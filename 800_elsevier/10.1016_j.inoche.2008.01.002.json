The dilacunary \u03b2-octamolybdate anion [Mo6O22]8- in 1 is derived from saturated \u03b2-octamolybdate through the removal of two MoO2 groups (). The molecule structure of compound 1 consists of copper-complex fragments-substituted dilacunary \u03b2-octamolybdate unit [{Cu(phen)}4Mo6O22], a [\u03b2-Mo8O26]4- cluster, two protoned water molecules and a K+ cation. Compound 1 is the first transition-metal-substituted derivative of [\u03b2-Mo8O26]4-. An ORTEP drawing of the asymmetry unit of 1 with the atom-labeling scheme is shown in  , which includes only seven molybdenum and two copper atoms. The well-known [\u03b2-Mo8O26]4- cluster consists of eight distorted corner- and/or edge-sharing MoO6 octahedra  with Mo-O distances in the range 1.690(3)-2.446(2)\u00c5 and bond angles in the range 69.30(8)-174.34(11)\u00b0. Each [\u03b2-Mo8O26]4- cluster forms covalent interactions with two [Cu(phen)] complexes through bridging terminal oxo-groups of \u03b2-octamolybdate. As shown in  , [{Cu(phen)}4Mo6O22] fragment is a 2D network, which is composed of dilacunary \u03b2-octamolybdate anion [Mo6O22]8- linked with four [Cu(phen)] complexes by sharing oxygen atoms. Molybdenum oxo-groups of [Mo6O22]8- anion possess two coordination modes, MoO5 square pyramidal geometry and MoO6 octahedron. The [Mo6O22]8- anion acts as a multidentate ligand linked with Cu ions. The lacunary sites of [Mo6O22]8- anion are occupied by four [Cu(phen)] complexes to form a Cu-complex fragments-substituted POMs. The Cu1 atom locates in the {CuO3N2} square pyramid corner-sharing with a MoO6 octahedron and a MoO5 square pyramid (Cu-O=1.970(2)\u00c5), bonds to two terminal oxo-groups of two MoO6 octahedra belonging to the [\u03b2-Mo8O26]4- cluster (Cu-O=2.394(3) \u00c5) and dilacunary \u03b2-octamolybdate anion [Mo6O22]8- (Cu-O=1.959(2) \u00c5), respectively, and contacts with two nitrogen donors of one phen ligand (Cu-N=1.995(3)-2.017(3)\u00c5). The Cu2 atom locates in the {CuO2N2} planar square corner-sharing with a MoO6 octahedron and a MoO5 square pyramid (Cu-O=1.929(2)\u00c5), bonds to a terminal O atom of the corner-shared MoO6 octahedron (Cu-O=1.944(3)\u00c5), and contacts with two nitrogen donors of one phen ligand (Cu-N=1.971(3)-1.975(3)\u00c5). Distance of Cu1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu2 is 4.095\u00c5. Cu1A and Cu2A are symmetrically equivalent copper atoms of Cu1 and Cu2, respectively. Their coordination environments are the same to those of Cu1 and Cu2, respectively. Therefore, the structure may also be described as four [Cu(phen)] complexes that take the place of two MoO2 groups located symmetrically in the [\u03b2-Mo8O26]4- shell to form the hybrid [{Cu(phen)}4Mo6O22] fragment. [{Cu(phen)}4Mo6O22] fragment and [\u03b2-Mo8O26]4- cluster are alternatively adjacent to each other and connected via terminal O atom of MoO6 octahedron to form a novel 1D linear chain ( ). The isolated K+ cations and protoned water molecules acting as charge-compensating cations, occupy inter-chain (SI.1). The bond valence sum calculations  for compound 1 indicate that all Mo atoms are in the +6 oxidation state with an average value of 5.939, all Cu atoms are in the +2 oxidation state with an average value of 1.686. Direct evidence for this is also provided by XPS measurements. As shown in the XPS spectra of 1(SI.2), two peaks at 232.4 and 235.8eV can be attributed to Mo6+ (3d5/2) and Mo6+ (3d3/2), respectively .

Molybdenum oxo-groups of [Mo6O22]8- anion possess two coordination modes, MoO5 square pyramidal geometry and MoO6 octahedron. The [Mo6O22]8- anion acts as a multidentate ligand linked with Cu ions. The lacunary sites of [Mo6O22]8- anion are occupied by four [Cu(phen)] complexes to form a Cu-complex fragments-substituted POMs. The Cu1 atom locates in the {CuO3N2} square pyramid corner-sharing with a MoO6 octahedron and a MoO5 square pyramid (Cu-O=1.970(2)\u00c5), bonds to two terminal oxo-groups of two MoO6 octahedra belonging to the [\u03b2-Mo8O26]4- cluster (Cu-O=2.394(3) \u00c5) and dilacunary \u03b2-octamolybdate anion [Mo6O22]8- (Cu-O=1.959(2) \u00c5), respectively, and contacts with two nitrogen donors of one phen ligand (Cu-N=1.995(3)-2.017(3)\u00c5).

When the compound was cooled from room temperature, the value of \u03c7 m T increased continuously to a maximum of 1.85emuKmol-1 at 9K, which indicates the existence of ferromagnetic interactions between the Cu2+ ions. Below 9K, the value of \u03c7 m T drops sharply to 1.07emuKmol-1 at 2K. Between 300K and 20K, the measured data are fitted using the Curie-Weiss equation, \u03c7 m = C/(T-\u03b8), where C =1.65emuKmol-1 and \u03b8 =2.12K. This fact further confirms the existence of weak ferromagnetic interactions. The room temperature \u03c7 m T value of 1.66emuKmol-1 is close to the spin-only value of 1.65emuKmol-1 expected for four independent Cu2+ ions (g =2.1) .
