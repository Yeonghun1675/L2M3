Up to now, most of the topology nets of MOFs which have been exhibited are only involved in three-, four-, or six-connected topologies owing to the limits of the usable coordination number of the metal centers , so further significant challenging work should be done in the topic of highly connected MOFs. The most effective route is rational employing of the ploynuclear metal clusters to replace general metal ions . As is well known, the current prominent Cu(I)-I clusters have been proved to be ideal building-blocks to assemble highly connected MOFs owing to their extensive connectivity and structural diversity . More importantly, they can propagate the structural diversity and physical properties to the MOFs constructed via suitable organic linking ligands. The structural diversity of [Cu<ce:inf loc=\"post\">m</ce:inf>I<ce:inf loc=\"post\">n</ce:inf>]<ce:sup loc=\"post\">m-n</ce:sup> clusters can be assigned to the linking versatility of the iodine anion, such as diverse cationic (m<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>&gt;<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>n), anionic (m<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>&lt;<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>n) and neutral (m<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>=<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>n) clusters .

For the cationic Cu(I)-I clusters, the investigation of the corresponding MOFs is still less developed owning to assembly difficulties [], so much more work for the cationic Cu(I)-I cluster-based MOFs should be done. Moreover, the organic bridging ligands as important build-blocks also play an important role in forming the resulting coordination framework . 5-[4-(imidazol-1-yl)phenyl]tetrazolate (HIPT) as an excellent build-block, which possesses both one imidazole group and one tetrazole group, has been previously employed in the construction of coordination polymer , all of which show that HIPT ligand as a good multidentate ligand possesses the excellent coordinated capacity.
