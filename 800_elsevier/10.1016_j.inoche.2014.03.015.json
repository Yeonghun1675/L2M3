When the single crystals of 1 were heated to 150\u00b0C in air for 20min, these crystals suddenly lose their crystallinity and the color changes from orange (1) to pink (1A). Then this non-crystalline solid was exposed to water vapor for 12h and the color of the solid 1A was returned to that of the original crystals 1', as shown in   and Fig. S5. For this, the solid-state UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra as shown in Fig. S6, clearly show that the bands observed in 1 and 1' correspond very well to the identical transitions causing the same color of products, and evidence that 1 and 1' have the same Co(II) environments. This spectral feature agrees with the typical d-d transitions of high spin Co(II) in distorted octahedral geometry with two broad bands at 471 and 1180nm, assigned to the \u03bd3: 4T1g \u2192 4T1g(P) and \u03bd1: 4T1g \u2192 4T2g, transitions, respectively . Whereas the amorphous form 1A shows different d-d transitions with three broad bands, \u03bd3: 4T1g \u2192 4T1g(P) which is splitted into two shoulders at around 484nm and 518nm (4Eg and 4A2g), \u03bd2: 4T1g \u2192 4A2g at 656nm and then \u03bd1: 4T1g \u2192 4T2g which is splitted into two shoulders at around 934nm and 1337nm (4B2g and 4Eg), giving the distinctive pink color and corresponding to the tetragonally distorted octahedral geometry . Furthermore, the IR spectra also confirm the structural transformation behavior in 1, as shown in Fig S7. In 1A, the broad and strong peaks of OH stretching around 3300cm-1 and HOH bending around 1500-1600cm-1 of coordinated water molecule disappear, resulting to the sharper IR spectrum with different splitting feature and a shift in some peak positions. In contrast, these features are removed in the IR spectrum of the rehydrated form 1', which are identical to that of the as-synthesized 1. The XRPD pattern of the as-synthesized product closely match the simulated one from the single-crystal data (Fig. S8). However, the XRPD pattern of dehydrated 1A shows peak disappearance, indicating that the dehydrated Co(4,4'-bipy)(pro)2 (1A) is in an amorphous phase (anal. calcd: C, 53.19; H, 5.02; N, 7.75%. Found: C, 52.26; H, 5.04; N, 7.61%) which is formed by the collapse of supramolecular structure of 1 accompanied with the destruction of hydrogen bonding networks when all water molecules are removed. Interestingly, this amorphous phase 1A can be restored to the original crystalline phase of 1' in which the color returns to that of the original color after being exposed in water vapor for 24h, as indicated by elemental analysis with the chemical composition of [Co(4,4'-bipy)(pro)2(H2O)] (1') (anal. calcd: C, 50.67; H, 5.32; N, 7.39%. Found: C, 50.34; H, 5.28; N, 7.42%) and the XRPD measurement results. The restored solid has the same XRPD pattern as the simulated one from the single-crystal X-ray diffraction data of 1.
