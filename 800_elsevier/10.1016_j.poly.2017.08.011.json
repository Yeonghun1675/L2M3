The \u03b5 values for complexes 1-8 are 0.0-0.008, which assumes ionic character and interactions along the inter-atomic interacting axes, as well as localization of the charge, excluding the values \u03b5 =0.016, 0.018 (Ag-O) in 1 and 0.108 (Zn-N) in 7. If we compare the latter quantities with the \u03b5 values of a delocalized CO double bond from the -COO- functional group in the organic ligand of 1 (\u03b5 =0.028), then we could conclude that in these M-L bonds in 1 and 7 there is charge de-localization, which could be associated with an intra-molecular CT effect within the AgO6 (1) and ZnCl3N (7) chromophores. However, \u03b5 =0.03-0.06 in 9, considering data on the Cu-O and Cu-N bonds (). The effect of delocalization is comparable to the electronic effects in delocalized CO groups in organic ligands, even obtaining a two times greater effect. The latter result can be addressed to the electronic configuration of the Cu2+ ions (d9) and the typically observed Jahn-Teller effect removing of the degeneracy of the energies of the orbitals from the d-electronic shell. The delocalization of the charges is presented in , showing in 6 an almost localized (spherical) distribution of the Laplacian_rho(r), in contrast to 1 and 9 where the delocalization of the experimental electron charge density is explicitly highlighted. Reliable quantitative characteristics of this effect can be obtained studying the energetics of the M-L bond as mentioned above. There has been evidence from many molecules that the relationship between the interaction energy and rho(r) at the bcp is approximated linearly . In this context, our efforts are indirectly addressed to the important correlative characteristics of an M-L bond associated with the energy of interactions. We use in our analysis the known expressions for G(r) and V(r) densities at the bcps (). The approximations Eqs. (19) and (20) (s.i.) hold well for covalent systems and/or those exhibiting positive Laplacian_rho(r)>0 values at the bcps . Despite this, our data ( and  ) reveal a clear tendency that the Vcp values for C-N and S-O multiple bonds are characterized with the lowest values, compared with single S-O, C-O and M-L bonds. In this context, the M-L interactions in 1-8 can be addressed to the formation of predominantly \u2018single' bonds in terms bond multiplicity or delocalization of charge along the bond axis, thus excluding multiple bonding. Complex 9 shows Vcp =-335.82 and -313.08kJ mol-1 Bohr-3, which assumes multiple character of the Cu-O bonds. The application of the bond valence model as a theoretical concept applied to experimental crystallographic data in predicting the oxidation state of the Cu atoms in 9 fails to reproduce excellent correlations, by contrast to other complexes of ions with the d1\u00b0Configuration. The data in  show lower discrepancy coefficients for hypothetical valences of +1 and +3, by contrast the real valence +2 is marked as a less probable one. This discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental oxidation states can be explained by the open shell character of the system (9), which has already been highlighted as a limit of the BV model . In contrast, the employment of theoretical AIM and ESP analyses distinguishes between the different oxidation states (, models A-C,   , ), which correlate well to the experimental Laplacian_rho(r) of the total static ED.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 16, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<ce:para id=\"p0050\" view=\"all\">Nevertheless, the BV methodology provides excellent data about the oxidation state of the central metal ions Ag<ce:sup loc=\"post\">+</ce:sup> and Zn<ce:sup loc=\"post\">2+</ce:sup> in <ce:bold>1</ce:bold>, <ce:bold>2</ce:bold> and <ce:bold>4</ce:bold> (the discrepancy parameter varies in the range 0.636\u20130.016).

The correlative analysis performed between the geometry bond lengths, FBOs and LBOs shows a linear relationship with confidence levels of 99.96\u201396.98%. The correspondence of the chemometric data between the FBO and LBO values indicates unexpectedly high confidence levels (98.67\u201389.14%).

Preliminary, it is important to point out that, as it was shown above, the BO values according the AIM computations lack rigorous application and thus they cannot be direct correlated as quantities with the NBO bond orders. However, the BO values shown in  assume a lack of bonding interactions according to the description already written in the theory and computations section, which qualitatively correlates with the conclusions about the BO values from NBO analysis, with values obtained in the ranges 0.3114-0.3245 and 0.2882-0.3025 (NLMO), indicating the lack of complete single bond formation. The latter data seek to provide additional evidence to support the statements above by analysing the natural ionicity parameters.

These good-to-excellent linear extrapolation data are mainly found correlating BOs and bond lengths of the metal chromophore in Zn2+ complexes with the strong electronegative Cl- ligand or for cases when strong electron localization occurs. On the contrary, complexes of Ag+ and Cu2+ ions, due to 2D delocalization, exhibit a decreasing reliability of the linear extrapolation. Confidence levels of 82 (8) and 61% (9) are obtained. However, the results concerning the latter cases of strongly delocalized systems do not clearly indicate a non-linear correlation. On this basis, it might be concluded that further systematic correlative analyses are needed between theoretical and experimental EDs of AgI and CuII complexes to determine any quantitative correlations, including distinguishing between the coordination behaviour between both ions, as there is no obvious explanation, even interpreting the results on the basis of the concept of the d9d' configuration of the AgI ions presented above, for the similar behaviour of AgI and CuII ions. In the latter case, there is the well known strong Jahn-Teller effect. The data of the statistical analyses on the nature of the Zn-Cl bond in T d  ZnClxNy chromophores as a function of the content of N centres in the inner coordination sphere, showing a linear correlation, allow the conclusion that even purely ionic interactions between the charged species, like Zn2+ and Cl- ions, could be affected by other non-covalent interactions within the framework of the inner coordination sphere. If we use the above discussed concept about the LBO, where negative values are associated with the covalence of the corresponding bond, then with increasing N centres (x =0-2) there is an increase in the LBOs, which indicates a further increase in the ionic character of the Zn-Cl bonds.

(a) An explicit statistical quantitative correlation between the experimental crystallographic potential energies at the M-L bond critical points and quantum chemically predicted bond dissociation energies show that with an increase in the number of N centres in the inner coordination sphere of the {[ZnClxNy]z} chromophore there is an increase in the Zn-Cl bond strengths.

Natural ionicity values are up to iAB =-0.00494. (c) An excellent agreement between the experimental and theoretical topological potential energies at the bcps is found. The lowest value of Vc is ~-0.1a.u. Bohr-3. The chemometrics yield confidence levels in the range 91.11-98.89%. As can be deduced, the lack of a strong contribution of electrostatic forces in the Ag-N interactions yields decreased bond strengths. In this context we would like to say that classical concepts about M-L bonding in these metal ions has been found to be valid only in cases of high symmetry inorganic chromophores, for instance, {[ZnCl4]2-} and {[Zn(H2O)6]2+}, with strong electronegative dentate centres. With a decrease in symmetry of the metal chromophore and an increase in the number of N-dentate centres in the inner coordination sphere a deviation from the above-mentioned concept is established.

The dissociation energy in this context can be obtained by computing the co-valence curve.

The values are shown in . In terms of the ESPs, the common electron poor space, known as the \u2018\u03c3-hole\u2019 and is characterized with positive values of the ESPs, has been associated with an electron deficient anti-bonding orbital assigned to covalent bonding.

Computations of the electrostatic potentials using the atomic charges (), accounting for the overlapping effect of the spherical electron charge clouds, has been regarded as the simplest model of covalent bonding . The dissociation energy in this context can be obtained by computing the co-valence curve. However correlative analyses with spectroscopic, crystallographic and thermo-chemical data have shown that theoretical bond dissociation energies (BDE) corresponded well with experiment when they are computed using models accounting for a deviation of the spherical valance electron radii of the atoms in the molecules .  depicts the 2D and 3D theoretical ESPs and the corresponding ones derived from the experimental crystallographic data. The values are shown in . In terms of the ESPs, the common electron poor space, known as the \u2018\u03c3-hole' and is characterized with positive values of the ESPs, has been associated with an electron deficient anti-bonding orbital assigned to covalent bonding. The theoretical quantum chemical and experimental crystallographic electrostatic potentials are correlated using Poisson's law  (Eq. (21) in the s.i.). Rho(r) represents the ED, while \u03b5 0 is the dielectric constant. It can be simplified . The employment of DFT values for atomic ESPs () yielded the Laplacian_V(r) values. The latter calculations were carried out within the so-called transferable local distribution, where the description of the molecular ESP surface is according this approximation . In addition, a correlative analysis was carried out between the kinetic energy of the bond (EKIN) obtained by the AIM approach () and the Vcp value from critical point analysis of the experimental EDs (compare data in ). Treatment of the experimental topological energetics of the M-L bonds also includes an estimation of the relationships between Vcr (topological data) with the theoretical quantum chemical dissociation energies (D0). Foremost, among the concepts of the dissociation energetics, the relationship between D0 and the electrostatic potentials is examined and given by Eq. (22) . The common concept in this case is that the ESP at the axial minimum (V(rp)) of the theoretical ED yields D0 within the framework of the shown parameterization (V(r) and D0 are in units [kcal mol-1]). Additional correlative analysis is carried out using the concept of the dissociation energy (D0) of the M-L bond in 1-9 according to equation (23) . Our computations at T=0\u00b0C yield the valid Eq. (24), where E0 is the ground state energy of species according to the dissociation  (s.i.). All the M-L bonds of the coordination polyhedron are treated as undergoing homolytic dissociation (), because the correlation with the experimental topological energies reflects the different geometry parameters and electron densities at the bcps of the M-L bonds in the metal chromophores. The correlative analysis between Vcr and D0 is shown in . The statistical tendencies seen () in Figs.  and  are discussed next. Contrary to organic compounds, where the nature of the chemical bonds is relatively well understood in thermodynamic terms, there is scarce corroborative research about the bonding type in metal-organics and inorganics on the basis of the energetics of the M-L coordination interaction . In general, obtaining high values of D0 in complex species is attributed to high bond strengths, which might be associated to a significant contribution of the purely electrostatic interactions, see for example . The BDE group tendencies of differently substituted {[ZnClxYz]y} chromophores seen in  provided by ab initio and DFT thermos-chemistry evidence low D0 values in the {[ZnCl4]2-} dianion. These results agree well with those predicted by AIM analysis, 75-61% ionic character of the Zn-Cl bonds and a metal to ligand CT effect of about E(2) ~2kcalmol-1 (). Apparently, the electrostatic interactions in this case are described as the main contributors to the formation of the {[ZnCl4]2-} complex anion. In the chromophore {ZnCl2N2} in 8 there is an increase in the D0 values at about ~0.2a.u., which indicates an increase in the bond strengths. The latter phenomenon could be associated with a ligand to metal CT effect at about E(2) ~34kcalmol-1 () with participation of coordinated N-centres to the inner coordination sphere, which affects the Zn-Cl bonding strength. A direct confirmation follows from the obtained D0 values of the Zn-N bond in the same chromophores compared with the corresponding values of {ZnCl3N} in 7. In the latter case D0 is about |0.03| a.u. higher than this one for the Z-N bond in 8. It is especially evident from the relationship between the D0 values of Zn-Cl as a function of N-content in the inner coordination sphere of {[ZnClxYz]y} chromophores. A confidence level of 93% was obtained, approximating the latter relationship to a linear function. Clearly, there is a deviation from the 100% confidence level, which is explained by the chance of the electronic configuration of the ZnII ion depending on the content of the N centres in the inner coordination sphere. On studying the iAB values for the ZnCl3N chomophore in 7, a decrease of about 6.5% in the ionic character compared to the ZnCl4 chromophore is obtained (iAB~-0.71 in 7, ).\n\nComputations of the natural ionicity i AB of the {[ZnCl4]2-} chromophore in 4 shows an iab value of about -0.76 for all Zn-Cl bonds (), indicating an almost purely ionic hybrid at the Cl centers. The data correlates well to computations for the AIM Laplacian of the total ED (). There is also an excellent agreement with the data for the hybrid directionality (), showing a small deviation from the direct line of the nuclear interaction with an s-type character of the hybrids (the large deviation \u2018Dev\" in  reflects a \u03c0-nature for the interaction). With E(2) values of ~2.5kcalmol-1, there is little argument about a significant CT effect (). The results, therefore, correlate well with the ESP ones, showing the following electrostatic properties: Zn (-29.32a.u.) and Cl (-64.76, -64.76, -64.76 and -64.76 a.u.). These conclusions are confirmed further by computation of the experimental static ED, as presented (). The data obtained on the basis of the Couloson orthogonality theorem for \u03c9ij (s.i.) of metal hybrids sdm, yields an \u03c9ij angle for Cl2-Zn1-Cl3 of 101.48\u00b0, which correlates excellently to the experimental crystallographic data, which shows an angle of 104.4(2)\u00b0 . We should stress here that the generally detected {[ZnCl4]2-} anion in tetrachlorozincate(II) containing crystals  could be assigned only to the major contribution of mainly electrostatic interactions with only intra-ionic factors governing its thermodynamic stability (). Nevertheless, this structural discrete unit is generally broadly distributed in metal-organics with ZnII containing ions . Moreover, as broadly discussed in the literature, the valuable properties of the {[ZnCl4]2-} containing anion in metal-organic multi-functional materials could be assigned to contributions due to the charged interacting character of the ions in the {[ZnCl4]2-} unit, excluding additional n-s interactions, as further AIM analysis of multi-pole moments reveal small total values of -0.067125 (XX), -0.029897 (YY), 0.097023 (ZZ), 0.001539 (XY), 0.002867 (XZ) and 0.006198 (YZ). The AIM analysis about the localized orbital energies and BOs indicate a possible ionic character of the interaction, of 69.2-75.6%, which correlates well to the NBO data stated above (). On the contrary for ZnII complexes, the iAB values of 1 and 2 are -0.288 and -0.0049. The latter results assume that the AgI ions tend to form covalent coordination bonds with N centers in the inner coordination sphere. This result agrees well with the topological potential energy of the Ag-N bonds in 2, showing the lowest Vcr ~0.1 a.u.

The latter data seek to provide additional evidence to support the statements above by analysing the natural ionicity parameters.

The same conclusions are obtained employing fuzzy and Laplacian bond orders (Figs.\u00a0\n<ce:float-anchor refid=\"f0025\"></ce:float-anchor> and ). In all cases positive LBOs are found, which assumes a lack of covalent bonding. The correlative analysis performed between the geometry bond lengths, FBOs and LBOs shows a linear relationship with confidence levels of 99.96\u201396.98%. The correspondence of the chemometric data between the FBO and LBO values indicates unexpectedly high confidence levels (98.67\u201389.14%).

The correlative analysis performed between the geometry bond lengths, FBOs and LBOs shows a linear relationship with confidence levels of 99.96-96.98%. The correspondence of the chemometric data between the FBO and LBO values indicates unexpectedly high confidence levels (98.67-89.14%). These good-to-excellent linear extrapolation data are mainly found correlating BOs and bond lengths of the metal chromophore in Zn2+ complexes with the strong electronegative Cl- ligand or for cases when strong electron localization occurs. On the contrary, complexes of Ag+ and Cu2+ ions, due to 2D delocalization, exhibit a decreasing reliability of the linear extrapolation. Confidence levels of 82 (8) and 61% (9) are obtained. However, the results concerning the latter cases of strongly delocalized systems do not clearly indicate a non-linear correlation. On this basis, it might be concluded that further systematic correlative analyses are needed between theoretical and experimental EDs of AgI and CuII complexes to determine any quantitative correlations, including distinguishing between the coordination behaviour between both ions, as there is no obvious explanation, even interpreting the results on the basis of the concept of the d9d' configuration of the AgI ions presented above, for the similar behaviour of AgI and CuII ions. In the latter case, there is the well known strong Jahn-Teller effect. The data of the statistical analyses on the nature of the Zn-Cl bond in T d  ZnClxNy chromophores as a function of the content of N centres in the inner coordination sphere, showing a linear correlation, allow the conclusion that even purely ionic interactions between the charged species, like Zn2+ and Cl- ions, could be affected by other non-covalent interactions within the framework of the inner coordination sphere. If we use the above discussed concept about the LBO, where negative values are associated with the covalence of the corresponding bond, then with increasing N centres (x =0-2) there is an increase in the LBOs, which indicates a further increase in the ionic character of the Zn-Cl bonds.

Additional confirmation can be obtained by examining the NBO E(2) values for complex 1, where by contrast to the ZnII complex discussed above (E(2) ~2.5kcalmol-1), the E(2) values of the Ag1O6 unit (complexes) are in the range 1.77-11.35kcalmol-1. The values provide significant evidence about the CT effects. By contrast, the E(2) values for the complex unit (Ag19-Ag24)O2 are in the range 0.04-0.13kcalmol-1. An exception is seen for the E(2) D\u2192A value of 3.69kcalmol-1, corresponding to the M\u2192L CT effect between the Ag19-O22(SO2) fragment.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "Zinc", "symbol": "Zn", "chemical formula": "Zn2+"}, "valence": "2", "oxidation state": "2+", "bond lengths": ["2.282", "2.262", "2.274", "2.238"], "unit": "\u00c5", "symmetry": "Td", "natural electronic configuration": "s0.583d9.994p0.725p0.02"}, {"meta": {"name": "Silver", "symbol": "Ag", "chemical formula": "Ag+"}, "natural electronic configuration": ["Ag1 s0.204d5.005p0.116d0.017p0.01", "Ag19 s0.994d5.005p2.806s0.015d0.306p0.187s0.176d0.02", "Ag24 s1.004d5.005p2.896s0.335d0.826p0.276d0.02"]}, {"meta": {"name": "Copper", "symbol": "Cu", "chemical formula": "Cu2+"}}, {"meta": {"name": "Zinc", "symbol": "Zn", "chemical formula": "Zn2+"}, "natural electronic configuration": "s0.443d9.984p0.594d0.015p0.01"}]], "include_properties": []}, {"idx": 1, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<ce:figure id=\"f0005\">\n<ce:label>Fig. 1</ce:label>\n<ce:caption id=\"cn0010\">\n<ce:simple-para id=\"sp0025\" view=\"all\">Chemical diagram of the non-equivalent binuclear metal ion containing chromophores (Ag1)<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>O<ce:inf loc=\"post\">12</ce:inf> and (Ag2)<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>O<ce:inf loc=\"post\">10</ce:inf>; Atom labelling scheme; Crystal structure of <ce:bold>1</ce:bold>, underlining the Ag\u2013O bonding within the framework of the non-equivalent binuclear metal ion containing chromophores.</ce:simple-para>\n</ce:caption>\n<ce:link id=\"lk00005\" locator=\"gr1\" xlink:href=\"pii:S0277538717305326/gr1\" xlink:role=\"http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4\" xlink:type=\"simple\"></ce:link>\n</ce:figure>", "clean_text": " Fig. 1  Chemical diagram of the non-equivalent binuclear metal ion containing chromophores (Ag1)2O12 and (Ag2)2O10; Atom labelling scheme; Crystal structure of 1, underlining the Ag-O bonding within the framework of the non-equivalent binuclear metal ion containing chromophores.
