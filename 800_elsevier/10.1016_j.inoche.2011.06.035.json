It is worth emphasizing that the fourth reduced species shows the best electrocatalytic activity, suggesting that the increase of reduction extent of the Keggin anion species may enhance their catalytic activities. It's also noteworthy that no obvious response was observed in the range +800 to -150mV on a bare CPE and the reduction of nitrite at a bare electrode generally requires a large overpotential (b). Moreover, the peak currents of 1-CPE keep almost unchanged over 100 cycles at a scan rate of 100mV/s when the potential range is maintained between +800 and -150mV, indicating that 1-CPE possesses a relatively high stability .\n\nCrystal data for 1: [Dy(HL)(L)1.5(H2O)3][PMo11VO40]\u22c58H2O, Mr=3009.80, triclinic, space group P-1, a=16.169(3) \u00c5, b=16.406(3) \u00c5, c=19.632(4) \u00c5, \u03b1=70.06(3)\u00b0 \u03b2=77.98(3)\u00b0 \u03b3=87.13(3)\u00b0 V=4786.8(17) \u00c53, Z=2, Dc=2.088Mg\u22c5m-3, \u03bc=2.369mm-1, 3.02<\u03b8<25.00\u00b0, F(000)=2904, T=150(2) K. 36427 reflection collected, 16405 unique. The final R1 and wR2 were 0.0866 and 0.2420, respectively [I>2\u03c3(I)]. The crystallographic data were collected at 150K on the Rigaku R-axis Rapid IP diffractometer using graphite monochromatic Mo K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb=0.71073\u00c5) and IP techniques. A multi-scan absorption correction was applied. The crystal data was solved by the direct method and refined by a full-matrix least-squares method on F2 using the SHELXTL-97 crystallographic software package . All non-H atoms were refined anisotropically except the disordered solvent water molecules. H atoms on the C atoms were fixed in calculated positions. The H atoms on the lattice water molecules cannot be found from the weak residual peaks but were directly included in the final molecular formula. In the final refinement, there are still some weak residual peaks but cannot be clearly determined as solvent water molecules, thus, the SQUEEZE program  was used to estimate the left crystalline water molecules in the structure. Furthermore, on the basis of the elemental analysis, TG and the SQUEEZE calculations, another one water molecule was directly included in the final molecular formula.
