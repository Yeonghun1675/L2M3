The Cd1 and Cd2 atoms are both seven-coordinated with a distorted pentagonal-bipyramidal geometry made up of one nitrogen atom and six oxygen atoms (N1, O1, O4, O15, O1D, O3W and O4W for Cd1 coordinated by three different chelidamic acid ligands, and N2, O11A, O14A, O11, O5W, O6W and O7W for Cd2 coordinated by two different chelidamic acid ligands), while Cd3 is six-coordinated with a distorted octahedral geometry made up of six oxygen atoms (O3, O13, O2C, O12B, O1W and O2W) from four different chelidamic acid ligands and two coordinated water molecules. The CdO bond distances range from 2.2477(18) to 2.5203(19)\u00c5 with the average distance of 2.362(2)\u00c5. And the Cd1N1 and Cd2N2B bond distances are 2.280(2) and 2.284(2)\u00c5 (Table S1), respectively. The CdO and CdN bond distances all lie in the normal range of those reported Cd complexes with chelidamic acid in the literature . Notably, there exists two different chelidamic acid ligands in 1, one of which exhibits the mode of \u03bc 4-\u03baO1,N1,O4:\u03baO1:\u03baO2:\u03baO3 and the other adopts the mode of \u03bc 5-\u03baO11,N2,O14:\u03baO11:\u03baO12:\u03baO13:\u03baO15. Obviously, the difference between them lies in hydroxyl group from the chelidamic acid for the latter involved in bridging Cd(II) centers. Accordingly, they are abbreviated to HCAM2- and CAM3-, respectively, in writing molecular formula of 1. Therefore, as shown in , Cd1 is coordinated by two HCAM2- and one CAM3- ligands, Cd2 is coordinated by two CAM3- ligands, while Cd3 is coordinated by two HCAM2- and two CAM3- ligands. Interestingly, two Cd1 centers are double bridged by two O atoms (O1 and O1D) from two HCAM2- ligands to form a centrosymmetric binuclear unit A of [Cd2(HCAM2-)2]. Similarly, two Cd2 centers are double bridged by O11 and O11A atoms from two CAM3- ligands to form another centrosymmetric binuclear unit B of [Cd2(CAM3-)2]. Each binuclear unit A or B is linked by four Cd3 centers via the carboxylate O from the chelidamic acid. And each Cd3 center is connected by two binuclear units A and two binuclear units B. Therefore, binuclear units (A or B) and Cd3 center can be considered as a four-connected node, which forms an undulating (4,4)-connected topology ( ).
