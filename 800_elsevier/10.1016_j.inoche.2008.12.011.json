The emission peak 5D0 \u2192 7F1 is a magnetic dipole transition, and its intensity should vary with the crystal field strength acting on the Eu(III) ions. The strongest emission peak 5D0 \u2192 7F2 transition is an electric dipole transition and is extremely sensitive to chemical bonds in the vicinity of Eu(III) ion. In the spectrum, the strongest emission peak in the 5D0 \u2192 7F2 transition region was split into four levels at 612, 616, 619 and 620nm, which can be ascribed to the splitting of energy levels. Because the presence of Eu(III) ion site with low symmetry the emission peak in the 5D0  \u2192  7F2 transition can be split. The intensity ratio I(5D0 \u2192 7F2)/I(5D0 \u2192 7F1) is equal to ca. 7.48, which also suggests that the Eu(III) ions in 1 have a non-centrosymmetric coordination environment. This is also consistent with the result of the single crystal X-ray analysis .\n\nCrystallographic data for complex 1: monoclinic P21/c, with a =9.7109(2), b =22.3358(5), c =9.1581(2)\u00c5, \u03b2 =117.485(1)\u00b0, V =1762.20(7)\u00c53, Z =4, D C =2.367, F(000)=1200, GOF=1.021, R 1 (I >2\u03c3(I))=0.0241 and wR 2 (all data)=0.0573. 2: monoclinic P21/c, with a =9.67980(10), b =22.2733(3), c =9.1262(1)\u00c5, \u03b2 =117.872(1)\u00b0, V =1739.36(4)\u00c53, Z =4, D C =2.439, F(000)=1212, GOF=1.115, R 1 (I >2\u03c3(I))=0.0259 and wR 2 (all data)=0.0590. 3: monoclinic P21/c, with a =9.6639(1), b =22.2590(3), c =9.1137(1)\u00c5, \u03b2=117.960(1)\u00b0, V =1731.60(4)\u00c53, Z =4, D C =2.459, F(000)=1216, GOF=1.041, R 1 (I >2\u03c3(I))=0.0209 and wR 2 (all data)=0.0460.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "peak spectrum": [{"value": "395", "unit": "nm", "condition": ""}], "crystal system": [{"value": "monoclinic", "condition": ""}], "space group": [{"value": "P2/c", "condition": ""}], "lattice parameters": [{"value": {"a": "9.7109", "b": "22.3358", "c": "9.1581", "alpha": "", "beta": "117.485", "gamma": "", "condition": ""}}]}, {"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "2", "chemical formula": ""}, "lattice parameters": [{"value": {"a": "9.67980", "b": "22.2733", "c": "9.1262", "alpha": "", "beta": "117.872", "gamma": "", "condition": ""}}]}, {"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "3", "chemical formula": ""}, "lattice parameters": [{"value": {"a": "9.6639", "b": "22.2590", "c": "9.1137", "alpha": "", "beta": "117.960", "gamma": "", "condition": ""}}]}]], "include_properties": ["peak_spectrum", "crystal_system", "space_group", "lattice_parameters"]}, {"idx": 1, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<ce:figure id=\"fig1\">\n<ce:label>Fig. 1</ce:label>\n<ce:caption>\n<ce:simple-para id=\"simple-para0005\" view=\"all\">Perspective view of the asymmetric unit of <ce:bold>1</ce:bold> (The free water molecules and H atoms were omitted for clarity).
