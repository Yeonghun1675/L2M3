The major significance of these complexes is that they can serve as precursors for mixed valence complexes. The binding mode [M<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>(\u03bc-tppz)] is observed for the dinuclear Cd(II) complex [{CdCl<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>}<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>(\u03bc-tppz)] (\n<ce:float-anchor refid=\"fig2\"></ce:float-anchor>). The Cd(II) compound is a neutral and centrosymmetric dinuclear complex in which the tppz ligand functions in a bis-tridentate bridging manner to link two Cd(II) ions that are separated by 7.286<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>\u00c5. Each Cd(II) center is five-coordinated by three N donor atoms of tppz in one plane and two Cl<ce:sup loc=\"post\">\u2212</ce:sup> ions normal to this plane; the Cl\u2013Cd(II)\u2013Cl angle is 101.72(3)\u00b0. The molecular structures of five-coordinate transition metal complexes show an extensive range from regular trigonal bipyramidal (RTBP) to regular square-based pyramidal (RSBP). The structure index parameter, <ce:italic>\u03c4</ce:italic>\n<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>=<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>(<ce:italic>\u03b2</ce:italic>\u2212<ce:italic>\u03b1</ce:italic>/60), was evaluated by the two large angles (<ce:italic>\u03b1</ce:italic>\n<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>&lt;<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>\n<ce:italic>\u03b2</ce:italic>) in the five-coordinated geometry, where <ce:italic>\u03c4</ce:italic>\n<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>=<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>1.0 for a RTBP geometry and <ce:italic>\u03c4</ce:italic>\n<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>=<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>0.0 for a RSBP . The coordination geometry around Cd(II) is slightly distorted from regular square-based pyramidal, as ascertained by the observed <ce:italic>\u03c4</ce:italic> value of 0.20. One Cl<ce:sup loc=\"post\">\u2212</ce:sup> and three nitrogen atoms of the tppz ligand constitute the basal plane of the square pyramid, and the remaining Cl<ce:sup loc=\"post\">\u2212</ce:sup> occupies the apical position (). The Cd<ce:sup loc=\"post\">II</ce:sup>\u2013N(pyrazine) distance is very slightly longer than the Cd<ce:sup loc=\"post\">II</ce:sup>\u2013N(pyridyl) distances. The \u03c0-accepting property of tppz is saturated by two Cd(II) metal centers, leading to the longer distance. The Cd<ce:sup loc=\"post\">II</ce:sup>\u2013Cl distances of 2.4492(8) and 2.5161(7)<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>\u00c5 compare well with the reported Cd<ce:sup loc=\"post\">II</ce:sup>\u2013Cl distances . However, if one accepts weak intermolecular Cd\u22efCl (1\u2212<ce:italic>x</ce:italic>, <ce:italic>y</ce:italic>, 1/2\u2212<ce:italic>z</ce:italic>) interactions of 3.0431(8)<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>\u00c5, the coordination geometry can be described as being based on an octahedron (\n<ce:float-anchor refid=\"fig3\"></ce:float-anchor>). The Cd\u22efCl weak coordination leads to the formation of a 1D chain in the solid state (). The Cd(1)\u22efCd(1B) distance through the two bridging chloride ligands is 4.211<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>\u00c5. The two Cd(II) ions are, respectively, below and above the plane of the pyrazine moiety of the bridging tppz ligand. This conformation probably minimizes steric strain while at the same time maximizes the bonding interaction of the tppz ligand with the Cd(II) ions. The dihedral angle between the mean planes of the two coordinated pyridyl rings is 44.83\u00b0.

All hydrogen atom positions were refined in an isotropic approximation in the riding model with the U iso(H) parameters equal to 1.5 U eq(Ci) for methyl groups and 1.2 U eq(Ci) for other carbon atoms, where U(Ci) are the equivalent thermal parameters of the atoms to which corresponding H atoms are bonded.

Further details of the structural analyses are given in  .\n\nThe RhIII-Cl bond length of 2.3258(10)\u00c5 is larger than the Rh-N distances. The RhIII-Cl distance compares well with the reported RhIII-Cl distances . The RhIII-Cl bond length is shorter than the average RuII-Cl bond length that was derived from the cis,cis-[{Ru(DMSO)Cl2}2(\u03bc-tppz)]\u22c52Me2CO\u22c52H2O structure . The shorter RhIII-Cl distance indicates significant \u03c3 bonding in this bond. A \u03c0 donation from the Cl- ligand to Rh(III) is not possible because of its d6 (t 2g 6) electron configuration.  also shows two PF6 - counter ions. The P-F bond lengths range from 1.578 (4) to 1.604(3)\u00c5, with an average of 1.596(8)\u00c5. The lattice structure is further stabilized by a network of weak hydrogen bonds between the H atoms of the acetylacetone or pyridyl rings of the tppz ligand and the F atoms of the PF6 - anions, with C-H\u22efF distances of 2.409-3.950\u00c5.\n\nThe literature reveals many crystal structures of the [M2(\u03bc-tppz)] binding mode . The major significance of these complexes is that they can serve as precursors for mixed valence complexes. The binding mode [M2(\u03bc-tppz)] is observed for the dinuclear Cd(II) complex [{CdCl2}2(\u03bc-tppz)] ( ). The Cd(II) compound is a neutral and centrosymmetric dinuclear complex in which the tppz ligand functions in a bis-tridentate bridging manner to link two Cd(II) ions that are separated by 7.286\u00c5. Each Cd(II) center is five-coordinated by three N donor atoms of tppz in one plane and two Cl- ions normal to this plane; the Cl-Cd(II)-Cl angle is 101.72(3)\u00b0. The molecular structures of five-coordinate transition metal complexes show an extensive range from regular trigonal bipyramidal (RTBP) to regular square-based pyramidal (RSBP). The structure index parameter, \u03c4 =(\u03b2-\u03b1/60), was evaluated by the two large angles (\u03b1 < \u03b2) in the five-coordinated geometry, where \u03c4 =1.0 for a RTBP geometry and \u03c4 =0.0 for a RSBP . The coordination geometry around Cd(II) is slightly distorted from regular square-based pyramidal, as ascertained by the observed \u03c4 value of 0.20. One Cl- and three nitrogen atoms of the tppz ligand constitute the basal plane of the square pyramid, and the remaining Cl- occupies the apical position (). The CdII-N(pyrazine) distance is very slightly longer than the CdII-N(pyridyl) distances. The \u03c0-accepting property of tppz is saturated by two Cd(II) metal centers, leading to the longer distance. The CdII-Cl distances of 2.4492(8) and 2.5161(7)\u00c5 compare well with the reported CdII-Cl distances . However, if one accepts weak intermolecular Cd\u22efCl (1-x, y, 1/2-z) interactions of 3.0431(8)\u00c5, the coordination geometry can be described as being based on an octahedron ( ). The Cd\u22efCl weak coordination leads to the formation of a 1D chain in the solid state (). The Cd(1)\u22efCd(1B) distance through the two bridging chloride ligands is 4.211\u00c5. The two Cd(II) ions are, respectively, below and above the plane of the pyrazine moiety of the bridging tppz ligand. This conformation probably minimizes steric strain while at the same time maximizes the bonding interaction of the tppz ligand with the Cd(II) ions. The dihedral angle between the mean planes of the two coordinated pyridyl rings is 44.83\u00b0. The dihedral angles between the pyrazine ring and each of the pyridyl rings are 36.19\u00b0 (C(2)-C(6)/N(1)) and 34.42\u00b0 (C(10)-C(14)/N(15)). Unlike the bidentate complexes of tppz, the two pyridine rings of most tridentate tppz complexes do not bow out of the pyrazine ring plane.

It is possible to have tppz \u03c0\u2192\u03c0\u2217 and n \u2192\u03c0\u2217 transitions as well as ligand field (LF) (t 2g 6 \u2192 e g), MLCT (Rh\u2192tppz and/or Rh\u2192bpy) and LMCT (Cl\u2192Rh) transitions. The electronic absorption spectroscopy of 4d6 and 5d6 complexes with polypyridyl ligands is characterized by intense ligand \u03c0\u2192\u03c0\u2217 and n \u2192\u03c0\u2217 transitions in the ultraviolet region and metal (d\u03c0)\u2192ligand (\u03c0\u2217) charge transfer (MLCT) transitions in the visible region .

Tppz has a substantially lower energy \u03c0<ce:sup loc=\"post\">\u2217</ce:sup> orbital than bpy. The two-electron reduction of Rh(III) therefore results in accumulation of an electron on the metal center and destabilizes the complex.

Metal ions can enhance or quench the fluorescence emission of polypyridyl ligands. Quenching of fluorescence of a ligand by transition metal ions during complexation is a rather common phenomenon which is explained by processes such as magnetic perturbation, redox activity and electronic energy transfer. Enhancement of fluorescence through complexation is, however, of much interest as it opens up the opportunity for photochemical applications of these complexes . The fluorescent intensity of the dinuclear Cd(II) complex is significantly stronger than that of free tppz, probably due to the conformational rigidity enhancement of the coordinated tppz, thereby reducing the non-radiative decay of the intraligand <ce:sup loc=\"post\">1</ce:sup>(\u03c0\u2013\u03c0<ce:sup loc=\"post\">\u2217</ce:sup>) excited state.

The first irreversible two-electron reduction (-0.71V) is assigned as Rh(III/I), the second and third reductions (-1.11 and -1.67V) are assigned as tppz0/- and tppz-/2-, and the fourth reduction (-1.96V) is assigned as bpy0/-. The tppz0/- and tppz-/2- couples occur prior to the bpy0/- reduction due to the larger \u03c0 system of tppz ligand as a result of the two extra pyridyl rings on tppz as well as the extra electron accepting character of the pyrazine ring. Tppz has a substantially lower energy \u03c0\u2217 orbital than bpy. The two-electron reduction of Rh(III) therefore results in accumulation of an electron on the metal center and destabilizes the complex. This can rationalize the \"electron-transfer chemical-reaction (EC)\" process, in which the chemical reaction involves loss of a chloride ion, which proceeds and leads to the irreversible process at the first reduction wave. In cis-[Rh(bpy)2X2]+ (X=Cl-, Br-, and I-), the irreversible Rh(III/I) couple was observed at a negative potential . The electrochemistry reported for the [RhIII(SacSac)3] (SacSac=dithioacetylacetone) complex indicates a structural instability associated with reduction of this species, consistent with the expectation for addition of the electron into a d \u03c3 -type (d\u2217) orbital .\n\nThe photoluminescence properties of both complexes were studied at room temperature in DMSO solution. Because of the low solubility of the complexes, we have been forced to study the spectral and emission measurements in DMSO solution. Since tppz itself hardly fluoresces, the fluorescence of the tppz complexes may result from the change in the lowest excited state from the n,\u03c0\u2217 triplet to the \u03c0,\u03c0\u2217 singlet, which becomes lower in energy than the n,\u03c0\u2217 triplet due to the complexation with the metal ion as a strong Lewis acid . In the absence of metal ions, the fluorescence of the ligand is probably quenched by the occurrence of a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process due to the presence of lone pairs of electrons of the donor atoms in the ligand. PET is an electron transfer which occurs when certain photoactive materials interact with light. The fluorescent emission of [{CdCl2}2(\u03bc-tppz)] at the excitation wavelength of 277nm is shown in  . Although CdCl2 is not luminescent, interestingly many cadmium coordination complexes containing polypyridyl ligands show an intense fluorescence band upon excitation at the ligand's absorption band in solution as well as in the solid state. No emissions originating from metal-centered and MLCT or LMCT excited states are expected for the Cd(II) complexes, since the Cd(II) ion is difficult to oxidize or reduce due to its d10 configuration . Thus, the emission observed at 406nm (\u03a6 =0.29) in [{CdCl2}2(\u03bc-tppz)] is tentatively assigned to the 1(\u03c0-\u03c0\u2217) intraligand fluorescence.\n\nThe emission spectrum of a deoxygenated solution of [Rh(tppz)(bpy)Cl][PF6]2 at the excitation wavelength of 322nm is shown in  . The maximum emission peak of this complex is located at 435nm (\u03a6 =8\u00d710-3). Since electrochemical data indicated that the reduction orbital of the metal center is d\u2217, instead of \u03c0\u2217 in nature, participating luminescence, the following emission in [Rh(tppz)(bpy)Cl][PF6]2 can thus be ruled out: metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT), sigma-bond-to-ligand charge transfer (SBLCT), halide-to-ligand charge transfer (XLCT), ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (LLCT) or ligand-centered (LC) emission . This conclusion in turn supports the \u03c0d\u2217 emission assignment at room temperature. For the complexes cis-[Rh(bpy)(DPA)Cl2] and cis-[Rh(phen)(DPA)Cl2] (DPA=the deprotonated form of 2,2'-dipyridylamine), only a one-electron reduction process occurs at the metal with elimination of a Cl- anion. Based on the luminescence and electrochemical data, the emission of these complexes was assigned as \u03c0d\u2217 . Some pseudo-octahedral Rh(III) complexes which contain the ortho-metallated phenylpyridine anion as a ligand are phosphorescent at room temperature .\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this study, two tppz complexes, [Rh(tppz)(bpy)Cl][PF6]2.acetylacetone and [{CdCl2}2(\u03bc-tppz)].ethylene glycol, have been synthesized and characterized.\n\nLuminescent polynuclear d10 metal complexes such as Cd(II) are of great interest because of their potential application in chemical optical sensors, photosensitization and electroluminescent devices. It is interesting that the dinuclear complex [{CdCl2}2(\u03bc-tppz)] has a very strong emission band centered at 406nm upon excitation at 277nm. Metal ions can enhance or quench the fluorescence emission of polypyridyl ligands. Quenching of fluorescence of a ligand by transition metal ions during complexation is a rather common phenomenon which is explained by processes such as magnetic perturbation, redox activity and electronic energy transfer. Enhancement of fluorescence through complexation is, however, of much interest as it opens up the opportunity for photochemical applications of these complexes . The fluorescent intensity of the dinuclear Cd(II) complex is significantly stronger than that of free tppz, probably due to the conformational rigidity enhancement of the coordinated tppz, thereby reducing the non-radiative decay of the intraligand 1(\u03c0-\u03c0\u2217) excited state. Thus, [{CdCl2}2(\u03bc-tppz)] may be used as an advanced material for light emitting diode devices and may be an excellent candidate for solvent-resistance fluorescent material because it is almost insoluble in most common solvents such as methanol, ethanol, acetone, CHCl3, CH2Cl2 and water.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "spectrum": [{"value":
