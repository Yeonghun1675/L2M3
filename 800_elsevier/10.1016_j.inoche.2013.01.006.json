The coexistence of Cu(I) and Cu(II) is due to the partly reduction of Cu(II) under basic hydrothermal conditions , and methanol in this reaction may act as the reducing agent .\n\nThe thermalgravimetric analyses (TGA) are performed on the single crystal samples of 1 and 2 with a heating rate of 10\u00b0C\u22c5min-1 under nitrogen atmosphere, as shown in Figs. S2 and S3. The TGA curves of the two compounds show the similar process of thermal decomposition with three stages. For 1, the first mass loss stage from 60 to 125\u00b0C is confirmed as the loss of uncoordinated and coordinated water molecules with residual weight of 10.55% (cal: 10.32%). The second stage occurs between 125 and 190\u00b0C and is attributed to the loss of Hatrz ligand with 66.10% (cal: 65.86%). The third stage from 310 to 370\u00b0C is considered as the break of pda ligand and then the compound is completely converted to CuO with residual weight of 22.25%, which is in good agreement with calculated value 22.81%. For 2, the first stage is confirmed as the loss of coordinated water molecules with 5.10% (cal: 4.58%) during 30-90\u00b0C. The second and third stages in the range of 155 to 380\u00b0C are considered as loss of atrz and pda ligands, respectively, with residual weights of 74.00% (cal: 74.30%) and 40.80% (cal: 40.45%). Also, compound 2 is converted to CuO. Two remainders after thermal decompositions are evidenced by X-ray powder diffraction analysis (Fig. S4).\n\nHMX is a typical highly energetic material which has been widely used in the main component of solid rocket propellant. The performance of HMX can be enhanced by reduce the peak temperature of decomposition and increase the heat release . To check the effects of thermal decomposition of HMX after adding the as-synthesized compounds, 1, 2 and HMX are mixed at a mass ratio of 1:30 to prepare the target samples. The study is investigated by DSC measurement with a heating rate of 10\u00b0C\u22c5min-1 in N2 atmosphere in the range of 100-500\u00b0C with Al2O3 as reference. The Kissiger's method is used to investigate the activation energy (E a) and pre-exponential factor (A) of thermal decomposition for HMX and HMX with additives by DSC measurement with four different heat rates of 5, 10, 15 and 20\u00b0C\u22c5min-1 .   shows the DSC curves of HMX and HMX with 1 and 2. In a, the endothermic and exothermic peaks at 197\u00b0C and 289\u00b0C of HMX are attributed to the phase transformation and decomposition temperatures, respectively, and the heat release of exothermic process is 1200J\u22c5g-1. From b and c, we can see that the mixtures have no significant impact on the phase transition of HMX. The peak temperature of HMX containing 1 decrease from 289\u00b0C to 280\u00b0C and the heat release up to 1410J\u22c5g-1 while that of HMX containing 2 reach to 272\u00b0C and 1550J\u22c5g-1. It can be inferred that the compounds decompose and release much heat itself, as well as the formation of metal and oxide at molecular level on propellant surface may contribute toward their catalytic effects .\n\nThe single-crystal X-ray data for 1 and 2 were collected on a Bruker SMART CCD diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb=0.71073\u00c5) at room temperature. Absorption corrections were applied using SADABS. The structure was solved with direct methods and refined with the full-matrix least-squares technique based on F 2 using the SHELXTL program package . Anisotropic thermal parameters were applied to all non-hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen atoms were located at the calculated sites and refined with isotropic temperature factors.
