NH2-Co-PYI2 was prepared similarly to NH2-Co-PYI1, except that D-BCIP replaced L-BCIP. Elemental analysis along with powder X-ray analysis (PXRD) of the compound indicated the pure phase of its bulky sample (Fig. S1). Circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of the bulk sample of NH2-Co-PYI1 presented positive cotton effects at 245nm (\u03b8=31.6 mdeg) and negative cotton effects at 300nm (\u03b8 = -75.7 mdeg). The CD spectrum of NH2-Co-PYI2 exhibited the cotton effects that were opposite to NH2-Co-PYI1, as expected for a pair of enantiomers with a mirror-imager relationship (Fig. S2) [,]. The molecular asymmetric structural unit of NH2-Co-PYI1 contains a Keggin anion CoW12O40 6- unit (the precursor W10O32 4- anion is labile under hydrothermal conditions and favours to rearrangement into the more stable Keggin-type CoW12O40 6- anion) and a cation [Co2(NH2-BPY)2(HPYI)2(H2O)(CH3CN)]6+ (Fig. S3). As shown in  a, both Co(2) ion and Co(3) ions adopt distorted octahedral geometries (Fig. S4). The crystallographically independent Co(2) ion is defined by one oxygen atom from coordinated water, two terminal oxygen atoms of CoW12O40 6-, two nitrogen atoms from NH2-BPY and one nitrogen atom from PYI. The removability of the coordinated water molecules indicates the potential of NH2-Co-PYI1 to act as an active Lewis acid catalyst (a). The coordination environment of Co(3) ion is defined by two terminal oxygen atoms of CoW12O40 6-, two nitrogen atoms from NH2-BPY, one nitrogen atom from PYI, and one nitrogen atom from CH3CN. Each of these CoW12O40 6- anion acts as a tetradentate ligand to connect with four Co ions through the terminal oxygen atoms forming a 2D square grid sheet (b). Then the 2D square grid sheet are further bridged by the NH2-BPY ligands coordinating with two different Co ions to form a three-dimensional  nbo  topology (6482)framework with one-dimensional chiral channels along the b axis (c, S5). According to the calculated from PLATON analysis, the accessible empty space of the framework is approximately 236.8\u00c53 (6.6%), which suggested that the MOF-based material NH2-Co-PYI1 has the possibility for absorbing substrates within its pores. TGA revealed that the frameworks are stable up to ~360\u00b0C (Fig. S6). NH2-Co-PYI1 exhibits high chemical and thermal stability, which satisfies most of the conditions of the ideal platform for heterogeneous catalysis. The coexistence of the Lewis acid catalyst Co(II), chiral organocatalyst PYI and Lewis base catalyst NH2-BPY in one framework would provide a synergistical catalytic way to accelerate the aldol and Knoevenagel condensation [,].\n\nThe aldol reaction is also a key carboncarbon bond-formingreaction in nature and repertoire of the synthetic chemist []. Enamine catalysis is commonly used in electrophilic \u03b1-substitution reactions of ketones and aldehydes []. The chiral POMOFs NH2-Co-PYIs were assessed as catalyst for the asymmetric aldol reactions between various aromatic aldehydes and cyclohexanone in DMSO or CH3OH/ H2O at room temperature. As listed in   (see S\u2161 for additional information), the corresponding catalytic and enantioselective activities varied significantly with different aldehydes. The reactions catalyzed by NH2-Co-PYIs in DMSO media produced aldol products in general yields (60-75%) and with fair to good enantioselectivity for anti-isomers (enantiomeric excess (ee), 48-63%). As is expected, a chirality induction effect was observed in the reaction between various aromatic aldehydes and cyclohexanone employed in DMSO. Thus, NH2-Co-PYIs represent the first examples of POM-based heterogeneous asymmetric catalysts for this important reaction, providing a convenient route to aldol reaction. To investigate the influence of the solvent, we employed the reactions in CH3OH/H2O media (1:1 ratio). Although the conversion is low, the higher diastereo-selectivity (>98%) and excellent enantioselectivity were obtained, especially, up to 89.15% for the 2-(Hydroxy-(4-nitrophenyl)methyl)-cyclohexan-1-one catalyzed by NH2-Co-PYI1. It's worth noting that catalyst NH2-Co-PYIs in CH3OH/H2O media always exhibited excellent specificity for the syn conformation of the product corresponding to the aldol reactions of the nitrobenzaldehydes rather than the anti conformation reported in previous literatures []. (Table S1) In NH2-Co-PYI1, the co-existence of imine as Lewis base and exposed Co2+ ions as Lewis acid catalytic sites within one framework will enhanced the activity of the enamine in aldol reaction and avoid the side reactions, such as self-aldolization.
