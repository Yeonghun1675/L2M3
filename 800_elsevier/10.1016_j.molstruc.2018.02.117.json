As shown in  a, the Cd(II) ion is seven-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms (N8 and N4a) from two independent biimpy ligands and five carboxylate oxygen atoms (O8, O9, O6c, O7b and O7b) from three different Htci2- ligands, affording a slightly distorted pentagonal bipyramidal geometry. The CdO and CdN distances are in the range of 2.302(3)-2.544(3) \u00c5, 2.266(3)-2.270(3) \u00c5, respectively. In the self-assemble process, the H3tci ligand deprotonated two protons into Htci2-, and the Htci2- ligand adopts a cis-cis-trans conformation linking three different Cd(II) ions in \u03bc 3-(\u03b7 2-O,O'), (\u03b7 2-O\",O\u2034), O\u2034 coordination mode ( a). Two symmetry-related Cd(II) ions are bridged by two carboxylate groups into a dinuclear [Cd2(COO)2] subunit with the Cd\u22efCd separation of 3.897\u00c5. Under the synergetic bridging effect of Htci2- and biimpy ligands, the dinuclear [Cd2(COO)2] subunits are bridged together into a 2D layer (b). In this 2D layer, each dinuclear [Cd2(COO)2] subunit is connected to six adjacent identical ones via four biimpy ligands and four Htci2- ligands (each two Htci2- ligands links two dinuclear [Cd2(COO)2] subunits). Topologically speaking, the dinuclear [Cd2(COO)2] subunits can be regarded as 6-connected nodes, so this 2D layer represents a 6-connected 2D hxl plane topological network with the point symbol of {36,46,53} (c). Notably, there exist abundant hydrogen bonds between CH groups and O donors, which not only further consolidate the 2D layer but also extend the 2D layer into 3D supramolecular framework. The detailed hydrogen bond parameters are listed in .\n\nCrystal structure of compound 2 \n\n Via tuning the pH value of reaction mixture, another new compound 2 was obtained. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that compound 2 crystallized in the triclinic P-1 space group, and contains one and half Cd(II) ions, one tci3- ligand and one biimpy ligand. As shown in  b, the Cd1 ion is coordinated by two nitrogen donors (N4 and N8b) from two independent biimpy ligands and five carboxylate oxygen donors (O8, O9, O6b, O7b and O8c) from three different tci3- ligands, adopting a slightly distorted pentagonal bipyramidal geometry, and the Cd2 ion is four-coordinated by three carboxylate oxygen donors (O4, O5 and O7a) from two independent tci3- ligands and one coordinated water molecule (O1w), displaying a rare tetrahedral geometry. The CdO and CdN distances locate in the range of 2.087(7)-2.619(5) \u00c5, 2.253(5)-2.296(4) \u00c5, respectively. Different from compound 1, the H3tci ligand deprotonated three protons into tci3-, and the tci3- ligand adopts a cis-cis-cis conformation and exhibits a \u03bc 5-(\u03b7 2-O,O'),O', (\u03b7 2-O\",O\u2034), O\", (\u03b7 2-O\u2034',O\u2034\") coordination mode (b). The tci3- ligand using its carboxylate groups links the Cd(II) ions to form a 2D layer (b). These adjacent 2D layers are further pillared by the biimpy ligands, giving rise to a 3D pillar-layered framework (c).\n\nPowder X-ray diffraction patterns and thermogravimetric analyses\n\nIn order to confirm the phase purities of the synthesized two compounds, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) experiments were performed. As shown in , the experimental PXRD patterns of compounds 1 and 2 are in good agreement with the simulated patterns, which suggest that the as-synthesized samples are in single pure phase. In addition, thermal stabilities of compounds 1 and 2 were also investigated under N2 atmosphere in the temperature range of 30-800\u00b0C. For compound 1, it can be stable up to 267\u00b0C, and after that, obvious weight loss was observed owing to the decomposition of the organic ligand. The final residue of 19.95% may be powder CdO (Calcd: 198.28%) (). For compound 2, the first weight loss of 2.38% occurred in the temperature range of 125-150\u00b0C was resulted by the departure of the coordinated water molecule, and then, the skeleton can be stable up to 300\u00b0C. When heating above 300\u00b0C, continuous weight loss occurred until 450\u00b0C, leading to the formation of powder CdO (Obsd: 25.02%, Calcd: 26.02%) ().\n\nPhotoluminescent properties of compounds 1 and 2 \n\nThe solid-state luminescent properties of compound 1 and 2 as well as free organic ligands (H3tci and biimpy) were investigated at room temperature. As shown in  , the free H3tci ligand shows an emission peak at 425 nm upon excitation of 310 nm, which originates from \u03c0*\u2192n or \u03c0* \u2192 \u03c0 electronic transitions, and the free biimpy ligand is non-fluorescent in the visible range. Compared with that of the free ligand, compound 1 shows a luminescent emission band at 438nm (\u03bb ex=325nm), and compound 2 shows a luminescent emission band at 455nm (\u03bb ex=325nm) (). It can be observed that the emission spectra of compounds 1 and 2 have obvious red-shifts (13nm for 1 and 30nm for 2)with respect to the free H3tci ligand. Thus, the luminescent emissions of compounds 1 and 2 can be ascribed to the intraligand charge transfer. The red-shifts of emission spectra for compounds 1 and 2 were caused by the deprotonation of H3tci ligand and coordination effects to metal centers, which can effectively enhance the rigidity of organic ligand. In addition, the difference of emission peaks between 1 and 2 may be caused by the different deprotonated existent forms (Htci2- for 1 and tci3- for 2), different coordination environments for metal ions and different spatial frameworks [,].", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "compound 1", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "Cd(II)"}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "267", "unit": "\u00b0C",
