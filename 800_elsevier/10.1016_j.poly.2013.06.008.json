The two compounds are isostructural as deduced from a Rietveld analysis of X-ray powder diffraction data of 2 simulated from the single crystal structure of 1. The crystal packing of 1 is formed by regular chains running along the crystallographic [-101] direction where the planar [Pt(CN)4]2- anion acts as a \u03bc2-bridging ligand via two nitrogen atoms of two different trans cyano groups, while the two abpt molecules act as chelating ligands. Along the neutral chains, the Fe\u22efPt distances are imposed by the cyano groups of the [Pt(CN)4]2- moiety (5.027 and 5.022\u00c5 at 294 and 150K, respectively), leading to Fe\u22efFe intrachain distances of 10.055 and 10.045\u00c5 at 294 and 150K, respectively. The thermal dependence of the product of the molar magnetic susceptibility times the temperature (\u03c7 m T) for compound 1 shows a constant value close to 0.2emuKmol-1 in the temperature range 10-300K in the cooling and warming scans. Above 300K, compound 1 shows a SCO transition from the LS to the HS configuration although the transition is not fully achieved at 400K.\n\nPhysical measurements\n\nInfrared spectra were recorded in the range 4000-200cm-1 on a FT-IR BRUKER ATR VERTEX70 Spectrometer. Variable temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements were carried out in the temperature range 2-400K, cooling and warming the sample at 1K/min with an applied magnetic field of 0.5T on a polycrystalline sample of compound 1 (mass=8.90mg) with a Quantum Design MPMS-XL-5 SQUID magnetometer. The susceptibility data were corrected for the sample holder previously measured under the same conditions, and for the diamagnetic contribution as deduced by using Pascal's constant tables (\u03c7 dia =-360.08\u00d710-6 emumol-1). Elemental analyses were performed at the \"Service de microanalyse\", CNRS, 91198 Gif-sur-Yvette.\n\nResults and discussions\n\nThe IR spectrum of 1 shows sharp peaks attributed to the distinctive bond vibrations modes of the abpt ligand, i.e. (i) the \u03bd (NH) absorption bands of the amino group in the 3250-3140cm-1 region, (ii) the stretching modes of the aromatic (CH) bonds detected in the 3080-3015cm-1 region and (iii) the stretching modes of the aromatic (CC) and (CN) bonds localized in the 1635-1500 and 1500-1400cm-1 regions, respectively . The modifications and the shifts of those bands, with respect to the IR spectrum of the abpt molecule only, clearly suggest the coordination of the abpt moiety in compound 1. Moreover, the two characteristic strong \u03bd(CN) bands, observed at 2164 and 2132cm-1 and distinct from the stretching vibration modes observed in K2[Pt(CN)4]\u22c5xH2O, 1 Infrared data of K2[Pt(CN)4].xH2O (cm-1): 3628(br), 3543(br), 2135(s), 2121(s), 1906(w), 1615(s), 1397(w), 503(s), 468(w), 426(s).   can be respectively assigned to bridging and terminal CN groups, indirectly revealing the coordinated character of the [Pt(CN)4]2- moiety in compound 1.\n\nThe structure of 1 is built from one Fe(II) cation, one [Pt(CN)4]2- anion, both located on inversion centers, and one chelating abpt ligand located on a general position. As indicated above, despite several attempts to prepare single crystals of nickel analogue (compound 2) using different techniques such as slow evaporation, slow diffusion in H tube and gel diffusion technique, only polycrystalline powder has been prepared. In order to verify whether the Ni(II) and Pt(II) analogues are isostructural, the measured powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the two samples were analysed using the Rietveld method, and compared to the patterns simulated from the single crystal structure of 1. As shown in  , the diffraction pattern of 1 is well reproduced using the room temperature (294K) single crystal structure of 1, with refined cell parameters (a =8.480(1)\u00c5, b =9.039(1)\u00c5, c =10.070(1)\u00c5, \u03b1 =83.707(4)\u00b0, \u03b2 =65.384(3)\u00b0, \u03b3 =88.968(4)\u00b0) close to the results of the single crystal analysis.\n\nThe microcrystalline powder of 1 is a pure phase corresponding to the derived single crystal structure. The measured pattern of 2 is qualitatively similar to the pattern of 1; with noticeable variations in diffraction peak intensity most probably due to the contrast in X-ray scattering power between Pt (for 1) and Ni (for 2). The results of the Rietveld analysis indicate a small difference in refined unit cell parameters (a =8.525(1)\u00c5, b =9.241(1)\u00c5, c =9.658(1)\u00c5, \u03b1 =83.97(1)\u00b0, \u03b2 =65.262(6)\u00b0, \u03b3 =90.71(1)\u00b0) with respect to the structure of 1; the c cell parameter decreases by 0.412(1)\u00c5 (4.1%), while the unit cell volume is reduced by 8.6\u00c53 (1.2%). The major differences in the diffraction pattern, such as the observed quasi splitting of several peaks (e.g. at 2\u03b8 =9.8\u00b0, 11.5\u00b0), result from the large decrease in the c cell parameter from 1 to 2. Accounting for this adjustment in cell parameters, all the diffraction peaks in the measured pattern of 2 are satisfactorily reproduced with the pattern simulated from the single crystal structure of 1, which suggest that the two compounds have very similar structures; the one dimensional topology is most probably preserved in 2.\n\nThe average values of the six Fe-N distances observed at 150K and at room temperature (294K) are 1.982(4) and 1.987(5)\u00c5, respectively. These observations are in good agreement with the value expected for the low spin (LS) state in the Fe(II) complexes displaying distorted octahedral geometry .\n\nThe crystal packing of 1 is formed by regular chains running along the crystallographic [-101] direction where the planar [Pt(CN)4]2- anion acts as a \u03bc2-bridging ligand via two nitrogen atoms of two different trans cyano groups ( ). Such linear chains are arranged in an eclipsed way along the [010] direction, leading to the parallel structural arrangement depicted in . Along the neutral chains, the Fe\u22efPt distances are imposed by the cyano groups of the [Pt(CN)4]2- moiety (5.027 and 5.022\u00c5 at 294 and 150K, respectively), leading to Fe\u22efFe intrachain distances of 10.055 and 10.045\u00c5 at 294 and 150K, respectively, in agreement with the trans linear arrangement of the metal ions along the [-101] direction. Albeit, the shortest Fe\u22efFe distances are simply defined by the length of the crystallographic a axis (8.5046(3) and 8.4330(3)\u00c5 at 294 and 150K, respectively).", "data": ["This model's maximum context length is 4097 tokens.
