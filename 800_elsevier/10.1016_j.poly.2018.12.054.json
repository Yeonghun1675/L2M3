The second stage of weight loss occurred at 180-240\u00b0C, the actual weightless was 17.60% (theoretical weight loss: 18.36%), corresponding to the losing of two coordinated H2O. The third weightless stage occurred at 240-800\u00b0C, corresponding to the partial collapse of the ligand L. For compound 2, the first stage of weight loss occurred at 30-255\u00b0C and the actual weight loss was 11.71% (theoretical weight loss: 11.00%), corresponding to losing of a coordinated H2O and a lattice H2O. The second stage of weight loss occurred at 255-600\u00b0C, the actual weight loss was 58.82% (theoretical weight loss: 60.92%), corresponding to the ligand L skeleton collapsed, the final residue is cadmium oxide. For compound 3, the first weightless stage occurred at 30-600\u00b0C and the actual weight loss was 52.77%, corresponding to the partial collapse of the ligand L. Comparing the weightlessness of compounds 1-3, the thermal decomposition temperatures were 100\u00b0C, 250\u00b0C and 330\u00b0C, respectively. Therefore, in the three compounds, 3 had the best thermal stability and 1 had the worst thermal stability.\n\nSOD activity\n\n  shows the results of the SOD activity test for the seven compounds. We summarize the results in  . It is found from  that IC50 values of 1-7 were 10.2, 2.7, 5.9, 2.6, 20.34, 4.2, 7.2mg/L, respectively. It was clearly observed that compound 2 has the better SOD activity. This was because that coordination modes between metal and ligand, as well as the different metal center attached to the carboxyl group of the ligand were different.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "Compound 1", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "30-180", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "loss of four lattice H2O", "condition": ""}, {"value": "180-240", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "loss of two coordinated H2O", "condition": ""}, {"value": "240-800", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "partial collapse of the ligand L", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "Compound 2", "symbol": "2", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "30-255", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "loss of a coordinated H2O and a lattice H2O", "condition": ""}, {"value": "255-600", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "ligand L skeleton collapsed", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "Compound 3", "symbol": "3", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "30-600", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "partial collapse of the ligand L", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "Compound 1", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "catalytic activity": [{"value": "10.2", "unit": "mg/L", "time": "", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "Compound 2", "symbol": "2", "chemical formula": ""}, "catalytic activity": [{"value": "2.7", "unit": "mg/L", "time": "", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "Compound 3", "symbol": "3", "chemical formula": ""}, "catalytic activity": [{"value": "5.9", "unit": "mg/L", "time": "", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["catalytic_activity", "decomposition_temperature"]}, {"idx": 44, "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<ce:section-title id=\"st125\">Conclusions</ce:section-title><ce:para id=\"p0160\" view=\"all\">In this work, we successfully synthesized three new superoxide dismutase mimics, [CoL(H<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>O)]\u00b72H<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>O (<ce:bold>1</ce:bold>), [CdL(H<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>O)]\u00b7H<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>O (<ce:bold>2</ce:bold>) and [PbL] (<ce:bold>3</ce:bold>) under hydrothermal conditions by using the reaction of transition metal salts and 5-aminoisophthalic acid (L).
