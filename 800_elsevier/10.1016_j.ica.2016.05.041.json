According to the hard and soft acid and base theory (HSAB), however, nitrogen atoms are less likely to connect with lanthanide ions. It may be a wise strategy to introduce a carboxylate group onto the tetrazole ring since oxygen atom is easy to coordinate with lanthanide ions. Tetrazole-carboxylate with both nitrogen and oxygen atoms are outstanding building blocks, the selection of such ligands arises from the following reasons: (i) oxygen and nitrogen are universally acknowledged as atoms with outstanding coordination ability; (ii) these ligands with either rigid tetrazole rings and flexible carboxylate groups may exhibit diverse coordination modes, thus forming various structures; (iii) the rich nitrogen and oxygen atoms can take part in the formation of hydrogen bonds and this can stabilize the supramolecular assemblies. In our previous work, we have reported the synthesis of mononuclear [Ln(tzpya)2(H2O)5]Cl\u22c54H2O (Ln =Y, Pr, Dy) (tzpya=3-(5-tetrazolyl)pyridine-1-acetato) , one dimensional [Mn(atzpa)2(H2O)2] (atzpa=5-aminotetrazole-1-propanoic anion) , three dimensional [M(pytza)2] (M =Mn, Zn, Co) and the energetic performance of [Co(pytza)2] , two dimensional [Pr4(4-pytza)5(OH)4(H2O)7Cl]Cl2\u22c54H2O  (pytza=5-(4-pyridyl)tetrazole-2-acetato). To extend our previous work, in this paper, Htzpya, Hatzpa and Hpytza were chosen to be reacted with Eu3+ salts. Exploration of Eu(III)-tetrazole-carboxylate compounds may not only enrich the knowledge of coordination chemistry but also explore potential candidates for luminescence because Eu(III) compounds usually show characteristic peaks of the Eu3+ and exhibit green luminescence. To systematically investigate the influence of the counter anion and pH on formation of such compounds, different counter anions (Cl-, NO3 -) and pH values were used. Additionally, the luminescence in the solid state were investigated, exhibiting both ligand centered emission and characteristic peaks of Eu3+.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 16, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<ce:section-title id=\"st030\">Experimental</ce:section-title><ce:section-title id=\"st035\">Materials and apparatus</ce:section-title><ce:para id=\"p0025\" view=\"all\">Htzpya, Hpytza and Hatzpa were prepared according to the literature method .

The luminescence properties of 1-4 and the free ligands were investigated in the solid state at room temperature. As is shown in  , the free ligands Htzpya, Hpytza and Hatzpa exhibit maximum emissions at 360, 393, and 433nm upon excitations at 315, 327 and 371nm, respectively. Compounds 1-4 all exhibit five peaks upon excitations at 307, 382, 375 and 375nm, respectively ( ). The peaks at 412nm for 1, 444nm for 2, 453nm for 3, 448nm for 4, are assigned to the ligand centered emission because similar emissions of the corresponding ligands are observed.

The emission intensity of 5D0 \u2192 7F2, an electric dipole transition, increases as the site symmetry of the Eu(III) ions decreases. The coordination environment of Eu3+ in compounds 1-4 are almost symmetric since the intensity of the 5D0 \u2192 7F2 (electric dipole) is similar to that of 5D0 \u2192 7F1 (magnetic dipole) , which is
