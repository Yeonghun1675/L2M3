Empirical absorption correction (\u03c8 scan) was applied. The structure was solved by the direct method and refined by the full-matrix least squares on F 2 using the SHELXS-97 software . All of the non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms were located from difference Fourier maps. A total of 6561 (3442 unique, R int=0.0463) reflections were measured. Structure solution and refinement based on 3442 independent reflections with I>2\u03c3(I) and 244 parameters gave R 1(wR 2)=0.0297 (0.0853) {R 1=\u2211||F o|-|F c||/\u2211|F  rmo |; wR 2=\u2211[w(F o 2-F c 2)2]/\u2211[w(F o 2)2]1/2}.\n\nThe TG curve of compound 1 ( ) exhibits two steps of weight losses. The first weight loss is 3.98% (calc. 3.71%) in the range of 340-380 \u00b0C, corresponding to the release of coordination water. The second weight loss is 61.72% (calc. 62.89%) in the temperature range of 390-480 \u00b0C, corresponding to the release of piperazine and btec ligands. The sample does not lose weight at temperatures higher than 480 \u00b0C. The residue is ZnO.\n\nThe crystal structure of compound 1 \n\nX-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that compound 1 is a three-dimensional (3D) polymer with two kinds of ligands bridging between the zinc ions. All carboxyl groups of btec ligands in compound 1 are deprotonated and two types of btec ligands are present in the structure. (a) Eight oxygen atoms from four deprotonated carboxyl groups of btec ligand are all used as coordinating atoms. Four oxygen atoms from two neighboring carboxyl groups coordinate to three zinc atoms. Among which, two oxygen atom adopt 1,6-bidentate chelating mode connecting to one Zn atom and the other two link with two Zn atoms with monodentate mode; the remaining four oxygen atoms of the btec ligand coordinate to other three zinc atoms with the same mode (abtec, ) . (b) Each carboxyl group adopts monodentate coordination mode linking to four Zn atoms (bbtec, ). There are two crystallographically unique Zn centers in the crystal structure, as shown in  . The Zn(1) center shows a distorted square pyramidal geometry and is coordinated by one nitrogen atom of a piperazine ligand and four oxygen atoms, two from two bbtec ligand, and other two from one abtec ligand. The Zn(2) center adopts distorted tetrahedral geometry coordinated by one nitrogen atom of a piperazine ligand, two oxygen atoms from two abtec ligand and one oxygen donors from one water molecule. The average Zn-N bond length is 2.0484(2) \u00c5. The Zn-O bond lengths vary from 1.963(2) to 2.2568 \u00c5, while Zn-OW bond length is 1.988(2) \u00c5. If we neglect piperazine ligand and Zn(2) ions, a 2-D sheet structure is observed (see  ). The sheet is made up of a rhombic grid with four abtec ligands on the corners, four Zn(1) atoms on the edges and one bbtec ligand that bridges between two of the Zn(1) atoms in the center of the rhombic grid. The size of these rhombic grids is ca. 8.9\u00d712.9 \u00c5. It is very interesting that the 2-D sheet is a wave-like structure viewed from the side (see  ), and such wave-like sheets composed of two types of btec ligand has not been observed so far. The distance between two neighboring crests is ca. 11.5 \u00c5. All Zn(1) atoms are in the position of crest and trough. Further, Zn(2) atoms, functioning as linkers, link two oxygen atoms from two carboxyl groups of two abtec ligand belonging to adjacent sheets to produce the 3D framework (see ). It is very interesting that the other bridging ligands piperazine are in the interlayer region linking to Zn(1) atoms and Zn(2) atoms () with chair conformation. Therefore, the 3D structure of compound 1 is produced by the combination of btec ligand and piperazine ligand, to our knowledge, such combination has not been reported.\n\nFluorescent property\n\nThe luminescent spectra of 1 and the free H4btec ligand in the solid state at room temperature are shown in   and  . The emissions of 1 [\u03bb max=489.00 nm, (\u03c4=0.016 ms)] (\u03c4=lifetime; the short lifetime suggests that luminescence should be assigned to fluorescence) can be observed upon photoexcitation at 442.00 nm, while emission of the free H4btec (\u03bb max=342.00 nm) is upon photoexcitation at 308.00 nm. Thus, the blue fluorescence may be assigned as ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) . A similar emission band has also been observed in other zinc-organic polymer compounds . Compound 1 may be used as an advanced material for blue-light emitting diode devices because of the blue fluorescence emission. This condensed polymeric material may be an excellent candidate for highly thermally stable and solvent-resistant blue fluorescent material because 1 is highly thermally stable and insoluble in common polar and non-polar solvents such as ethanol, chloroform, acetone, and water .", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "compound 1", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature":
