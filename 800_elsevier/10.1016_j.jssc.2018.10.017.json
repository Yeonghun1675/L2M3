The outer layers of the Fe3+ ions are in an unsaturated electronic state (d6), meaning that the ions have empty orbitals and are ideal acceptors for electrons . Moreover, the O 1s X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies were discussed on 1 and 1@Fe  3+  (). The O 1s peaks from free oxygen atoms of monodentate carboxylate at 530.21eV get shifted to 533.21eV on the addition of Fe3+ (). Such a shift reflects the decrease in the electron density of the O, indicating that the Fe3+ cations were coordinated with the oxygen atoms in the MOFs framework .", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 42, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<ce:section-title id=\"sect0115\">Detection of anions</ce:section-title><ce:para id=\"p0150\" view=\"all\">Simultaneously, various anions were selected to carry out the anion-sensing function by immersing <ce:bold>1</ce:bold> in different anion aqueous solutions (anion = Br<ce:sup loc=\"post\">-</ce:sup>, I<ce:sup loc=\"post\">-</ce:sup>, SO<ce:inf loc=\"post\">4</ce:inf>\n<ce:sup loc=\"post\">2-</ce:sup>, C<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>O<ce:inf loc=\"post\">4</ce:inf>\n<ce:sup loc=\"post\">2-</ce:sup>, CO<ce:inf loc=\"post\">3</ce:inf>\n<ce:sup loc=\"post\">2-</ce:sup>, Cl<ce:sup loc=\"post\">-</ce:sup>, Cr<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>O<ce:inf loc=\"post\">7</ce:inf>\n<ce:sup loc=\"post\">2-</ce:sup>, CrO<ce:inf loc=\"post\">4</ce:inf>\n<ce:sup loc=\"post\">2-</ce:sup>, respectively).

In addition, three Zn(II) ions are connected by four bridging carboxylate groups and two monodentate carboxylate groups to form a trinuclear [Zn3(\u03bc1-COO)2 (\u03bc2-COO)4] SBU (b), the SBU is by the Zn1\u22efZn2 separations of 3.2876(4) \u00c5. The SBU is extended by six L3- ligands to produce a 2D layered network viewed along the a direction (b). Finally, the O-H\u22efO connected by solvent molecules exist between the neighboring 2D layers, which combine the layers into a 3D supramolecular network (c,  and ).

The asymmetric unit is made up of three crystallographically independent Cd(II) ions, two fully deprotonated L3- (La and Lb), adopting different coordination models with Cd(II) ions (c), and five coordinated water molecules. As shown in a, Cd1 atom, which is six connected by one N atom from Lb ligand, one water molecule and four O atoms from three Lb ligands, displays a distorted octahedron geometry.

The TGA of 1-4 were carried out under a N2 atmosphere from 35 to 700\u00b0C (). 1 releases three coordinated NMP molecule before 265\u00b0C with a total weight loss of 22.8% (calcd. 23.9%). No further weight loss is observed before the framework collapses at 380\u00b0C. 2 loses 9.7% (calcd. 9.8%) weight before 168\u00b0C, corresponding to the departure of one Diox molecule, and the framework could keep intact until about 415\u00b0C, showing good thermal stability. 3 loses 11.3% (calcd. 13.3%) weight before 140\u00b0C is assigned to the loss of one free NMP and three coordinated water molecules. The main framework is thermally stable up to 330\u00b0C and then decomposes at a higher temperature. 4 presents a weight loss of 2.1% (calcd. 2.5%) before 190\u00b0C, arising from the release of one coordinated H2O and one lattice H2O molecules.\n\nWater stability of 1-4\n\nIn order to further study the water stability of the 1-4, the experiments were carried out by immersing 40mg of 1-4 crystals in 5mL in water at room temperature for some time and the 1-4 crystalline structures were confirmed by PXRD, respectively. The PXRD patterns contained for 1-4@H2O are the coincidence of the experimental PXRD patterns with those simulated from the single-crystal structures, respectively, revealing excellent stability in water ().\n\nLuminescence properties\n\nComplexes constructed by d10 metal centers and conjugated organic linkers are promising candidates in photochemistry, chemical sensors, and electroluminescent displays . In this paper, the solid-state luminescence properties of the free ligands and 1-4 were studied at room temperature. As displayed in , the free H3L show a strong emission peak at 375nm (\u03bbex =330nm), which may be derived from the intraligand \u03c0*-\u03c0 and/or \u03c0*-n transition. Complexes 1-4 exhibit a maximum emission peak at 369nm (\u03bbex =319nm), 385nm (\u03bbex =330nm), 453nm (\u03bbex =343nm) and 515nm (\u03bbex =356nm), respectively. The emission spectrum of 1 exhibits a slight blue shift of 6nm at 375nm compared to that of H3L ligand, which can be assigned to the intraligand \u03c0-\u03c0* or n-\u03c0* transition of H3L. The emission spectrum of 2 displays the slight red shift of 10nm for the 375nm band compared to that of H3L ligand, which may arise from the ligandcentered \u03c0-\u03c0* electronic transitions compared to the reported luminescent d10 MOFs . Complexes 3-4 exhibit an obvious red-shifts of 78nm and 140nm for the 375nm band, respectively, which can be attributed to the ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) between the delocalized \u03c0-bond of carboxylate groups and p orbitals of Cd(II) and Pb(II) centers, respectively . Moreover, complex 1 has an enhanced luminescence intensity compared to 2-4, which can be explained by the differences in the structures. The different emission intensity for 1-4 mainly derives from the differences in the coordination modes of the L3- ligand, and the coordination environments of the metal ions and the rigidity of the solid-state crystal packing. Whereas the rigid and stable framework of 1 can reduce this loss of energy and thus maintaining enhanced luminescence intensity.
