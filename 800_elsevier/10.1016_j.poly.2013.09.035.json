In each ligand molecule (N,N'-bis(4-pyridyl)idene-1R,2R-diaminocyclohexane), the inner imino N-atoms are oriented in different directions, with the nearly gauche N-C-C-N torsion angles equal to 59.71\u00b0 and 63.99\u00b0, which makes them inert to metal ion coordination. As a result, only the peripheral pyridyls coordinate to the silver ions. Every silver ion has a distorted tetrahedral coordination environment, being bound to four nitrogen donors from the four adjacent molecules of L1 , with Ag-N bond distances in the range 2.247(3)-2.423(4)\u00c5, and bond angles around the neighboring atoms ranging from 89.0(1)\u00b0 to 143.4(1)\u00b0. The Ag(I) centers are extended by L1  ligands along two directions (b), resulting in a (4,4)-connected two-dimensional layer with a corrugated surface, in which four L1  ligands bridge four adjacent Ag atoms to form a 60-membered metallocycle with two opposite Ag\u22efAg distances of 17.758 and 13.256\u00c5 (c). Significantly, these two-dimensional layers stack in a parallel fashion, producing a one-dimensional channel when viewed down the crystallographic b axis (d and e). These channels are filled by the uncoordinated CF3SO3 - anions and guest H2O molecules. The shortest Ag\u22efAg distance between adjacent layers is 9.182\u00c5. This result suggests that similar coordination complexes can be formed by L1  ligands and silvers ions, even when different counter anions are used . However, if the 4-substituted pyridine moiety on L1  was replaced by a 3-substituted pyridine moiety (L2 ), we found that a one-dimensional helical chain of L2  with Cd(II) can be formed ( ).", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 17, "type": "text", "classification": ["property"], "content": "<ce:section-title id=\"st040\">Crystal Structure of {[Cd<ce:bold>L<ce:sup loc=\"post\">2</ce:sup>\n</ce:bold>(NO<ce:inf loc=\"post\">3</ce:inf>)(3H<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>O)]\u00b7NO<ce:inf loc=\"post\">3</ce:inf>\u00b72H<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>O}<ce:inf loc=\"post\">n</ce:inf> (<ce:bold>2</ce:bold>)</ce:section-title><ce:para id=\"p0040\" view=\"all\">Inorganic and organic nanochannels, such as nanotubes, have received considerable attention due to their potential applications in nanoelectronics, molecular devices and sensors, ion exchange and catalysis .
