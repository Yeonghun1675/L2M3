The Sm(III) ion is surrounded by four pydc and two pic ligands, as well as one water molecule. As shown in  , each Sm(III) center is eight-coordinated by four O atoms from four different pydc ligands, two O atoms from pic, one N atom from pydc and an O atom from one coordinated water molecule, forming a square antiprismatic coordination geometry ( a): O1-N1=2.654, O4-N1=2.974, O4-O7=2.883, O7-O1=3.041, O2-O3=2.935, O3-O5=2.844, O6-O5=2.922 and O5-O2=2.974\u00c5. Muetterties and Wright, in their review  on high coordination numbers, classified eight-coordinate molecules into two groups in terms of energy: a low-energy set of structures (dodecahedron (DD), square antiprism (SAP) and bicapped trigonal prism), and a higher energy set (cube, hexagonal bipyramid, square prism, bicapped trigonal antiprism and bicapped trigonal prism). By far the largest numbers of reported structures are found for the DD and SAP geometries, many with chelating ligands. Often there are alternative chelation modes, and they noted that the preferred isomer will be determined by a delicate balance of a host of electronic, \"bite-size\", steric, and packing effects. Generally, for small-bite bidentate ligands, the DD structure is more favorable. In our system, complex 1 preferred the SAP geometry, with a relatively large chelation bite angle.\n\nIn complex 1, one pydc anion takes three coordination modes (b). In the first mode, one carboxylate group adopts the \u03bc 2-\u03b7 1:\u03b7 1 bridging mode. In the second mode, the oxygen atom of a carboxylate group and the nitrogen atom of pyridine adopt the \u03bc 1-\u03b7 1:\u03b7 1 chelating mode and the other oxygen atom of a carboxylate group is \u03bc 1:\u03b7 1 bridging as a third mode. The whole pydc ligand acts as a \u03bc 4-bridge to link four different rare earth Sm(III) ions in adjacent chains, resulting in a three-dimensional network structure ( ). One pydc ligand chelates a Sm(III) ion via nitrogen and oxygen atoms while an O atom of the para-carboxylate bridges to a second Sm(III) ion. The two pic ligands bridge two Sm(III) ions, while two pydc ligands bridge simultaneously another two Sm ions via the nitrogen and one oxygen atom of one carboxylate group of pydc and the other oxygen atom of a carboxylate group to another Sm(III) ion. Thereby these bridging structures generate a 3D chain structure with neighboring Sm\u22efSm distances of 4.520 and 7.916\u00c5. The bond distances around the Sm(III) ion are in the range 2.327(2)-2.634(2)\u00c5, and the Sm-N distance is 2.634(2)\u00c5. Two of the four bridging Sm(1)-O distances are significantly shorter [Sm(1)-O(2) 2.327(3)\u00c5, Sm(1)-O(6) 2.384(3)\u00c5] than Sm(1)-O(3) 2.407 (3)\u00c5 and Sm(1)-O(5) 2.396 (3)\u00c5, which are bridging the neighboring Sm(III) ion. In addition to that, other coordinated carboxylate oxygen to Sm distances are longer than former bonds: Sm(1)-O(4) 2.460(3)\u00c5, Sm(1)-O(1) 2.458(3)\u00c5. The water oxygen coordinated to Sm has a bond length of 2.422\u00c5. These Sm-O distances are also comparable to those in related Sm(III)-carboxylates . Sm-N bond length value is 2.634\u00c5, which is similar to those observed for eight coordinate Sm(III) complexes with nitrogen donor ligands . The O-Sm-O and N-Sm-O angles are in the ranges 69.47(6)-149.13(6)\u00b0 and 62.71(6)-146.88(7)\u00b0, respectively ().\n\nIR spectra\n\nIn the FT-infrared spectra, the ligand 2,5-pydc shows stretching bands attributed to \u03bd(OH), \u03bd(CO), \u03bd(CN) and \u03bd(CH) at 3473, 1737, 1598 and 1120cm-1, respectively (). FT-IR spectrum of the complex displays a broad absorption band at about 3478cm-1 for the stretching vibrations of \u03bd(OH) groups  engaged in hydrogen bonds (O-H vibrations of water molecules). The CO stretching frequency of the ligand appeared at 1737cm-1 as the strongest absorption in the IR spectrum. After coordination, the CO stretching frequency of the complex shifted to 1660cm-1, indicating that the oxygen atoms in the carbonyl group were also coordinated to samarium ions . The remarkable changes observed in the 900-400cm-1 region for the complex are attributed to the coordination of the ligands to the metal. The appearance of \u03bd(SmO) bands at 722-650 and 526-592cm-1 can be attributed to the carbonyl and carboxylate oxygen atoms , respectively. These bands support the chelation through the O atoms. A new band, having very strong intensity at 505cm-1, can be assigned to the \u03bd(SmN)  stretching vibration. This band supports chelation through the N atoms of the 2,5-pydc ligands ().\n\nThermal stability\n\nIt is well known that lanthanide ions have a high coordination number, and this feature may cause structural flexibility and increase thermodynamic stability . TG analysis supported the thermal stability of the coordination polymer ( ). It was performed in the temperature range 50-800\u00b0C under a N2 atmosphere at 1atm with a heating rate of 10\u00b0Cmin-1 on a Perkin Elmer Diamond TG/DTA. The compound is thermally stable up to ~300\u00b0C. Above this temperature, the TG curve exhibits two weight loss steps. The first weight loss of 4.08%, between 298 and 340\u00b0C, is attributable to the loss of a coordinating water molecule in the formula unit (calculated: 3.95%). The next significant weight loss of 62.96%, which occurred from 350 to 545\u00b0C, corresponds to the decomposition of the 2,5-pydc and picolinic ligands (calculated: 63.37%). The remaining weight of 32.96% corresponds to the final product, Sm2O3 percentage (32.68%).
