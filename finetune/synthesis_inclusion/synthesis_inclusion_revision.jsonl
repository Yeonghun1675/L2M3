Data were collected on a Siemens SMART diffractometer using Mo K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb=0.71073 \u00c5). An empirical absorption correction based on redundant reflections was applied to the data set. The absolute configuration was unambiguously assigned based on the analysis of the Bijovot pairs and the refinement of the Flack parameter. The absence of inversion center in the structure was also confirmed by MISYM. The refinement of Flack parameter for the chosen configuration gave 0.00020(9) with 5239 reflections where F c(H) and F c(\u2013H) differ by more than 0.0001. The asymmetric unit contains two Cd2+ ions, two 4,4\u2032-bipy ligands, two SO4  2\u2212 anions, and three coordinate and three crystallization water molecules. The metal centers are first linked by the SO4  2\u2212 anions to form the one-dimensional arrays of fused 12-membered rings containing three cadmium, three sulfur and six oxygen atoms (see ). The arrays are drawn together by hydrogen bonding between the coordinate water molecules and the SO4  2\u2212 anions from the adjacent net. The two SO4  2\u2212 anions are split into \u03bc2- and \u03bc3-bridging ligands. Thus, Cd(1) is coordinated by a \u03bc2-SO4  2\u2212, a \u03bc3-SO4  2\u2212 and two cis-H2O molecules while the Cd(2) is linked by a \u03bc2-SO4  2\u2212, two different \u03bc3-SO4  2\u2212 anions and a water. The 4,4\u2032-bipy ligands act as \u2018posts\u2019 that connect the cadmium centers to form the one-dimensional [Cd2(4,4\u2032-bipy)2(H2O)3] n   4+ chains. The coordination of both Cd atoms can best be described as slightly distorted octahedral with four O atoms situated in the square plane and two N atoms occupying the axial positions.  depicts the coordination environments of the two Cd atoms. Rather than being parallel, these chains run across each other from two different directions. Thus, the compound forms three-dimensional interwoven networks as shown in . The most common coordination modes of the SO4  2\u2212 ion are monodentate, bidentate and \u03bc2-bridging, while \u03bc3-bridging is much less frequent . The combination of both \u03bc2- and \u03bc3-bridging in the same structure is hitherto unreported. The fact that 1 crystallizes in a noncentrosymmetric space group can perhaps be attributed to this unusual combination of the two different bridging modes for the SO4  2\u2212 anion. We have noticed that the use of simple, weaker coordinating anions such as NO3  \u2212 and ClO4  \u2212 results in centrosymmetric more often than noncentrosymmetric crystal packing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['solvothermal_synthesis', 'washing']"}]}

Indeed, the pore apertures of MOFs determine the size of the guest molecules, which embodies those functional features as a carrier. In general, the construction of porous structural topologies immensely depends on the organic ligands and the coordination geometry of central metal ions . One successful strategy for making large porous MOFs and avoiding appearance of interpenetration is to construct a framework by the \u201cshort axis \u2013 long axis\u201d mode . The design solution can maintain a short axis with the long organic links inclined to that axis. The short axis by metal\u2013oxygen bonds is the distance between the long organic links of ligand skeleton along that axis joining the secondary building units (SBUs), and effectively eliminates the possibility of framework interpenetration. Conceptually, the main efforts are centered around the choice of suitable organic multicarboxylate ligands . Among various multicarboxylate ligands, asymmetrical carboxylate ligands have been reported rarely in the fabrication of MOFs . Those can be utilized to form large porous MOFs because of their asymmetrical nature in favor of the short axis \u2013 long axis arrangement, in which the organic carbon backbone acts as the longer linkage with the asymmetrical carboxyls leaning against the backbone as the short rods . Meanwhile, the twisted conformations of asymmetrical carboxyl ligands benefit the generation of polynuclear metal clusters for addressing that strategy . "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[]"}]}

Due to the different coordination environment of Cu atoms, the respective paddle-wheel units in 1 and 2, also display some differences, which each bptca4 \u2212 ligand of 1 connects only one paddle-wheel cluster and the cation of 2 does two paddle-wheel clusters.

These 2D layers are linked in the third direction by folded mononuclear Cu(bptc)2 units, to form a 3D nanoporous framework (c). Similar to 1, the framework accommodates infinite open 1D quadrate channels with 11.20\u00c5 caliber (Cu\u2026Cu distance).
