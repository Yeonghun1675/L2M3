And the 0.25 (CH3)2NH of guest comes from the hydrolysis of DMF under high pressure and temperature . TZI3\u2212 ligand coordinates with six mental sites by the coordination mode which can be described as \u03bc\n6-\u03b71: \u03b70: \u03b70: \u03b71: \u03b71: \u03b71: \u03b71: \u03b71 (\na). Its conformation is mode-b by the dihedral is 90.0\u00b0 between the m-benzenedicarboxylate and tetrazolyl ring (). Two kinds of zinc centers (Zn1 and Zn2) are found in the framework. The Zn1 atom is five-coordinated by three oxygen atoms which consist of two carboxylate oxygen atoms from two TZI3\u2212 and one bridging oxygen atom from a \u03bc\n3-OH ligand in the equatorial plane, and two nitrogen atoms from two TZI3\u2212 ligands distribution in the axial position, which forms triangle biconical ZnN2O3 coordination geometry. While the Zn2 atom is six coordinate by four oxygen atoms from two \u03bc\n3-OH ligands, two coordinated water molecules and two nitrogen atoms from two different TZI3\u2212 ligands, forming an octahedral geometry. The Zn\u2013O bond distances are from 1.962(4) to 2.128(6)\u00c5, and the Zn\u2013N bond distances are 2.110(5) and 2.362(5)\u00c5 (). For the interactions between metal sites and ligands described above, triangle [Zn3(\u03bc\n3-OH)] SBU are formed by \u03bc\n3-OH connecting three metal centers (b), these isosceles triangles connected by TZI3\u2212 spacers to form 1D strip-shaped chains further. Adjacent chains linked by m-benzenedicarboxylate groups to form 3D frameworks with 1D rectangular channels (6.5\u00d73.0\u00c52) with taking van der Waals radii into consideration run along the c axis (c). A better insight into the nature of JUC-165 can be achieved by the application of a topological approach, that is, reducing multidimensional structures to simple node-and-linker nets (the Topos4.0 program is a powerful tool for the analysis, comparison, and design of network structures) . As shown in , the trimetallic [Zn3(\u03bc\n3-OH)] SBU can simply be regarded as a 5-connected node since the terminal H2O molecules do not contribute to the network topology. Likewise, each TZI3\u2212 ligand coordinated to five [Zn3(\u03bc\n3-OH)] clusters can act as a 5-connected node. On the basis of the simplification principle, the resulting structure of JUC-165 is a rare binodal five-connected net, and its Schl\u00e4fli symbol is 4664 (d)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['property']"}]}

In this structure, there are five kinds of Cd2+ sites. Among them, Cd1, Cd2, Cd3, Cd5 are all six-coordinated octahedral geometry. For Cd1, it is coordinated by three oxygen atoms from two terminal coordinated waters and one bridging oxygen \u03bc\n3-OH ligand, and three nitrogen atoms from three TZI3\u2212 ligands. The Cd2 atom is coordinated by three oxygen atoms from one \u03bc\n3-OH ligands, two carboxylate oxygen atoms from two TZI3\u2212 ligands and three nitrogen atoms from three different TZI3\u2212 ligands. Cd3 atom is coordinated by five oxygen atoms from one TZI3\u2212 ligand, three terminal coordinated waters and one \u03bc\n3-OH ligand, and one nitrogen atom from one TZI3\u2212 ligand. For Cd5, it is six-coordinated by four oxygen atoms of three TZI3\u2212, one terminal coordinated water oxygen atom, and one nitrogen atom from TZI3\u2212 ligand.

Sample activation is also easier because no high-boiling point solvent is employed. Sorption behaviors of the porous MAFs can be explained by their pore size and surface properties. Due to the complete coordination of nitrogen donors and alkyl-lined pore surface, the imidazolate frameworks MAF-4 and MAF-5 are rare hydrophobic adsorbents with high pore volumes, which can easily adsorb large amount of organic solvent but do not adsorb water even at very high humidity. As the pore size is similar to small aromatic derivatives such as benzene and toluene, MAF-5 is suitable for removal of trace aromatic molecules from water. On the other hand, the large pore MAF-4 exhibits lower adsorption affinity for organic solvents, and significant adsorption arise from capillary condensation. While MAF-7 is isostructural with MAF-4, incorporation of uncoordinated nitrogen donor on the pore surface increases the sorption affinity and lowers the onset pressure of capillary condensation.

Synthetic challenges in this field include controlling the size and size distribution of the nanoparticles and modifying structure . Large nanosized cadmium chalcogenido clusters have not only the definite structures, but also the extremely low limit of the size distribution and high stability. Therefore, a \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach to the synthesis of well defined large cadmium chalcogenido clusters has been recognized as a key to developing the semiconductor quantum dots technologically . These clusters generally fall into three series: supertetrahedral clusters (Tn), pentasupertetrahedral clusters (Pn), and capped tetrahedral clusters (Cn) . The most exploited large size clusters CdQ (Q\u00a0=\u00a0S and Se) are the Cn clusters having 17 , 32 , and 54  cadmium atoms in the clusters (). Besides the potential applications as quantum dots, they could serve as model systems and provide synthetic and structural insights into the formation and properties of nanomaterials.

To verify whether the framework of 1 can be sustained after the removal of the solvent molecules, PXRD patterns were measured (). The framework of 1 still has crystallinity after removing the solvent molecules, but the PXRD pattern of the activated sample is different from the as-synthesized one which may be attributed to the framework dynamics of 1.

Elemental analysis data reveals an empirical formula of Ag(L)NO3, suggesting a 1:1 metal-to-ligand ratio in 1. 1 is poorly soluble in common solvents, and slightly soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The 1HH NMR spectrum of 1 in DMSO-d\n6 reveals only signals identical to those of the free ligand, indicating the decomposition of the complex in DMSO. In the IR spectrum of 1 a strong band at around 1405cm\u22121 appeared due to the coordinated NO3\n\u2212 ions. X-ray structural analysis confirmed the formation of a coordination network involving effective Ag\u2013S binding in the solid state (\n). 1 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Cmc21 and in the asymmetric unit there contains only one half of ligand L, one silver ion and nitrate anion, and the second half of L was generated by symmetry (operation code: \u2212x, y, z). The Flack parameter of crystal 1 having a acentric space group was refined to be \u22120.01(2), indicating 1 crystallizes as an enantiopure form, although achiral ligand was used. It was noticed that as seen in a the ligand molecules in 1 adopt the conformation I and type-A binding mode with two silver(I) centers related by a C\n2 symmetric axis (). Relevant bond parameters around metal centers are summarized in \n. The silver(I) center is tetracoordinate with two sulfur atoms from symmetry-related ligands and two oxygen atoms of the bridging nitrate ions, being in a slightly distorted tetrahedral environment. The Ag-S bond distances are almost identical (2.5185(6) and 2.5186(6)\u00c5, respectively), falling in the range of Ag\u2013S bond lengths reported in the literature , yet the Ag\u2013O bonds are slightly different in length (2.357(3) and 2.533(3)\u00c5). Propagation of the repeat structure unit along the silver(II) centers results in the formation of an infinite 2-D coordination network which is composed of 20-membered macrocycles containing two ligand units, two silver(I) centers and two bridging nitrato-O atoms (b\u00a0and\u00a0c). In each macrocycle, the Ag\u22efAg nonbonding distance between two silver(I) centers bonded to the same ligand is approximately 10.7\u00c5, while the O-bridged Ag\u22efAg nonbonding distance is approximately 4.6\u00c5. The two phenyl rings of ligands in the macrocycle are arranged in an edge-to-face fashion and thus effective C\u2013H\u22ef\u03c0 interaction is observed between the rings. The C\u2013H\u22ef \u03c0 (centroid) distance as illustrated in c is as short as ca. 2.85\u00c5 (c). It is worth mentioning that previously a silver(I) perchlorate complex based on a similar thioether ligand, 1,3-bis(phenylthiomethyl)benzene has been reported, where a structurally related grid-like network was observed . However, the structure of the repeating macrocyclic motif in this network is essentially distinct with that of 1. In the structure reported previously , the silver centers are bridged by two oxygen atoms of the perchlorate anion, and the Ag\u2013O bond distances are relatively longer (2.556(10) and 2.719(4)\u00c5, respectively), indicating weaker bonding interactions. In addition, the phenyl rings in the macrocycle are arranged in a face-to-face mode by \u03c0\u22ef\u03c0 stacking interaction (the distance between two aromatic planes is ca. 3.5\u00c5), in sharp contrast to the C\u2013H\u22ef\u03c0 interactions found in 1 (c)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['property']"}]}

Currently, several extreme interests on MOFs were focused on designing new topological architectures, and pioneers have disclosed many kinds of topological structure, such as NbO, PtS, CdSO4 net, diamond net, rutile net, boracite net, sodalite net, etc.  Carefully checking the structure characters of MOFs, most of them were constructed from the single type of node, and the MOFs assembled from the double type of nodes are relatively less developed, such as the (3, 4) and (3, 6)-connected MOFs . To achieve this goal, the key factor is the choice of suitable organic ligands and metal centers; that is, to achieve the (3, 4)-connected net, one of the best ways is to choose metal centers with a low coordination number such as Zn, Cu, Co as 4-connected nodes and trigonal organic ligands as 3-connected nodes .

These compounds display interesting and versatile coordination features from 3D to 3D parallel entangled frameworks. Topological analysis reveals that 1\u20133 are 3D (4,4)-connected bbf topology net with the (64\u00b782)(66) topology. The adjustable channels size of individual 3D framework is realized by using different lengths of co-ligands from byp to bib with keeping similar architectures of compounds 1\u20133. In compound 3, the assignment of characteristic absorption bands of UV\u2013vis spectra at 580nm correlated with the d-d transitions of Co2+ ions in field of tetrahedral coordination is confirmed by the result of the single-crystal X-ray structure analysis. The solid-state photoluminescent properties of 1 and 2 were investigated, and the emission bands were assigned to the intra-ligand charge transfer (ILCT), and the different emission wavelength due to the effect of co-ligands.

Porous MOFs with high surface areas and tunable structures have recently attracted considerable interest not only for their fascinating architectures and intriguing topologies, but also for their potential applications in sensing, heterogeneous catalysis, gas storage and separation . Flue gases consist of nitrogen (typically more than two-thirds), carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen, and minor components such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur oxides. Economical and efficient CO2 capture and storage (CCS) has been attracting tremendous attention due to the culprit for causing the greenhouse effect . Several technologies have been considered for CO2 capture and separation from nitrogen-rich streams, including absorption, adsorption and membranes separations . In particular, for separation of CO2/N2, because of the relatively similar kinetic diameters of the molecules (3.3 and 3.64\u00c5, respectively), it would require materials operating on a size-selective mechanism to possess very small pores, which may limit the diffusion of gases throughout the material. Therefore, to find a suitable pore size material is a necessary condition for CO2/N2 separation.

The Zn(II) ions show different coordination geometries. The Zn1 (Zn1#5) ion is five coordinated with a distorted pentahedron coordination geometry, which is fulfilled by four oxygen atoms (O1, O2, O4 and O5) originating from three independent 1,4-H2bdc ligands and one nitrogen atom (N1) of the L ligand with the coordination angles varying from 99.9(9)\u00b0 to 121.9(6)\u00b0. The ZnN bond length is 2.004(3) \u00c5, and the lengths of ZnO bonds are 1.975(3) \u00c5, 1.955(3) \u00c5 and 1.930(3) \u00c5, respectively, four oxygen atoms and one nitrogen atom are located on the five vertices of pentahedron, and the Zn1(Zn1#5) is located in the center of pentahedron (\na).

The dihedral angle between one pyridine ring and one anthracene ring in the same L is 63.9\u00b0. The trimers are joined through the scaffolds of 1,4-H2bdc ligands, leading to the formation of a 44\n-sqc\n coordination layer and two trimers in a diagonal position are linked by 1,4-H2bdc (\nd). The L ligand adopts bidentate bridging coordination, linking the 2D layers to form a 3D framework (\ne). Meanwhile, from the topological point of view, Zn2 can be described as 8-connected nodes, and the ligands are regarded as linear linkers.

The coordination complexes with the rational selection and design of conjugated organic spacers with metal centers can be efficient for obtaining new luminescent materials . To investigate the luminescence properties of complexes 1\u20133, the solid-state fluorescent properties of 1\u20133 as well as the ligand L have been studied at room temperature under the same experimental condition and their emission spectra are given in Supplementary 2 . When excited with 390\u00a0nm light, the free L ligand exhibited an emission peak at 470\u00a0nm, which originated from ligand internal change transfer. Upon excitation with 390\u00a0nm light, complexes 1\u20133 all display intense photoluminescence, with emission maxima at 474, 440 and 440\u00a0nm, respectively. Compared with the free L Ligand, the introduction of Zn(II) and Cd(II) to ligand L led to a weak blue-shift for complexes 2 and 3.

In addition, the high-dimensional structures of complexes 2 and 3 lead to significant enhancement of fluorescence intensity compared to that of the free ligand. The enhancement of fluorescence intensity of complexes 1\u20133 can be attributed to the following aspects: firstly, anthracene is a kind of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with strong fluorescence emission; secondly, the ligand coordination to the metal center and increase plane conjugated system of ligands, which the intraligand \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* transition occurs more easily; on the other hand, the ligand rigidity enhancement and thus reduces the loss of energy through a radiationless pathway , however, fluorescence enhancement of complexes 1\u20133."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['property']"}]}

The X-ray powder diffraction (PXRD) of the complexes 1\u20133 demonstrate that they have high phase purity. In addition, we studied thermal stabilities and fluorescent properties of complexes 1\u20133. We believe that this study reveals the effectiveness of general solvothermal processing methods which are influenced by the nature of the solvent and reaction temperature. Because of the multi ring structure of the ligand molecule, the solubility of the ligand is reduced and the difficulty coefficient is enhanced. Complexes 1\u20133 has a novel structure and strong fluorescence properties, which indicated that those complexes can be used as a potential functional materials, for example used in LED lamps.

There is currently a renewed interest in that field because of the nanotechnologies emergence. Actually, the design of nanoporous open frameworks is a factor of this revival  because these compounds are anticipated to exhibit good efficiency as far as size selective separation, catalysis and gas storage are concerned . These potential applications require materials that do not decompose or collapse upon the removal of the guest molecules. Such materials can be obtained by using aromatic poly-carboxylate ligands. Several lanthanide-based coordination polymers involving benzene-poly-carboxylate ligand have already been described , but potentially porous materials are still rather uncommon . In order to increase the intermetallic distances in these materials, we have undertaken the study of naphthalene-poly-carboxylate-based coordination polymers . The two new lanthanide-containing coordination polymers reported below are part of this study.

In this work, the luminescent properties of compounds 1 and 2 as well as the free ligands (H3bpt, H4bptc and Hdatrz) were investigated in the solid state at room temperature. The free H3bpt, H4bptc and Hdatrz ligands display intense emission peaks at 388\u00a0nm (\u03bbex\u00a0=\u00a0345\u00a0nm), 402\u00a0nm (\u03bbex\u00a0=\u00a0345\u00a0nm), 435\u00a0nm (\u03bbex\u00a0=\u00a0340\u00a0nm), respectively, which can be assigned to the \u03c0*-n or \u03c0*-\u03c0 transitions (b). Under the excitation light of 340\u00a0nm, compounds 1 and 2 show broad emission bands centered at 442\u00a0nm and 445\u00a0nm, respectively (a). Notably, the luminescent emission peaks of compounds 1 and 2 are similar to that of free Hdatrz ligand with red-shifts of 7\u00a0nm and 10\u00a0nm, respectively. The absence of the carboxylate-based ligands (H3bpt and H4bptc) emission bands further indicates that the luminescence of compounds 1 and 2 can be attributed to Hdatrz intraligand charge transfer ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['property']"}]}

Thus, Cd(1) is coordinated by a \u03bc2-SO4\n\n2\u2212, a \u03bc3-SO4\n\n2\u2212 and two cis-H2O molecules while the Cd(2) is linked by a \u03bc2-SO4\n\n2\u2212, two different \u03bc3-SO4\n\n2\u2212 anions and a water. The 4,4\u2032-bipy ligands act as \u2018posts\u2019 that connect the cadmium centers to form the one-dimensional [Cd2(4,4\u2032-bipy)2(H2O)3]\nn\n\n\n4+ chains. The coordination of both Cd atoms can best be described as slightly distorted octahedral with four O atoms situated in the square plane and two N atoms occupying the axial positions. \n depicts the coordination environments of the two Cd atoms. Rather than being parallel, these chains run across each other from two different directions. Thus, the compound forms three-dimensional interwoven networks as shown in \n. The most common coordination modes of the SO4\n\n2\u2212 ion are monodentate, bidentate and \u03bc2-bridging, while \u03bc3-bridging is much less frequent . The combination of both \u03bc2- and \u03bc3-bridging in the same structure is hitherto unreported. The fact that 1 crystallizes in a noncentrosymmetric space group can perhaps be attributed to this unusual combination of the two different bridging modes for the SO4\n\n2\u2212 anion. We have noticed that the use of simple, weaker coordinating anions such as NO3\n\n\u2212 and ClO4\n\n\u2212 results in centrosymmetric more often than noncentrosymmetric crystal packing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['property', 'synthesis condition']"}]}

Some compounds based on polynuclear CoII\n\nn\n (n\n=2\u20138) clusters and multicarboxylate have been reported .

Accordingly, it possesses TT, TG, GG and GG\u2032 conformations (T\n=\ntrans, G=\ngauche) owing to the free twist of the propyl group (\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013).

To be specific, the C1 cluster was obtained from the mixed solvent of acetonitrile/H2O (3:1 in volume) at 85\u00a0\u00b0C, while pure acetonitrile and 110\u00a0\u00b0C were suitable for the growth of C2 crystals. The optimized conditions of crystallization of these compounds are described in experimental section. The anion structures of all the six compounds were accurately characterized by X-ray single crystal diffraction. Because there are too many heavy atoms in the large clusters (the largest volume of the cell is about 130 thousands) and the serious disorder of the organic moieties, the cations are not completely solved. The [Ru(Phen/bpy)3]2+ cations or Ru2+ (fragment) are found in all the structures of the compounds. The cations have been further characterized by spectra (460\u00a0nm MLCT band of [Ru(Phen/Bpy)3]2+ cation) and electrospray mass spectrum analysis (m/z: 321.25, ).  shows the TEM images of the aggregated nanoclusters.

Furthermore, parallel and incline interpenetration is exhibited in 2 and 3, respectively, which shows that the small counterion is liable to the entanglement. Finally, different porosity of 4 and 5 reveals that the large counterion is beneficial to porous coordination polymers.

This ligand is similar to pca and ppca in that there exists a terminal and a chelating nitrogen coordination site that can be used for coordinating to metal centers. However, while in the case of pca and ppca the coordination sites are in a linear arrangement with respect to each other, in the case of pytac, the chelating nitrogen is no longer exactly opposite the terminal nitrogen, but rather is oriented approximately perpendicular to it.

Longer length of co-ligand (bib) in compound 2 and 3 than that of co-ligand (bpy) in compound 1 resulted in that compound 2 and 3 exhibit larger channels of individual 3D frameworks in size (18.1567\u00c5\u00d724.0957\u00c5) than those (15.0977\u00c5\u00d722.2255\u00c5) of compound 1. Correspondingly, compound 2 and 3 with larger channels size accommodate more H2O molecules than compound 1. The 3D grid allows each frameworks to be penetrated by two other independent frameworks to form the interesting 3D 3-fold interpenetrating frameworks with isolated water molecules occupying the neutral channels ((b), S5)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['else']"}]}

As far as the construction of cluster polymers is concerned, on the one hand, the inorganic salts being prone to form the clusters, such as oxides, halides or sulfides are usually used as the inorganic precursors to form inorganic subunits (SUs) . On the other hand, the literature show that three types of bridges can extend the inorganic SUs into poly-nuclear or high-dimensional (D) cluster polymers: (i) inorganic bridge. With various organic ammines as guest species or organic templating agents, the SUs interact with each other through covalent M\u2013O (X or S) bonds (or through sharing the corner, edge or/and face) between the SUs, producing new polymeric clusters. This is the basic constructing conception of zeolite and zeolite-like materials . (ii) Organic bridge, the most common method. Up to now, lots of bridging organic ligands with N/O/S donors have been chosen to extend the SUs into the 1-D, 2-D, 3-D cluster polymers via covalent interactions or a combination of covalent and non-covalent interactions . (iii) Metal complex bridge. This strategy has been extensively adopted when preparing high-D poly-acids . Some recent reports show that it is being extended to the construction of metal\u2013halo cluster polymers ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['else']"}]}
