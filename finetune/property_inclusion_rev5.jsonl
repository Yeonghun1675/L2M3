And the 0.25 (CH3)2NH of guest comes from the hydrolysis of DMF under high pressure and temperature . TZI3\\u2212 ligand coordinates with six mental sites by the coordination mode which can be described as \\u03bc\\n6-\\u03b71: \\u03b70: \\u03b70: \\u03b71: \\u03b71: \\u03b71: \\u03b71: \\u03b71 (\\na). Its conformation is mode-b by the dihedral is 90.0\\u00b0 between the m-benzenedicarboxylate and tetrazolyl ring (). Two kinds of zinc centers (Zn1 and Zn2) are found in the framework. The Zn1 atom is five-coordinated by three oxygen atoms which consist of two carboxylate oxygen atoms from two TZI3\\u2212 and one bridging oxygen atom from a \\u03bc\\n3-OH ligand in the equatorial plane, and two nitrogen atoms from two TZI3\\u2212 ligands distribution in the axial position, which forms triangle biconical ZnN2O3 coordination geometry. While the Zn2 atom is six coordinate by four oxygen atoms from two \\u03bc\\n3-OH ligands, two coordinated water molecules and two nitrogen atoms from two different TZI3\\u2212 ligands, forming an octahedral geometry. The Zn\\u2013O bond distances are from 1.962(4) to 2.128(6)\\u00c5, and the Zn\\u2013N bond distances are 2.110(5) and 2.362(5)\\u00c5 (). For the interactions between metal sites and ligands described above, triangle [Zn3(\\u03bc\\n3-OH)] SBU are formed by \\u03bc\\n3-OH connecting three metal centers (b), these isosceles triangles connected by TZI3\\u2212 spacers to form 1D strip-shaped chains further. Adjacent chains linked by m-benzenedicarboxylate groups to form 3D frameworks with 1D rectangular channels (6.5\\u00d73.0\\u00c52) with taking van der Waals radii into consideration run along the c axis (c). A better insight into the nature of JUC-165 can be achieved by the application of a topological approach, that is, reducing multidimensional structures to simple node-and-linker nets (the Topos4.0 program is a powerful tool for the analysis, comparison, and design of network structures) . As shown in , the trimetallic [Zn3(\\u03bc\\n3-OH)] SBU can simply be regarded as a 5-connected node since the terminal H2O molecules do not contribute to the network topology. Likewise, each TZI3\\u2212 ligand coordinated to five [Zn3(\\u03bc\\n3-OH)] clusters can act as a 5-connected node. On the basis of the simplification principle, the resulting structure of JUC-165 is a rare binodal five-connected net, and its Schl\\u00e4fli symbol is 4664 (d)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['crystal_system', 'space_group', 'topology']"}]}

Compound 1 crystallizes in the F-43c space group. In 1, tpt ligands and metal ions assembled into eight interpenetrating (10,3)-a networks which has been observed in Zn(tpt)2/3(SiF6)(H2O)2(MeOH) as reported by B.F. Abrahams et al. . However, the coordinated SiF6\\n2- anion in the reported architecture was replaced with one dehydrogenized carboxyl from H4bpta, and the coordination sphere of the six coordinated Ni(II) center was accomplished with two water molecules and one hydroxyl group. The Ni\\u2013O bond lengths vary from 2.049(3) to 2.088(3)\\u00c5, and the Ni\\u2013N bond lengths range from 2.093(2) to 2.108(3)\\u00c5. Benefiting from its structure characteristic, each bpa4\\u2212 joint two left- and two right-handed individual chiral (10,3)-a subnets together by coordinating to Ni(II) ions from the corresponding subnets. As the individual (10,3)-a subnets interconnected by bpa4- ligands, a complicated three dimensional porous framework was achieved. In the structural view, the discrete networks were banded together and the eight interpenetrating (10,3)-a topology was modified by the connectivity increased from the presenting of bpa4\\u2212 ligands. To simplify and realize the structure of 1, bpa4\\u2212 ligand could be viewed as four connected vertex and the stacking tpt ligands could be viewed as triangle building blocks (a), then the overall structure could be simplified into a network bearing bor topology (b). According to the topology of the framework, the free volume found in the framework of 1 could be divided into chambers and channels, separately. In the octahedron double-wall chambers raised from the connection of four triangle building blocks and six vertexes, the dimension between the opposite vertexes is about 21.3\\u00c5 and the triangle window formed has 10.2\\u00c5 length edge, slightly bigger than the similar reported coordination cage .

The average wavelength of the hypersensitive band of Sm3+ (6H5/2\\n\\u2192\\n6F1/2) is 5921cm\\u22121 for maleate and 6250cm\\u22121 for fumarate. The increase of the covalency of the Sm\\u2013O bonds is noticeable through the visible growth of the intensity of the hypersensitive transition when going from fumarate to maleate (see ). This relation between the increasing of covalency and the higher intensities of hypersensitive transitions has been postulated very often . This kind of relation is possible to compare in a simple way when the coordination number (C.N.=9) is the same for both systems (see )."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['peak_spectrum']"}]}

The asymmetric unit contains two Cd2+ ions, two 4,4\\u2032-bipy ligands, two SO4\\n\\n2\\u2212 anions, and three coordinate and three crystallization water molecules. The metal centers are first linked by the SO4\\n\\n2\\u2212 anions to form the one-dimensional arrays of fused 12-membered rings containing three cadmium, three sulfur and six oxygen atoms (see \\n). The arrays are drawn together by hydrogen bonding between the coordinate water molecules and the SO4\\n\\n2\\u2212 anions from the adjacent net. The two SO4\\n\\n2\\u2212 anions are split into \\u03bc2- and \\u03bc3-bridging ligands. Thus, Cd(1) is coordinated by a \\u03bc2-SO4\\n\\n2\\u2212, a \\u03bc3-SO4\\n\\n2\\u2212 and two cis-H2O molecules while the Cd(2) is linked by a \\u03bc2-SO4\\n\\n2\\u2212, two different \\u03bc3-SO4\\n\\n2\\u2212 anions and a water. The 4,4\\u2032-bipy ligands act as \\u2018posts\\u2019 that connect the cadmium centers to form the one-dimensional [Cd2(4,4\\u2032-bipy)2(H2O)3]\\nn\\n\\n\\n4+ chains. The coordination of both Cd atoms can best be described as slightly distorted octahedral with four O atoms situated in the square plane and two N atoms occupying the axial positions. \\n depicts the coordination environments of the two Cd atoms. Rather than being parallel, these chains run across each other from two different directions. Thus, the compound forms three-dimensional interwoven networks as shown in \\n.

The combination of both \\u03bc2- and \\u03bc3-bridging in the same structure is hitherto unreported. The fact that 1 crystallizes in a noncentrosymmetric space group can perhaps be attributed to this unusual combination of the two different bridging modes for the SO4\\n\\n2\\u2212 anion.

The asymmetric coordination unit comprises one Zn(II), one and a half independent 2-eiba ligands, and a half-occupied hydroxide ions. As shown in a, each Zn(II) is coordinated by four O atoms from two 2-eiba ligands and one hydroxide ion, and one N atom from another 2-eiba ligand. The coordination geometry of the Zn center (\\u03c4=0.48) can be portrayed as a distorted polyhedron between trigonal bipyramid and square pyramid, where the \\u03c4 values of the ideal trigonal bipyramid and square pyramid are defined as 1 and 0, respectively . A pair of ZnII centers are interconnected by the \\u03bc2-hydroxyl and \\u03bc2-COO\\u2013 bridges to form a [Zn2(COO)(OH)] secondary building unit (SBU), with the Zn\\u22efZn separation of 3.292(2) \\u00c5. As for the 2-eiba ligands, they show the bridging and terminal linking role to connect the binuclear Zn(II) SBU, respectively. In this way, a grid-like layered coordination net (14.25\\u00d714.25\\u00c52), being extended through 2-eiba ligands, is formed (b). This 2D pattern is considerably undulated and of further importance, decorated with the unidentate 2-eiba pendants as side arms at single side. Interestingly, these long prominent arms, with a length of ca.7.824\\u00c5 between the pyridyl N atom and carboxylate C atom, penetrate into the grids of two adjacent layers to build a 3D polythreading supramolecular architecture with finite components . In fact, each lateral 2-eiba arm goes through two parallel grids and forms a OH\\u22efN hydrogen bond with the third one (O\\u22efN=2.759\\u00c5, H\\u22efN=1.91\\u00c5, \\u2220OH\\u22efN=172\\u00b0) (c). Thus, if these H-bonding interactions are also taken into account, [Zn2(COO)(OH)] SBUs behave as 6-connected nodes and 2-eiba ligands act as bridges. Then three uniform 3D networks are generated, which are 3-fold interpenetrating (d and e). In view of topological simplification, a single net is isolated and classified as a pcu net ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['chemical_formula_weight', 'crystal_system', 'space_group', 'lattice_parameters', 'density', 'topology']"}]}

To verify whether the framework of 1 can be sustained after the removal of the solvent molecules, PXRD patterns were measured (). The framework of 1 still has crystallinity after removing the solvent molecules, but the PXRD pattern of the activated sample is different from the as-synthesized one which may be attributed to the framework dynamics of 1. The crystalline solid of 1 can be re-generated by immersing the activated sample in 10mL DMF for 12h as indicated by the PXRD measurements () . The results show that the host framework of complex 1 is flexible enough to change its structure depending on the nature of the guest molecules, and the framework transformations are reversible. While complex 2 shows good crystallinity after removing the guest water molecules and the PXRD pattern of the activated sample shifts and becomes broad compared with the as-synthesized one (), therefore, the gas sorption isotherms of 1 and 2 are investigated.

The obviously larger electron density of NiRu-HTP near E f than that of Ni-HTP implies a higher electrical conductivity, which is confirmed by the conductivity measurements in Figure S9. In addition, the fully symmetric electron state densities of Ni-HTP indicate that the Ni atoms are of low spin with no single electron. In NiRu-HTP, the electron state densities near E f are asymmetric and spin-polarized, which is attributed to the plentiful single electrons on Ru atoms, contributing to the gas adsorption and activation.

The tolerance of MOFs linked by Zr4+-based clusters towards harsh chemical and mechanical conditions makes them ideal platforms for introducing functionalities employing PSLE, and MOF-808 is itself a robust system with a wide pore arrangement. The resulting functionalized MOF showed structural retention and affinity towards heavy-metal ions such as Cd2+ in aqueous media. In situ growth of CdS NPs inside the MOF pores was realized at elevated temperatures under mild reaction conditions. Moreover, it is well established that the Zr4+ cluster is capable of acting as a cocatalyst for photocatalytic water splitting or CO2 reduction. Therefore, the confinement of CdS NPs in the MOF nanopores in close proximity to the Zr4+ cluster not only opens up a facile and shorter electron transfer channel that suppresses electron-hole recombination but also stabilizes the catalytic system by preventing self-agglomeration and photobleaching ().

The adamantane cage, having an internal pore diameter of 16.1 \u00c5, is formed by the tetrahedral cages acting as the vertices. To balance the charge, the coordination of the SBU is completed with five exchangeable formate ligands that are well-directed toward the spacious adamantane cage. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of the as-synthesized MOF-808 (a) exhibited two peaks at 8.6 and 9.9\u00b0, typical of MOF-808. Importantly, the observed pattern demonstrated unshifted peaks when compared with the simulated pattern obtained from its single-crystal structure analysis. The as-synthesized MOF-808 was also characterized employing FT-IR spectroscopy (Figure S1) and 1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure S2). The morphology of MOF-808 was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), wherein octahedral particles of size around 200-250 nm were observed (d). The lattice fringe spacing calculated was 1.64 nm, which is typical for MOF-808, and the result is consistent with the pore size obtained from the non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) methods based on N2 adsorption data at 77 K (d inset). N2 adsorption study (at 77 K) was performed to validate the permanent porosity of MOF-808 (b). The BET surface area was 2418 m2 g-1, which is in good agreement with the previous reports of Zr4+-based MOF-808. The high internal surface area, large cavity size, excellent stability in aqueous solutions, and, most importantly, the presence of appropriately oriented and exchangeable formate ions on the Zr6 cluster makes Zr4+-based MOF-808 an ideal platform for postsynthetic modification with l-cys. The robustness of the structure of MOF-808 after functionalizing with l-cys was confirmed by PXRD studies (a), where similar peak positions were observed when compared with the pristine MOF-808. 1H NMR studies of alkaline digested MOF-808 exhibited two characteristic peaks at chemical shift values of 8.28 and 8.20 ppm corresponding to the protons of benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate (BTC) and formate ligands. The peak integration ratio of these two peaks confirmed the presence of six BTC and five formate units in the framework. However, for MOF-808-cys, this resulting ratio indicated the presence of six BTC units and one formate unit, thereby confirming the successful exchange of four formate ligands by l-cys (Figure S4). The FT-IR spectra for MOF-808-cys showed two new peaks at 2310 and 1190 cm-1 corresponding to the S-H and C-N symmetric stretching, respectively, further confirming the presence of the l-cys molecule in the MOF-808 framework (Figure S3). TEM images of MOF-808-cys (e,f) reveal an octahedral morphology, thereby confirming no significant change in morphology upon covalent grafting of l-cys. The presence of S and N in the elemental mapping of MOF-808-cys (g and S5) also illustrates the incorporation of l-cys into the framework."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['surface_area']"}]}

This peak at 410 nm was attributed to the charge transfer from the valence band (VB) primarily having the 3p character of the S atom to the empty CB, which majorly has the 5s character of the Cd2+ center. Interestingly, CdS is one of the most prominent visible-light-responsive semiconductor photocatalysts for solar-fuel generation due to its efficient visible-light absorption and excellent carrier transport capacity. Herein, the band gap of CdS1@MOF-808 was calculated to be 2.60 eV from the Tauc plot (Figure S19), thereby suggesting a narrow band gap that is suitable for visible-light-driven photocatalysis as opposed to the wide band gap of around 4.02 eV observed for MOF-808-cys (Figure S18). The flat band potential and, consequently, the relative alignment of the VB and CB were evaluated from the Mott-Schottky plots (b,c). The observed flat band potential of the sample is -0.51 V. The suitable band alignment and narrow band gap of CdS1@MOF-808 enthused us to study its photocatalytic activity for the visible-light-driven hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by water reduction. Herein, the photocatalytic activity of an aqueous dispersion of CdS1@MOF-808 was evaluated under visible-light (\u03bb > 400 nm) irradiation by employing triethylamine (TEA) as the sacrificial agent, and the time course for H2 evolution was monitored by gas chromatography (d). After a period of 12 h, 1.01 mmol g-1 H2 evolved. To enhance the photocatalytic activity of the nanocomposites even further, the wt % of CdS formed was enhanced to 1.84 and 3.56% by increasing the concentration of the Cd2+ aqueous solution to 50 and 150 ppm, and the samples were named CdS2@MOF-808 and CdS4@MOF-808, respectively. The robustness of the structure of these two samples was verified by PXRD analysis (Figure S16). In line with the morphological analysis of CdS1@MOF-808, CdS NPs of 1-2 nm diameter were found confined inside the MOF pores and not on the exterior surface of the MOF for both CdS2@MOF-808 and CdS4@MOF-808 (d, S20, and S21). However, further drastically increasing the concentration of the aqueous solution of Cd2+ to 0.1 M led to the formation of larger CdS NPs (size ~ 20 nm) on the MOF surface (Figure S22), and therefore, the CdS loading inside the pore was not amplified beyond what was obtained for CdS4@MOF-808. Both CdS2@MOF-808 and CdS4@MOF-808 showed similar absorption spectra and flat band potential (Figures S23 and S24) as that observed for CdS1@MOF-808, and hence, the photocatalytic activities of these two samples were tested subsequently. The amount of H2 evolved after 12 h of reaction shot up from 2.42 to 125.79 mmol g-1 for CdS2@MOF-808 and CdS4@MOF-808, respectively (d,f). Recyclability of CdS1@MOF-808, CdS2@MOF-808, and CdS4@MOF-808 as photocatalysts was tested under similar reaction conditions by degassing the samples after every 4 h cycle. The photocatalytic performances of all samples were consistent even after 4 cycles (e and S25) and hence were rendered extremely stable. Notably, CdS4@MOF-808 demonstrated an extremely high photocatalytic activity with a rate of 10.41 mmol g-1 h-1. Raman spectroscopy is an extremely effective tool to study small changes corresponding to the local environment of the molecule, chemical bond, and so forth. The Raman peak observed at 303 cm-1 for the pristine CdS NPs corresponds to the first-order longitudinal optical phonon (A1-LO) scattering from the CdS NPs (Figure S26). Interestingly, in case of CdS4@MOF-808, this peak shifted to a higher energy value at 401 cm-1. This could possibly be attributed to the freezing of several degrees of rotational and vibrational freedom owing to the confinement inside the MOF nanopores. After 12 h of photocatalytic reaction, the Raman spectrum of CdS4@MOF-808 showed no changes for the peak corresponding to CdS and for the MOF peaks, thereby suggesting no change in its chemical composition and interaction of the elements. The surface charge of CdS4@MOF-808 was analyzed by \u03b6-potential measurements before and after photocatalysis (Figure S27). CdS4@MOF-808 shows an intense peak at a \u03b6-potential value 0 mV, indicating the fact that the net surface charge on the MOF is neutral. A similar phenomenon is observed for the sample after 12 h of photocatalytic reaction, thereby signifying no change in the surface charge of the MOF. The photocatalytic activity of CdS4@MOF-808 was analyzed in basic (TEA), acidic (l-ascorbic acid), and neutral (methanol) media (Figure S28). Since the H2 evolution activity observed in basic media was the highest, further HER studies were carried out in basic media using TEA as the sacrificial agent. In order to confirm the photocatalytic HER by CdS4@MOF-808, several control studies were carried out under varying reaction conditions (Figure S29). No H2 evolution was observed from a visible-light irradiated mixture of H2O and TEA, thereby ruling out the possibility of any H2 generation from the solvent or sacrificial agent. Negligible H2 was evolved using bare MOF-808-cys or even MOF-808-cys-Cd, where Cd2+ ions are simply coordinated to the l-cys moiety under visible-light irradiation using TEA as the sacrificial agent. This, in turn, highlights the importance of formation of CdS NPs inside the MOF for efficient photosensitizing, which is crucial for photocatalysts. Finally, the lack of H2 generation by CdS4@MOF-808 in the dark with otherwise similar reaction conditions confirms the photocatalytic nature of the HER. The apparent quantum efficiency after irradiation at 400 nm was calculated to be 3.28% for CdS4@MOF-808 (see Supporting Information for detailed calculation). HER tests using CdS4@MOF-808 were also performed for a time course of 36 h to demonstrate consistent performance and long-term stability of the photocatalyst (Figure S30). Intactness of the pristine MOF structure was confirmed by PXRD analysis, and the morphological stability of CdS4@MOF-808 was confirmed by TEM analysis, wherein no agglomeration or leaching of CdS NPs were observed (Figures S31 and S32). The H2 evolution activity of CdS4@MOF-808 without an external photosensitizer or cocatalyst was more or less equal to or greater than several recently reported NP-MOF composite photocatalysts (Table S2)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['peak_spectrum', 'etc']"}]}

In this context, it was observed that photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the CdS moiety to the empty LUMO of the Zr4+ cluster of MOF-808-cys could open up a catalytic path for manifesting in excellent photocatalytic activity of the system. Confinement of CdS NPs in close proximity to the catalytic center, that is, the Zr4+ cluster, helps dock and separate electron-hole pairs by opening up a shorter electron transfer route, resulting in stabilization of the excited-state electron and rendering it more available for catalytic reactions. To study this phenomenon in detail, a comparative study was carried out between two photocatalytic systems, CdS4@MOF-808 and CdS/MOF-808-cys, having different locations of CdS NPs in the MOF-808 (Figure S33). Unlike CdS4@MOF-808, in case of CdS/MOF-808-cys, the presynthesized CdS NPs of 1-2 nm were stabilized on the surface of MOF-808-cys. From ICP-OES analysis, the amount of CdS present in CdS/MOF-808-cys was found to be 3.82 wt %, which is almost equal to that observed for CdS4@MOF-808. TEM images of CdS/MOF-808-cys showed the presence of CdS NPs on the external surface of the MOF (e). The photocatalytic activity observed for CdS/MOF-808-cys (0.15 mmol g-1 h-1) (f) was almost 60 times lower compared to that observed for CdS4@MOF-808. Recyclability tests demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity of CdS/MOF-808-cys gradually decreases with each cycle (Figure S25). Although the crystalline MOF structure remains intact post-photocatalytic reaction (Figure S34), considerably large agglomerations of CdS NPs on the MOF surface were observed for CdS/MOF-808-cys (Figures S38-S40). However, CdS NPs in CdS4@MOF-808 continued to maintain a uniform dispersion inside the MOF pores, as validated from TEM and FESEM images (Figures S35-S37). This further accentuates the fact that in an unconfined state, CdS NPs tend to agglomerate and undergo photobleaching, thereby reducing the overall photocatalytic activity of the system. To gain an insight into the factors responsible for such differential activity of the two samples, photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies were carried out. The photocurrent response (a) of the as-prepared samples was examined in a three-electrode photoelectrochemical cell with multiple 30 s on-off cycles under visible-light irradiation. CdS4@MOF-808 exhibited a much higher current density as compared to CdS/MOF-808-cys, suggesting a large separation rate of the photoinduced electron-hole pairs, and consequentially, higher efficiency of charge transfer from CdS to the MOF in the former was conjectured. The EIS-Nyquist plot of CdS4@MOF-808 (b) demonstrated a smaller circular radius than that of CdS/MOF-808-cys, therefore indicating a lower charge-transfer resistance of the former sample. Moreover, the photocurrent response and EIS analysis of MOF-808-cys individually revealed negligible charge transfer, thereby emphasizing the importance of CdS in this system for any PET process to occur, and most importantly, the enhanced charge-transfer efficiency of CdS4@MOF-808 compared to CdS/MOF-808-cys solely arises from the confinement of the CdS NPs inside the MOF pores. Furthermore, photophysical studies were employed to investigate the efficiency of charge carrier trapping and transfer in the photocatalysts. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of both CdS4@MOF-808 and CdS/MOF-808-cys (c) showed a peak at 504 nm corresponding to the radiative recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes. However, significant quenching of PL intensity was observed for CdS4@MOF-808 as compared to that of CdS/MOF-808-cys, indicating that the former showed enhanced separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The lifetime of the charge carriers was studied via luminescence decay measurements (d and Table S3), wherein CdS4@MOF-808 demonstrated a shortened lifetime value of 2.02 ns as compared to CdS/MOF-808-cys, which has a lifetime of 4.03 ns. To further understand the charge-transfer kinetics of the photogenerated electrons and origin of higher current density in CdS4@MOF-808 than CdS/MOF-808-cys observed in EIS studies, femtosecond TA experiments were performed. The TA spectra of CdS/MOF-808-cys in the visible region for different times are shown in Figure S41a. At initial time, the spectra of the sample showed a negative TA band (B1) with a peak ~480 nm and a broad negative band (B2) spanning over 520-700 nm. The TA spectra of the sample also revealed a positive absorption band (A1) below 440 nm. Following the literature report, B1, B2, and A1 bands are assigned to the exciton bleach due to the state filling of the 1S(e) level at the CB of CdS, stimulated emission, and the excitonic absorption due to the presence of multiple excitons, respectively. Significant quenching of all three bands in the presence of methyl viologen clearly indicates that an electron rather than a hole mainly contributes to these spectral bands (Figure S41b). Since the excitonic bleach band B1 represents the population of the electron in the 1S(e) state, its dynamics corresponds to the depopulation of the electron at the CB. Hence, to understand the fate of electrons, the dynamics of the B1 band has been analyzed. The fitting of B1 band decay kinetics results in the decay time constants of 0.83 ps (33%), 21 ps (53%), and 3.12 ns (14%) for CdS/MOF-808-cys. The two fast decay time constants are due to the trapping of the electron in the shallow and deep trap state, respectively. The longest lifetime (3.12 ns) is due to the recombination of the CB edge electron with the trapped hole. A similar TA spectral feature has been observed for CdS4@MOF-808 (e) except that the B1 band is centered at ~460 nm than 480 nm in CdS/MOF-808-cys. Such difference in the spectral position is due to the agglomeration of CdS NPs in CdS/MOF-808-cys. The kinetics of the B1 band for CdS4@MOF-808 has been compared with CdS/MOF-808-cys, and the result is shown in f. Similar analysis of the B1 band for CdS4@MOF-808 results in the decay time constants of 0.22 ps (44%), 13.2 ps (31%), and 384 ps (25%). Hence, the lifetime of excitonic electrons in the CB of CdS NPs reduces significantly due to its incorporation inside the MOF cavity as compared to the CdS NPs residing on the external surface of the MOF. This result is also in accordance with the significant quenching of PL and shorter PL lifetime in CdS4@MOF-808 than CdS/MOF-808-cys."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['peak_spectrum', 'etc']"}]}

Before this step, the water adsorbed is likely due to cluster adsorption around the open metal sites. For 1, the onset of pore filling is concurrent with pore collapse and structural rearrangement, as evidenced by the much lower total uptake of 0.389 gH2O gMOF -1, a powder X-ray diffraction pattern consistent with largely amorphous material (Figure S1), and a greatly reduced apparent surface area (Figure S2). In contrast, 2 and 3 exhibit large and steep uptake steps as their pores are filled with water. These materials remain crystalline after water sorption and retain their high BET surface areas of 1912 m2 g-1 and 1762 m2 g-1, respectively (Figures S3-S6). At 94% RH, the total water uptakes for 2 and 3 are 0.968 g g-1 and 0.766 g g-1, respectively (A). The lack of hysteresis between adsorption and desorption indicates continuous reversible pore filling rather than irreversible capillary condensation. The uptake of water between 10% and 30% RH is referred to as the deliverable capacity because uptake in this region is due to a process with a high enough driving force to be useful in AWG and AHP applications, while allowing low-temperature regeneration. B illustrates the superiority of 2, on a material basis in this humidity range, as compared to other MOFs and zeolites that have been investigated for their water uptake properties."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['surface_area', 'gas_adsorption']"}]}

The heat of adsorption for water in 2, determined by variable temperature water sorption isotherms fitted to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, is approximately 55 kJ mol-1 at zero coverage and falls to 45.8 kJ mol-1 during pore filling (Figure S7). The latter is closer to the heat of vaporization for water, 40.7 kJ mol-1, and indicates that water-water interactions are dominant during pore filling. The variable temperature water sorption isotherms also allow the calculation of a characteristic curve, which converts the independent pressure and temperature variables governing uptake into a single parameter related to the Gibbs free energy of adsorption (see the Supporting Information). In turn, the characteristic curve allows for the extrapolation of an isotherm at a given temperature to temperature and pressure values relevant for various devices. The characteristic curve for 2 (Figure S8) was validated by measuring water vapor isotherms at 283, 293, and 298 K (Figure S9).

Notably, the water-2 working pair has the highest COP for any fluid-adsorbent combination across a wide range of desorption temperatures. The high COP for this material is a direct result of its unusually high gravimetric water capacity: very little energy is expended on heating the adsorbent because less solid is required for a given water capacity relative to other adsorbents. Compound 2 is stable to cycling under AHP conditions as well (C).

An illustration of this highly ordered arrangement of CO2 in the NP form is provided in Figure b, where one might assume a smectic-like order with an interlayer distance of about 8.6 \u00c5 corresponding to the interpore length along the y axis.

The asymmetric unit of 2 contains one and a half crystallographically unique Cu atoms, one hpdc3- anion, three coordinated ammonia molecules occupying four different lattice sites, a half of coordinated water molecule, and two independent half-occupied lattice water molecules. The Cu1 atom shows similar coordination environment and linkage to those in 1, but exhibits a distorted square-pyramidal geometry (\u03c4=0.28), accompanied by a slight change in the N-Cu-O chelate bite angles (78.32\u00b0 and 81.84\u00b0), and the dihedral angle between adjacent pyrimidine rings (72.87\u00b0) ( ). The Cu2 atom is located in a nearly perfect square-pyramidal geometry (\u03c4=0.09), coordinated by four ammonia molecules in equatorial positions and one water molecule with longer bond directed toward the axial position (Fig. S1). The bridge modes of 1D polymer chain in 2 are identical to that in 1 but the nearest Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu distance slightly extends to 6.06\u00c5. Due to the existence of the cationic unit involving the Cu2 atom, [Cu(NH3)4(H2O)]2+, the 1D polymer chain built up by pentacoordinated Cu1 atom should be negatively charged in order to achieve charge balance within the whole crystal. In this case, it is considered that the hydrogen atom on the hydroxyl group of the H3hpdc molecule might be further removed to contribute an additional negative charge to chain-like polymer during the molecular assembly. Different from 1, in which the hydroxyl group associates with three carboxylate oxygen atoms of adjacent Hhpdc2- ligands through one lattice ammonia molecule based on hydrogen bonding interactions (the N\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O distances: 2.79-2.88\u00c5), no appropriate hydrogen bonding interaction (the N\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O or O\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O distances: <3.0\u00c5) with the hydroxyl oxygen atom can be observed in 2. Furthermore, the IR spectrum (Fig. S2) of 2 exhibits an additional peak at about 1684cm-1, which is characteristic for the exocyclic carbonyl bond (CO) stretching vibration . Therefore, a carbonyl (oxo) tautomeric form is considered to exist predominantly in 2 after deprotonation of the hydroxyl group.

Thermal analyses showed mass loss even at low temperatures as 50\u00b0C, suggesting the presence of weakly bonded water molecules. This characteristic is especially remarkable in compound 1, and seems to be responsible for the slight disagreement in the elemental analysis results. In fact, when solids are stored is a desiccator over silica, the TGA showed that, at least, two water molecules are not present anymore. For compounds 2, 3, and 4, the loss of mass involved a well defined two-steps process ( ). The first corresponds to crystallization water (12 molecules for 2 at 62\u00b0C, 12 molecules for 3 at 80\u00b0C, and 3 molecules for 4 at 100\u00b0C). The second loss of weight corresponds to coordinated water molecules (6 for complexes 2 - 4 at 202, 220, and 210\u00b0C, respectively).

Previously, the reaction was conducted without catalyst under the same conditions. No appreciable aniline conversion was detected in this case. However, by using the coordination polymer, it could be observed that the compound 1 was very active ( ), practically promoting the complete conversion of aniline (91.9%). Regarding the reaction selectivity, compound 1 preferentially catalyzed the formation of azobenzene (45.9% of selectivity), with some concomitant formation of nitrosobenzene, nitrobenzene and azoxybenzene as secondary products. The phenylhydroxylamine production was not detected. This result indicates that phenylhydroxylamine oxidizes to nitrosobenzene and further to nitrobenzene. In the course of the reaction, however, intermediate phenylhydroxylamine can react with aniline or nitrosobenzene to form azobenzene or azoxybenzene and the unconverted aniline can also react with nitrosobenzene by condensation to form azobenzene, which can also be oxidized to form azoxybenzene ( ) . In order to further examine the catalytic properties, we have investigated the conversion for the oxidation of aniline and the products selectivity, using only Cu(NO3)2 as catalyst under the same reaction conditions. The result showed that the Cu(NO3)2 led to a much lower aniline conversion (about 12%) relative to the compound 1. The Cu(NO3)2 catalyst displayed curious behavior in terms of selectivity, leading to the preferentially formation of N-phenylformamide (a product from the formylation of aniline) probably due to the acidity of the reaction medium, and only traces of nitrobenzene .

Coordinatively unsaturated Mg2+ cations lining the 18.4-\u00c5-diameter channels of 2 were functionalized with N,N'-dimethylethylenediamine (mmen) to afford Mg2(dobpdc)(mmen)1.6(H2O)0.4 (mmen-Mg2(dobpdc)). This compound displays an exceptional capacity for CO2 adsorption at low pressures, taking up 2.0 mmol/g (8.1 wt %) at 0.39 mbar and 25 \u00b0C, conditions relevant to removal of CO2 from air, and 3.14 mmol/g (12.1 wt %) at 0.15 bar and 40 \u00b0C, conditions relevant to CO2 capture from flue gas. Dynamic gas adsorption/desorption cycling experiments demonstrate that mmen-Mg2(dobpdc) can be regenerated upon repeated exposures to simulated air and flue gas mixtures, with cycling capacities of 1.05 mmol/g (4.4 wt %) after 1 h of exposure to flowing 390 ppm CO2 in simulated air at 25 \u00b0C and 2.52 mmol/g (9.9 wt %) after 15 min of exposure to flowing 15% CO2 in N2 at 40 \u00b0C. The purity of the CO2 removed from dry air and flue gas in these processes was estimated to be 96% and 98%, respectively. As a flue gas adsorbent, the regeneration energy was estimated through differential scanning calorimetry experiments to be 2.34 MJ/kg CO2 adsorbed. Overall, the performance characteristics of mmen-Mg2(dobpdc) indicate it to be an exceptional new adsorbent for CO2 capture, comparing favorably with both amine-grafted silicas and aqueous amine solutions.\n\nPowder X-ray Diffraction\n\nPowder X-ray diffraction data were collected with either a Rigaku Ultima III or a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer using Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 1.5406 \u00c5). The unit cell dimensions of DEF-2 and mmen-2 were determined by performing a full-pattern decomposition using the Le Bail method, as implemented in TOPAS-Academic. Owing to the isomorphism with Zn2(dobpdc), the trigonal space group P3221 was used for the refinements. Crystal data for DEF-2: a = 21.761(2) \u00c5, c = 6.9721(7) \u00c5, V = 2859.1(5) \u00c53 (R wp = 0.093, R p = 0.067). Crystal data for mmen-2: a = 21.500(2) \u00c5, c = 6.8275(9) \u00c5, V = 2733.2(6) \u00c53 (R wp = 0.042, R p = 0.033).\n\nThe synthesis and structure of mmen-2 is depicted schematically at the right of Figure . An activated sample of 2 was suspended in hexanes and an excess of mmen was added. As shown by powder X-ray diffraction (see ), framework crystallinity was not significantly affected by activation or subsequent amine functionalization. A much reduced BET surface area of 70 m2/g was calculated for mmen-2, while DFT pore size distributions indicated a reduction in average pore size (see ).\n\nCO2 Adsorption Isotherms\n\nThe CO2 adsorption data obtained for 2 are depicted in . Isosteric heats of adsorption were calculated to approach -44 kJ/mol at low coverage, as shown in . This value is similar to those previously reported for the analogous Mg2(dobdc) framework. The adsorption capacity of 2 at 25 \u00b0C is 4.85 mmol/g (17.6 wt %) and 6.42 mmol/g (22.0 wt %) at 0.15 and 1 bar, respectively. The gravimetric capacity of 2 for CO2 at 0.15 bar exceeds the capacity of all metal-organic frameworks except for Mg2(dobdc), which adsorbs 6.1 mmol/g (21.2 wt %) at 25 \u00b0C and 0.15 bar. \n\nThe alkylamine-functionalized metal-organic framework mmen-2 displayed an extremely high affinity for CO2 at extraordinarily low pressures. The CO2 adsorption isotherms obtained at 25, 50, and 75 \u00b0C are presented in Figure . At 25 \u00b0C and 0.39 mbar, near the current partial pressure of CO2 in Earth's atmosphere, the compound adsorbed 2.0 mmol/g (8.1 wt %), which is 15 times the capacity of 2. At the much higher pressure of 5 mbar, the median partial pressure of CO2 within the International Space Station, the framework adsorbed 2.6 mmol/g (10.3 wt %). For comparison, zeolite 5A, which is currently used aboard the station to adsorb CO2, adsorbs 0.85 mmol/g (3.6 wt %, crystallographic volumetric capacity 1.3 mmol/cm3) at 5 mbar. \n\nAt 25 \u00b0C, the CO2 adsorption in mmen-2 reaches 3.13 mmol/g (12.1 wt %) at 0.15 bar and 3.86 mmol/g (14.5 wt %) at 1 bar. Remarkably, its CO2 uptake at 1 bar and 25 \u00b0C exceeds the amount of N2 adsorbed at 77 K. Thus, the low surface area measured at 77 K does not appear to accurately reflect the surface area accessible to CO2, and the pore size distribution calculated from N2 adsorption at cryogenic temperatures likely does not accurately represent the true pore size distribution within mmen-2. On a per mass basis, the amine-functionalized framework adsorbed less CO2 than 2 at pressures higher than 20 mbar. The large density difference between the two frameworks is primarily responsible for the lower gravimetric capacity of mmen-2. Crystallographic densities of 0.58 and 0.86 g/cm3 were calculated for 2 and mmen-2, respectively. At 0.15 bar, 2 and mmen-2 adsorb 2.8 and 2.7 mmol/cm3, respectively.\n\nCO2 Capture from Air\n\nTo evaluate the performance of mmen-2 as a regenerable adsorbent, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was utilized to monitor sample mass under dynamic environments. The top panel of Figure  plots changes in sample mass (normalized to the mass of the framework under N2 at 25 \u00b0C) while simulated air containing 390 ppm CO2 was flowed over the sample. Despite the very low concentration of CO2, a 4.6%mc (%mc = percent mass change; 1.05 mmol/g; 4.4 wt %) was realized after 60 min. The adsorbent was then regenerated under flowing N2 at 150 \u00b0C for 30 min and the cycle repeated 10 times with no apparent loss of capacity.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, no studies evaluating the efficacy of air capture within metal-organic frameworks have yet been reported. The equilibrium capacity (2.0 mmol/g, 1.72 mmol/cm3) of mmen-2 is similar to the capacities of the very best amine-grafted silica and alumina adsorbents reported to date. However, the kinetics of adsorption appear to be significantly faster in mmen-2 than for amines deposited via evaporation or polymerization methodologies. For example, while the pseudo-equilibrium capacity of an outstanding poly(ethyleneimine) impregnated silica gel was reported to be ca. 2.4 mmol/g, it took nearly 200 min for the silica based adsorbent to realize 4.6%mc, the capacity of mmen-2 for CO2 after only 60 min. The easily accessed amines within mmen-2 appear to enhance adsorption rates greatly, enabling rapid adsorption-desorption cycles to be utilized.\n\nCO2 Capture from Dry Flue Gas\n\nThe capabilities of mmen-2 as an adsorbent for removing CO2 from the flue gas of coal-fired power stations were also investigated. The bottom panel of Figure  presents the dynamic cycling behavior of mmen-2 under the relevant, dry conditions: 15% CO2 in N2 flowing over the solid at 40 \u00b0C. After adsorbing CO2 for 15 min, the sample was heated at 120 \u00b0C for 15 min under N2. A capacity of 11.1%mc (2.52 mmol/g, 9.9 wt %) relative to the sample mass of mmen-2 under N2 at 40 \u00b0C was realized. After 50 cycles, only a 0.2%mc capacity loss was observed. Longer adsorption and desorption times did not significantly improve the cycling capacity of the material, nor did higher desorption temperatures. Note that the apparent capacity of mmen-2 greatly exceeds the ca. 2 wt % working capacity of aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) scrubbers, which would likely swing between the same adsorption and desorption temperatures.\n\nDifferential Scanning Calorimetry\n\nTo approximate the adsorbent regeneration energy, heats of adsorption and desorption were quantified for mmen-2 via differential scanning calorimetry (see Figure ). When 15% CO2 in N2 at 40 \u00b0C was introduced over a sample of mmen-2 activated at 150 \u00b0C under N2, an exothermic heat flow of -153 J/g was observed (event A). Note that, to enable rapid gas exchange, the pan was not hermetically sealed and the true value of heats evolved are likely slightly larger than those registered by the instrument due to heat loss to the environment. When this heat flow was correlated to the 2.5 mmol/g capacity calculated via TGA adsorption under similar conditions, an approximate, average heat of adsorption of -61 kJ/mol CO2 was calculated.\n\nFollowing a 15 min adsorption period, 100% N2 was introduced into the cell and the sample was heated to 120 \u00b0C (event B); 260 J/g were required to heat the sample and maintain the regeneration temperature for 15 min. Lastly, -107 J/g were evolved as the material was cooled under a N2 atmosphere (event C) from 120 to 40 \u00b0C. Based upon this laboratory-scale experiment, approximately 2.34 MJ of energy would be required to regenerate 1 kg of CO2 adsorbed onto mmen-2. This value compares very favorably with the 3.6-4.5 MJ of energy necessary to release 1 kg of CO2 from an MEA scrubber. \n\nApproximate heat capacities (C  P ) were calculated for mmen-2. Over the 80 \u00b0C temperature range, the average heat required to regenerate CO2-loaded mmen-2 was 3.3 J/g\u22c5K. The regenerated framework released an average of 1.3 J/g\u22c5K upon cooling, a reasonable approximation of the heat capacity of mmen-2. For comparison, the heat capacity of a 30 wt % MEA solution without CO2 is ~3.8 J/g\u22c5K over the same 80 \u00b0C range. The lower regeneration energy of mmen-2 is thus attributable to its lower heat capacity. In addition, the significantly greater working capacity of mmen-2 means that a smaller mass is required to adsorb the same amount of CO2. The heat required to desorb CO2 from the amines is similar for mmen-2 and MEA solutions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['gas_adsorption', 'crystal_system', 'space_group', 'lattice_parameters', 'density', 'surface_area', 'pore_diameter', 'decomposition_temperature', 'thermal_conductivity_coefficient', 'etc']"}]}

At 78 K and 20 bar, the highest total uptake was observed for NOTT-103 with 65.1 mg g-1 H2. From NOTT-100 to NOTT-102, the increasing ligand length results in an increase in BET surface area and pore volume, and this accounts for the increase in overall H2 capacities on going from NOTT-100 to NOTT-102. Thus, the increasing pore volume provides more space to accommodate H2; however, the large pore size in NOTT-102 gives a weaker overlap potential from the walls, and a higher pressure is thus required to store the same amount of H2 in the pores compared to NOTT-100 and NOTT-101. This can be clearly identified from the adsorption data at 1 bar. Thus, increasing the pore size from 6.5 \u00c5 in NOTT-100 to 7.3 \u00c5 in NOTT-101 leads to a small reduction of total H2 uptake at 1 bar from 25.9 to 25.2 mg g-1, while NOTT-102 with the largest pore size of 8.3 \u00c5 adsorbs only 22.4 mg g-1 H2, the lowest value of all samples at 1 bar. Although NOTT-102 has a much larger pore size and volume than NOTT-101, its H2 uptake does not exceed NOTT-101 until the pressure reaches 20 bar. This demonstrates that larger pore size materials require higher pressure to confine the H2 into the channels and suggests that there may well be an optimum pore size and dimension to maximize H2 uptake. Based upon our observations this optimum pore size lies between 7.3 and 8.3 \u00c5. This is further supported by the successful synthesis of NOTT-103 which has a pore size of 8.0 \u00c5 and its H2 adsorption at 20 bar and 77 K is the highest in the series of complexes. So far only two metal-organic framework compounds (MOF-5 and MOF-177) are known to have such high H2 uptake at 20 bar. More interestingly, at 1 bar NOTT-103 adsorbed 26.3 mg g-1 H2, higher than any other framework showing a total H2 uptake of more than 6 wt% at 20 bar. Thus, at 1 bar MOF-5  adsorbs 14.2 mg g-1, MOF-177 13.2 mg g-1, Mn-BTT 22.8 mg g-1, and Cu-BTT 23.0 mg g-1. This suggests that, in addition to using optimum ligand lengths to form intermediate pore size materials, the shape and nature of the central functional group (i.e., the napthyl in NOTT-103) can give a stronger potential overlap to improve adsorption of H2 at low pressures.\n\nThe high pressure H2 adsorption measurements revealed that NOTT-103 has the highest excess and total uptake of all the materials studied. The total uptake is given by n T = n E + \u03c1B V where n E is the experimental excess uptake, \u03c1B is the bulk density of H2, and V is the pore volume which at this stage we take to be the volume obtained from the 78 K N2 isotherms (see ). We used the Redlich-Kwong-Soave equation of state to calculate \u03c1B. Up to 20 bar excess H2 adsorptions obtained by the volumetric method (using the Sievert's apparatus) and the gravimetric method (using the IGA system) are in very good agreement. The total H2 adsorption data in Figure  show that NOTT-101 is nearly saturated at 30 bar. The larger pores of NOTT-102 reach saturation at higher pressures, 40 bar, and the higher pore volume allows the total uptake of NOTT-102 to reach 72.0 mg g-1 at 60 bar. These experiments confirm the importance of high pore volume for high H2 adsorption and are in line with previous theoretical modeling analyses. NOTT-103 has almost the same pore volume and BET surface as NOTT-102 according to their N2 isotherms, but the total H2 adsorption on NOTT-103 is 5.8 mg g-1 higher at 60 bar, reaching 77.8 mg g-1. This derives from and correlates with the higher adsorption heat of NOTT-103 (see below).\n\nThe hydrogen storage capacities for the NOTT series complexes are also very impressive in volumetric units and are among the highest obtained for physisorption materials. At 60 bar and 77 K the total volumetric capacities are 43.1 g L-1 for NOTT-101, 42.3 g L-1 for NOTT-102, and 50.0 g L-1 for NOTT-103, the latter being comparable to MOF-177. Only MOF-5, when prepared and handled under anhydrous conditions, shows a higher volumetric storage capacity (60 g L-1 at 60 bar and 77 K).\n\nComparisons of NOTT-100 with NOTT-101, -102, and -103 can give us an insight to the effects of pore size and the presence of additional aromatic rings on the enthalpy of H2 binding. As shown in Figure a, the adsorption heat of NOTT-100 at zero coverage is 0.9 kJ mol-1 higher than those of NOTT-101 and NOTT-102, and the difference is the same in most loading ranges. Pore size appears to affect the adsorption heat significantly, even at zero surface coverage when the exposed Cu(II) coordination sites are readily accessible to H2 molecules. The [Cu12(L)12] and [Cu24(L)6] cavities in NOTT-100 have approximate spherical diameters of 8.0 and 10.0 \u00c5, respectively. Cavities in this size range can potentially provide more effective profile overlap than the corresponding larger cavities in NOTT-101 and NOTT-102. The spherical cavities [Cu12(L)12] in NOTT-101 and NOTT-102 have diameters of 12.7 and 13.4 \u00c5, respectively, and the long axes in the ellipsoidal [Cu24(L)6] cavities of NOTT-101 and NOTT-102 are 19.6 and 32.0 \u00c5, which are too long to allow the potential profiles from opposite ends to overlap efficiently. The adsorption enthalpies obtained are, therefore, strongly correlated to the local structures, i.e., the binding energies of the three adsorption sites which are located at the bottom of the ellipsoid [Cu24(L)6] cavity as revealed by NPD results. For NOTT-101 and NOTT-102, the local structures are very similar. As shown in Figure a, the adsorption enthalpies of NOTT-101 and NOTT-102 at zero loading are essentially the same taking into account the uncertainties in the measurement, which is consistent with the similarity in their local structure, and their different pore sizes do not noticeably affect the adsorption heat at low H2 loading. This also suggests that the introduction of phenyl (NOTT-101) or biphenyl groups (NOTT-102) and the significant difference (19.6 vs 32.0 \u00c5) in the shape of their ellipsoid [Cu24(L)6] cavities has very little impact on the adsorption heat at low coverage. The adsorption heat of NOTT-101 becomes evidently higher than that of NOTT-102 at higher H2 loading (Figure b). Such a difference (0.5 kJ mol-1 at 0.025 mol g-1 H2 loading) corresponds to the filling of the middle of the cavities and the differences between the H2 interactions with the cavities in NOTT-101 and NOTT-102. The adsorption heat of NOTT-100 at high H2 loading is 1.2 kJ mol-1 higher than that of NOTT-101 and 1.7 kJ mol-1 higher than that of NOTT-102, and this reflects the smaller cavity in NOTT-100 (diameters below 10 \u00c5) and the greater potential overlap in the narrower pore.\n\nComparison of NOTT-101 with its structural derivatives NOTT-105, -106, -107 reveals how the heat of adsorption at low loading can be modified by introducing functional groups into the cavities. As shown in Figure a, the heat of adsorption for NOTT-105-107 is significantly higher than that for NOTT-101 and ranges from 5.77 to 6.70 kJ mol-1 at zero coverage and decreases much more rapidly with increasing H2 loading (Figure b). The highest initial adsorption heat (6.70 kJ mol-1) was observed for NOTT-107, followed by NOTT-106, suggesting that the four methyl groups contribute toward the increased isosteric heat. It decreases rapidly with increasing loading due to the saturation of the strong adsorption sites. NOTT-106 has an initial adsorption heat of 6.34 kJ mol-1, 0.57 kJ mol-1 higher than that for NOTT-105. The difference of adsorption heat between NOTT-105, NOTT-106, and NOTT-107 becomes smaller with the increasing H2 loading, and above 0.0075 mol g-1, their adsorption enthalpies converge (Figure b). The adsorption enthalpies of NOTT-105, NOTT-106, and NOTT-107 decrease at the same rate from the loading of 0.0075 mol g-1 indicating that H2-pore interactions at higher loading are similar and not affected significantly by the introduction of fluorine or methyl substituents. At high loading, H2-H2 interactions may also contribute to changes in enthalpies of adsorption."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['chemical_formula_weight', 'gas_adsorption', 'surface_area', 'pore_volume', 'porosity', 'etc']"}]}

The heat of adsorption for NOTT-103 lies in the range 5.1-4.0 kJ mol-1 between 0.0075 and 0.029 mol g-1 loading, with the initial heat of 5.71 kJ mol-1 at zero loading approaching that observed for the narrower porosity of NOTT-105. Interestingly in the high loading region, the adsorption heat of NOTT-103 decreases more slowly than that of NOTT-105, NOTT-106, and NOTT-107, which have smaller pores. NOTT-103, therefore, incorporates a high surface area and pore volume and provides excellent H2 uptake at all pressures by enhancing both heat of adsorption and pore volume within the same framework material.\n\nThe initial enthalpies for H2 adsorption for all the complexes lie in the range 5.34-6.70 kJ mol-1. The adsorption enthalpies decrease with similar gradients at low coverage, except NOTT-107 which decreases more rapidly. The NPD experiments on NOTT-101 revealed that, at 1.72 D2/Cu loading (equivalent to 0.0065 mol g-1), all the adsorption sites are partially occupied, even at 4 K, indicating that the H2 binding energies of the exposed Cu(II) sites are not significantly higher than those at other adsorption sites. If we consider that the initial adsorption heat is due entirely to the adsorption of H2 molecules on the exposed Cu(II) sites, the binding energy of H2-Cu is only 5.42 kJ mol-1 for NOTT-101. At a 0.025 mol g-1 loading, all the exposed Cu(II) sites should be saturated, but NOTT-101 still has an adsorption heat of 3.51 kJ mol-1; thus the difference between the initial adsorption heat and the adsorption heat at 20 bar is ~1.9 kJ mol-1. This value varies for the different Cu materials reported herein. NOTT-107 has the largest difference of 2.76 kJ mol-1, NOTT-106 2.37 kJ mol-1, NOTT-105 2.43 kJ mol-1, NOTT-103 1.92 kJ mol-1, NOTT-102 2.34 kJ mol-1, and NOTT-100 1.35 kJ mol-1. Thus, we can conclude that the binding energies of H2 molecules to the exposed Cu(II) sites are similar to those for other, nonmetal, adsorption sites. Another factor that requires consideration is that the enthalpies of adsorption on the exposed Cu(II) sites are affected significantly by the pore size and pore geometry. In NOTT-100, the close proximity of the opposite wall creates a high H2-framework potential. In NOTT-105, -106, and -107, the fluorine or methyl substituents create a small pocket in the ellipsoidal [Cu24(L)6] cage (Figure b and c). Significantly, these pocket structures can result in apparent high adsorption enthalpies. The NPD experiments on NOTT-101 gave the D2 occupancy of 0.85 at the exposed Cu(II) site at 1.72 D2/Cu (0.0065 mol g-1). Therefore, we reasonably consider the differences in the heats of adsorption (Figure a) between zero loading and 0.0075 mol g-1 as the difference of binding energy between the exposed Cu(II) site and the nonmetal site.\n\nConclusions and Perspectives\n\nWe have synthesized a series of [Cu2(L)] framework complexes and their H2 adsorption properties have been investigated. NOTT-103 has achieved 77.8 mg g-1 (7.22 wt%) total H2 adsorption at 77 K and 60 bar. We have investigated the correlation of the H2 uptake capacity and heats of adsorption with pore metrics and the influences of functional groups on the ligands. Exposed Cu(II) sites and two sites close to the center of three {Cu2} paddle wheels were identified as strong adsorption sites at low H2 loading by Rietveld refinement of NPD data. The exposed Cu(II) site is the strongest adsorption site in the pore, but its adsorption heat is only slightly higher than those for other sites. Furthermore, it is significantly affected by the ligand structure near the {Cu2} paddle wheels. Therefore, we conclude that the higher adsorption heat observed in NOTT-106 and NOTT-107 at low loading represents the collective contribution from the exposed Cu(II) site and the dimensions and functionality of the pore defined by the methyl groups on the ligands."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['gas_adsorption', 'etc']"}]}

Compound 1 lost the free and coordinated water molecules in the temperature range of 50-180 \u00b0C (found, 15.23 wt %; calcd, 15.23 wt %), and the fully dehydrated sample (1a) was stable up to 340 \u00b0C without further weight loss (Figure S5a in the ), which was confirmed by VTPXRD patterns (Figure S5b in the ). The ion currents showed peaks at these temperatures only for ions with m/z = 17 and 18, which may be assigned to HO+ and H2O+, respectively. The destruction of the material occurred from 340 to 520 \u00b0C (Found 38.65 wt %, Calc. 39.04 wt %), leading to the formation of CdO and Na2CO3 as the residue (found, 46.12 wt %; calcd, 45.72 wt %) indicated by the TG and VTPXRD results. The MS peaks of ions with m/z = 17, 18, 28, and 44 were observed during the above decomposition, which may correspond to HO+, H2O+, CO+, and CO2+, respectively.\n\nThe TG-MS analysis of compound 2 was demonstrated in Figure S5c in the , and the weight loss attributed to the departure of water molecules (found, 6.14 wt %; calcd, 6.42 wt %) was observed in the range of 80-310 \u00b0C. The destruction of the material occurred from 310 to 480 \u00b0C (found, 50.15 wt %; calcd, 49.83 wt %). The ion currents of m/z = 17 (HO+) and 18 (H2O+) appeared in both above steps, whereas the MS peaks of ions with m/z = 30 (NO+ or CH3NH+), 44 [CO2 + or (CH3)2N+], and 46 [NO2+ or (CH3)2NH2 +] were observed in the second process. VTPXRD studies (Figure S5d in the ) revealed that compound 2 was stable up to 310 \u00b0C, and crystallinity was retained upon the loss of all water molecules. The diffraction patterns measured between 25 and 180 \u00b0C showed no evident changes, which could correspond to the release of guest water molecules. Above 180 \u00b0C, the patterns showed an apparent shift toward the higher angle 2\u03b8 of the peaks due to shrinkage of the framework with the removal of coordinated water molecules, and the resulting phases at the higher temperatures (above 310 \u00b0C) were CdO and Na2CO3, corresponding to the TG residue (found, 43.71 wt %; calcd, 43.75 wt %).\n\nThe N2 isotherm tested at 77 K revealed that 1a exhibited typical type I adsorption behavior: The adsorption and desorption branches were closed without hysteresis. Compound 1a adsorbed 142 cm3 g-1 of N2 at 77 K, corresponding to Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 473 m2 g-1 (within the range 0.06 < p/p 0 < 0.2) and the Langmuir surface area of 618 m2 g-1. The pore volume calculated from the maximum N2 adsorption was 0.220 cm3 g-1. Furthermore, the N2 adsorption showed very good reversibility. The surface area for N2 adsorption is not too impressive, comparing with the values of very well studied microporous MOFs such as MOF-177 (4630 m2 g-1 for BET model, 5250 m2 g-1 for Langmuir model) and MOF-5 (3800 m2 g-1 for BET model, 4400 m2 g-1 for Langmuir model). By analyzing the crystal structure of 1a, interpenetration decreases the internal diameter of aperture to 6 \u00c5 without blocking any adsorptive sites and leads to a more convoluted void region. These narrow voids are too small to incorporate more N2 molecules (the kinetic diameter for N2, 3.64 \u00c5).\n\nH2 adsorption isotherm was recorded at 77 K under atmospheric pressures, which also showed type I behavior with good reversibility and no hysteresis. The H2 adsorption kinetic data confirmed that equilibrium was achieved rapidly within approximately 3 min of the isotherm pressure step. Compound 1a could adsorb nearly 1.11 wt % H2 at 1.0 bar and 77 K. The saturation value of H2 uptake on a unit specific surface area was calculated to 2.35 wt % per 1000 m2 g-1. The result confirmed the monolayer prediction, on the basis of which the H2 storage capacity was estimated to be 2.27 wt % per 1000 m2 g-1. By fitting the Langmuir-Freundlich equation, the maximum H2 uptake of 1a was predicted to be 1.12 wt %, which was in accordance with the experimental value. Under ambient pressures (1.0 bar), the H2 uptake amount of 1a is typical comparing to MOF-177 (1.25 wt %) and MOF-5 (1.32 wt %), although these famous MOFs have large pore dimensions (MOF-5, 15 \u00c5; MOF-177, 10.8 \u00c5). The result suggests that many reported MOFs have spaces between their walls that are too large for the effective adsorption of H2 (the kinetic diameter for H2, 2.89 \u00c5), on the basis of the confirmed monolayer prediction for H2 adsorption. However, in 1a, the rolling surface of the pores and the nonlinearity of the channels may be appropriate for accommodate more H2 as several reported references. \n\nTo investigate the interaction between H2 and the framework, the isosteric heats of the adsorption were calculated by fitting the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to the H2 adsorption isotherms measured at 77 and 87 K (Figure b). The equation is as follows:    ( ln  P )   n   = -   Q   st   / R T + C  where P is the pressure, n is the amount adsorbed, T is the temperature, R is the universal gas constant, and C is a constant. By calculating the slope of the ln P -(-1/RT) curve, the coverage dependency of Q st was presented graphically in Figure c. Interestingly, the isosteric heats of adsorption for 1a increased initially with H2 loading until a maximum of 8.4 kJ mol-1, higher than MOF-177 (4.4 kJ mol-1) and MOF-5 (5.2 kJ mol-1). These values suggest that there may be effects due to H2-H2 interactions at low coverage. The reason of high adsorption heat of 1a may be that its convoluted narrow pores and unsaturated Na sites afford strong binding affinities for H2 molecules.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe combination of transition metals [Cd(II)] and alkali metals [Na(I)] to react with the aromatic BTC ligands afforded two novel 3D MOFs through solvothermal syntheses. Compound 1 constructs a {Na3O12}-bridged 2-fold interpenetrated framework with bor topology, while 2 forms a {Na2O10}, (CH3)2NH2 +, and free water-filled 1D honeycomb channel network. In compound 1, the exceptional H2 storage capacity of 1.11 wt % at 77 K and 1.0 bar has been observed with the higher isosteric heat of 8.4 kJ mol-1. This illustration demonstrates that metal (transition alkali) organic frameworks with very narrow voids and exposed alkali sites may provide a useful platform for further new MOFs with enhanced H2 storage performance. We are currently investigating the possibilities of gas adsorption for compound 2, through any method of replacing (CH3)2NH2 + by alkali cations."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['decomposition_temperature', 'gas_adsorption', 'surface_area', 'pore_volume']"}]}

The \u03b3 values are comparable to those of the best NLO materials and coordination polymers. We found that the valence shell structures of central metal ions can influence the NLO properties of coordination polymers. \n\nIn addition, coordination polymers are of great current interest because of the formation of fascinating structures with potentials in applications. Among all the networks, the polymers with large pores and chiral or helical structures are of particular importance. Fujita synthesized a big square-grid polymer with dimensions of about 20 \u00d7 20 \u00c5. Zaworotko reported several helical coordination polymers with large chiral cavities. A square-grid polymer {[Cd(bpy)2](NO3)2} n  shows catalytic activity, and it accelerates cyanosilylation reactions. A honeycomb-like polymer Ag-tris(p-cyanobenzene)ethynylbenzene exhibits auxetic properties, such as a negative coefficient of thermal expansion. Polymer {[Cd3(\u03bc3-OH)L3(py)6](ClO4)2} n  (L = 4-[2-(4-pyridyl)ethenyl]benzoate) has a powder SHG efficiency approximately 10 times higher than that of technologically useful potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP). [NdM(bpym)(H2O)4(CN)6]\u22c53H2O (M = Fe, Co) exhibits unusual magnetic behavior. 3-D porous structural [Ag(4,4\u2018-bpy)(NO3)] shows ion-exchange properties. NLO properties, especially third-order NLO properties, have received little attention. In principle, compared with traditional NLO material, such as organic molecules, the incorporation of metal atoms introduce more sublevels into the energy hierarchy, which permits a more allowed electronic transition to take place and hence a larger NLO effect. In this paper, we synthesized a new bidentate ligand, N,N \u2018-bis(3-pyridyl formyl)piperazine (bpfp), and solved its crystal structures. The bpfp self-assembled into 2-D polymers {[Mn(H2O)2(SO4)(bpfp)](H2O)3(CH3OH)} n  (1) and {[Zn(NCS)2(bpfp)2]\u22c52H2O} n  (2) with Mn(II) and Zn(II), a 3-D layered polymer [Cd(N3)2(bpfp)] n  (3) with Cd(II), and a 1-D zigzag polymer [HgI2(bpfp)] n   (4) with Hg(II).

The \u03b12 values are larger than those of all the reported NLO materials. The third-order NLO hyperpolarizabilities \u03b3 are 1.79 \u00d7 10-28, 9.10 \u00d7 10-29, and 9.66 \u00d7 10-29 esu, respectively. The \u03b3 values are comparable to those of the best NLO materials and coordination polymers. \n\n Thermoanalysis. The TG-DTA of polymers 1-4 was determined in the range 20-900 \u00b0C in air. On the DTA curve of 1 there are two endothermic peaks from 80 to 376 \u00b0C corresponding to the removal of lattice water, coordinate methanol, and water molecules in the TG curve, and then a plateau region is observed until 720 \u00b0C; from 720 to 900 \u00b0C a strong exothermic peak demonstrates the decomposition of 1. There is an endothermic peak from 76 to 130 \u00b0C on the DTA curve of 2 corresponding to the removal of lattice water in the TG curve; three moderate exothermic peaks at 380, 500, and 600 \u00b0C on the DTA curve and weight loss between 360 and 600 \u00b0C in the TG curve show 2 undergoes decomposition. In the DTA curve of 3, there are one very strong exothermic peak at 294 \u00b0C and one moderate exothermic peak at 440 \u00b0C; polymer 3 keeps losing weight from 290 to 490 \u00b0C, and then a plateau region is observed from 490 to 900 \u00b0C. Polymer 4 undergoes a one-step decomposition process from 212 to 530 \u00b0C; this great mass loss is due to the losses of bpfp ligands, iodide atoms, and Hg. \n\n Nonlinear Optical Properties. Recently coordination polymers have been concerned for nonlinear optical (NLO) applications. Here we report third-order NLO properties of polymers 1-4. Their UV-vis spectrum in a DMF solution show there is only one absorption peak at 273 nm for 1, 269 nm for 2, 268 nm for 3, and 268 nm for 4 (Figure ). These polymers have a very low linear absorption ranging from 400 to 800 nm, promising low-intensity loss and little temperature change caused by photon absorption when light propagates in the materials. A broad transparent range is important for NLO applications especially in waveguide forms. They show linear absorption similar to other 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D coordination polymers.  \n\nFigures a, a, and 11a depict NLO absorptive properties of polymers 1-3, respectively. They clearly illustrate that the absorption increases as the incident light irradiance rises. The normalized transmittance drops to about 31% for Figure a, or 56% for Figure a, or 51% (T  d ) for Figure a at the focus. It is obvious that the three polymers exhibit very strong NLO absorption. The third-order NLO absorption data can be well represented by eqs 1 and 2, which describe a third-order NLO process.         where Z is the distance of the sample from the focal point; \u03b1 0 and \u03b1 2 are the linear and nonlinear absorption coefficients, respectively; L is the sample thickness; I 0 is the peak irradiation intensity at focus; Z 0 = \u03c0\u03c90 2/\u03bb with \u03c90 is the spot radius of the laser beam at focus and \u03bb is the wavelength of the laser; r is the radial coordinate; t is the time; and t 0 is the pulse width. The three polymers' third-order NLO absorptive coefficients \u03b12 are listed in Table . In accordance with the known NLO properties of coordination polymers, we find that most coordination polymers possess very strong NLO absorptive properties; their \u03b12 values are in the range 10-8-10-9 m W-1. Their \u03b12 values are larger than those of all the reported NLO materials.     \n\nTo put the optical nonlinearity of polymers 1-3 in a proper perspective with reference to other known third-order NLO materials, \u03b3 values are listed in Tables  and  along with the reported \u03b3 values of related coordination polymers and a few best performing known NLO materials. Most of the well-performing NLO materials reported in the literature are clusters, organic polymers, fullerene, semiconductors, and organometallic compounds. The \u03b3 values of polymers 1-3 can be comparable to those of the known cluster compounds (\u03b3 values are in the range of 10-29-10-27 esu), such as 1.26 \u00d7 10-29 and 5.8 \u00d7 10-27 esu for clusters {[Et4N]2[WS4Cu4(CN)4]}n and MoOS3Cu3(SCN)(Py)5, and are better than those of other compounds, such as C60(7.5 \u00d7 10-34 esu) and C70 (1.3 \u00d7 10-33 esu), semiconductors InSb (1.7 \u00d7 10-33 esu) and Ge (2.3 \u00d7 10-33 esu), ferrocene derivatives (\u03b3 values are ranging from 10-35 to 10-33 esu), group 10 metal alkynyl polymers (\u03b3 values are in the range 8.6 \u00d7 10-35-5.6 \u00d7 10-34 esu), metallophalocyanines (\u03b3 values are ranging from 10-32 to 10-31 esu), octopolar alkynylruthenium complexes (\u03b3 values are from 9.3 \u00d7 10-35 to 3.6 \u00d7 10-33 esu), organic compounds 2-ethenylthiophene(1.04 \u00d7 10-36 esu), \u03b1,\u03c9- diphenylhexatriene (~10-32 esu), and C60H62 polyene (8 \u00d7 10-32 esu)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['decomposition_temperature', 'catalytic_activity', 'etc']"}]}

The complex 1 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pbcn, with a = 17.911(5) \u00c5, b = 15.804(5) \u00c5, c = 6.6538(18) \u00c5, and Z = 4. The Mn atoms are coordinated by three N atoms of the tptz ligands and connected to each other by double end-on (EO) azide ligands, forming a neutral 1D chain. The adjacent 1D chains are connected by face-to-face \u03c0-\u03c0-stacking interactions and C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions of pyridine rings of the tptz ligands, which leads to the formation of a supramolecular 2D sheet structure.

Here each MnII is seven-coordinated and is connected to one another by a double EO bridging azide ligand, forming a 1D chain. The adjacent 1D chains are connected by face-to-face \u03c0-\u03c0-stacking interactions and C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions of the pyridine rings of the tptz ligand, which leads to the formation of a supramolecular 2D sheet. Variable-temperature magnetic measurement exhibits intrachain ferromagnetic interactions and interchain antiferromagnetic interactions with the overall metamagnetic behavior having 3D magnetic ordering at 2.7 K. \n\n Magnetic Study and Magnetostructural Correlation. The magnetic susceptibility of 1 was measured at 2-300 K with an external field of 3000 G. The \u03c7M T vs T plot (Figure a) indicates ferromagnetic coupling between the MnII centers bridged by the \u03bc1,1-N3 ligands. Indeed, \u03c7\u039c T has a value of 5.07 cm3 K mol-1 at 300 K, slightly higher than the expected value for an isolated octahedral MnII ion (4.38 cm3 K mol-1 and TIP = 0). Indeed, in complex 1 the MnII ion is heptacoordinated; thus, there is a nonzero TIP value. \u03c7\u039c T values increase gradually upon cooling to ca. 75 K. Below this temperature, \u03c7\u039c T increases abruptly to a maximum value of 31.19 cm3 K mol-1 at 8 K because of rapidly increasing ferromagnetic correlations between adjacent spin carriers. Upon cooling to 2 K, \u03c7\u039c T decreases quickly to 13.19 cm3 K mol-1 because of possible interchain antiferromagnetic interactions. The same behavior has been observed in other  related complexes such as trans-[Mn(N3)2(pyz)] n   (pyz = pyrazine) and cis-[Mn(N3)2(2-bzpy)] n  (2-bzpy = 2-benzoylpyridine). To determine the exchange parameters via a N3 bridge type, \u03c7\u039c T was fitted to the S = 5/2 Fisher chain model, \u03c7M (eq 1), in conjunction with an additional mean-field correction term, \u03c7MF (eq 2), where N is Avogadro's number, \u03bcB is the Bohr magneton, k B is the Boltzmann constant, and z is the number of nearest neighbors. The best least-squares fit parameters gave J = 4.07 cm-1, zJ\u2018 = -0.13 cm-1, g = 2.003, R = 5.22 \u00d7 10-4 = \u2211 i (\u03c7M T cal - \u03c7M T obs)2/(\u03c7M T obs)2.    where         \n\nThe ferromagnetic coupling was confirmed by magnetization measurements performed at 2 K up to an external field of 5 T showing the typical behavior of a soft ferromagnet because coercivity was not observed (Figure b). At higher field, the magnetization in M/N\u03b2 units indicates a saturated S = 5/2 system, 5.18 N\u03b2. A comparison of the overall shape of the plot with the Brillouin plot for a fully isolated S = 5/2 system indicates faster magnetization, consistent with the ferromagnetic interaction. \n\nThis ferromagnetic behavior may be explained by attending to the principal factors that influence the sign of the exchange interaction in the [{\u03bc1,1-N3}2MII] system. The magnetostructural correlation studies have shown a dependence of the ferromagnetic exchange coupling constant (J) on the M-N(azide)-M bridging angle. For Mn, the ferromagnetic exchange appears to increase with an increase of the bridging angle (starting from 100\u00b0) involved in the exchange pathway. Very recently, Arom\u00ed et al. have deduced from four dinuclear MnII compounds a linear relationship between the exchange integral (J) and the azide bridging angle (\u03b8); J = 0.64\u03b8 - 64.5. If this relationship holds for complex 1 [\u03b8 = 106.16(4)\u00b0], a J value of ca. 3.43 cm-1 is anticipated. The experimental J value (4.07 cm-1) appears to be close to the average among the prospective values using the previous relationship. \n\nTo characterize the magnetic transition from intrachain ferromagnetism to interchain antiferromagnetism of 1 in the low-temperature region, field-cooled magnetization was measured under different fields (Figure ). At the lower field of 15, 30, and 50 G, the M vs T curve shows a maximum at ca. 2.7 K (Figure , inset), clearly indicating the occurrence of antiferromagnetic ordering of the ferromagnetic chains below the critical temperature. The magnetization maximum shifts toward low temperature as the applied field is increased to 200, 1000, and 3000 G. However, the magnetization at or above 200 G shows no maximum and tends to saturate at lower temperature, indicating that the interchain antiferromagnetic interactions are overcome by the external field. This behavior is characteristic of a metamagnet built of ferromagnetic chains. The metamagnetic behavior is confirmed by the field dependence of magnetization (Figure ). The sigmoidal shape of the M/N\u03b2 vs H curve at 2 K indicates the field-induced transition from an antiferromagnetic to a ferromagnetic state, which is characteristic of a metamagnet.  The critical field is ~80 G, estimated as the field at which a maximum \u03b4M/\u03b4 H value is reached (Figure , inset).   \n\nThe temperature dependence of the ac magnetic susceptibility is also measured at zero dc field and confirms the occurrence of the magnetic transition with T c = 2.7 K, at which the maximum of \u03c7\u2018 (the in-phase component) occurs. The divergence of \u03c7\u2018\u2018 (the out-of-phase component) with the field starts at this temperature (Figure ). This metamagnetic-like transition results from the presence of small antiferromagnetic interactions among the ferromagnetic chains and, in complex 1, can be favored by the heptacoordination of the Mn ions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['crystal_system',\n 'space_group',\n 'lattice_parameters',\n 'magnetic_susceptibility']"}]}

The most outstanding structural feature of 1 is that the different arrangements of armed ribbon chains. A pair of one-end-coordinated bipy ligands act as rods that thread the [Zn6Mimda6] ring from the adjacent ribbon chains, resulting in the existence of 3D pseudorotaxane character. This kind of 3D polyrotaxane structure is exceedingly rare to observe. Both Nd1 and Nd2 are 3-connected nodes, Zn1 and Zn2 are 3-connected nodes, the Mimda ligand exhibits 3- and 4-connected nodes, and the whole structure is a 3,4-connected (4.82)(4.83.92) (6.8.9)2 (6.92) (83) topology, which presents a new topology. Notably, the YbIII MOF 5 is slightly different from the others, and this compound is based on two kinds of heteronuclear cluster cages, as displayed in Figure S6 in the Supporting Information.\n\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA; see Figure S7 and S8 in the Supporting Information) indicates that 3 exhibits an initial mass loss of 6.0% in the temperature range of 250-300 \u00b0C, corresponding to the release of coordination and free water molecules (calculated 5.9%). According the TGA and EA (Table S4 in the Supporting Information) results, dehydrated samples 3a were easily obtained by heating the as-synthesized sample 3 at 70 \u00b0C in a vacuum for 80 min to produce a new guest-free phase, {[Tb3Zn6(bipy2)2(Hmimda)7]} n  (3a). It is thermally stable up to 350 \u00b0C, and a similar process was performed to afford 2a. The phase purities of bulk materials 1-5 were independently confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and the slight difference between the simulated and experimental patterns may be due to variation in the preferred orientation of the powder samples. As illustrated in Figure S9 in the Supporting Information. The pattern of the guest-free phase [Tb3Zn6(bipy2)2(Hmimda)7] n  (3a) is almost identical with that of the as-synthesized 3, indicating that the basic 3D framework is retained. Before further luminescent sensing investigation, a porosity luminescent study of 3a was performed by measuring the iodine uptake. The MOF 3 was immersed in a dichloromethane (DCM) saturated solution of iodine for a certain length of time and dried to obtain 3b after 6 h and 3c after 20 h. The PXRD pattern of 3b is slightly different from that of 3a, indicating that structural changes occur in response to the absorption of guest molecules. The I2 release experiment is also investigated by immersing the sample 3c-I2 in pure CH2Cl2 and replacing CH2Cl2 (4 mL) per 1 h after 2 days to recover 3, followed by luminescence measurements for samples 3a-I2 and 3b after being immersed in pure CH2Cl2 for different lengths of time, as shown in . However, as can be seen, the process of adsorption and release of I2 is quasi-reversible.\n\nSpectroscopic Studies and Photophysical Properties\n\nThe PL spectra of 2 and 3 at room temperature are described in  and S10-S12 in the Supporting Information, respectively. The spectra of 2 (red) display the characteristic emissions of EuIII ions originating from 5D0 \u2192 7F J  (J = 0, 1, 2,3, 4) at 582, 594, 616, 652, and 702 nm with CIE coordinates of (0.403, 0.434) (Figure S11 in the Supporting Information). The weak emission at 460 nm may have originated from the ligand, which means that ligand-to-metal charge transfer is not in effect for the EuIII MOF. As shown in  (blue), polymer 3 exhibits characteristic emission peaks at 492, 548, 586, and 621 nm, which are assignable to 5D4 \u2192 7F J  (J = 6, 5, 4, 3) transitions of the TbIII ion, respectively. The spectrum shows a dominant green-light emission at ca. 550 nm due to the 5D4 \u2192 7F5 transition (Figure S12 in the Supporting Information), which is attributed to a magnetic-dipole-induced transition. \n\nLanthanide luminescence lifetimes were measured at 549 nm for Tb and 616 nm for EuIII recorded at ambient temperature and were up to 603 and 764 \u03bcs long (Figure S13 in the Supporting Information). The luminescence is measured for samples 3a-I2 and 3b after being immersed in pure CH2Cl2 for different lengths of time, and the morphology/color and emission spectra are shown in  and S14 in the Supporting Information. The intensity decreases with the time immersed in an iodine solution, until the characteristic emission peak disappeared after 40 h. The quenched fluorescence is due to the heavy-atom effect of iodide or an aggregation-induced new emission (Figure S15 in the Supporting Information). The intrinsic porosities of luminescent MOFs allow them to adsorb and release guest molecules via modification of the approaches and to provide a platform for specific luminescent recognition of targets due to host-guest interactions. Considering that both the Hmimda and bipy ligands were incorporated, which can sensitize EuIII and TbIII simultaneously, the color of the emission can be tuned with the in situ doping of different Ln ions, and the production of white light should be achievable with the right combination of Ln ions in appropriate molar ratios. In order to explore the luminescent properties of EuIII and TbIII compounds, a series of mixed-lanthanide-contained complexes {[Eu3x Tb3(1-x)Zn6(bipy)2(Hmimda)7]\u22c5mH2O} n  (x = 1, 0.8, 0.6, 0.45, 0.2, 0.1, 0) are developed (see the experimentsl details in the Supporting Information). The spectroscopic properties of the mixed-lanthanide complexes are investigated (a). From 2a to 3a, with the increasing quality of TbIII being in situ doped emission spectra (\u03bbex = 363 nm), the characteristic peaks of TbIII 5D4 \u2192 7F2 and 5D4 \u2192 7F5 (548 nm) are enhanced gradually, corresponding to a decrease of the emission intensity of 5D0 \u2192 7F2 of EuIII (616 nm). As expected, the variation trends of the CIE coordinates are similar to those for two groups of mixing components. As shown in b, points a and e represent the CIE coordinates of MOFs 2a and 3a, respectively, while points b-d represent the CIE coordinates for Eu-Tb mixed components, which change from (0.403, 0.344) to (0.243, 0.402). White-light emission is realized by the EuIII ion in situ doped into the TbIII framework. This reveals that the emission color of the doped materials can be finely tuned by varying the doping ratio, as depicted in Table S4 in the Supporting Information, and white-light emission of the doped material with a molar ratio at x = 0.45, compound [Eu1.35Tb1.65Zn6(bipy)2(Hmimda)7] n , was obtained at CIE chromaticity coordinates (0.331, 0.342) (Table S5 in the Supporting Information) at an excitation wavelength of 363 nm. This is close to the internationally pure white-light CIE chromaticity coordinates (0.333, 0.333). The singlet-state energy (1\u03c0\u03c0*) level of [Zn6(bipy)2(Hmimda)7] is estimated by referencing its absorbance edge, which is 25000 cm-1 (400 nm; Figure S10a in the Supporting Information). The triplet (T1) energy levels were calculated by referring to the lower-wavelength emission peak of the corresponding phosphorescence spectrum of the GdIII complex, which is 20600 cm-1 (478 nm; Figure S10b in the Supporting Information). Therefore, it is easily understandable that energy transfer from [Zn6(bipy)2(Hmimda)7] to TbIII is sufficient, whereas that to EuIII is incomplete, and the mechanism on the energy transition process is illuminated in Figure S16 in the Supporting Information."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['porosity', 'decomposition_temperature', 'topology', 'peak_spectrum']"}]}

Single crystals of [Fe(bntrz)3][Pt(CN)4].H2O (1) have been synthesized via diffusion technique in a fine glass tube (3.0 mm diameter) by layering an ethanolic solution of the bntrz ligand onto an aqueous solution containing both K2[Pt(CN)4)]\u22c5xH2O and Fe(BF4)2\u22c56H2O salts (). The magnetic susceptibility (\u03c7m) of 1 was measured over the 2-300 K temperature (T) range on a set of single crystals. The \u03c7m T versus T plot is displayed in . In the high-temperature region, the \u03c7m T value (3.45 cm3\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1) is consistent with a HS (S = 2) configuration of the hexacoordinated FeII ions. Upon cooling, the \u03c7m T remains constant down to 240 K, then sharply decreases to ca. 0.0 cm3\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1, indicating the presence of a complete sharp HS to LS first-order spin transition (T 1/2 = 242 K). However, no significant thermal hysteresis effects were detected after the warming mode, at the value of the temperature scan rate of 0.4 K\u22c5mn-1. The DSC measurements for 1, performed in the temperature range 200-260 K with a temperature scan rate of 2 K\u22c5mn-1, reveal exo- and endothermic transitions with maxima at 241.1 and 243.5 K, respectively (inset in ). Furthermore, the phase transition has been found to occur with an enthalpy and entropy changes of \u0394H = 16.87 kJ\u22c5mol-1 and \u0394S = 69.61 J\u22c5K-1\u22c5mol-1, respectively. These values are in the range of those reported in the literature for similar SCO compounds. The presence of a weak hysteresis in the calorimetry data while it was absent in magnetic measurements can be reasonably attributed to the difference of temperature scan rates.\n\nTo understand how the crystal structure is affected by the SCO transition, the temperature dependence of the lattice parameters of a single crystal of 1 was measured in the range 200-280 K. As clearly depicted in , the evolution of the unit cell parameters (a, b, c) reveals significant anisotropic changes at the transition temperature (ca. 242 K), more precisely a contraction upon heating for the c parameter paralleled with positive expansions occurring simultaneously in the ab plane. The amplitude of the anisotropic expansion is much more pronounced along the a axis, proving that the major structural change accompanying the SCO transition in the overall structure arises along the 1D chain. In comparison with the parent 1D compound [Fe(Htrz)2(trz)](BF4), the careful examination of the shortest interchain contacts in 1 reveals the absence of direct H-bonding interchain interactions whereas strong direct H-bonding interchain interactions through the N-H group of the triazole have been identified in [Fe(Htrz)2(trz)](BF4) (). However, the presence of significant indirect H-bonding, occurring via the [Pt(CN)4]2- anions, links the chains in the b and c directions, leading to an overall 3D packing ( and ). These interactions in 1 are more pronounced in the LS state than in the HS state; this observation may explain the more constrained iron geometry along the chain in the LS state. The intrachain Fe\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Fe distances in 1 are almost similar to those found in [Fe(Htrz)2(trz)](BF4), in both spin states, whereas the interchain Fe\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Fe ones are significantly longer than those observed in other parent 1D triazole-based derivatives that have been structurally characterized (see ). Moreover, the Fe\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Fe intrachain distances in 1 appear also longer in both HS and LS states than the corresponding distances observed in discrete trinuclear complexes based on triazole ligands, although this latter observation refers only to the few compounds that display \"full\" HS or LS states, i.e., involving all the iron centers. Because of the triclinic symmetry of the crystal lattice, the interchain distances do not exactly match the Fe\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Fe intermolecular distances, but are shorter because the chains are slightly shifted from each other in the a direction (). It follows that the interchain distances are different along the b and c directions. Thus, in the LS state, they are shorter in the b direction (14.2708(4) \u00c5) compared to the c direction (14.5072(4) \u00c5), whereas in the HS state, we observe the opposite tendency because the interchain distances along the b direction (14.4975(4) \u00c5) are longer than those along the c axis (14.2832(4) \u00c5), leading finally to very similar distances in the LS and HS states, but inverted with respect to b and c parameters (). These observations indicate a significant motion of the chains with respect to each other in the bc plane that co-occurs with a slight gliding along the a direction as the chains shift increase during the LS to HS transition (ca. 0.35 \u00c5). Additionally, the LS to HS transition is accompanied by a rearrangement of the side chain of the triazole ligand, leading to a much better accommodation of the modification of the iron coordination sphere volume in 1 than in the parent compound [Fe(Htrz)2(trz)](BF4). Indeed, while the octahedron volume (Vp) increases in similar proportions for both compounds (Vp increase of 32% for 1 and 36% for [Fe(Htrz)2(trz)](BF4)), the molecular volume remains almost the same for 1 (+0.8%) but increases appreciably for [Fe(Htrz)2(trz)](BF4) (+4.7%, ). This structural rearrangement of the chains and the related accommodation of the molecular volume to the transition might be responsible for the smaller unit cell volume change at the transition when compared to the parent compound [Fe(Htrz)2(trz)](BF4) (4.5% vs 11.5%). Such capability of structural breathing was not observed in [Fe(Htrz)2(trz)](BF4) and may explain the (i) unusual crystal quality of compound 1 and (ii) its exceptional reliability and mechanical resilience to repeated LS to HS transition. The latter has been clearly evidenced by crystal mosai\u0308city studies and optical microscopy investigations performed over 20 SCO cycles. Thus, (i) the crystal mosai\u0308city was found to be nearly constant around 0.49(2) between the LS and HS states (), and (ii) no damage or alteration at the resolution of the optical microscopy (~0.3 \u03bcm) was detected within the single crystal (). In addition, an elongation of 5.3% of the crystal upon LS to HS transition was observed in optical microscopy studies. This value is in excellent agreement with X-ray data that indicates an elongation of 5.32% of the a parameter during the LS/HS thermal transition."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['magnetic_susceptibility', 'crystal_system', 'lattice_parameters']"}]}

Under oxygen-free conditions, the 1H T 1 was found to be relatively constant at 15.0 \u00b1 0.4 s over the temperature range from 230 to 345 K.\n\nFor motions on the order of tens of kilohertz, 1H T 1\u03c1 values were measured using a spin-locking field of 62.5 kHz, equivalent to that used in the CP/MAS experiments. For hardware reasons, the spin-locking field was not allowed to exceed 30 ms. Little decay of the 1H signal was seen in this temperature range. The 1H T 1\u03c1 times obtained from fits to the experimental data were also relatively constant at 150 \u00b1 30 ms. Because no data points could be acquired with spin-locking fields comparable to the relaxation time constant, there is significant uncertainty in the measurements. Nevertheless, the experimentally determined time constants are nearly independent of temperature.\n\nProton T 1 times can be measured indirectly from the 13C CP/MAS spectrum. The results for this sample are given in Table . The T 1 of 0.53 \u00b1 0.03 s obtained by this method is in good agreement with the value 0.51 s obtained by direct observation of the proton resonance. Although the protons are strongly dipolar coupled and hence yield a single-proton relaxation time indicative of the dominant relaxation site, relaxation measurements of the rare 13C spins allow one to probe spatially within the framework. The 13C T 1 relaxation times at the various sites were obtained by Torchia's technique and are reported in Table . As previously discussed, the 1H T 1 is increased in the static sample from 0.5 s in air to 15 s in a nitrogen atmosphere. When the 1H spin-lattice relaxation time is measured indirectly by 13C NMR combined with MAS for a sample packed in the rotor in air with the rotor driven by compressed air, the same 1H T 1 of 0.5 s is obtained under MAS. However, when the sample is packed in the rotor under a nitrogen atmosphere with the rotor driven by nitrogen gas, the proton spin-lattice relaxation times become two orders of magnitude longer. It is interesting to note that under the conditions of a nitrogen atmosphere and MAS, the methyl proton T 1 is longer than the T 1 for the other protons. The combination of internal molecular motion, that is, the rotation of the methyl group, and the MAS provides some attenuation of the proton homonuclear coupling, reducing the spin diffusion between the methyl protons and the others.\n\nSimilar NMR relaxation results were obtained for another member of this family, ZIF-4, in which the Zn atoms are linked by an unsubstituted imidazolate. For ZIF-4 in air, paramagnetic oxygen has an even greater effect on nuclear spin relaxation. The 1H T 1 value at 296 K is 63 \u00b1 7 ms, almost an order of magnitude shorter than that measured for ZIF-8. In the presence of nitrogen, the 1H T 1 time increases to 115000 \u00b1 12000 ms. The 1H T 1\u03c1 time remains relatively long at 60 \u00b1 7 ms for air and nitrogen atmospheres. ZIF-4 crystallizes with a lower symmetry than ZIF-8 in the orthorhombic space group Pbca. Unlike ZIF-8 in which all the methylimidazolate rings are equivalent, three individual resonances are resolved in the CP/MAS spectra for each type of carbon atom (Figure C) as well as for the nitrogen atom (Figure D)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['etc', 'space_group']"}]}

The reason is that not only these four kinds of dyes are suitable for pore permeation in the structure but also their large UV/vis absorption extinction coefficients are able to facilitate the detection and quantification of their uptake by FJI-H-U1. Identical amounts (5 mg) of freshly prepared crystals of FJI-H-U1 were soaked in the solution of these organic dyes at room temperature. The UV/vis absorbance of dyes was monitored after 0, 1, 6, 13, and 20 h.

Compared to literature values, the Q st of TMOF-1 is higher than those of most of the unfunctionalized carboxylate-based MOFs without exposed metal sites or amine functionality, confirming the high affinity of TMOF-1 for CO2. In addition, after TMOF-1 had been soaked in 1 bar CO2 for 1 h at room temperature, the material exhibited a characteristic CO2 absorption band at 2335 cm-1 in the infrared spectrum, confirming the strong interaction between CO2 and TMOF-1 even under ambient conditions (Figure S3). Besides CO2 sorption, the H2 sorption isotherms of TMOF-1 exhibit a steep increase at low pressure with a Q st of 9.0 kJ/mol, resulting in H2 uptake capacities of 0.9 wt % (77 K, 1 bar) and 0.75 wt % (87 K, 1 bar) (d). The high Q st value is likely related to the increased extent of H2-host interaction, due to the narrow pore size from the 2-fold interpenetration. \n\nTo examine in detail the interaction between CO2 and embedded sulfonate moieties in TMOF-1, we employed both control experiments and DFT calculations. First, we synthesized a doubly interpenetrated carboxylate-based Cu(II) MOF, [Cu2(bpy)(bdc)2] n  [MOF-508b(Cu)], which possesses the same N-donor ligand and a prototypical primitive-cubic topology, as well. Despite the fact that its BET surface area (364 m2/g) is slightly larger than that of TMOF-1 (256 m2/g) (Figure S4), its CO2 uptake value at 298 K and 1 bar is <40% compared to that of TMOF-1 (c). More importantly, the zero-coverage Q st of this carboxylate MOF is as low as 19.2 kJ/mol, measured using variable-temperature CO2 sorption under identical conditions. This value agrees well with the literature value (15-19 kJ/mol) of the isostructural MOF-508b(Zn). \n\nIn addition to control experiments of CO2 capture, we performed first-principles calculations based on dispersion-corrected DFT to investigate the CO2 binding sites residing in TMOF-1 (see the Supporting Information for calculation details). By adding CO2 molecules to the cavity of TMOF-1, we discovered that the adsorbed CO2 inside TMOF-1 reaches up to four molecules per unit cell at 298 K and 1 bar of CO2, which is equivalent to a CO2 uptake of ~78 mg/g. The most energetically stable adsorption site (two such sites per unit cell) is shown in , where each CO2 is surrounded by four sulfonate groups from the two adjacent EDS linkers, confirming the strong binding between CO2 and organosulfonate functionalities. The calculated free energy of adsorption after the correction of vibrational entropy and the zero-point energy is 29.2 kJ/mol, which agrees well with the experimentally measured Q st (30.9 kJ/mol). Importantly, our first-principles molecular dynamics simulation confirms that these captured CO2 molecules together with TMOF-1 are energetically stable at room temperature (Figure S5). Adding CO2 above the ~39 mg/g capacity, we found the new additional CO2 would reside in the spare porosity adjacent to the adsorbed CO2 molecules, which are distal (\u22655.9 \u00c5) to the sulfonate groups within the TMOF-1 framework. These CO2 molecules are rather weakly adsorbed, with an adsorption free energy value of -3.3 kJ/mol. The proposed CO2 diffusion channels were analyzed, as well, on the basis of the MD trajectories (Figure S6). According to computational results, the CO2 molecules can easily diffuse through the 3D-interconnected porosity of the TMOF-1 with a low free energy barrier (only ~0.3 eV). Overall, the CO2-sulfonate interaction obviously plays an important role in the CO2 capture of TMOF-1.\n\nThe thermal stability of TMOF-1 was investigated in detail by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and ex situ PXRD ( and Figure S7). An ~10.0% weight loss occurs after heating beyond 100 \u00b0C, ascribed to the removal of solvent H2O molecules in the pores. The anhydrous phase is stable up to ~300 \u00b0C until the decomposition of bpy and EDS. Ex situ PXRD of heating TMOF-1 to 260 \u00b0C in air confirms the retention of the as-synthesized 3D porous topology (). The chemical stability of TMOF-1 was examined in polar and nonpolar boiling solvents (water, methanol, and n-hexane), a HCl solution (pH 3), and a NaOH solution (pH 10). After incubation in these solutions for 24 h, the high crystallinity of the primitive-cubic topology is retained well, as evidenced by PXRD patterns (). Besides PXRD, a <10 wt % decrease in mass was observed after the thermal and chemical treatment, which is likely due to the solvent loss after activation (Table S1). To further confirm the strong water-stable nature of TMOF-1, in situ optical microscopy was employed to monitor the crystallinity throughout the immersion of MOF in an acid/base solution (Figure S8). The size and morphology did not change in an observable manner. Importantly, the porosity of the material was largely retained after refluxing in water, evidenced by BET measurements (238 m2/g) using Ar at 87 K (Figure S9). Note that only a limited number of carboxylate MOFs with permanent porosity demonstrate excellent stability in boiling water, or in aqueous solutions over a wide pH range. Indeed, divalent metal carboxylate MOFs (e.g., Cu2 or Zn2 paddlewheel) are subject to hydrolysis and usually quite soluble in aqueous solutions. It is likely that the typical Jahn-Teller distorted octahedral coordination geometry of Cu(II) in our TMOF-1 was less susceptible to hydrolysis than the conventional five-coordinate Cu centers in Cu2 paddlewheel SBUs.\n\nGiven the strong inherent CO2 affinity and highly robust nature of TMOF-1, we sought to investigate the embedded Cu(II) Lewis acidic sites for CO2-related heterogeneous catalytic reactions. As a benchmark reaction, cycloaddition of CO2 and epoxides to form cyclic carbonates is of great interest in the chemical industry, because of the wide application of carbonates in pharmaceuticals. High pressure and/or temperature is necessary for this CO2 fixation by common catalysts, such as metal-salen complexes, metal oxides, and zeolites. A few recent studies employed MOFs as promising and efficient catalytic materials to convert captured CO2 to cyclic carbonates. In conjunction with tetra-n-tert-butylammonium bromide (TBAB) as a cocatalyst under ambient conditions (i.e., room temperature, 1 bar), TMOF-1 exhibited a nearly quantitative yield in converting 2-methyloxirane to the corresponding cyclic carbonate (, entry 1). The high efficiency of this catalytic activity was successfully extended to functionalized (e.g., -CH3, -Cl, or -Br) 2-methyloxirane substrates (, entries 2-5). By comparison, these catalytic activities are significantly higher than that of the benchmark Cu(II)-carboxylate MOF, HKUST-1, which showed a moderate yield in the range of 50-60%. Meanwhile, a control reaction without any catalyst gave negligible conversion. However, for bulky epoxide substrates such as styrene oxide, TMOF-1 gave a yield of only 39(3)% (, entry 6). This lower yield is probably due to the steric hindrance on the \u03b2-carbon of the substrates, hampering nucleophilic attack from TBAB (see the mechanism in Figure S10). To confirm the heterogeneous and reusable nature of the catalysis, TMOF-1 demonstrated excellent recyclability in converting 2-(chloromethyl)oxirane without a significant decrease in yield [86-92% (Figure S11)]. Between each run, the catalyst was recovered by filtration, rinsed with methanol, dried in air, and reused on subsequent reactions without further treatment. Importantly, the crystallinity of TMOF-1 was maintained after each cycle, as indicated by PXRD (Figure S12). In addition, the filtrate of catalysis reactions contained <0.1 ppm Cu, as evidenced by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). All these results point to the heterogeneity of the MOF catalyst. Overall, the high efficiency and reusability presented here prove that TMOF-1 can catalytically achieve successful cycloaddition of captured CO2 to form cyclic carbonates."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['gas_adsorption', 'surface_area', 'decomposition_temperature', 'catalytic_activity', 'etc']"}]}

Two mass steps are observed in the TGA curve in the range of 30-300 \u00b0C that are each accompanied by an endothermic event in the DSC curve (Figure , upper). The TG steps are well-resolved and separated. The experimental mass losses of \u0394m exp(1st step) = 9.9% and \u0394m exp(2nd step) = 9.7% are in good agreement with that calculated for the release of each four water molecules [\u0394m calc(4H2O) = 10.2%]. On the basis of the experimental mass losses, it can be assumed that in the first step the tetrahydrate [Mn(bdcbpy)(OH2)4] n  is formed leading to the formation of the anhydrate [Mn(bdcbpy)] n  (1') upon further heating before it starts decomposing at ~300 \u00b0C. The four noncoordinating water molecules are most likely released first, followed by the four coordinating water molecules, because of their strong hydrogen bonding interactions with the framework (Table ).\n\nAs found from elemental analysis, {[Ni(bdcbpy)(OH2)4]\u22c54H2O} n  (2) partially dehydrates instantly after synthesis and workup at room temperature. It can be assumed that one of the volatile noncoordinating water molecules leaves the framework giving a new composition of {[Ni(bdcbpy)(OH2)4]\u22c53H2O} n . This heptahydrate shows a significantly different dehydration behavior than compound 1. Three mass steps are observed in the TGA curve in the range of 30-300 \u00b0C that are each accompanied by an endothermic event in the DSC curve (Figure , lower). The experimental mass losses of \u0394m exp(1st step) = 8.0%, \u0394m exp(2nd step) = 7.4%, and \u0394m exp = 3.1% (3rd step) are in good agreement with that calculated for the release of three water molecules in the 1st/2nd step [\u0394m calc(3H2O) = 7.8%] and one water molecule in the third step [\u0394m calc(1H2O) = 2.6%]. As with compound 1, the noncoordinating water molecules are most likely released first before releasing the metal-coordinating water molecules. However, the next heating event in 2 is separated into two steps as compared to 1. This observation can be explained based on the different metal-water coordination strengths and hydrogen bonding interactions. As shown in Table , the metal-Owater distances in 2 are significantly shorter with 2.050(2)-2.099(2) \u00c5, as compared to those of 1 with 2.158(2)-2.228(2) \u00c5, which indicates a stronger bonding in 2. Also, as shown in Table  and Figure b, there are two metal-coordinating water molecules, namely, O1W and O4W, which are stabilized by two hydrogen bonding interactions and with O1W showing in average stronger hydrogen bonds than O4W, while O2W and O3W show instead only one hydrogen bond. This environment makes O1W the strongest-bonded water molecule in 2, and thus, it can be assumed that this water molecule is released last upon heating. These energetic differences in the metal-water coordination are less pronounced in 1 and, thus, not resolved in the TGA curve of 1. Heating rate-dependent TGA and DSC measurements of 1 showed no impact on the resolution of this heating step ().\n\nAdsorption Properties\n\nGas-adsorption measurements at 77 K reveal that both compounds have no affinity to N2. Further adsorption experiments with CO2 at 195 K show no significant uptake. However, a H2 adsorption of 8.6 cm3/g for 1 and 11.6 cm3/g for 2 can be observed, which can be regarded as a significant uptake capacity taking the potential void space of only 13.2% for 1 and 18.0% for 2 into account (Figure ). Although it is not among those with the highest H2 uptake, the positive slope at 1 bar, which is an indication of unsaturation, shows that they may have higher hydrogen uptake capacities under higher pressures."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['decomposition_temperature', 'gas_adsorption']"}]}

The asymmetric unit contains one-quarter Cu+ ion and half of [V6O13(L)2]2- cluster. The Cu+ ion employs a slightly distorted tetrahedral geometry and is ligated by four pyridyl nitrogen atoms from different 1a anions with N-Cu-N bond angles of about 104.46(15) and 112.04(8)\u00b0 (b). The Cu-N bond length is 2.035(3) \u00c5, which is comparable with the reported Cu+-based frameworks. Every 1a anion acts as a linear bridge to join two neighboring Cu+ ions, and the Cu-Cu distance is about 2.09 nm. Such linkage between tetrahedral Cu+ ions and linear 1a anions lead to the creation of a 3D anionic framework with diamond topology (c and S2). It is noteworthy that Hill and co-workers made the first Lindqvist-type POM-based cluster organic framework Tb[V6O13{(OCH2)3C(NH2CH2C6H4-4-CO2)}{(OCH2)3C(NHCH2-C6H4-4-CO2)}2] (Tb1). However, an auxiliary ligand 4,4-bis(pyridine-N-oxide) is indispensable in their assembly process for the formation of the framework structure. Comparatively, no additional auxiliary ligand is needed during the formation of the framework of 2. The size of tetragonal channels based on opposite atoms and polyhedra in 2 is about 2.43 \u00d7 4.24 nm2. The whole size of the diamondoid cage is 5.88 \u00d7 4.21 nm2, and the inner diameter is about 3.04 nm (d). Such extremely porous characteristic gives rise to 6-fold interpenetration of six symmetry-related frameworks (e). Although the final structure is 6-fold interpenetrated, there is still a large irregular channels with size of about 0.90 \u00d7 0.90 nm2 in the ab plane. The disordered TBA cations and solvent molecules which play the role of charge balancing and framework stabilization occupied those approximate nanoscale channels. PLATON calculation indicates that the total empty volume of the 6-fold interpenetrated anionic framework is 1764.8 \u00c53, corresponding to 41.2% of the total crystal volume (4287.0 \u00c53).\n\nCrystal Structural Description of 3 \n\nSCXRD analysis revealed that 3 crystallizes in the centrosymmetric space group R3\u0305 and exhibits a 3D structure.

Different from Cu+ ion in 2, the Ag+ ion in 3 has a square-planar geometry and is surrounded by two nitrogen atoms from two pyridyl groups and two bridge oxygen atoms of two Linqvist-type clusters (a). The Ag-N and Ag-O bond distances are 2.174(5) and 2.811(5) \u00c5, respectively. In 3, the Ag+ ions are linked by [V6O13(L)2]2- polyanions to give rise to an infinite 1D cluster chain with Ag-Ag distance of 2.13 nm (a). The most intriguing structural feature in 3 is further assembly of these 1D cluster chains. Three discrete chains are aligned in a crossed mode to generate a unique layer containing a three-membered window in the ab plane (Figure S3). The adjoining layer is rotated by 60\u00b0 along the vertical axis in the center of the three-membered window, giving rise to a larger six-membered hole and a smaller three-membered hole along the c axis (b,c and S4). Furthermore, the adjacent layers are interconnected by Ag-O bonds of two intersected chains from different layers, resulting in the formation of a 3D open framework with two kinds of channels with smaller triangular and large hexagonal shapes (d). As is well known, such structure is not common in cluster organic framework materials. The size of the larger hexagonal channel is about 1.52 nm. The total potential accessible volume of the framework is about 50.6% based on PLATON calculation, which is a slightly higher than that of 2.\n\nPXRD Patterns, Thermalgravimetric Analysis, and IR Spectra\n\nIn powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) of 2, the good consistence between the experimental pattern of the as-synthesized sample and the simulated pattern based on SCXRD result indicates the phase purity of 2 ().

The curve indicates the elimination of three lattice water molecules (9.0%, cal. 9.1%) and one coordination water molecule (3.2%, cal. 3.1%) in the ranges of 25-88 \u00b0C and 88-150 \u00b0C, respectively ( in the ).\n\nPhotoluminescence Properties\n\nWhen the samples were excited with a UV lamp (365 nm), complexes 1 and 2 emitted distinct colors from those of complexes 3 and 4, as shown in Figure , which were readily observed with the naked eye. Moreover, the photoluminescence intensity of complexes 2 and 4 is stronger than that of 1 and 3, respectively. To look into these differences in photoluminescence properties in the solid state, excitation and emission spectra were recorded at room temperature. The excitation spectra of complexes 1 and 2 were recorded by monitoring the intensity of the 5D0 \u2192 7F2 transition of the Eu3+ ion (615 nm for 1 and 618 nm for 2, Figure ). For complex 1, a broad band that ranged from 240 to 375 nm with a peak at 335 nm can be assigned to the \u03c0-\u03c0* ligand transition, and the narrow bands that are centered at 381, 395, 416, and 465 nm can be assigned to transitions of Eu3+ from 7F0,1 \u2192 5L7, 5L6, 5D3, and 5D2, respectively. However, these transitions are weaker than the absorption of the organic ligand and are overlapped by a broad excitation band, indicating that the luminescence sensitization via the excitation of the ligand is much more efficient than the direct excitation of the Eu3+ ion absorption level. For complex 2, the \u03c0-\u03c0* ligand transition red shifts to the range of 240-380 nm with a peak at 350 nm, which is attributed to the higher electron density of the conjugate system of the OBPT ligand in 2 resulting from the breaking of the Eu-OL bond. Meanwhile, the 7F0,1 \u2192 5L7 transition, which is the characteristic energy level of Eu3+ and is observed in 1, is covered by the \u03c0-\u03c0* ligand transition in 2, indicating that the antenna effect of the ligand is still efficient for Eu3+. The excitation spectra also illustrate that complex 2 is more efficiently excited than complex 1 under a UV lamp (365 nm, Figures  and ). The emission spectra of 1 and 2 were recorded under the excitation wavelength at 350 nm and exhibited a classical pattern for Eu3+ that is caused by the transition of the first excited state, 5D0, to the ground septet, 7F J  (J = 0-4) (Figure ). The 5D0 \u2192 7F0 transition is very weak and is at 580 nm. The moderately strong 5D0 \u2192 7F1 transition splits into three peaks at 589, 593, and 596 nm. The peaks at about 650 and 653 nm correspond to the characteristic 5D0 \u2192 7F3 transition, and the 5D0 \u2192 7F4 transition splits into three peaks at 687, 695, and 698 nm. It is noted that the hypersensitive 5D0 \u2192 7F2 transition also splits into three peaks at 615, 618, and 621 nm, resulting in red luminescence. However, the strongest band in complex 1 is at 615 nm with a intensity ratio of I 615/I 618 = 5.2 that shifts to 618 nm with a ratio I 615/I 618 = 0.38 in complex 2. The intensity ratio of the I(5D0 \u2192 7F2)/I(5D0 \u2192 7F1) transitions is very sensitive to the symmetry of Eu3+, with 9.6 for 1 and 4.5 for 2 indicating that the symmetry of the Eu3+ site in 1 is lower than that of 2, which is in good agreement with the results of the single-crystal X-ray analysis.\n\nThe room-temperature solid-state excitation and emission spectra of complexes 3 and 4 are presented in Figure . The excitation spectra of 3 and 4 were monitored around the 5D4 \u2192 7F5 transition of Tb3+ and show broad bands in the range of 240-390 nm, which can be assigned to the \u03c0-\u03c0* ligand transition. The absence or weakness of the absorption bands for the f-f transition of Tb3+ indicates that the luminescence sensitization via the ligand is more sensitive. The emission spectra of 3 and 4, excited at 350 nm, present a series of characteristic emission bands of Tb3+ that are centered at 489, 542, 584, 623, 653, 667, and 680 nm, which result from transitions of the 5D4 excited state to the corresponding ground state 7F J  (J = 6-0) of the Tb3+ ion.\n\nRoom-temperature time-resolved fluorescence was carried out by monitoring the most intense emission bands of 615 nm for 1, 618 nm for 2, and 542 nm for 3 and 4 upon excitation, with maximum peaks of the excitation spectra at 335 nm for 1, 370 nm for 2, 335 nm for 3, and 350 nm for 4. The luminescence lifetimes of 0.54 ms for 1, 1.40 ms for 2, 1.00 ms for 3, and 1.40 ms for 4 were obtained by fitting their decay curves to single-exponential functions ( in the ), indicating that only one emissive Ln3+ center exists in each complex. It is worth noting that complexes 2 and 4 have longer luminescence lifetimes than those of the corresponding complexes 1 and 3. This can be attributed to the luminescence quenching that is caused by the OH oscillators of the bonded water molecules in 1 and 3. \n\nSelective Sensing for Small Molecules\n\nThe obvious enhancement of the emission intensity in 2 that is caused by the displacement of the coordinated water in 1 by DMF encouraged us to observe the solvent-induced luminescent sensing for small solvent molecules. The powdery samples of 1 were immersed in acetone, ethyl acetate (EA), ethanol, acetonitrile, methanol, THF, and DMF solvents for 0.5 h. The solvents on the surface of the samples were absorbed with filter paper, and the samples were fixed and sealed in a quartz cell for luminescence experiments upon excitation at 365 nm. The photoluminescence response of 1 for the various small molecules is shown in Figure . The histogram (Figure ) clearly shows that most of the solvents give a negligible change in luminescence; however, DMF triggers a marked luminescence enhancement of more than 11-fold. Moreover, the strongest band is shifted from 615 to 618 nm."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['decomposition_temperature', 'peak_spectrum']"}]}

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that all complexes exhibit a rare (4,8)-connected alb-4,8-P topology with binuclear [Eu2(COO)8] n  secondary building units as 8-connected nodes and H4L ligands as 4-connected nodes. Two mixed-lanthanide analogues of single-lanthanide MOFs were designed and prepared [Ln = La0.93Eu0.02Tb0.05 (9) and Tm0.47Eu0.18Tb0.35 (10)] by way of careful regulation of the relative concentration of lanthanide ions which are able to emit pure white light. Luminescent sensing of complexes 3 and 5 has been investigated. Strikingly, complex 5 exhibits an excellent luminescent sensing to TNP with a high K sv value of 3.58 \u00d7 104 M-1 and a low detection limit of 4.66 \u00d7 10-4 mM. Complex 3 reveals high selectivity and sensitivity toward benzaldehyde (K sv of 4.9 \u00d7 104 M-1; detection limit of 3.4 \u00d7 10-4 mM). It represents the first example of an NIR luminescent MOF for sensing of benzaldehyde.\n\nLuminescence\n\nPhotoluminescent spectra for all single-lanthanide complexes 1-8 were conducted in solid state at room temperature ( and S6-S10). Complexes 1 and 8 exhibit lanthanide ion tuned ligand-centered emission at 426 and 421 nm under excitation at 398 and 394 nm, respectively. Complex 4 exhibits co-luminescence of the Sm3+ ion and the ligand excited at 417 nm, implying that the H4L ligand can only partly sensitize the Sm3+ ion. Complex 5 exhibits an intense characteristic red emission of Eu3+ with peaks located at 590, 614, 648, and 698 nm upon being excited at 398 nm, respectively, which are attributed to the 5D0 \u2192 7F J  (J = 1-4) transitions of the Eu3+ ion (b). The lifetime and quantum yield of complex 5 are \u03c41 = 0.26 ms (4.67%), \u03c42 = 1.10 ms (95.33%), and \u03a6 = 21.78%. In contrast, complex 2 reveals the NIR luminescence around 1020 and 1227 nm when excited at 420 nm, which are attributed to f-f transitions of 1D2 \u2192 3F4 and 1G4 \u2192 3H4 for the Pr3+ ion, respectively (Figure S7). Complex 3 exhibits the characteristic NIR luminescence around 890, 1054, and 1326 nm under excitation at 386 nm that can be attributed to the 4F3/2 \u2192 4F9/2, 4F3/2 \u2192 4F11/2, and 4F3/2 \u2192 4F13/2 transitions of the Nd3+ ion, respectively (Figure S8). The lifetime and quantum yield are \u03c41 = 2.11 \u03bcs (41.83%), \u03c42 = 7.51 \u03bcs (58.17%), and \u03a6 = 1.9%. Notably, the lifetimes and yields of complexes 3 and 5 are comparable to those of the reported neodymium and europium complexes ().\n\nIn view of that complexes 1-8 are isostructural and complexes 1 and 8 exhibit intense blue emission (a,d), it will, therefore, be possible to construct white-light-emitting materials by doping of both Eu3+ ions and Tb3+ ions into the host frameworks of complexes 1 or 8 with an appropriate molar ratio. In fact, the designed mixed-lanthanide complexes 9 and 10 have realized the white-light emission when excited at 320 and 322 nm (). The optimal concentrations of the components are 93 mol % for La3+ ions, 2 mol % for Eu3+ ions, and 5 mol % ions for Tb3+ ions in complex 9, and 47 mol % for Tm3+ ions, 18 mol % for Eu3+ ions, and 35 mol % for Tb3+ ions in complex 10. The CIE coordinates (0.329, 0.333) and (0.331, 0.336) for complexes 9 and 10, respectively, fall within the white-light region of the 1931 CIE chromaticity diagram. The quantum yield \u03a6overall is 15.3% for complex 9 and 13.9% for complex 10. The lifetimes are \u03c4Tb = 785 \u03bcs (monitored at 542 nm) and \u03c4Eu = 436 \u03bcs (monitored at 614 nm) for complex 9, \u03c4Tb = 705 \u03bcs (monitored at 542 nm) and \u03c4Eu = 405 \u03bcs (monitored at 614 nm) for complex 10, respectively (Figures S12 and S13). The CRI index (80.2 and 78.7) and CCT value (5652 and 5558 K) could also be readily realized for complexes 9 and 10. Notably, the quantum yield of complex 9 is slightly higher than that of complex 10, attributed to the poor sensitivity of the ligand to the Tm3+ ion. In comparison with the quantum yields with previously reported three-component analogues (), the quantum yields of complexes 9 and 10 are higher than those of La0.6Eu0.1Tb0.3CPOMBA (H3CPOMBA = 4,4'-(((5-carboxy-1,3-phenylene)bis(oxy))bis(methylene)), [Sm41.26Gd44.72Eu14.02(4-SBA)(IP)OH] and [Sm27.93Tb53.13Eu18.94(4-SBA)(IP)OH] (4-SBA = 4-sulfobenzoate and IP = 1H-imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]-phenanthroline), but lower than those of La0.6Eu0.1Tb0.3-BTPCA (H3BTPCA = (1,1',1-(benzene-1,3,5-triyl)tripiperidine-4-carboxylic acid) and [H2NMe2]3[Gd1-x-y Eu x Tb y (L)3] (L = pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid). \n\nThe quenching efficiency can be quantitatively explained by the Stern-Volmer (SV) equation: I/I 0 = K sv[Q] + 1, where I and I 0 are the luminescent intensities of the suspension of complex 5 before and after for sensing nitro aromatic compounds, [Q] is the molar concentration of analytes (M-1), and K sv is the Stern-Volmer constant. In this work, the SV plots for all analytes are nearly linear in the range of low concentrations; the K sv can then be estimated as 1.39 \u00d7 103 M-1 for NB, 1.9 \u00d7 103 M-1 for m-DNB, 2.33 \u00d7 103 M-1 for 2,4-DNT, 2.4 \u00d7 103 M-1 for 2,6-DNT, and 3.58 \u00d7 104 M-1 for TNP, respectively (Figures S15-S19). Particularly, the K sv value of complex 5 is comparable to that of most of the MOF-based probes toward TNP reported recently (Table S3). On the basis of K sv values and the standard deviations for five repeated luminescent measurements of blank solutions, the detection limits (3\u03c3/K sv) of complex 5 toward five nitro aromatic compounds are also calculated (Table S1). For complex 5, TNP is the most efficient quencher with a detection limit of 4.66 \u00d7 10-4 mM. The high quenching constant and low detection limits indicate that complex 5 exhibits extremely high detection sensitivity toward TNP (). In addition, complex 5 can be recycled by centrifuging the suspension after use and washing several times with DMAC; the luminescent intensity and quenching ability of complex 5 exhibited negligible changes after being used for four repeated cycles (d). The identical structure of the regenerative sample is demonstrated by the corresponding PXRD patterns (Figure S20). Similarly, The H4L ligand was also employed as a luminescent sensor toward the detection of TNP in DMAC. The emission spectra of H4L dispersed in DMAC were investigated upon incremental addition of TNP contents. The K sv value of the H4L ligand is 2.9 \u00d7 104 M-1 for TNP, which is smaller than 3.58 \u00d7 104 M-1 of complex 5 (). This indicated that the framework of complex 5 is more efficient than the H4L ligand for the detecting of TNP, which may be attributed to the presence of pores in the framework to facilitate possible host-guest interactions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['topology', 'peak_spectrum', 'etc']"}]}

PXRD confirmed its purity (Figure S3). Then, the reaction of Cu3 cluster with H2BDC in 85 \u00b0C gave the blue block crystal of HBNU-1 formulated as [Cu3(\u03bc3-OH) (pz)3(BDC)1.5(DMF)]\u22c5(DMF)2\u22c5(HDMA)\u22c5(H2O). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction showed that HBNU-1 crystallized in triclinic P1\u0305 space group with lattice parameter a = 10.6498(4) \u00c5, b = 12.5501(4) \u00c5, c = 16.9471(5) \u00c5, \u03b1 = 99.125(1)\u00b0, \u03b2 = 97.698(1)\u00b0, and \u03b3 = 98.722(1)\u00b0. The asymmetric unit of HBNU-1 is composed of a trinuclear complex Cu3(\u03bc3-OH)(pz)3, one and a half BDC molecules, one terminal DMF, two guest DMF molecules, one guest DMA, and one water molecules (a). In the trinuclear Cu3 cluster, Cu1 and Cu2 were four-coordinated and connected to two pyrazoles, one \u03bc3-OH, and one BDC ligand, respectively. However, the Cu3 was five-coordinated and linked to two pyrazoles, one \u03bc3-OH, one BDC ligand, and a terminal DMF. The water molecule interacted with the uncoordinated oxygen atoms in BDC by O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bonds (O1W\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O3: 2.80 \u00c5, \u2220DHA = 162\u00b0, O1W\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O7: 2.78 \u00c5, \u2220DHA = 135\u00b0). One guest DMF molecule also interacted with the \u03bc3-OH moiety by O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bond (O1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O10: 2.74 \u00c5, \u2220DHA = 163\u00b0). Interestingly, the guest DMA molecule was protonated and interacted with the water molecule by O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bond (O11-H2O\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O1W: 1.85 \u00c5, \u2220DHA = 167\u00b0) (b). Each Cu3 cluster connected to three BDC ligands, forming a 2D honeycomb sheet (c). Each sheet interacted with guest DMF or DMA molecules by hydrogen bonds and then DMF or DMA interacted with another sheet by weak C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions between the -CH3 groups and the pz moeities, thus forming a 3D supramolecular structure (d). Adjacent two sheets formed 9 \u00c5 \u00d7 13 \u00c5 cavities, which were filled with four guest DMF molecules (e). The phase purity was confirmed by the similarity between the simulated and experimental PXRD patterns (Figure S4). For further investigating the stability of HBNU-1, PXRD were conducted after the sample was treated under different temperatures and in different solvents, respectively. HBNU-1 could be stable to about 80 \u00b0C, and when heated to 100 \u00b0C, the crystallinity got very poor, indicating collapse of framework (Figure S5). In addition, HBNU-1 could be stable in common organic solvents such as DMF, DMA, MeOH, EtOH, and MeCN but could not sustain in water (Figure S6). TGA showed that HBNU-1 had a continuous weight loss before 450 \u00b0C, indicating the unstability nature of HBNU-1 (Figure S7). The N2 adsorption test was tried but failed as the sample of HBNU-1 was collapsed after activation in vacuum at 50 \u00b0C which was confirmed by PXRD (Figure S8).\n\nThe reaction of the Cu3 cluster with H2BDC in 100 \u00b0C gave the dark red block crystals of HBNU-2 formulated as [Cu3(\u03bc3-O)(pz)3][Cu3(\u03bc3-OH)(pz)3][Cu(BDC)2.5(H2O)]\u22c5(DMF)4\u22c5(H2O)2. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction showed that HBNU-2 crystallized in orthorhombic Cmmm space group with lattice parameter a = 12.94 \u00c5, b = 29.05 \u00c5, and c = 20.34 \u00c5. In the asymmetric unit of HBNU-2, there were three kinds of crystallographic unique Cu atoms in which Cu1 and Cu2 are composed of half a Cu3 cluster and Cu3 is composed of a quarter paddle-wheel structures with a quarter terminal water molecules (a). It was noteworthy that there were three different kinds of Cu clusters in the structure which was relatively rare in reported MOFs till now, namely, Cu3(\u03bc3-O)(pz)3, Cu3(\u03bc3-OH)(pz)3, and Cu2(COO)4 paddle-wheel, respectively. Furthermore, the clusters of Cu3(\u03bc3-O)(pz)3 and Cu3(\u03bc3-OH)(pz)3 were connected by three carboxyl groups in BDC ligands, thus dimerizing into a novel Cu6 clusters (b). Each Cu6 cluster is linked to three BDC ligands and each BDC is connected to one Cu6 cluster and one paddle-wheel, thus generating a 2D sheet (c). Each adjacent sheet interacted with each other by \u03bc3-OH\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03bc3-O hydrogen bonds from the Cu3 cluster moieties, leading to the generation of 3D supramolecular structure (d). There were two kinds of channels in direction [100], namely, rhombic and triangular shapes, whose sizes were 9 and 7 \u00c5 measured by Material Studio, respectively (e). Solvent accessible volume was calculated to be as high as 51.4% with PLATON packages. Topology analysis was done by TOPOS 4.0 software package. Each Cu6 cluster is connected to three BDC ligands and interacted with other two Cu6 clusters by hydrogen bonds, so each Cu6 cluster could be simplified as a 5-connected node; and each paddle-wheel could be simplified as a 4-connected node, thus forming a (4,5)-connected mcf-d topology. The point symbol for net was {4\u22c556\u22c563}2{42\u22c562\u22c572}. Phase purity was confirmed by the similarity of the simulated and experimental PXRD patterns (Figure S9). For further investigating the stability of HBNU-2, PXRD were conducted after the sample was treated under different temperatures and in different solvents, respectively. HBNU-2 could be stable to about 100 \u00b0C (Figure S10). In addition, HBNU-2 could keep its crystallinity in DMF, DMA, and MeOH. However, when immersing in DMSO, HBNU-2 got bad and completely collapsed in water, indicating its poor stability (Figure S11). TGA indicated that HBNU-2 had a 3% weight loss before 200 \u00b0C which was mainly attributed to guest molecules in channels. As temperature increased continually, the framework collapsed rapidly (Figure S12).\n\nTo assess the porosity of HBNU-2, the sample activation was done before N2 adsorption measurement at 77 K. The sample was soaked in MeOH for 2 days and then in CH2Cl2 for other 2 days before treating in 80 \u00b0C for 8 h. N2 sorption isotherm showed a typical type-I adsorption curve, indicating the microporosity nature of HBNU-2. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area was calculated to be about 488 m2 g-1 with the pore volume 0.808 cm3 g-1. Pore size distribution was calculated according to the nonlocal density functional theory, which showed two narrow pore width distribution located at 6.1 and 8.5 \u00c5, well agreed with that measured by material studio mentioned above ().\n\nTo evaluate the sorption performance of HBNU-2, N2 and CO2 adsorption experiments were conducted. The maximum adsorption amounts of CO2 were 48.68 and 35.30 cm3 g-1 at 273 and 298 K, respectively; and the results of N2 were 13.97 and 4.21 cm3 g-1, respectively (a). For further investigation of CO2/N2 separation performance of HBNU-2, ideal adsorption solution theory (IAST) method was used. The dual-site Langmuir-Freundlich equation was adopted for nonlinear curve fitting the experimental data (Figure S13). The selectivities for CO2/N2 were 11.73 and 9.33 at 273 and 298 K under 101 kPa, respectively (b). This relatively low adsorption capacity of CO2 and CO2/N2 selectivity than many MOFs (Table S1) was mainly attributed to the nonunsaturated metal sites in the Cu6 clusters."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['chemical_formula_weight', 'crystal_system', 'space_group', 'lattice_parameters', 'topology', 'decomposition_temperature', 'surface_area', 'pore_volume', 'gas_adsorption', 'porosity']"}]}

To study the photocatalytic activity of compound 1, we select methylene blue (MB) as a model of dye contaminant to evaluate the photocatalytic effectiveness. The experiments were performed in typical processes. A suspension containing 1 (40 mg) and 80 mL of MB (4.0 \u00d7 10-5 mol L-1) solution was stirred in the dark for about 30 min. Then, the mixture was stirred continuously under UV irradiation from a 350 W xenon lamp. A sample solution (2 ml) was taken every 30 min or 1 h and separated through centrifuge to remove suspended catalyst particles, while the starting point did not contain the first 30 min to rule out the effect of its absorption on the material surfaces. After filtration, the samples were analyzed by the UV-vis spectrophotometry. By contrast, the simple photolysis experiment was also completed under the same conditions without any catalyst. The organic dye concentrations were estimated by the absorbance at 665 nm (MB). Interestingly, approximately 58% of MB was decomposed during the first hour. After 4 h, the MB in the solution almost disappeared (Figure ). The results indicate that compound 1 has a high photocatalytic activity for the degradation of MB. Additionaly, the powders were obtained by filtration after photocatalytic reaction, and the PXRD patterns of each powder were basically identical to those of the parent compounds, indicating that these complexes are stable during photocatalysis ().\n\nLuminescent Properties\n\nThe photoluminescent properties of compounds 1 and 2 were investigated in the solid state at room temperature. The emission peaks of the compounds are shown in Figure . Compound 1 exhibits an intense emission between 430 and 575 nm (\u03bbmax = 487 nm upon excitation at 349 nm). The maximum emission peaks at about 421 nm (\u03bbex = 338 nm) were observed for compound 2. The \u03bbmax of free Tipa is 405 nm, while free 4,4'-bpdc ligand fluoresce in the solid state with their emission peaks at 396 nm. However, we did not observe obvious peak in the range of 350-450 nm for 1, indicating that there are no \u03c0*-\u03c0 transitions between Tipa ligands and the deprotonated acids. So the emission peaks for 1 and 2 can be attributed to the charge transfer (\u03c0\u2192\u03c0* and n\u2192\u03c0*) of internal Tipa ligands, and the red-shifted emission of 1 is attributed to the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transitions.\n\nGas Sorption Properties of Compound 2 \n\nTo investigate the permanent porosity of compound 2, gas sorption experiments evaluating N2, H2, and CO2 uptakes were performed. The freshly prepared samples of compound 2 were first activated through solvent exchange with acetone 10 times in 3 d, followed by the thermal/vacuum activation at 303 K to generate activated materials. As shown in Figure a, the N2 sorption isotherm at 77 K shows that 2 displays typical Type I sorption behavior, with Langmuir and BET surface areas of 484.8 and 348.8 m2 g-1, respectively. Meanwhile, it has a moderate absorption of H2 (95.7 cm3 g-1 STP, 0.89 wt %) at 77 K and 1 atm. The CO2 uptakes around 1 atm are 48.17 and 33.49 cm3 g-1 at 273 and 297 K, respectively (Figure b,c).\n\nThe small hydrocarbons, CH4, C2H2, and C2H4, are also selected as probe molecules to assess the gas adsorption properties of compound 2 (Figure b,c). As expected, compound 2 adsorbs much more C2 hydrocarbons than C1 methane. At 297 K and 1 atm, compound 2 can take up a moderate amount of C2H2 (64.13 cm3 g-1) and C2H4 (40.52 cm3 g-1), but basically a much smaller amount of CH4 (12.04 cm3 g-1), indicating that compound 2 is a promising material for selective separation of C2 hydrocarbons from CH4 at room temperature. To evaluate the affinity of gas molecules to compound 2, we calculated the isosteric enthalpies of adsorption (Q st) of CH4, C2H2, and C2H6 from the adsorption data using the virial method at zero coverage. The Q st value of CH4 for 2 is 22.72 kJ/mol, while the Q st values of C2H2 and C2H4 for 2 are 41.05 and 34.69 kJ/mol, respectively. It is worthy to mention that these Q st values of C2H2 and C2H4 are much higher than those observed with other MOFs, such as M'MOF-4a (36.0, 28.0 kJ/mol), M'MOF-2a (30.0, 22.5 kJ/mol), and Zn-MOF-74 (32, 23 kJ/mol). These results indicate that the surface of 2 has strong affinity with the light hydrocarbons.\n\nTo evaluate the gas separation ability of 2, the adsorption selectivities of C2H2/CH4, C2H4/CH4, and CO2/CH4 were calculated by Henry's law based on the equation S  ij  = KH(i)/KH(CH4). The calculated selectivities for C2H2, C2H4, and CO2 over CH4 are 67.9, 23.7, and 4.3 at 273 K, 39.1, 13.5, and 3.1 at 297 K, respectively, which are higher and comparable to the previously reported porous adsorbents, such as UTSA-34b (18-24), UTSA-35a (15-25), and mesoPOF (25-40). The C2H2/CH4 selectivity in compound 2 is one of the few highest values ever reported among the porous metal-organic materials. The highly selective sorption of 2 for C2H2 and CO2 makes it a good candidate for practical C2H2/CH4, C2H4/CH4, and CO2/CH4 separation application in the near future."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['surface_area', 'gas_adsorption', 'selectivity', 'peak_spectrum']"}]}

The slightly higher \u03c7T value is possibly due to the spin-orbit coupling of the high-spin d6 ions. From the \u03c7T vs T plot, it can be seen that the \u03c7T value decreases very slowly with a decrease in the temperature because of a weak antiferromagnetic coupling that may occur for FeII ions bridged by carboxylate groups. However, at low T (110 K), the \u03c7T value starts to rise with a decrease in the temperature and reaches 6.97 cm3\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1 at 9 K before a sharp fall to 5.40 cm3\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1 at 1.79 K. The rise of \u03c7T at low T might be due to the presence of an untraceable amount of iron oxide or might represent the result of structural reorientation, which is common for this kind of coordination network. However, low-temperature crystal measurements will be necessary to gain further insight. The sharp decrease of \u03c7T at very low temperature might be a result of the zero-field-splitting parameter (D).\n\nThe thermal stability of the compound was studied using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA; Figure S1 in the ). The compound loses lattice solvents slowly at the beginning. At the first visible step (204 \u00b0C), the slope suggests a weight loss of 22%, which counts for the detachment of five coordinated and noncoordinated MeOH and four O molecules, which possibly form as the decomposition products of two [ClO4]- anions as 2[ClO4]- \u2192 2Cl- + 4O2. This is in accordance with the calculated residual weight of 77.9%. Finally, the compound loses all of the organic components and results into a residual weight of 35.4% at 1000 \u00b0C.

The first event occurring from 216 up to 246 \u00b0C is assigned to the departure of two free water molecules and one aqua ligand (obsd: 4.52%; calcd: 4.42%) and indicates that the interactions of these water molecules with the framework are slightly strong, which ends at a somewhat high temperature. From then on, almost no loss is observed until 260 \u00b0C, at which temperature the compound begins to decompose. The second weight loss step up to 375 \u00b0C is attributed to the removal of three N-diacetate groups of the H2TTHA4- ligand (obsd: 31.96%; calcd: 32.14%). The last event, up to 633 \u00b0C, corresponds to the decomposition of the 4,4'-bipy and the triazine ring (obsd: 18.20%; calcd: 19.19%). For compound 2, an immediate weight loss upon heating is completed from 46 \u00b0C up to 122 \u00b0C, which can be attributed to the loss of three aqua ligands (obsd: 4.13%; calcd: 4.05%). The rapid weight loss starts at ~200 \u00b0C, up to 540 \u00b0C, corresponding to the decomposition of three N-diacetate groups of the TTHA4- ligand (obsd: 29.21%; calcd: 29.29%). The remaining weight loss to 735 \u00b0C is in good agreement with further the decomposition of the triazine ring (obsd: 5.68%; calcd: 5.86%). The TGA curve of compound 3 illustrates that there is a significant weight loss stage between 42 and 110 \u00b0C due to the loss of the hydronium, three aqua ligands, and the uncoordinated carboxylate group (obsd: 4.95%; calcd: 5.00%) because of the instability of the group as described in the X-ray crystallographic determination section. A rather complicated continuous weight loss profile starts at 200 \u00b0C, suggesting decomposition of the organic linkers.\n\nPhotoluminescent (PL) Properties and Detection for Nitrobenzene\n\nThe luminescent properties of UVI are of interest due to potential applications, including photocatalysis. The utilization of [UO2]2+ ions in compounds arranges the metal centers into an extended topology as well as allows for the introduction of chromophoric organic linkers, which could sensitize the [UO2]2+ luminescence. The luminescence of uranyl compounds centered near 520 nm has been known for centuries. The charge-transfer-based emission is vibronically coupled to both bending and stretching modes of the uranyl cation and typically consists of a five-peak spectrum, although far more lines can be observed at low temperature. Denning and his group members have examined in detail these transitions for the solid samples containing the [UO2Cl4]2- anion owing to its crystallization in a cubic space group. However, not all uranyl compounds possess luminescent properties, and the mechanisms of the emission from uranyl compounds are most often difficult to explain. As we reported here, unusual luminescent properties have been documented recently for a family of uranyl flexible hexapodal carboxylates. The luminescent spectra for these three novel carboxylate compounds (\u03bbex = 290 nm), the benchmark compound UO2(CH3COO)2\u22c52H2O (\u03bbex = 332 nm), and the ligand (\u03bbex = 262 nm) were collected under the same experimental conditions and procedures and are shown in . Five peaks (452, 470, 491, 515, and 538 nm) for 1 and four peaks (452, 470, 491, and 515 nm) for 2 and 3 are observed in the spectra, which all exhibit characterized emission from uranyl cations. These emission peaks correspond to the electronic and vibronic transitions of S11 \u2192 S00, S10 \u2192 S0v  (v = 0-3) for 1 and S11 \u2192 S00, S10 \u2192 S0v  (v = 0-2) for 2 and 3, and the most intense peak is positioned at 470 nm for these three compounds. As for the benchmark compound, the luminescent spectrum shows well-resolved sharp vibronic peaks at 488, 510, 533, 559, and 587 nm [corresponding to S11 \u2192 S00 and S10 \u2192 S0v  (v = 0-3)], and the most intense peak (S10 \u2192 S00) is positioned at 510 nm. These compounds exhibit a slight blue-shift of 40 nm along with lesser intensity for the emission bands compared to the benchmark compound. Such behaviors were previously observed for other uranyl complexes. Moreover, comparison of the observed spectrum for compound 1 to compounds 2 and 3 shows an obvious difference in the shape of the five-peak, which may be attributed to the coordination environment around the uranium centers UO7 and UO8 for 1 and UO7 for 2 and 3, further resulting in differences in the stereospecific blockade and the symmetry of the uranyl equatorial coordination layer. To our surprise, two additional peaks at 379 and 400 nm were found, corresponding to the \u03c0* \u2192 \u03c0 transition of the ligand and the MLCT transition (from metal to ligand charge transfer transition), respectively, in accordance with the fluorescent spectrum for the ligand (375 and 392 nm). It is indicated that the energy of the ligand does not overall transfer to the [UO2]2+ ions.\n\nThe sensing properties of 1 for nitrobenzene were further investigated by monitoring a series of emulsions in DMSO upon gradually increasing the nitrobenzene concentration. As shown in b, the luminescence intensity gradually decreases with increasing nitrobenzene concentration. When the concentration of nitrobenzene increased to 1000 ppm, the luminescence intensity was quenched with a high quenching efficiency of 90%. Seemingly, Zn3(L1)2(L2) (2) {L1 = 4-[3-(4-carboxyphenoxy)-2-[(4-carboxyphenoxy)methyl]-2-methyl-propoxy]benzoate, L2 = 1,4-bis(1-imidazolyl)benzene]}, which has a quenching efficiency of 98.91%, is the most sensitive for nitrobenzene detection. Although there is a certain gap between compound 1 and Zn3(L1)2(L2) (2) {L1 = 4-[3-(4-carboxyphenoxy)-2-[(4-carboxyphenoxy)methyl]-2-methyl-propoxy]benzoate, L2 = 1,4-bis(1-imidazolyl)benzene]}, the result suggests that compound 1 has a good sensitivity in detecting small amounts of nitrobenzene in solution. To further verify the effect of the nitro group on the sensing of nitrobenzene, we measured the emission spectrum of 1 in toluene (c). Obviously, the luminescence intensity of the nitrobenzene emulsion was far below those of others in the benzene series. The result reveals that the nitro group is the main cause of the quenching effect. In addition, compounds 2 and 3 also show sensing properties for nitrobenzene (Figures S7). The different quenching efficiencies of compounds 1-3 are compared in d."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['decomposition_temperature', 'peak_spectrum', 'etc']"}]}

In contrast to NU-505-Zn, consecutive N2 sorption measurements performed on NU-505-Ni up to 6 days after solvent evacuation revealed no change in the surface area (). The material's surface area was unchanged, even after heating at 100 \u00b0C for 18 h, indicating a marked increase in the stability of the MOF realized by transmetalation to Ni(II). The combination of the robust Ni(II) centers with the basic dabco linkers (the pK a of the monoprotonated conjugate-acid of dabco is 10.16) has markedly enhanced the stability of the structure.\n\nSupercritical CO2 drying was performed and a N2 adsorption isotherm was collected on this material to obtain a pore volume of 0.74 cm3/g and a BET area of 1630 m2/g (Figure ). When a nitrogen isotherm was collected on the same sample 1 week after activation (), the porosity was found to be unchanged. We additionally analyzed the various isotherms to obtain estimates of pore-size distributions (see the  for plots). Untreated NU-505-Ni yielded a single pore of effective diameter of 10 \u00c5, while the version that was water-treated, supercritically dried, and then heated at 100 \u00b0C showed, in addition to the 10 \u00c5 pores, a set of pores of effective diameter of 15 \u00c5, consistent with the alternating and periodic absence of dabco pillars.\n\nBased on the lower overall stability of NU-505-Zn compared to the Ni(II) analogue, we expected its ability to withstand exposure to liquid water to be limited. To test our hypothesis, we subjected NU-505-Zn to the same water treatment process as the Ni(II)-based material. As was the case with the Ni(II) analogue, the 1H NMR spectrum of the water-treated Zn(II)-based material showed a decrease of the TBAPy:dabco ratio to 1:0.6. However, the PXRD pattern did not show an additional low-angle peak and, instead, remained largely unchanged, barring the presence of low-intensity shoulders around the main peaks at 2\u03b8 = 5.56\u00b0 and 2\u03b8 = 7.90\u00b0 (Figure ). Furthermore, there was a marked decrease in the BET area of the material (1150 m2/g, compared to 1600 m2/g attainable for the pristine NU-505-Zn), suggesting a loss of structural integrity. Again, as in the case with the pristine NU-505-Zn, the porosity of the water-treated MOF material was observed to be nonpersistent, with 20% of porosity lost within 48 h of activation ().\n\nWe next examined whether the displacement of dabco pillars by water could be reversed. We were pleased to see that, following the exposure of the water-treated NU-505-Ni to a concentrated dabco solution in DMF for 24 h, an increase of the TBAPy:dabco ratio from 1:0.5 to 1:1.1 was evidenced by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The low-angle 2\u03b8 = 4.08\u00b0 peak in the PXRD pattern disappeared and overall the pattern appeared identical to that of pristine NU-505-Ni MOF (Figure ). The pore volume and the BET area of the supercritically dried material increased to 0.816 cm3/g and 1910 m2/g, respectively, thereby approaching the values obtained for the parent (Figure ).

The PXRD profile of each as-synthesized complex well matched the simulated ones based on the single-crystal X-ray structure (Figure S2 in the  for 1-4). Prior to gas sorption experiments, water and DMF molecules are removed from compound 4 by solvent exchanges. The solvent-exchanged sample was then dried under a high vacuum to obtain the desolvated solid 4a. The activated sample 4a is still crystalline, as evidenced by the PXRD patterns. Although the experimental patterns of the activated sample 4a show a few unindexed peaks and slightly broadened diffraction lines that might be attributed to the slight change of the structure caused by removal of the guest molecules, the whole porous framework should remain. To examine the thermal stability of 4, a TGA experiment was performed by heating the crystalline sample (Figure S1 in the ). The TGA curve of 4 reveals that the first weight loss of 3% in the temperature region of 195-295 \u00b0C corresponds to the expulsion of lattice water and partial DMF molecules. The residual component starts to decompose beyond 300 \u00b0C with two step weight losses (peaking at 305 and 527 \u00b0C). TGA of 4 showed that it is stable to 300 \u00b0C (Figure S3 in the ).\n\nTo investigate the porosity of 4a, N2 sorption was performed at 77 K. The uptake amount of N2 is 93.96 cm3/g (STP) at P/P 0 = 1.0, and the gas sorption shows a reversible type I isotherm with no hysteresis upon desorption (Figure a), being characteristic of microporous material. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and Langmuir surface areas of the guest-free framework were estimated to be 322.56 and 421.98 m2 g-1, respectively, and the Horvath-Kawazoe (H-K) pore diameter is 4.98 \u00c5 (Figure S4 in the ). Furthermore, the H-K pore volume is 0.15 cm3 g-1, a little lower than the value of 0.17 cm3 g-1 calculated from the crystal structure, which indicates that the gas molecules fill the void space efficiently.\n\nThe accessible porosity in 4a confirmed by the N2 sorption study prompts us to further investigate the gas sorption properties of 4a. Subsequently, O2 and H2 adsorption measurements were carried out. In the case of O2 adsorption, 4a adsorbs up to 20.38 wt % (142.32 cm3 g-1, 6.37 mmol g-1, STP) at 77 K and P/P 0 = 0.9 (Figure a).\n\nThe H2 sorption isotherms at 77 and 87 K both show type I behavior with slight hysteresis and no noticeable change in the properties upon repeated cycling (Figure b). The uptake of H2 at 77 K and 800 mmHg is 0.84 wt % (94.27 cm3 g-1, STP). Moreover, the H2 isosteric heats of adsorption (Q st) for 4a calculated from the respective adsorption isotherms at 77 and 87 K, employing the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, are 7.3-7.1 kJ mol-1, depending on the degree of H2 loading (Figure S5 in the ), which is in the usual range of the PMOFs. The approximate value of 7.3 kJ mol-1 at zero surface coverage obtained from isotherm studies is close to the corresponding values found for most promising MOFs for hydrogen storage. \n\nAlthough most adsorption studies on porous materials have been carried out for hydrogen storage purposes in the past few years, there are now increasing investigations aimed at different objectives for other gases, such as CO2, CH4, etc. To further check the gas adsorption properties of 4a, CO2 and CH4 adsorption studies have been systematically carried out at 273 K under normal pressure, respectively. All of the adsorption isotherms exhibit typical type I sorption behavior (Figure c) and the adsorption capacity of CO2 is higher than that of CH4 under the same conditions. At 832 mmHg, 4a adsorbs CO2 gas up to 11.21 wt % (57.08 cm3 g-1, STP), while the adsorb amount of CH4 at 833 mmHg is 1.02 wt % (14.29 cm3 g-1, STP), indicating the high selectivity of gas sorption for CO2 over CH4. This may mainly be attributed to two factors: (1) The kinetic diameter of the CO2 molecule (3.3 \u00c5) is smaller than that of the CH4 molecule (3.8 \u00c5), so that access to the channels in 4a is easier. (2) The quadrupole moment of CO2 (-1.4 \u00d7 10-39 C m2) might induce stronger interaction with the porous framework than CH4. \n\nLuminescent Properties\n\nIt is known that many d10 metal compounds exhibit luminescent properties. The coordination compounds with the rational selection and design of conjugated organic spacers and metal centers can be efficient for obtaining new luminescence materials. To investigate the luminescent properties of complexes 1-4, measurements of the complexes and the H2ptp ligand were carried out in the solid state at room temperature. As shown in Figure , H2ptp exhibits a blue emission band at 490 nm upon excitation at 360 nm, which could be attributed to intraligand charge transfer (n-\u03c0* or \u03c0-\u03c0*). Complexes 1-4 present emission bands at 431, 436, 491, and 431 nm upon excitation at 372, 255, 446, and 383 nm, respectively. Compared with emission of the H2ptp ligand, complexes 1, 2, and 4 reveal similar blue shifts of the emission peak and increased luminescent density. These might be attributed to coordination of the ligand ptp2- to ZnII ions, which decreased the nonradiative decay of intraligand excited states. The red shift of the emission spectra of complex 3 suggests an enhancement of \u03c0 conjugation. All of the emissions of the complexes are tentatively attributed to the intraligand transition (n-\u03c0* and \u03c0-\u03c0*) modified by ligation of the ligand to the inactive ZnII ion. To some extent, coordination enhances the \"rigidity\" of the ligand and thus reduces the loss of energy through a radiationless pathway."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['gas_adsorption', 'decomposition_temperature', 'surface_area', 'pore_volume', 'porosity', 'peak_spectrum']"}]}

The crystal structure and X-ray photoelectron spectrum for 2 reveal that metal oxidation states are -{[Pt2 II,II]-[Ru2 II,II]-[Pt2 II,II]} n -, where [Ru2 II,II] can have an electronic configuration of \u03c32\u03c04\u03b42\u03b4*2\u03c0*2 or \u03c32\u03c04\u03b42\u03c0*4. The magnetic susceptibility of 2 has a \u03bceff [\u221d(\u03c7T)1/2] value of 2.77 \u03bcB per [Pt2 II,II]-[Ru2 II,II]-[Pt2 II,II] unit at 300 K, showing that two unpaired electrons lie on \u03c0*(Ru2). Magnetic measurements performed at temperatures of 2-300 K indicate that S = 1 Ru2 II,II units are weakly antiferromagnetically coupled (zJ = -1.4 cm-1) with a large zero-field splitting (D = 221 cm-1).\n\nFor [Ru2 II,II] compounds, in general, there are two possible electronic configurations, \u03c32\u03c04\u03b42\u03c0*4 and \u03c32\u03c04\u03b42\u03b4*2\u03c0*2, depending on the ordering of the \u03c0* and \u03b4* molecular orbital levels and their energy separation. When the destabilization of \u03b4* by the antibonding contribution from bridging ligands occurs, the order of the \u03c0* and \u03b4* orbitals is reversed compared with the conventional order, resulting in the diamagnetic ground-state configuration \u03c32\u03c04\u03b42\u03c0*4. However, the magnetic susceptibility of 2 has a \u03bceff [\u221d(\u03c7T)1/2] value of 2.77 at 300 K per [Pt2 II,II]-[Ru2 II,II]-[Pt2 II,II] unit, showing that it is paramagnetic; this indicates that the electronic configuration of [Ru2 II,II] is \u03c32\u03c04\u03b42\u03b4*2\u03c0*2, where two unpaired electrons lie in the \u03c0* orbitals at the Ru2 core (, right).\n\nThe temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of compound 2 measured in the range of 2-300 K is shown in . The overall behavior is very similar to that of the parent RuII 2(O2CR)4 compounds, showing that the ground-state electronic configuration is \u03c32\u03c04\u03b42\u03b4*2\u03c0*2, which is an S = 1 state with an appreciable zero-field splitting (ZFS); for triplet states, ZFS due to spin-orbit coupling can cause magnetic properties to be strongly dependent on temperature. Compound 2 exhibits a continuous decrease in \u03c7T at lower temperatures, ranging from 0.95 cm3 K mol-1 at 300 K to 0.07 cm3 K mol-1, which is primarily due to the ZFS arising from the 3A2g ground state. The theoretical fitting is performed with a previously reported equation that contains the following valuable parameters: g, the magnitude (D) of the ZFS, a temperature-independent paramagnetic (TIP) contribution, the superexchange interaction in the chain accounted for by the molecular field approximation (zJ), and an extrinsic paramagnetic impurity (\u03c1) of a ubiquitous Ru2 II,III species (S = 3/2) with g imp = 2.0 (fixed). The theoretical fitting led to the following values: g = 2.00, D = 221 cm-1, zJ = -1.4 cm-1, TIP = 2.0 \u00d7 10-5 cm3 mol-1, and \u03c1 = 0.03."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['magnetic_susceptibility', 'etc']"}]}

UV-vis competition was performed on the A\u03b2 peptide as well as on a wide series of modified peptides, leading to an affinity value of 1.6 \u00d7 109 M-1 at pH 7.1 for the A\u03b2 peptide and to a coordination model for the Cu(II) site within the A\u03b2 peptide that agrees with the one mostly accepted currently.\n\nThe parameters estimated from the EPR signature (A) are also in line with the Cu(L) solid-state structure. Indeed, the g // and A //(65Cu) values equal 2.22 and 212 \u00d7 104 cm-1, respectively, and are thus in line with a 2N2O equatorial binding mode according to the Peisach and Blumberg correlation.

Termed MUF-17 (MUF = Massey University Framework), it adsorbs 112 cm3(STP)/cm3 of acetylene at 293 K and 1 bar. Its one-dimensional zig-zag channels have large cavities connected by narrow apertures. Owing to their size and electrostatic characteristics, the high affinity of these apertures for acetylene is revealed by an adsorption capacity of 51.5 cm3(STP)/cm3 at a low pressure (0.01 bar). MUF-17 is, thus, amenable to the capture of both bulk and trace acetylene. Similar levels of uptake by the same multipurpose material from a range of gas mixtures has seldom been observed. MUF-17, synthesized from inexpensive precursors, is robust and can be reused multiple times while maintaining its separation performance.\n\nGuest-free MUF-17 can be readily produced at 130 \u00b0C under vacuum, which preserves the coordinated water molecules. These water ligands are lost (as are the crystallinity and porosity) by heating above 200 \u00b0C; therefore, high temperatures were avoided. The phase purity of the material activated at 130 \u00b0C was confirmed by matching its powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern with that simulated from its SCXRD structure (Figure S2) and by elemental analysis. Thermogravimetric analysis and PXRD demonstrated that MUF-17 decomposes above 300 \u00b0C under nitrogen (Figure S3), whereas it is stable when exposed to a laboratory atmosphere (~80% humidity) at ambient temperatures for at least 1 year (Figure S2). A CO2 adsorption isotherm at 273 K illustrated the permanent porosity of MUF-17 and gave a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of 247 m2/g and a pore volume of 0.14 cm3/g (Figure S12). These values are consistent with a geometric surface area of 323 m2/g and pore volume of 0.20 cm3/g calculated from the crystallographic coordinates (Table S3).\n\nBased on the high stability, permanent porosity, and suitable pore size and chemistry of MUF-17, we were intrigued by its potential to meet the challenges of separating C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 under ambient conditions. Low-pressure C2H2, C2H4, and CO2 adsorption isotherms were collected up to 1 bar at different temperatures (a,b and S9). The adsorption results show that MUF-17 adsorbs considerably more C2H2 than C2H4 under the same conditions. At 293 K and 1.0 bar, the C2H2 uptake of MUF-17 is 111.58 cm3/cm3 (3.01 mmol/g, 0.68 C2H2 per cobalt), whereas the C2H4 uptake is only 79.70 cm3/cm3 (2.15 mmol/g) and the CO2 uptake is 93.05 cm3/cm3 (2.51 mmol/g).\n\nImportantly in the context of gas separations, the C2H2 isotherms rise steeply in the low-pressure region. For instance, at 293 K and 0.01 bar (7.5 Torr), the capacity of C2H2 reaches 51.53 cm3(STP)/cm3, more than double that of C2H4 and CO2. This exceptional affinity for C2H2 at low pressure indicates that MUF-17 has the potential to separate C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 mixtures with high efficiency, including the removal of trace acetylene. At 0.01 bar, MUF-17 adsorbs more C2H2 than top-performing materials such as SIFSIX-2-Cu-i (41.9 cm3/cm3), Fe-MOF-74 (31.7 cm3/cm3), SIFSIX-3-Zn (30.0 cm3/cm3), UTSA100-a (18.03 cm3/cm3) and NOTT-300 (5.4 cm3/cm3) at ambient temperature, and is comparable to the benchmark materials UTSA-200a (57.8 cm3/cm3) and NKMOF-1-Ni (67.8 cm3/cm3) (c).\n\nMotivated by the high uptake and preferential binding of C2H2 by MUF-17, the adsorption selectivity toward C2H2 in mixtures with C2H4 was predicted on the basis of ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) using a range of starting compositions (50/50, 5/95, and 0.1/99.9 C2H2/C2H4) at 273 and 293 K (d and S20-S27). For 50/50 C2H2/C2H4 mixtures, the selectivity of MUF-17 at 293 K and 1 bar is 8.73. Although the separation selectivity of MUF-17 is lower than benchmark materials such as SIFSIX-2-Cu-i (41.0) and UTSA-100a (19.6), it is still high and on par with SIFSIX-1-Cu (8.3) and superior to frameworks such as UTSA-67a (4.5), FeMOF-74 (2.1), SIFSIX-2-Cu (5.0), and M'MOF-3a (5.2) (Table S5). With respect to CO2, acetylene is found in crude product streams in approximately equimolar ratios with this gas. Therefore, the IAST selectivity calculated for 50/50 C2H2/CO2 mixtures is critical. This value is 6.01 at 293 K and 1 bar, which is comparable to the previously reported high-performing MOF UTSA-74a and higher than others such as UTSA-50a, Cu-BTC, and MFM-188, whereas it dips below that of NKMOF-1-Ni and [Ni3(HCOO)6] (Table S5). These results imply that MUF-17 can separate C2H2 from C2H4 and CO2 under typically encountered industrial conditions.\n\nTo evaluate the binding strength between MUF-17 and guest molecules, coverage-dependent adsorption enthalpies (Q st) for C2H2, C2H4, and CO2 were evaluated experimentally from pure component isotherms collected at 273, 288, 293, and 298 K by the implementation of a virial equation (Figures S14-S17). The Q st profiles show values of 49.5, 31.1, and 33.8 kJ/mol for C2H2, C2H4, and CO2, respectively, at zero loading. The high Q st of C2H2 compared to that of C2H4 and CO2 illustrates that the interaction of MUF-17 with C2H2 is energetically more favorable than the other gases. This is only true up to intermediate pressures since the Q st for C2H2 decreases with an increase of gas loading. This indicates that MUF-17 presents a range of binding sites with various affinities. Interestingly, the Q st of C2H4 rises at higher pressures, possibly due to interactions between the absorbed gas molecules as the pores approach saturation.\n\nBuilding on these results, we investigated the feasibility of C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 separations under dynamic conditions. We measured experimental breakthrough curves for 50/50 and 1/99 gas mixtures of C2H2/C2H4 at 293 K and 1.1 bar. a shows the relative concentration profile of C2H2, C2H4 exiting an adsorption bed packed with MUF-17 as a function of time. The complete separation was realized by MUF-17, whereby the C2H4 broke through from the column at an early stage because of its low adsorption capacity and affinity for the framework. This occurred after around 10 min, which means that the uptakes of C2H4 under these dynamic conditions are 1.10 and 0.55 mmol/g for 1/99 and 50/50 mixtures, respectively. Conversely, the signal of C2H2 was not detected for at least 37 and 99 min for 50/50 and 1/99 mixtures, respectively. This equates to dynamic uptake capacities of 0.11 and 2.06 mmol/g, respectively. These results indicate that MUF-17 can efficiently trap small quantities of C2H2 when it is present in both bulk and trace quantities. The elimination of trace C2H2 from 1/99 mixtures yields polymer grade C2H4. Advantageously, the breakthrough trace of C2H2 is steep, which arises from the high affinity of MUF-17 for this guest. This indicates that the mass-transfer zone of C2H2 in the adsorption bed will be narrow, which decreases the unused bed length to maximize the capture efficiency. The C2H4 productivity, defined by the amount of this gas with a purity of at least 99.95% that can be produced from an adsorption bed packed with 1 kg of MUF-17 under these conditions, is 192 L."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['gas_adsorption', 'selectivity', 'decomposition_temperature', 'surface_area', 'pore_volume']"}]}

As shown in Figure S2, from room temperature to 165 \u00b0C, a weight loss of 32.12% can be observed, which corresponds to the loss of H2O and DMF molecules (calcd: 32.21%). Subsequently, TGA curves show a weight loss of 15.93% between 265 and 421 \u00b0C, corresponding to the loss of coordinated phen molecules (calcd: 15.91%). Then, compound 1 starts to decompose above 521 \u00b0C. The high thermostability of structures is possibly attributed to the robust BTB ligands.\n\nLuminescent Behaviors and Sensing Properties\n\nUnder excitation at 300 nm, five characteristic emission peaks of compound 1 appear at 535, 591, 614, 655, and 697 nm (Figure S6), which are attributed to 5D1 \u2192 7F1 and 5D0 \u2192 7FJ (J = 1, 2, 3, or 4) transitions of Eu3+ ions, respectively. On the basis of the transition rules of Eu3+ ions, when Eu3+ ions locate at an inversion center, the magnetic dipole transitions (5D0 \u2192 7F1) are regnant, emitting orange light; when Eu3+ ions locate at a noninversion center, the electric dipole transitions (5D0 \u21927F2) are dominant, emitting red light. As shown in Figure S6, the emission intensities at 591 nm are weaker than those at 5D0 \u2192 7F2 transitions (614 nm), which is indicative that Eu3+ ions locate at noninversion center sites, agreeing with the structural analyses. \n\nIn addition, to study the detection limit of the Al3+ sensor, we prepared a series of ethanol suspensions of 1-Al3+. As shown in , the luminescence intensity of 1 gradually decreases as Al3+ increases, and the decreased luminescence still can be clearly observed under the concentration of Al3+ at about 5 \u00d7 10-8 M, which is indicative that the detection limit of this Al3+ sensor can reach 5 \u00d7 10-8 M (1.35 ppb), which is lower than the United States Environmental Protection Agency's recommended level of Al3+ in drinking water (200 ppb). Therefore, 1 displays the lowest detection limit compared to those of the reported MOF-based sensors of Al3+ (Table S3). To further explore the quenching effect of Al3+ on the emission, a luminescence intensity vs Al3+ concentration chart was made (), which can be linearly fitted by the equation I 0/I = 1.04 + K sv[Al3+] (I 0 and I represent the luminescent intensity of 1 before and after dropping Al3+, respectively; [Al3+] represents the concentration of Al3+, and K sv represents quenching rate constant), which is close to the Stern-Volmer equation I 0/I = 1 + K sv[Al3+]. The K sv value was calculated to be 1.59 \u00d7 104 L/mol, revealing that Al3+ displays a high quenching efficiency on the emission of compound 1.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn summary, a novel 3D lanthanide-organic framework {[Eu(BTB)(phen)]\u22c54.5DMF\u22c52H2O} n  was obtained based on a carboxylate ligand (H3BTB) with C 3 symmetry. The characterization of structures showed that compound 1 has 1D channels with potential pore volume as high as 56.1%, and 1 with large pores can adsorb CO2. Interestingly, compound 1 can be demonstrated as an effective and recoverable catalyst for cycloaddition reaction with CO2 and epoxides, and the recycling number can reach at least five. Additionally, as a luminescent MOF, 1 could detect Al3+ after being recycled with high selectivity and high sensitivity with the lowest detection limit among other MOF-based Al3+ sensors of 5 \u00d7 10-8 M (1.35 ppb)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['decomposition_temperature', 'peak_spectrum', 'porosity', 'etc']"}]}

Typical values of \u03c7M T (or \u03bceff) are 2.75-3.4 cm3 mol-1 K (4.7-5.2 \u03bcB). Lower values at room temperature indicate perturbation from ideal octahedral geometry. Considering the spin-orbit coupling due to the 4T1g ground state for octahedral CoII complexes together with their distortion, exact calculations for deriving the J parameter from experimental data in the  entire temperature range are only possible through sophisticated computer programs, based on full-diagonalization methods. 1D systems of CoII are frequently associated with anisotropic Ising systems, and they can be fitted in the low-temperature zone assuming again an effective spin S\u2018 = 1/2. More recently, Rueff et al. have proposed a phenomenological approach for some low-dimensional CoII systems that allows one to have an estimate of the strength of the antiferromagnetic exchange interactions. They postulate the phenomenological equation    in which A + B equals the Curie constant (~2.8-3.4 cm3 mol-1 K for octahedral CoII) and E 1 and E 2 represent the \"activation energies\" corresponding to the spin-orbit coupling and the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction. This equation, thus, adequately describes the spin-orbit coupling (high-temperature region) and the exponential low-temperature divergence of the susceptibility. Very good results have been reported in 1D and 2D CoII complexes. In almost all of these complexes, E 1/k, the effect of spin-orbit coupling and site distortion, is on the order of +100 K. \n\nThus, applying this formula, we can only give an average J value. The \u03c7M T vs T plot for 1 (\u03c7M is the molar magnetic susceptibility for one CoII ion) is shown in Figure . The \u03c7M T value at 300 K is 2.5 cm3 mol-1 K. The \u03c7M T values of 1 continuously decrease to 0 cm3 mol-1 K at 2 K. From 50 to 2 K, there is a different slope in the curve. At high temperature, the effect of the spin-orbit coupling is manifest, while at low temperatures, the antiferromagnetic coupling is dominant.  \n\nThe fit value obtained with the Rueff procedure is A + B = 3.53 cm3 mol-1 K, which perfectly agrees with those given in the literature for the Curie constant (C ~ 2.8-3.5 cm3 mol-1 K); E 1/k = 127 \u00b1 2 K is of the same magnitude as those reported by Rueff et al. for several 1D and 2D CoII complexes.

No maximum in \u03c7M vs T is observed. This behavior is consistent with weak antiferromagnetic (AF) exchange between S = 1/2 Cu(II) centers. From the X-ray structure, the two Cu(II) centers are connected via a nearly linear Cl-Hg-Cl chain; each pair of such Cu(II) centers is magnetically (but not structurally) isolated from the next. Thus, 6 can be treated as a simple bimetallic Cu(II) species, and accordingly the magnetic data were fitted with the Bleaney-Bowers dimer model (using \u0124 = -2JS1S2) to yield J = -0.70 \u00b1 0.01 cm-1 and g = 2.16 \u00b1 0.01. This interaction is quite weak on account of the long Hg-Cl bonds (3.2800(16) \u00c5) that disrupt the exchange pathway. \n\nThe magnetic behavior of 5 is very similar to 6. The \u03bceff = 1.92 \u03bcB at 300 K and is temperature-independent until 30 K, upon which it drops to 1.58 \u03bcB at 2 K. The pathway for the AF interactions in 5 is also a Cl-Hg-Cl bridge, but in this case the Cu(II) centers form a 1-D chain (Figure ); hence, the magnetic data were fitted using the theoretical expression for a 1-D Heisenberg AF chain of S = 1/2 centers to give best-fit values of J = -0.45 \u00b1 0.01 cm-1 and g = 2.22 \u00b1 0.01. Unlike for 6, the Cl-Hg-Cl bridge in 5 is not linear but kinked, and the Cu(II) centers are connected in an equatorial/axial fashion. Despite this difference, the magnitude of the coupling interaction is similar and weak, but stronger than that found in {[Cu(bipy)Hg(CN)2Cl2]2Hg(CN)2}, which has a linear, axial/axial Cl-Hg-Cl bridge mediating Cu(II) magnetic exchange. \n\nAs would be expected, 7, which contains a chloro-bridged Cu(dien) dimer cation, shows the strongest magnetic interaction. At 300 K, \u03bceff = 2.57 \u03bcB (per dimer), and this remains unchanged until 4 K, at which point it drops, reaching 1.58 \u03bcB at 1.8 K. Importantly, there is a maximum in \u03c7M at 4.0 K (Figure ), indicative of significant AF interactions.  \n\nAn examination of the structure shows that the [Cu(dien)(\u03bc-Cl)]2 2+ dimers are connected in a 2-D array via Cl-Hg-Cl bridges similar to 5. Thus, the magnetic data was fitted using the Bleaney-Bowers equation with an additional magnetic field parameter (zJ \u2018) to account for the weaker interdimer interactions and a paramagnetic impurity factor (P). This gave best fit values of J = -1.16 \u00b1 0.11 cm-1, g = 2.08 \u00b1 0.05, P = 0.003, and zJ \u2018 = -0.14 \u00b1 0.01 cm-1; the fit is shown as a solid line in Figure ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['magnetic_moment', 'magnetic_susceptibility', 'etc']"}]}

Intriguingly, the EPR spectrum of C2A-DNIC exhibits a well-resolved seven-line pattern with a g value of 2.029 (coupling constants A N(NO) = 2.45 G and A H(Cys) = 1.90 G) at 298 K. Compared to those of C1A-DNIC, C3A-DNIC, and C4A-DNIC, C2A-DNIC displays a seven-line EPR signal ascribed to the higher contribution of cysteine-containing peptide to the singly occupied molecular orbital of C2A-DNIC. This could be further supported by the intense circular dichroism (CD) signals in the near-UV and visible regions (from 260 to 600 nm; Figure ). In addition, the far-UV (from 200 to 260 nm) CD spectra indicate that these peptide-bound DNICs CnA-DNIC do not have significant secondary structures (Figure S7 in the ).\n\nExtended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data analysis was performed to obtain the local structure of the Fe site of peptide-bound DNICs CnA-DNIC and RRE KCAAK-RRE, respectively (Figures  and S13 in the ).

The third peak in the radial distribution function, including the multiple scattering contribution of Fe-N-O, is assigned as the distance between Fe and O (2.80-2.82 \u00c5). The EXAFS data and fitting results are consistent with our previous single-crystal structures of DNIC models. In the peptide-bound RRE KCAAK-RRE, the first and second peaks in the radial distribution function arise mainly from backscattering from two ligated N atoms and two ligated S atoms, respectively. The third peak in the radial distribution function is dominated by the single scattering path between Fe and Fe as well as multiple scattering contributions from the Fe-N-O path. The EXASF result of peptide-bound RRE KCAAK-RRE is best described as a [Fe(\u03bc-SCys)2Fe] core with NO molecules coordinated to two Fe sites.

The electrocatalytic activity of complex 1 toward generating H2 from water was evaluated by cyclic voltammograms (CVs) in H2SO4 aqueous solution. For comparison, the electrochemical behavior at the bare carbon glassy electrode (GCE) was also studied. Figure  shows the CVs in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution in the potential range from -1.2 to 1.8 V vs Ag/AgCl at 50 mV\u22c5s-1. As we know, in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution, the potential for H2 evolution reaction (HER) on a clean Pt electrode is -0.24 V vs Ag/AgCl, indicating the overpotential range in Figure  is -0.96-2.04 V. An irreversible peak at -0.82 V vs Ag/AgCl (overpotential \u03b7 = -0.58 V) was observed at the bare GCE (Figure ), which coincides with the evolution of bubbles, corresponding to the generation of H2 from water. When the 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution contains L1, the irreversible peak at the bare GCE was shifted to more negative potential (\u03b7 = -0.62 V) and the peak current decreases (Figure ), indicating the free ligand L1 cannot catalyze HER. It is expected that L1 might not act as an electron-transfer promoter under the condition. When the 1-modified electrode (1-GCE) was utilized, the reduction peak of H+ in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution is obviously shifted to more positive potential (\u03b7 = -0.43 V) accompanied by the enhanced current, suggesting complex 1 has good electrocatalytic activity for HER (Figure ). Complex 1 can lower the overpotential of HER, which is also evidenced by the Tafel curve at 1-GCE in H2SO4 aqueous solution (). The quasireversible redox couple with a half-wave overpotential of 0.72 V (E pa = 0.82 V and E pc= 0.62 V, E pa = anodic peak overpotential, E pc = cathodic peak overpotential) at the 1-GCE may be assigned to the Cu-based oxidation of complex 1 (Figure ). The redox of the [Mo8O26]4- polyanion is overlapped by the potential for HER with peaks at -0.16 and 0.16 V in the system (Figure ). \n\nControlled potential electrolysis (CPE) experiments at -0.8 V vs AgCl/Ag (\u03b7 = -0.56 V and current density =0.7 uA/cm2) were also performed to provide evidence for catalytic activity of complex 1. As depicted in , 1-GCE affords a robust and essentially linear charge build-up over time, with no substantial loss in activity over the course of 2 h, which shows higher charge build-up than the bare GCE under the same condition (\u03b7 = -0.56 V and current density = 0.1 uA/cm2) (). Moreover, 1-GCE is stable. When the potential range is maintained at -1.0 to 2.0 V vs AgCl/Ag, the peak currents can be kept over one hundred cycles. The behavior at 1-GCE is indicative of the possible reversible structural transformation between the oxidization and reduction states of the species during the redox process.\n\nTo estimate the Faradaic efficiency for H2 production by complex 1, the evolved H2 in the 2 h CPE experiment is characterized and proved by gas chromatography. The generated H2 volume matches that calculated based on the amount of charge consumed, indicating the catalyst operates at 98% Faradaic efficiency (see the ). On the basis of the amount of complex 1 used in the experiment, a turnover number (TON) of 2.6 \u00d7 103 mol of H2 per mole of catalyst is calculated.\n\nThe Electrocatalytic Activity of Complex 2 \n\nAs for complex 2, its electrocatalytic activity toward generating H2 from water was also evaluated under similar condition. The CV reveals the reduction overpotential of H+ is shifted to -0.49 V accompanied by the enhanced current at the 2-modified electrode (2-GCE), indicating complex 2 also can catalyze the generation of H2 from water (Figure ). Complex 2 can lower the overpotential of HER, which is also evidenced by the Tafel curve at 2-GCE in H2SO4 aqueous solution (). Whereas for the free ligand L2, the irreversible peak was observed at more negative potential (\u03b7 = -0.65 V) and the peak current decreases (Figure  ), indicating the free ligand L2 cannot catalyze HER. In the presence of complex 2, the electrocatalytic current grows larger with increasing acid concentrations, as shown in . And the peak currents were also proportional to the scan rates (). EIS measurement shows the redox process is diffusion-controlled and the impedance of the half cell in the presence of 2-GCE is more than that for the bare-GCE, indicating the electrode resistance of 2-GCE is more than that of the bare-GCE (). The abnormal enhanced current for HER at 2-GCE is related to the framework of complex 2. The catalytic activity of complex 2 is also evidenced by the CPE experiment (\u03b7 = -0.56 V and current density = 0.3 uA/cm2), in which 2-GCE shows higher charge build-up than the bare GCE under the same condition (\u03b7 = -0.56 V and current density = 0.1 uA/cm2) () with the Faradaic efficiency of 97% and TON of 3.0 \u00d7 102 mol of H2 per mole of complex 2.\n\nComparing complexes 1 and 2, the reduction overpotential of H+ at 1-GCE (-0.43 V) is more positive than that at 2-GCE (-0.49 V) (), indicating the Cu complex 1 possesses better catalytic activity than the Ag complex 2. The result is in agreement with the 2 h-CPE experiment, in which 1-GCE shows higher charge build-up than 2-GCE under the same condition (). Because the lowered overpotential is related to the active center of electrocatalyst for H* binding, complex 1 reduces the overpotential of H2 evolution greater than complex 2, as shown by the Tafel curves in , which is probably due to their different unsaturated coordinated metal centers in the structures. The detailed mechanism is under investigation. The present work shows it is possible to obtain better electrocatalyst with the cheaper metal ion by the rational design and synthesis of POM-based MOFs.\n\nThermal Stability of Complexes 1 and 2 \n\nTo examine the thermal stability of complexes 1 and 2, TGA and simultaneous DSC were carried out. The samples were heated to 650 \u00b0C in Ar. As the black curve shows in Figure a, complex 1 exhibits one step of weight loss in the range of 150-260 \u00b0C with a loss of 2.0 wt % (calcd 1.9 wt %), corresponding to the loss of coordinated water. In the similar range, the DSC plot of complex 1 shows a broad endotherm with a peak at 200 \u00b0C. When the temperature is in the range of 410-500 \u00b0C, complex 1 exhibits one step of weight gain, and the calorimetric curve shows an endotherm with a peak at 415 \u00b0C, which might correspond to the phase change of the molybdenum oxide.\n\nAs for complex 2, it releases its coordinated water in the range of 150-260 \u00b0C (calcd 0.9%; obsd 1.0%), as the black curve shows in Figure b. In the similar range, the DSC curve of complex 2 shows an endotherm with a peak at 170 \u00b0C. The pyrolysis of organic ligand exhibits two endothermal peaks at 280 and 343 \u00b0C, respectively (Figure b). Similar to complex 1, complex 2 shows one step of weight gain in the range of 440-510 \u00b0C, and the calorimetric curve shows two endothermal peaks at 442 and 473 \u00b0C, respectively, probably corresponding to the phase change of the molybdenum oxide.\n\nAs for complex 1, it displays absorption in the range of 240-400 nm with maxima at 328 and 351 nm. As for complex 2, it exhibits strong absorption with maxima at 250 nm in the range of 240-400 nm, which are different from those of free ligands, inferring that the absorption of complexes 1 and 2 may be associated with the Mo-O LCMT bands. The broad absorption band of complex 1 in the range 460-900 nm corresponds to the visible d--d transition."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['etc', 'catalytic_activity', 'decomposition_temperature', 'peak_spectrum']"}]}

Among 1A and 1C, although the adsorption amount is same, for the previous one it is very much dependent on activating time and temperature, so we did all other adsorption measurements using 1C.

The PXRD patterns of 1 and 1-NH2 match quite well with the simulated ones of 1 and 1-NH2 from the single-crystal-structure analyses, showing not only the similarity in structures of 1 and 1-NH2 but also the phase purity of as synthesized samples (). The thermal stabilities of 1 and 1-NH2 were also investigated under N2 atmosphere from room temperature to 800 \u00b0C with a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min (Figure S6). As showed in Figure S6, the 1 and 1-NH2 have the similar thermal stability. A weight loss from 147 to 211 \u00b0C was observed, which can be attributed to the loss of the DMA solvent and lattice water molecules. The TGA results further indicate that, after removal of guest molecules, 1 and 1-NH2 exhibit relatively high thermal stability up to 300 \u00b0C with certain structural robustness.\n\nThe CO2, CH4 and N2 adsorption isotherms were measured at 273 and 298 K, showing the completely reversible without hysteresis (a,b). It was shown that at 273 K (1 bar), 1 possesses good CO2 capture with an uptake of 33.6 cm3 g-1(1.5 mmol g-1) while the CH4 and N2 uptakes at 273 K (1 bar) were only 3.9 cm3/g and 1.9 cm3/g, respectively. At 298 K (1 bar), 1 still held the amount of 17.7 cm3 g-1 of CO2 capture while that of CH4 and N2 is quite minimal (2.1 cm3 g-1 and 1.6 cm3 g-1). It is obvious that 1 displayed the better sorption selectivity for CO2 over N2 and CH4, which could be attributed to the open metal sites and the acylamide groups in the channels forming strong quadrupole-quadrupole interaction between 1 and CO2.\n\nMoreover, in order to further improve the sorption selectivity for CO2, the pores in 1 were modified with amine group to give 1-NH2. The result showed that 1-NH2 displayed a much higher uptake of CO2 at 273 K, 1 bar (49.3 cm3 g-1, 2.2 mmol g-1) with a less uptake of CH4 and N2 (4.0 cm3 g-1 and 2.0 cm3 g-1, respectively). Also at 298 K, 1 bar, the 1-NH2 showed better adsorption of CO2 than 1 (b). To further investigate the CO2 selectivity, the separation selectivities of CO2 versus CH4 (50/50 mol ratios) and N2 (15/85 mol ratios) at room temperature were calculated up to 100 kPa using the ideal adsorption solution theory (IAST) based method (c and Figure S12 in the Supporting Information). For 1, the selectivity of CO2/N2(CO2/CH4) displayed slight decreasing trend from 84.3 to 60.8 (9.7 to 8.0) in the range of 0-100 kPa. However, the corresponding value was almost improved two times from 157.6 to 104 (17.7 to 12.8) for 1-NH2. These results suggest that the 3-D interpenetrating 1/1-NH2 networks have a strong affinity toward CO2 over N2 and CH4, in which the performance of 1-NH2 from further amino functionalization of 1 is more effective. As we have learned, this performance is much better than some porous organic frameworks and zeolite imidazolate frameworks (Table S4). \n\nMoreover, the dynamic column breakthrough experiments were also performed to test the performance of the materials in the actual adsorption-based separation and purification processes. The mixture of CO2/N2 (15/85, v/v) was flowed over a packed bed of 1 and 1-NH2 solid at 298 K. As shown in a,b, 1 can successfully separate the CO2 from the CO2/N2 (15/85, v/v) mixture while the NH2 functional material, 1-NH2, performs more efficiently. The dynamic CO2 adsorption capacity (0.83 mmol g-1) in 1-NH2 at room temperature is higher than that of 1 (0.41 mmol g-1). The result is similar to the known IRMOF-74-III-CH2NH2 (0.8 mmol g-1) and better than the HKUST-1 (0.45 mmol g-1). When it comes to the mixture of CO2/CH4 (50/50, v/v), the breakthrough occurs at a shorter dimensionless time due to the relatively small separation ratio of CO2/CH4 compared to the CO2/N2 (15/85, v/v) binary mixture.\n\nTo better understand these results, the adsorption enthalpies (Q st) of CO2 are counted from the adsorption data at 273 and 298 K by using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to quantitatively assess the binding strengths between CO2 and the frameworks (see the Supporting Information). As depicted in d, the Q st values at zero coverage, respectively, reach 26.0 and 29.5 kJ mol-1 for 1 and 1-NH2 showing the good interaction of CO2-framework in 1 and 1-NH2. The high Q st value of 1-NH2 is consistent with the fact that the amine group in the pores of MOFs could enhance the interaction of CO2-framework. What's more, the DFT calculations were also provided to further confirm the probable position of CO2 in the pores. A specific spatial possibility distribution can be exhibited in Figure S9 and , which illustrate the tendency of particles after equilibrium. On the direction of b and c, there was an obvious difference between two MOFs. For 1, the position of CO2 was mainly influenced by the acylamino and metal-cluster jointly. After amination, the molecules of CO2 begin to adsorb parallel with the plane of acylaminos for the existence of these two groups on both sides. Besides, the specific spatial possibility distribution increased near the amino. In one pore, because of the symmetry of both acylaminos and amino, CO2 will have a conformation that was completely parallel with their plane. This phenomenon provided an evidence that the amino and acylamide group in 1-NH  2  provide the interaction sites with CO2.\n\nTo further reveal the quenching efficiency of TNP, 1 mM TNP solution was gradually added to a dispersed solution of 1 in DMA and the fluorescence intensity showed decrease gradually (Figures S21 and S22). Besides, the Stern-Volmer equation, (I 0/I) = K sv[A] + 1, was used to calculated the quenching constant (K sv). b shows that the Stern-Volmer plot for TNP is the typically linear at low concentrations, and the values of K sv for TNP of 1 and 1-NH2 are estimated to be 2.5 \u00d7 104 and 4.8 \u00d7 104 M-1, respectively. Likewise, the difference of K sv values also reflects that free NH2 group in channels of MOFs may improve the fluorescence sensitivity of sensing TNP, and its K sv value from Table S6 is higher than most of the reported interpenetrating MOFs. For the practical applications, the detection of TNP was also performed in the medium of water. The same quenching detection efficiency could also be observed and the K sv value of 1 and 1-NH2 both present a slightly decrease which might due to the effect of water polarity on charge transfer (Figures S23-S26). What's more, the detection limits (DL) was calculated based on the equation DL = 3S b/K sv in which the S b is the standard deviations for 10 repeated fluorescent measurement of blank solutions and it came out that the DL of 1 and 1-NH2 were calculated to be 1.3 and 0.29 ppm, respectively (Table S7)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['decomposition_temperature', 'gas_adsorption', 'selectivity', 'etc']"}]}

This value remains practically constant when cooling until 30 K and it further decreases to ca. 0.40 cm3 mol-1 K at 2.0 K (Figure ). A maximum on the magnetic susceptibility is observed at 3.1 K. These features are typical of a weak antiferromagnetic coupling between the copper(II) ions. An inspection of the structure shows that the exchange pathway responsible for this coupling would be the two arms linking Cu(1) and Cu(2) which are defined by O(6)C(9)C(4)C(5)C(10)O(7) and O(13)C(26)C(20)C(21)C(27)O(15) (see Figure ). Consequently, the magnetic data of 1A were treated by means of a simple Bleaney-Bowers expression for two spin doublets derived through the Hamiltonian  H  = -JS  Cu1\u22c5 S  Cu2 (eq ) 1    \u03c7   M   =  ( 2 N \u03b2   g   2   / k T )     [ 3 + exp  ( - J / k T )  ]    - 1    where J is the magnetic coupling and N, \u03b2, g and k have their usual meaning. Least-squares best fit parameters are J = -3.5 cm-1 and g = 2.09. This weak magnetic coupling can be understood by simple orbital symmetry considerations. The molecular orbital which defines the unpaired electron at each copper(II) ion [Cu(1) and Cu(2) atoms], the so-called magnetic orbital, is of the d(x 2-y 2) type with the x and y axes corresponding roughly to the equatorial Cu-Ocarboxylate bonds]. The \u03c3-overlap between these equatorially located magnetic orbitals through the two -OCCCCO- multiatom bridges [Cu(1)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu(2) = 5.784(2) \u00c5] is predicted to be very poor. As the antiferromagnetic coupling in a dicopper(II) unit is proportional to the square of the overlap integral, a weak magnetic coupling is predicted for 1A, as observed. The value of J obtained by fit for 1A is of the same nature but somewhat greater than the one reported by some of us for the dicopper(II) complex of formula [Cu2(terpy)2Cl2(\u03bc-phta)]\u22c54H2O with terpy = 2,2':6',2\"-terpyridine and H2phta = phthalic acid (J = -0.28 cm-1). The fact that only one of two dicarboxylate arms connects equatorial sites of the two copper(II) ions in this dinuclear species instead of two of these arms in 1A accounts for the weaker magnetic coupling in the terpy-containing complex."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['magnetic_susceptibility']"}]}

Five isomorphic MOFs with different functional groups (F, Cl, NH2, CH3, and OCH3) are successfully synthesized by systematic functional modification of UMCM-151. By studying the adsorption properties of C2 and C3 hydrocarbons (C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, and C3H8), it is found that the electron-withdrawing group functional UMCM-151-F and UMCM-151-Cl exhibit strong affinity for C2H2 (98.71 cm3 g-1 for UMCM-151-F and 90.29 cm3 g-1 for UMCM-151-Cl), while the electron-donating group functional UMCM-151-NH  2 , UMCM-151-CH  3 , and UMCM-151-OCH  3  have strong affinity for C2H4 (97.89 cm3 g-1 for UMCM-151-NH  2 , 90.22 cm3 g-1 for UMCM-151-CH  3  and 94.13 cm3 g-1 for UMCM-151-OCH  3 ). The differences in affinity of electron effects for light hydrocarbon provide an experimental basis for porous MOFs to improve their light hydrocarbon storage capacity.\n\nAs is well-known, grafting functional groups into the organic linkers increases affinity with gas molecules, although the pore volume is reduced. In this article, we introduce five different electronic organic functional groups, including strongly electron-withdrawing groups (F and Cl) and electron-donating groups (NH2, CH3, and OCH3), with an increased atomic radius (from 0.710 to 1.897 \u00c5), into the parent compound UMCM-151, which is a prototypical fm j-type MOF (with the point symbol {62.82.102}{62.84}{63}8{64.102}4) consisting of dicopper paddlewheel and [1,1':3',1''-terphenyl]-4,4'',5'-tricarboxylic acid (H3 L), and systematically explored their light hydrocarbons adsorption properties. Among the six compounds (UMCM-151, UMCM-151-F, UMCM-151-Cl, UMCM-151-NH  2 , UMCM-151-CH  3 , and UMCM-151-OCH  3 ), functionalized compounds UMCM-151-F, UMCM-151-Cl, UMCM-151-NH  2  exhibit a higher Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area than UMCM-151-CH  3  and UMCM-151-OCH  3 . With the incorporation of functional groups, the adsorption capacity of light hydrocarbons is significantly increased. For example, modified UMCM-151-F with a strong electron-withdrawing group exhibited the highest C2H2 uptake, reaching 98.71 cm3 g-1 at 273 K and atmospheric pressure. However, UMCM-151-NH  2  was modified by a strong electron-donating group, which exhibited a higher C2H4 uptake, reaching 97.89 cm3 g-1 at 273 K and atmospheric pressure. The adsorption heat (Q st) of light hydrocarbons in the compounds is calculated by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, UMCM-151-CH  3  exhibits the highest Q st for C3H6, while UMCM-151-OCH  3  has the highest Q st for C3H8.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nCrystal Structure\n\nSingle-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis show that UMCM-151-F, UMCM-151-Cl, UMCM-151-NH  2 , UMCM-151-CH  3 , and UMCM-151-OCH  3  are isostructural with UMCM-151, crystallizing in the orthorhombic space group of Immm. The crystal structure of UMCM-151-F is described representatively. A typical dicopper paddlewheel [Cu2(COO)4] secondary building unit (SBU) is formed by two adjacent copper and four carboxylate groups from four different organic ligands. There are two kinds of SBUs in the structure, one coordinated by four m-carboxylate groups, and the other coordinated by four p-benzoate groups (a,b). If the dicopper paddlewheel SBUs are simplified as 4-connected, and the organic linkers are considered as 3-connected nodes, the three-dimensional (3D) frameworks can be simplified as the typical fmj-type topology structure. With the introduction of different functional groups, there are subtle transformations of other isomorphism due to the differences in size and electron cloud density. As shown in , the twist angles between the central benzene ring and the side benzene ring have changed (39.490\u00b0, 47.032\u00b0, 57.157\u00b0, 56.479\u00b0, 57.180\u00b0, and 56.479\u00b0 for UMCM-151, UMCM-151-F, UMCM-151-Cl, UMCM-151-NH  2 , UMCM-151-CH  3 , and UMCM-151-OCH  3 , respectively). With the addition of functional groups, the diameter of the channel along the a-axis changes, and the pore size decreases accordingly (). Notably, all of the modified functional groups extend into the pores, and the surface of the framework is decorated with potential Lewis basic (nitrogen donor sites) and Lewis acid (fluorine or chlorine sites), which are favorable for gas adsorption. The total accessible volumes are calculated by PLATON (the guest and coordinated water molecules are removed), which are 76.6, 75.7, 73.2, 75.5, 74.4 and 73.7% for UMCM-151, UMCM-151-F, UMCM-151-Cl, UMCM-151-NH  2 , UMCM-151-CH  3 , and UMCM-151-OCH  3 , respectively. The crystallographic data and selective bond lengths and angles are summarized in Tables S1-S9.  \n\nGas-Adsorption\n\nGas-uptake measurements of desolvated UMCM-151, UMCM-151-F, UMCM-151-Cl, UMCM-151-NH  2 , UMCM-151-CH  3 , and UMCM-151-OCH  3  are performed. As shown in a, all six compounds exhibited Type-I reversible sorption isotherms, which is defined as the characteristic of microporous materials in the IUPAC classification. The maximum N2 uptakes at 77 K are 195.67, 236.41, 228.68, 215.75, 163.86, and 146.63 cm3 g-1 for UMCM-151, UMCM-151-F, UMCM-151-Cl, UMCM-151-NH  2 , UMCM-151-CH  3 , and UMCM-151-OCH  3 , respectively. The BET surface areas based on the N2 adsorption isotherms are calculated to be 697.35, 803.12, 781.65, 746.19, 589.76, and 502.18 m2 g-1 for UMCM-151, UMCM-151-F, UMCM-151-Cl, UMCM-151-NH  2 , UMCM-151-CH  3 , and UMCM-151-OCH  3 , respectively. It should be noted that the porosities of the six compounds vary slightly with the maximum difference of 2 \u00c5, but the platform does not change (b). With the introduction of functional groups, the BET surface area of the modified crystal increases as the N2 adsorption capacity increases, except for UMCM-151-CH  3  and UMCM-151-OCH  3  (Table S10). This can indicate that the introduction of functional groups enhances the interaction of gas molecules with framework; however, they tend to reduce the porosity of the compounds and thus have a negative impact on gas adsorption performance.\n\nAdsorption Isotherms of Hydrocarbons\n\nIn order to explore the effect of different functional groups on the adsorption of light hydrocarbons. We have carried out light hydrocarbon adsorption isomers on the six compounds. As shown in  and , the adsorption-desorption isotherms tested are completely reversible, indicating rapid adsorption and desorption kinetics. At 273 K and atmospheric pressure, the C2H2 uptake values are UMCM-151-F (98.71) > UMCM-151-Cl (90.29) > UMCM-151-NH  2  (87.5) > UMCM-151-OCH  3  (80.06) > UMCM-151-CH  3  (74.51) > UMCM-151 (49.7) cm3 g-1 (). It can be observed that the C2H2 uptake increased after the insertion of the electron-withdrawing and electron-donating functional groups. While the UMCM-151-F shows the highest value among the six compounds, and the storage capacity of C2H2 increases significantly due to the electron-withdrawing groups (F and Cl). The C2H4 uptake values are UMCM-151-NH  2  (97.89) > UMCM-151-CH  3  (90.22) > UMCM-151-OCH  3  (94.13) > UMCM-151-F (72.24) > UMCM-151-Cl (67.32) > UMCM-151 (60.18) cm3 g-1 at 273 K, which are higher than UPC-33, FJI-C4, 1-FA, and comparable to that of 1-pim and 1-buim. There is no significant difference on the adsorption capacity of C2H6, C3H6, and C3H8 between the two electron-withdrawing groups (F, Cl), which is also present in the electron-donating groups (NH2, CH3, OCH3) (). Compared with the parent compound, the C2H2 uptake of UMCM-151-F increased by 1.98 times, while the C2H4 uptake of UMCM-151-NH  2  increased by 1.62 times. Adsorption experiments show that these functional groups can enhance the affinity with light hydrocarbons, especially for C2H2."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['gas_adsorption', 'surface_area', 'crystal_system', 'space_group', 'topology']"}]}

Accordingly, we have fitted the magnetic data with the isotropic S = 1/2 dimer model of Bleaney and Bowers, taking only into account the interactions through the bpym ligand (the Hamiltonian is written as H = -2JS  a  S  b ) and adding a term for the paramagnetic contribution. A very satisfactory fit over the whole temperature range (2-300 K) is obtained with the following set of parameters: J = -90 cm-1, g = 2.12, and 4% of monomeric paramagnetic impurity (solid line in Figure ). The J value is similar to those found in other Cu-bpym-Cu bridges.

The XRD pattern shows that COMOC-2(lp) is isostructural with the rigid microporous aluminum biphenyl-4,4'-dicarboxylate DUT-5. COMOC-2 structure (Figure ) contains chains of octahedra cross-linked by BPDC2- organic linkers. The octahedral chains have a -O\ue5fbV-O\ue5fbV- coordination mode. The equatorial corners of the {VO6} octahedra are shared with BPDC2- ligands. The 1D orthorhombic channels parallel to the octahedral chains have an aperture of ~18.9 \u00c5 \u00d7 19.4 \u00c5. The refined lp structure has an accessible pore volume of 68.2% (2092.7 \u00c53 per 3068.6 \u00c53), as calculated by PLATON. \n\nTo study the role of oxidation state in determining the extent of framework flexibility, the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms (Figure ) of COMOC-2(VIV) and COMOC-2(VIV/VIII) at 77 K were measured and compared. Both samples reveal a two-step sorption behavior, typical for flexible MOFs. For COMOC-2(VIV), a gradual adsorption occurs until P/P 0 = 0.5, when the isotherm reaches its first plateau. Then a very strong uptake of N2 can be observed, rising steeply in the area P/P 0 = 0.5-1.0; leading to a final uptake volume of 510 cm3/g at P/P 0 = 0.98 (The maximum N2 uptake volume of COMOC-2(VIV) with different batches is around 510 \u00b1 40 cm3/g). This sorption amount is similar to that of DUT-5, which has a Langmuir surface area of about 2335 m2 g-1 and a total N2 sorption amount of ~600 cm3 g-1. A hysteresis occurs upon desorption. For COMOC-2(VIV/VIII), the N2 sorption isotherms at 77 K also reveal a two-step sorption behavior. However, the first plateau is maintained until P/P 0 = 0.6, then followed by a large nitrogen uptake at higher relative pressures, leading to almost the same sorption amount as for COMOC-2(VIV) at P/P 0 = 0.98. It is interesting to note that the presence of VIII in COMOC-2(VIV/VIII) compared to pure COMOC-2(VIV) increases the difficulty in triggering the flexibility of the framework. This phenomenon is contrary to MIL-47, in which the presence of VIV centers inhibits the flexibility to a large extent. The reason that COMOC-2(VIII/VIV) needs a higher nitrogen pressure to open up the pores might be due to remaining internal stabilization effects (e.g., H-bonding).\n\nGas/Vapor Sorption Isotherms\n\nTo further verify the structural transformation of COMOC-2(VIV), CO2, CH4, and n-hexane sorption isotherms were measured. As shown in Figure a, the adsorption isotherms at 303 K for both CO2 and CH4 show a classical type I shape, with a capacity of 4.8 mmol of CO2 g-1 at 25 bar and 1.4 mmol CH4 g-1 at 27 bar. At 265 K, however, the CO2 and CH4 isotherms become distinctively different. In the CO2 sorption isotherm at around 12.5 bar, a sudden increase in adsorption is observed, reaching 14 mmol g-1 at 28 bar, corresponding to almost complete pore filling based on the nitrogen porosimetry data. Two distinct steps are clearly observed, revealing a breathing of the framework. Desorption occurs with a large hysteresis loop. This loop is explained with the stress model developed by Neimark et al. According to this model, structural transition or phase transformation, i.e., the breathing effect, occurs when a certain critical stress threshold is reached. As a consequence, the structural transition pressure depends on the stress threshold. As the stress threshold is different for the various phases, a hysteresis occurs in the adsorption-desorption process. Also at this lower temperature, CH4 presents a type I isotherm. The desorption curve for CH4 almost coincides with an adsorption isotherm without the occurrence of any hysteresis. The adsorption profile of COMOC-2(VIV) shows a distinctive adsorption step at 265 K for CO2 but not for CH4. This is similar to the CO2 and CH4 adsorption behavior of MIL-53 at 304 K. \n\n n-Hexane, having larger molecular weight and thus comparatively larger van der Waals interactions, shows the two-step adsorption behavior associated with framework breathing at 323 K. As shown in Figure b, in the first plateau, when COMOC-2(VIV) is in the np form, the adsorption capacity is ~2 mmol g-1. The framework opens up at P/P 0 = 0.2 to reach a final hexane adsorption capacity of 4.7 mmol g-1 or almost 40 wt % at the saturation pressure."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['porosity', 'gas_adsorption']"}]}

The pillaring bipy site in the asymmetric unit was statistically disordered together with two other ligated dabco sites and two lattice water sites with a total site occupancy of 1. Nickel, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms were refined anisotropically, and carbon atoms were refined isotropically. The hydrogen atoms were assigned isotropic displacement coefficients U(H) = 1.2U(C), and their coordinates were allowed to ride on their respective atoms.

The complete exchange of the longer pillaring ligand bipy by the shorter pillaring ligand dabco in 2a significantly reduced the pore volume and the specific surface area. The partial exchange of the pillaring ligand by the shorter pillaring ligand dabco in 3a also led to a reduced N2 uptake amount and BET surface area compared with those of 1a. The N2 uptake amount and the BET specific area of 3a were 305 cm3/g and 1150 m2/g, respectively. As expected from the intermediate dimension with the selectively and alternatively exchanged mixed pillars, these values are smaller than those of 1a with pure bipy pillar, but larger than those of 2a with pure dabco pillar. All the activated samples, 1a-3a, are stable in air at least for a couple of hours. The activated samples exposed in air for a couple of hours did not indicate any decrease in N2 uptake amounts. However, an extended exposure in air or a soaking in water led to the complete loss of the crystallinity and the porosity of the activated samples. The activated samples exposed to air for one month or soaked in water overnight did not show any powder diffraction peaks and did not adsorb any N2 at 77 K.\n\nCO2 and CH4 Sorption Behaviors of the MOFs\n\nThe effects of the modified pore dimensions of 2a and 3a compared with that of 1a are reflected in the sorption behavior of CH4 and CO2 (Figures  and  and Figures S4 and S5 of the ). At 195 K, decreased CH4 uptake amounts on 2a and 3a (106 and 118 mg/g, respectively) were observed compared with that of 1a (152 mg/g) (Figure  and Figure S5 of the ). However, at 273 K, slightly increased uptake amounts on 2a and 3a were observed compared with that on 1a (Figure a). The larger CH4 sorption uptake amounts at 273 K on 2a and 3a with the smaller pore volumes compared with that on 1a with the larger pore volume are due to the larger CH4 adsorption enthalpy on 2a and 3a (approximately -21 and -23 kJ/mol, respectively) than that on 1a (approximately -17 kJ/mol) (Figure b). On the other hand, at 273 K, the CH4 uptake amount on 2a (38 mg/g) is similar to that on 3a (34 mg/g) even though the pore volume of 2a is significantly larger than that of 3a.\n\nThe sorption behavior of CO2 on 1a-3a is different from that of CH4 (Figure  and Figure S6 of the ). The qualitative uptake behavior of CO2 on 1a-3a looks similar to that of CH4 (Figure a). Although, at 195 K, the CO2 uptake amount on 3a (447 mg/g) is ~1.2 times that on 2a (379 mg/g), at 273 K the CO2 uptake amount on 3a (261 mg/g) is ~2.2 times that on 2a (119 mg/g), which is caused by the larger CO2 adsorption enthalpy on 3a (approximately -27 kJ/mol) than that on 2a (approximately -22 kJ/mol) (Figure b). Although the pore dimension of 3a based on the N2 uptake amount is larger than that of 2a, the adsorption enthalpy of 3a on CO2 is larger than that of 2a, which is due to the combined effects of the different properties of the pillaring ligands and of the unsaturated metal sites generated from the solvent or monodentate dabco-ligated Ni(II) centers in 3a. The less hydrophobic nature of aromatic bipy and aliphatic dabco as mixed pillaring ligands in 3a compared to that of pure aliphatic dabco in 2a is responsible for the larger adsorption enthalpy of CO2 with a larger polarizability and quadrupole moment on 3a than 2a. In addition, the presence of the unsaturated metal sites is also contributing to the larger adsorption enthalpy of 3a versus that of 2a. At 1 bar and 273 K, the CO2 uptake amount of 1a is 316 mg/g, which is the second largest amount yet reported at this temperature, and almost comparable with the largest amount of SNU-5, 385 mg/g. More interestingly, although the uptake amount of 3a at 1 bar and 273 K is smaller than those of 1a and SNU-5, the uptake amount at ~0.15 bar (which is the partial pressure of CO2 in flue gas), 141 mg/g, is almost twice the uptake amounts of 1a and SNU-5 at the same pressure, 72 and 73 mg/g, respectively.\n\nH2 Sorption Behaviors of the MOFs\n\nAt 77 K, interestingly, although the specific surface areas and the pore dimensions of 2a and 3a were significantly reduced compared with those of 1a, the H2 uptake amounts of 2a and 3a (19.5 and 21.1 mg/g, respectively) were only slightly reduced compared with that of 1a (23.1 mg/g) (Figure a). At 87 K, more interestingly, the H2 uptake amounts of 2a and 3a (16.5 and 16.6 mg/g, respectively) are even slightly larger than that of 1a (16.0 mg/g). The increased adsorption enthalpies of 2a and 3a (Figure b), which come from the more extensive interaction of the adsorbate H2 with the pore surface of the reduced pore dimensions, are responsible for the H2 sorption behaviors. Surprisingly, the H2 adsorption enthalpy of 2a with no unsaturated metal sites is slightly larger than that of 3a with the unsaturated metal sites. The interaction of H2 with the pore surface of 2a with the smaller pore dimension compared with that of 3a with the larger pore dimension is responsible for the slightly larger H2 adsorption enthalpy of 2a versus that of 3a.\n\nThe authors declare no competing financial interest.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nBrunauer-Emmett-Teller\n\n4,4'-bipyridine\n\ntwo-dimensional\n\nthree-dimensional\n\n1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane\n\n N,N'-dimethylformamide\n\nelemental analysis\n\n1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid\n\nmetal-organic frameworks\n\npostsynthetic ligand exchange\n\npostsynthetic modification\n\npowder X-ray diffraction\n\nsingle-crystal-to-single-crystal\n\nReferences\n\nEven though the sample of 1 was activated according to the reported procedure at 150 \u00b0C under vacuum for 12 h, the N2 uptake amount and the BET specific area of 1a are significantly larger than the reported values, 290 cm3/g and 970 m2/g, respectively.

Compound 1 is obtained by means of the reaction of the SBU with manganese(II) acetate in the presence of potassium cations and the 18-crown-6 ether, whereas compound 2 is obtained by means of the reaction of the SBU with manganese(II) acetate in the presence of Ph4PCl. The [MnCu3(Hmesox)3]- and [MnCu3(Hmesox)3Cl]2- moieties in compounds 1 and 2, respectively, yield chiral 3-connected three-dimensional (3D) anionic (10,3)-a (srs, SrSi2) nets. In the cubic and centrosymmetric structures (Pa3\u0305) of 1, two inversion-symmetry-related anion nets interpenetrate to a racemic structure. The Ph4P+ cations in 2 are organized in a supramolecular (10,3)-a net through the 6-fold phenyl embrace. In 2, both the cationic and anionic nets are homochiral and enantiopure with opposite handedness and form interpenetrating supramolecular and covalent (10,3)-a nets in the noncentrosymmetric Sohncke space group P 212121.

The different spin states of the tricopper(II) unit in 1 and 2 has been explained by means of a density functional theory (DFT) study performed in the [Cu3(Hmesox)3]3- and [Cu3(Hmesox)3Cl]4- fragments, for 1 and 2, respectively.

Each Mn(II) ion is 6-coordinated in an octahedral geometry. The Mn(1) atom coordinates to six oxygen atoms from four different L6- anions. Two coordinated nodes of the terminal Mn(2) atom are from the aqua ligand [O(1W)] and DMF molecule [O(20)]; the others are from carboxyl oxygen atoms. An axial site of the terminal Mn(3) atom is coordinated by an aqua ligand [O(2W)]; the other oxygen atoms are from H6L ligands. The Mn-O distances range from 2.077(2) to 2.414(2) \u00c5. The six carboxyl groups in the L6- anion are bidentate or tridentate and bridge 10 Mn2+ ions. The Mn(1)O6 octahedron connects to terminal Mn(2) and Mn(3) octahedra via corner and edge sharing to form trinuclear MnII 3 subunits. There are two types of bridges (syn-syn \u03bc2-carboxylate bridge and oxygen bridges from L6- ligands) in the trinuclear unit, and it shows obvious symmetric breaking with Mn\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Mn distances of 3.308(1) and 3.495(1) \u00c5 and Mn-O-Mn angles of Mn(1)-O(5)-Mn(2) 103.7(1)\u00b0, Mn(1)-O(8)-Mn(3) 94.8(2)\u00b0, and Mn(1)-O(18)-Mn(3) 92.9(2)\u00b0. The distances and angles between metal centers are within a range of F coupling reported. They are shorter and smaller than distances and angles between metal centers of similar complexes in the literature, respectively. As seen in Figure , such trimetallic building units (SBUs) are linked by L6- ligands into a 3D porous framework along the (010) direction with four types of 1D channels (11.97 \u00d7 8.35 \u00c5, 8.89 \u00d7 7.92 \u00c5, 8.78 \u00d7 8.05 \u00c5, and 8.03 \u00d7 7.80 \u00c5). All pore sizes in this work are calculated through taking into account the van der Waals radius. The solvent-accessible volume is approximately 5330.5 \u00c53 per unit cell volume, and the pore volume ratio is calculated to be 54.5% using the PLATON program. Each L6- site is also a four-coonected node with two couples of carboxyl groups chelating two Mn3 II subunits, similar to compounds 1 and 2. TOPOS analysis reveals that this framework can be simplified as a 4-coordinated uninodal sra net with a point symbol of 42.63.8.\n\nAs shown in Figure , the magnetic properties of 1-3 are displayed in the form of \u03c7m -1 and \u03c7m T versus T plots from 2 to 300 K. The \u03c7m T versus T plot exhibits values of 13.49, 13.46, and 12.16 cm3 K mol-1 at 300 K for 1-3, respectively. The inverse susceptibility plot as a function of temperature is linear above 15 K, following the Curie-Weiss law with a Weiss constant of \u03b8 = -12.72 K for 1, -17.32 K for 2, and -22.70 K for 3. Curie constants are 14.11, 14.13, and 13.11 cm3 mol-1 K for 1-3, respectively, close to the spin-only value as expected for three isolated Mn2+ ions (13.125 cm3 mol-1 K with S = 5/2) with g = 2.0 each.\n\nFor 1, the \u03c7m T versus T plot decreases slightly in most of the temperature range on cooling and decreases more rapidly under 60 K to a value of 4.86 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K. The negative value of \u03b8 and the total decrease of \u03c7m T should be attributed to the overall antiferromagnetic coupling between metal centers within the trimer. For 2 and 3, their \u03c7m T curves show similar diversification at high temperature. They decrease continuously with decreasing temperature and reach a minimum of 5.10 cm3 mol-1 K at 6.5 K and 4.53 cm3 mol-1 K near 8 K, respectively, indicating an antiferromagnetic coupling among the Mn2+ ions, which also indicates that the dominant interaction between spin carriers is antiferromagnetic at high temperature. Below this minimum, the \u03c7m T rises quickly to 6.94 cm3 mol-1 K for 2 and 8.38 cm3 mol-1 K for 3 at 2 K; that may be the signature of the ferrimagnetic behavior or spin-canting response. In contrast to the above measurement for compound 1, the low-temperature magnetization for 2 and 3 is clearly different from each other.\n\nThe magnetization curves at 2 K for 1-3, which are shown in the inset of Figure , sharply increase to reach a value of ca. 4.62, 4.24, and 2.73 N\u03b2 at a field of 20 kOe, then slowly increases to a saturation value of 5.95, 5.37, and 4.21 N\u03b2 at 50 kOe. The saturation value for compound 3 is far from the value anticipated for a net spin value of S = 5/2 with g = 2.0 (5.00 N\u03b2) in the local ferrimagnetic [5/2 + 5/2 - 5/2], further confirming the predominant antiferromagnetic coupling between the MnII ions. Its magnetization curve exhibits a hysteresis loop with a critical field of 500 Oe and a remnant magnetization of 0.05 N\u03b2, which is in agreement with the weak ferromagnetic response of this compound at low temperature. No hysteresis loop was observed at the temperature for 2.\n\nConsidering their structral information shown in Figure , in compound 1, the MnII 3 subunit is linear and centrosymmetric with a Mn\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Mn distance of Mn(1)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Mn(2) 3.755(1) \u00c5. Compound 2 is linear and noncentrosymmetric with one type of carboxylate bridge [Mn\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Mn distances of 3.627(1), 3.641(1), and 7.267(1) \u00c5]. In compound 3, Mn(1) atoms are linked to Mn(2) by one \u03bc2-O bridge from the carboxylate group and two carboxylate bridges; Mn(1) is linked to Mn(3) by two \u03bc2-O bridges from carboxylate groups and one carboxylate bridge. Therefore, there are two sets of magnetic exchange pathways within the trinuclear: carboxylate bridges and \u03bc2-O bridges. The different coordinated molecules of terminal metal centers cause symmetry breaking in trinuclear units. The bent angle of Mn(2)-Mn(1)-Mn(3) is 155.02(3)\u00b0, for compound 3, as shown in Figure . From centrosymmetric trinuclear subunits (1) to obvious symmetry breaking (2 and 3), the consequent magnetization data at low temperature increases sharply: 4.86 cm3 mol-1 K for 1, 6.94 and 8.38 cm3 mol-1 K for 2 and 3, respectively. The fitting data (Weiss constant \u03b8 and intrasubunit coupling constants J 1) also show similar increasing variation. J 1 (intrasubunit coupling constants) values are 1 < 2 < 3 (increasing symmetry breaking). This is in view of developing the structure-magnetic property relationships, and to provide a platform for further development of interesting porous magnetic materials.\n\nAs seen in Figure , the TGA curve of compound 1 shows two main steps of weight losses. The first step (129-242 \u00b0C) corresponds to the release of two noncoordinated DMA molecules and four coordinated DMA molecules; the observed weight loss of 14.2% is very close to the calculated value (13.9%). The second step covering a temperature range of 350-477 \u00b0C corresponds to the combustion of carboxylate ligands. The total weight loss at 477 \u00b0C is 85.8%.\n\nThe TGA result of 2 reveals the first weight loss of 23.9 wt % in the temperature range of 70-202 \u00b0C corresponding to the release of solvent molecules inserting into the pores (8 equiv of DMF per formula unit), coordinated DMF, and aqua ligands. The second weight loss occurred in the temperature range of 280-486 \u00b0C, which corresponds to the loss of coordinated DMF and aqua ligands, and combustion of carboxylate ligands and a total weight loss of ca. 82.9% at 486 \u00b0C.\n\nThe TGA curve of compound 3 also exhibits two main steps of weight losses (Figure ). The first step (48-178 \u00b0C) exhibits two continuous weight losses, which correspond to the release of five DMF molecules, coordinated DMF molecules, and two aqua ligands. The observed weight loss of 33.43% is larger than the calculated values (26.55%), which may be the water molecules of surface adsorption. The second step (316-423 \u00b0C) corresponds to the combustion of carboxylate ligands. The total observed weight loss is 84.9% at 423 \u00b0C for 3."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['space_group', 'porosity', 'magnetic_susceptibility', 'magnetization', 'decomposition_temperature']"}]}

We investigated the sorption properties of CAU-13 towards various gases and vapors at low (p \u2264 1 bar) and high pressures (p \u2264 40 bar). From the adsorption isotherm of N2 at 77 K, the specific surface area (380 m2 g-1) and the micropore volume (0.15 cm3 g-1) were determined. These experimental data are in good agreement with the calculated pore volume of 0.17 cm3 g-1 using PLATON  and the simulated accessible surface area (450 m2 g-1) estimated using a Monte Carlo algorithm, following the same strategy as previously reported by Du\u0308ren et al. The H2O sorption isotherm of CAU-13 at 298 K is presented in Figure , while the isotherms for N2, CO2, and H2 obtained up to a pressure of 1 bar are shown in Figure S13 in the .\n\nThe H2O sorption isotherm exhibits an S shape. Because of the hydrophobic character of the pore walls, adsorption does not begin at low partial pressures but is shifted to p/p 0 = 0.15. This effect has also been observed for functionalized MIL-53 derivatives Al-MIL-53-Cl, -Br, and -CH3. The steep increase at p/p 0 = 0.2 corresponds to the adsorption of one water molecule per formula sum (Figure ) and is in accordance with the water molecule that was localized in the structure of CAU-13\u22c5H2O by Rietveld refinement. At higher relative pressures, a maximum of 1.8 mol mol-1 water are adsorbed. The maximum amounts of CO2 and H2 adsorbed at 298 K and 1 bar are 75 and 6.8 mg g-1, respectively. These values correspond to less than one molecule per formula sum (0.36 and 0.73 mol mol-1). An overview of the adsorbed amounts in mol mol-1, mg g-1, and wt % is listed in the  (Table S8). Except from the water sorption experiment, no stepwise adsorption of the guest molecules could be observed in the low-pressure region. In order to investigate whether such adsorption steps occur at higher adsorbate concentrations, high-pressure isotherms at 303 K were recorded using N2, CH4, CO2, and CO. Simultaneously, the adsorption enthalpies were determined by microcalorimetry. The adsorption isotherms and a plot of the adsorption enthalpies against the adsorbed amount are reported in Figure . The exact adsorbed amounts and adsorption enthalpies are presented in Table S8 in the .\n\nThe high-pressure adsorption isotherms show that CAU-13 exhibits porosity towards all investigated gases. All isotherms show a steeper increase at lower pressures than at higher pressures, which is most distinct regarding the adsorption of CO2 and CH4. Unlike the MIL-53 compounds, CAU-13 does not show a stepwise adsorption of the investigated adsorbates, which implies that there are no guest-induced sudden structural changes. The observed capacities for the adsorbates are relatively small. At 303 K and 23 bar, CAU-13 adsorbs 2.78 mmol g-1 CO2 (0.60 mol mol-1), similar to the amount adsorbed by the np form of Al-MIL-53, which is only stable up to a CO2 pressure of 6 bar. However, the lp form of Al-MIL-53 is formed above this pressure and adsorbs almost 4 times the amount of CO2 (~10 mmol g-1, 2.1 mol mol-1). The relatively flat enthalpy profiles observed for all four samples during pore filling suggests a relatively homogeneous energetic surface. A comparison of the adsorption enthalpies obtained for the adsorption of CO2 shows that the adsorption enthalpy of CAU-13 (-39 kJ mol-1) is similar to that observed in the first step in the experiments with the np form of Al-MIL-53 (-35 kJ mol-1) or with STA-12 (-32 kJ mol-1), which features open metal centers. In contrast, the adsorption enthalpy for methane is remarkably higher for CAU-13 (-32 kJ mol-1) compared to Al-MIL-53 (-17 kJ mol-1). Furthermore, the methane uptake is high with respect to that observed for nitrogen and carbon monoxide. This can be explained by the smaller pore diameter of CAU-13 and thus a higher degree of confinement, which leads to an increase of the host-guest interactions. However, these drastic differences in the methane adsorption enthalpies and uptakes of methane by CAU-13 may also be related to a contribution of the aliphatic pore environment.\n\nIn Situ PXRD and CO2 Adsorption\n\nThe adsorption of water and CO2 in MIL-53 leads to similar structural changes. Because CAU-13 has already shown a small breathing effect upon the uptake of water, a similar effect was expected for the adsorption of CO2. Because the adsorption isotherms measured at 298 and 303 K gave no direct evidence for a breathing effect, the CO2 sorption of CAU-13 was additionally followed in situ by synchrotron PXRD at 195 K. At this lower temperature, a larger amount of CO2 can be adsorbed. The experiments were performed at beamline KMC-2 at BESSY, Berlin, Germany. The corresponding adsorption isotherm is presented in Figure S3 in the  (left) together with an overview of the relative pressures at which PXRD patterns were recorded. At the conditions used for this study (195 K, p \u2264 1 bar), CAU-13 adsorbs 24 wt % (1.2 mol mol-1) CO2. During the experiment, PXRD patterns were recorded. Significant parts of the patterns are shown in Figure  (top). The full patterns are presented in Figure S3 (right) in the . A noticeable shift of the reflections corresponding to the crystallographic b axis (i.e., 010 and 01\u03051) can be observed, whereas the position of the 001 reflection is not remarkably influenced.\n\nWe studied the liquid- and vapor-phase single-component xylene adsorption on CAU-13 and also the competitive adsorption from the liquid phase. In Figure , the liquid-phase batch adsorption isotherms of CAU-13 are presented. The experiments were carried out at 298 K using mesitylene as the eluent. For o-xylene, a slightly higher uptake (17 wt %, 0.34 mol mol-1) than those for p-xylene (15 wt %, 0.29 mol mol-1) and m-xylene (14 wt %, 0.28 mol mol-1) can be observed.\n\nThe PXRD patterns exhibit a shift of the reflections to lower angles in the order CAU-13\u22c5H2O < CAU-13(empty pore) < CAU-13(xylene, vapor phase) < CAU-13(excess xylene). Indexing of the powder patterns obtained for CAU-13 loaded with the xylene isomers and Pawley refinements gave rise to cell volumes of 1350 \u00c53 for the m-xylene-loaded sample and 1317 \u00c53 for the o-xylene-loaded sample. The unit cell of p-xylene-containing CAU-13 is doubled in the direction of the one-dimensional pores (a axis), giving a cell volume of 2654 \u00c53. The results of the refinement and final Pawley plots are presented in Table S4 and Figure S8 in the . With a cell content of Z = 4 [8 for CAU-13(pX)], this corresponds to a relative expansion by ~25% compared to CAU-13(empty pore) (V = 540 \u00c53, Z = 2; Table ). The volume changes are accompanied by an increase of symmetry from the triclinic space group P1\u0305 to the monoclinic space group P21. On the basis of these findings, structural models have been set up in the space group P21 using Materials Studio 5.0.

As shown in Figure S3, three isomorphous frameworks showed similar TGA curves; thus we chose compound 1 as a representative to discuss their stability. From room temperature to 265 \u00b0C, a weight loss of 15.33% can be observed, which corresponds to the encapsulated [H3O]+ cations, DMA, and H2O molecules (calcd 15.35%). Subsequently, a complicated weight above 265 \u00b0C was observed, possibly attributed to the collapse of the charge-imbalanced framework. Finally, compound 1 starts to decompose sharply above 521 \u00b0C.\n\nThe powder XRD diffractions of 1, 2, and 3 are shown in Figure S4, and the PXRD patterns are almost identical to the simulated one, indicating that compounds 1, 2, and 3 are pure phases.\n\nLuminescent Behaviors and Sensing Properties\n\nUnder excitation at 295 nm, the emission spectra of compounds 1 and 2 were measured and are recorded in Figure S5. For compound 1, the five characteristic emission peaks of Eu3+ were observed at 538, 592, 614, 653, and 696 nm (Figure S5a), attributed to the transitions of 5D1 \u2192 7F1 and 5D0 \u2192 7F J  (J = 1, 2, 3, 4) from Eu3+ ions, respectively. In terms of Eu3+ transition rules, Eu3+ ions with inversion center sites emit orange light due to the transitions of the magnetic dipole (5D0 \u2192 7F1); on the other hand, Eu3+ ions with noninversion center sites emit red light, due to the transitions of the electric dipole (5D0 \u21927F2). Considering the transitions of 5D0 \u2192 7F1 and 5D0 \u2192 7F2 in compound 1, the stronger 5D0 \u2192 7F2 transition clearly revealed that Eu3+ ions locate at noninversion centers, according to the structural analyses. In 2, two typical emission peaks of Dy3+ were observed, at 480 and 575 nm (), attributed to the 4F9/2 \u2192 6H15/2 and 4F9/2 \u2192 6H13/2 transitions, respectively. \n\nMoreover, the detection limit of 1 as a chemical sensor for detecting Al3+ was also investigated: 4 mg samples of 1 were ground and immersed in a series of concentrations of Al(NO3)3 DMF solutions (1 \u00d7 10-4 to 7 \u00d7 10-4 M) for 5 min. As shown in , the luminescence intensity of samples of 1 gradually decreases as the Al3+ concentration increases, and the luminescence intensity almost completely quenches as Al3+ increases to 7 \u00d7 10-4 M. Additionally, the decrease of emission still could be observed clearly under a 10-4 M Al3+ DMF solution, revealing that the detection limit of 1 as a chemical sensor for sensing Al3+ ions could reach 10-4 M. To further investigate the Al3+ concentration of the quenching effect on compound 1, the luminescence intensity (614 nm) versus Al3+ concentration was charted (Figure S7), which could not be linear fitted to the Stern-Volmer equation, indicating that the quenching mechanisms are caused not only by the dynamic quenching processes. \n\nMagnetic Properties\n\nThe magnetic susceptibilities of the microcrystalline samples of compound 2 were measured in a temperature range from 1.8 to 300 K and under a 1000 Oe field (). Generally, 2S+1L J  states are derived from the split of the 4f n  configuration due to the coexistence of spin-orbit coupling and interelectronic repulsion. Additionally, because of the influence of the weak crystal field perturbation, each 2S+1L J  state would be split into Stark sublevels, and the thermal depopulation of these Stark sublevels would cause the \u03c7M T to gradually decrease with decreasing temperature. As shown in , the value of \u03c7M T for compound 2 is 35.18 cm3\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1 at 300 K, which is close to the calculated value of 35.43 cm3\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1 expected for two and a half noninteracting Dy3+ in the 6H15/2 ground state (g = 4/3). Upon cooling, the value of \u03c7M T decreases gradually to reach 26.69 cm3\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1 at 1.8 K; hence, the essence of the interaction between Dy3+ ions in compound 2 cannot be completely decided, since the \u03c7M T value decreases when the temperature is lowered."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['decomposition_temperature', 'peak_spectrum', 'magnetic_susceptibility']"}]}

For 1, the weight loss of 12.82% below 207 \u00b0C (calcd 12.74%) corresponds to the loss of two coordinated water molecules/formula. Then the compound begins to decompose.

The second loss corresponding to the release of almost all coordinated water molecules is detected between 80 and 160 \u00b0C (obsd 4.29%, calcd 4.02%). Two consecutive decompositions suggest the  total destruction of the framework by the oxidation of the organic component, leading to the formation of the stoichiometric amount of zinc oxide as the residues (obsd 18.68%, calcd 18.18%).

Excitation at 342 nm leads to stronger blue-fluorescent emission bands at 417 nm for 1, 447 nm for 4, and 418 nm for 5 while weaker blue-fluorescent emission bands are observed at 420 nm for 2 and 458 nm for 3, respectively, under the same conditions. These emissions are neither metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) nor ligand-to-metal transfer (LMCT) in nature since the Zn2+ or Cd2+ ions are difficult to oxidize or to reduce due to their d10 configuration which can probably be assigned to the intraligand (\u03c0-\u03c0*) fluorescent emission because similar emissions are observed for the free PDCO at 416 nm. It is clear that bathochromic shift of emission occurs in 3 and 4, compared with other compounds, which is probably due to the differences of ligands and coordination environment around central metal ions, because photoluminescence behavior is closely associated with the local environments around metal ions.

With the exception of 6, the \u03c7T values at 300 K are in rather good accordance with the presence of the expected number of isolated octahedral Ni2+ ions (S = 1; g = 2.1, ). The thermal dependence of \u03c7T for 1, 3, and 4 reveals the presence of a plateau for all compounds down to 150 K before diverging from the Curie law upon further cooling. The observed positive deviation is indicative of dominant ferromagnetic interactions between the Ni2+ ions, and the maximum \u03c7T values are 9.23 (6 K), 3.68 (8 K), and 13.91 cm3 K mol-1 (8.5 K) for 1, 3, and 4, respectively. For 1 and 4, the maximum values of \u03c7T are lower than the theoretical value of 11.02 cm3 K mol-1 (S = 4 species, g = 2.1) and 23.1 cm3 K mol-1 (S = 6 species, g = 2.1) calculated for these isolated molecules assuming ferromagnetic interactions between all the nickel ions. For lower temperature, a steep decrease in \u03c7T is observed for 1, 3, and 4, which may originate from zero-field splitting and/or intermolecular interactions (a). The field dependence of the magnetization, M, at 1.8 K confirms the presence of rather ferromagnetic interactions at low temperature for 1 and 4 without reaching a clear saturation, indicating the presence of a magnetic anisotropy (b). Note that compound 3 presents a very weak value of the magnetization at 70 kOe, which may be explained by a strong zero-field splitting occurring due to an unusual geometry of Ni(II) ions in this structure.\n\nThe room-temperature \u03c7T value for 5 is equal to 4.04 cm3 K mol-1, which is slightly lower than the expected value of 4.40 cm3 K mol-1 for four noninteracting octahedral Ni2+ ions with g = 2.1. The thermal dependence of \u03c7T shows a progressive decrease down to a minimum value of 3.25 cm3 K mol-1 at 60 K and then a dramatic increase to a value of 5.87 cm3 K mol-1 at 8 K (a). This value remains lower than the expected value of 11.00 cm3 K mol-1 in the case of ferromagnetic coupling between all the spin carriers. Such a shape of the \u03c7T vs T curve reflects the occurrence of both competitive antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions within the tetranuclear unit mediated by different magnetic pathways.

To determine the maximum ReO4 - capacity of NU-1000 and examine the associated kinetics, MOF samples (5 mg) were exposed to aqueous sodium perrhenate solutions (15 mL) with Re concentrations corresponding to 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3 ions per MOF node (28, 43, 57, 71, and 85 ppm). The amount adsorbed q in mg of perrhenate per gram of NU-1000 was determined using   1    q =    (   C   i   -   C   f   )  V   m     where C i = initial concentration (mg/L), C f = final concentration (mg/L), V = volume of solution exposed to NU-1000 (L), and m = mass of NU-1000 (g). Adsorption isotherms were constructed by monitoring q as a function of time () and indicate that NU-1000 reaches maximum uptake within 5 min of exposure, which can be attributed to the rapid diffusion of solvent through the large pores (30 \u00c5) of NU-1000. The maximum adsorption capacity of NU-1000 for perrhenate was determined to be 210 mg/g using the Langmuir eq () making NU-1000 among the best sorbents reported to date (). \n\nPost-Adsorption Characterization\n\nFull postadsorption characterization of NU-1000 was performed to confirm the retention of both crystallinity and porosity. From powder X-ray diffraction patterns, it is apparent that NU-1000 remains crystalline throughout adsorption (). Zirconium concentrations were monitored in all ICP-OES experiments and indicate no leaching, further verifying the stability of NU-1000. Additionally, N2 isotherms before and after adsorption are nearly identical in shape with Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of 2140 \u00b1 5 m2 g-1 (1010 \u00b1 5 m2 cm-3) and 1640 \u00b1 5 m2 g-1 (1040 \u00b1 5 m2 cm-3), respectively (). The decrease in surface area is consistent with the increase in mass due to adding perrhenate to the framework and is in agreement with surface area reductions we have seen when capturing sulfate and selenate in NU-1000 and when installing catalysts in NU-1000 via postsynthetic modification. The associated pore size distribution further corroborates the existence of binding motifs within both pores as shown by the SCXRD data (). Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) further elucidates the binding motifs of perrhenate within NU-1000. Neat NU-1000 exhibits a strong peak at 3674 cm-1 corresponding to non-H-bonding -OH stretches and this peak is diminished after perrhenate capture confirming the exchange of hydroxyl groups on the node for perrhenate anions ().\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, the water-stable, Zr6-MOF NU-1000 was evaluated as a sorbent for aqueous perrhenate and found to have an adsorption capacity for ReO4 - of 210 mg/g. Over a range of concentrations, NU-1000 was found to reach its maximum capacity within 5 min of exposure, presumably due to its large pores that facilitate diffusion and easy access to the nodes that contain substitutionally labile Zr-OH sites. Importantly, screening with pertechnetate further indicates NU-1000 is an effective sorbent and confirms that perrhenate is a suitable simulant for pertechnetate. Additionally, the presence of competing anions including chloride, bromide, iodide, and nitrate did not inhibit the adsorption of ReO4 -; whereas sulfate only slightly reduced ReO4 - adsorption. Furthermore, NU-1000 can be regenerated after ReO4 - adsorption by washing with dilute HCl and the MOF consistently adsorbs 1.8 ReO4 - ions per node through 5 cycles of exposure and washing. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction was used to elucidate the ReO4 - binding motifs which include a unique chelating mode in both the small pore and the mesopore, and two additional unique nonchelating modes in each pore. The facile, large-scale preparation of NU-1000, large pores, and high concentration of accessible nodes, and our recently garnered understanding of perrhenate binding at the node, make this material a promising candidate for pertechnetate remediation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['gas_adsorption', 'surface_area', 'pore_diameter']"}]}

It contains one-dimensional close-packed open channels with a pore diameter of 4.5 \u00c5. It demonstrates a remarkable thermal stability, a unique ability to separate methanol from dimethyl ether or water, and is among the microporous MOFs having the highest adsorbed hydrogen density (0.054 g/cm3 at 77 K and 1 atm). \n\nThere has been some concern on practical utility of porous metal organic materials due to their thermal instability. Many of these compounds being investigated are incapable of withstanding prolonged and repeated heating, even at relatively mild temperatures. However, as an exception, GFMMOFs can possess exceptionally high thermal stability. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis of 1 showed that no weight loss occurred during a prolonged heating at 350 \u00b0C (over 24 h). The structure retained its crystallinity fully. This was verified by PXRD analysis immediately after TGA. This remarkable feature demonstrates that MMOFs of this type may indeed be suitable for applications that require frequent adsorption-desorption cycles over long time periods, such as on-board hydrogen storage. \n\nThe pore characteristics and hydrogen adsorption capabilities of 1 were characterized by gas sorption study using a previously described procedure. The DA (Dubinin-Astakhov)2q pore volume of 1 was calculated to be 0.14 and 0.15 cm3/g based on the N2 and Ar sorption data collected at 77 and 87 K, respectively (Figure a). Both follow a typical Type I isotherm. A gravimetric density of 0.75 and 0.52 wt % of hydrogen was achieved at 77 and 87 K and 1 atm, respectively (Figure b). The density of adsorbed H2 at 77 K and 1 atm, calculated to be 0.054 g/cm3, is as high as that of our previously reported value, 0.053 g/cm3, which is one of the highest values among the porous metal organic frameworks reported to date. This high hydrogen density was achieved with relatively small multipoint BET surface area, 256 m2/g, from N2  adsorption data at 77 K, and smaller pores compared to [M3(bpdc)3bpy]\u22c54DMF\u22c5H2O (M = Co or Zn). In addition, the isosteric heats of hydrogen adsorption Q st of 1 were calculated to be 6.7-6.4 kJ/mol (coverage 0.02-0.5 wt %). These values are similar to those of [Co3(bpdc)3bpy]\u22c54DMF\u22c5H2O, suggesting a relatively strong adsorbent-adsorbate interaction. It leads us to believe this high density is a result of suitable pore diameter (comparable to H2 kinetic diameter) and effective pore structure (close-packed 1D channels).  \n\nThe new MMOF material is also of great interest because of its potential for unique applications in gas separation. The effective cross-section of the 1D channels in 1 is ~4.5 \u00c5, allowing it to adsorb normal paraffins, methanol (MeOH), and dimethyl ether (DME) but to exclude aromatics. The intimate relationship between MeOH and DME in important reactions such methanol to olefins and methanol to gasoline made them prime candidates for our gas sorption study. Compound 1 has the property of being very hydrophobic, exhibiting essentially zero water adsorption (<~1 mg/g at P/P 0 = 0.65) but adsorbing high volumes of methanol, 110 mg/g at 24.5 \u00b0C and 90 Torr MeOH (P/P 0 = 0.73). The shape of the MeOH adsorption isotherms (Figure ) is typical for an adsorbent that exhibits relatively weak interactions with the adsorbate, adsorbing less than ~3 mg/g up to 40 Torr followed by a very sharp increase in adsorption as capillary condensation fills the pores with MeOH. The condensation point shifts ~4.7 Torr/1 \u00b0C, indicating that at ~15 \u00b0C capillary condensation should occur at very low pressure (e.g. 1 Torr MeOH). The Zn(tbip)/MeOH system also exhibits hysteresis (Supporting Information). The adsorption properties of 1 may be compared with those of pure silica ZSM-5 (4 ppm Al, silicalite), which is hydrophobic but adsorbs as much as 7 mg/g of water at P/P 0 = 0.65 and shows moderate affinity for MeOH (Supporting Information). Its MeOH adsorption isotherms are fitted reasonably by the Langmuir equation, with adsorption beginning at low pressures but not exhibiting the sharp increase associated with capillary condensation.  \n\nZn(tbip) also exhibits potential for the separation of DME from MeOH. The adsorption of DME, followed by MeOH, is illustrated in Figure . At 30 \u00b0C, 650 Torr (P/P 0 = 0.13), 30 mg/g of DME is rapidly adsorbed on 1. After 30 min, simultaneously, the pressure of DME is set to zero and MeOH is introduced at 85 Torr. As DME desorbs (P = 0) it is replaced by MeOH and quickly reaches the 105 mg/g adsorption level. Several separation schemes are possible. For example, at conditions of T and P below the MeOH capillary condensation point, DME will selectively adsorb for facile separation from MeOH. In a second case, T is chosen to maximize the difference between DME and MeOH adsorption, and after adsorption of the binary gases, a few degrees increase in temperature will result in desorption of a majority of the MeOH and a relatively small amount of DME. The isosteric heat of adsorption of DME computed from adsorption isotherms (Supporting Information), at Q = 10 mg/g loading, is 51 kJ/mol and is similar to that of MeOH (Q = 60 mg/g loading points of Figure ), 53 kJ/mol. Note the latter heats include substantial adsorbate-adsorbate contributions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['pore_diameter', 'gas_adsorption', 'decomposition_temperature', 'surface_area', 'selectivity']"}]}

Both complexes 1 and 2 have been characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectra, single-crystal X-ray diffraction, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Complexes 1 and 2 consist of 1D Co(II) chains bridging by carboxylate groups in syn-anti fashion. 1 shows a novel 3D tri-nodal (4,6,10)-connected net with a (3.43.52)2(32.414.512.612.74.8)(32.42.55.64.72) topology.

For complex 2, the pyrolysis of the sample occurred from 230 to 540\u00b0C.\n\nMagnetic properties\n\nThe temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibilities were measured on polycrystalline samples of 1 and 2 at 1000Oe in the range of 2-300K in  . For complexes 1 and 2, The value of \u03c7 M T at 300K is 2.78 and 3.47cm3 mol-1 K, respectively, which is much larger than the spin-only value (1.875cm3 mol-1 K) for one spin only Co(II) (S=3/2) ion, indicating the important orbital contribution arising from the high-spin octahedral Co(II) . Upon cooling, \u03c7 M T decreases to minimum value of 1.62cm3 mol-1 K at 3K for 1 and minimum value of 2.35cm3 mol-1 K at 12K for 2, and then increases to 1.70cm3 mol-1 K at 2K for 1 and 3.87cm3 mol-1 K at 2K for 2. Upon cooling, the decrease of \u03c7 M T at high temperature is a typical manner of spin-orbit coupling of Co(II) ions. The increases in \u03c7 M T under 12K for 2 are clearly indicative of ferromagnetism between neighboring Co ions . The temperature dependence of 1/\u03c7 M obeys the Curie-Weiss law with C=2.87cm3 Kmol-1 and \u03b8=-12.80K above 12K for 1 and C=3.62cm3 Kmol-1 and \u03b8=-13.80K above 25K for 2, revealing the presence of strong spin-orbit couplings.\n\nIn this equation,   x = \u03bb / k T  , ( \u03bb  is the spin-coupling parameter and A is a measure of the crystal field strength due to the inter-electronic repulsions).

The complex crystallizes in the hexagonal P63/m space group with the refined formula [Na6(H3O)4][Cu3(cbal)3(\u03bc3-OH)(H2O)3]4(ClO4)6\u22c53H2O (1). In the unit cell four anionic [Cu3(cbal)3(\u03bc3-OH)(H2O)3]- trinuclear units, six Na+ and six ClO4 - counter ions along with three water molecules of crystallization and additionally, to balance the total charge, four hydronium ions (formally O11 or O11B and O12) are present. The anionic cluster is constituted by three [Cu(cbal)] subunits in which each copper(II) ion is coordinated to a deprotonated tridentate ligand, cbal2-. The [Cu(cbal)] subunits are held together by two distinct bridging systems: (i) one \u03bc3-hydroxo group (O5) which is coordinated to each of the three copper centers  and (ii) the three bridging aliphatic carboxylate oxygen atoms, each coming from different ligand unit. The resulting trinuclear species can be viewed as either a partial cubane or a cubane with one missing corner of the [Cu3O4] core. In the trinuclear unit, the three copper(II) ions assemble at the corners of an equilateral triangle with ~3.202(2)\u00c5 edges ( ). Each copper(II) ion is in a Jahn-Teller distorted octahedral geometry with the bridging aliphatic carboxylate oxygen of the ligand and an exogenous H2O molecule occupying the elongated axial positions. While the square base of the octahedral geometry around each copper(II) center is defined by the O1, N1, O3' and O5 atoms, the axial positions are taken by O3 and O10 atoms. The average Cu-O(bridging hydroxo) and Cu-O(bridging carboxylate) bond distances are 2.017 and 2.137\u00c5, respectively. The Cu-O(hydroxo)-Cu and Cu-O(carboxylate)-Cu bridging angles are 105.1(2)\u00b0 and 96.77(18)\u00b0, respectively. The \u03bc3-O5 atom is located at 0.807\u00c5 above the plane defined by the three copper(II) ions. This induces a relatively bigger Cu-O(hydroxo)-Cu bridging bond angle of 105.1(2)\u00b0 on the structure when compared to the smaller Cu-O(carboxylate)-Cu bridging angle of 96.77(18)\u00b0. The observed Cu---Cu inter-metallic distance at 3.202(2)\u00c5 in the complex is comparable to the values reported in the literature . The crystal structure of complex 1 features several modes of carboxylate binding involved in a 3D coordination network in which the trinuclear Cu3 units are inter-linked through the Na+ ions (). The plentiful hydrogen bonding interactions among the coordinated water molecules and carboxylate oxygen atoms of the ligand contribute towards the stabilization of the crystal lattice.\n\nDescription of X-ray crystal structure of complex 2 \n\nA structural view of the trinuclear body of complex 2 with the atom numbering scheme is shown in  . The complex crystallizes in the monoclinic P21/c space group with the refined formula [K(H2O)2][Cu3(cbal)3(\u03bc3-OH)(H2O)]\u22c53.75H2O. Unlike to complex 1, each metal center of the Cu3 unit poses different coordination geometries. The coordination geometry around the Cu1, Cu2 and Cu3 centers is best described as distorted octahedral, square pyramidal and trigonal bipyramidal geometry, respectively. While the square base of the octahedral geometry around the Cu1 center is defined by the O1, O14, O3 and N1 atoms, the axial positions are occupied by the O11 and O13 atoms. The square base of the square pyramidal geometry around the Cu2 center is described by the O5, O14, O7 and N2 atoms, whereas the axial position is occupied by the O3 atom. The trigonal bipyramidal geometry around Cu3 center is defined by the O5, O11 and O7 atoms at the equatorial position, and N3 and O14 atoms at the axial position. The coordination environment of the counter cation K+ is best described by the distorted octahedral geometry, with four carboxylate and two water oxygens. The Cu1-O11 bond distance of 2.377(7)\u00c5 is slightly longer when compared to the 2.217(6) and 2.233(6)\u00c5 values for Cu2-O3 and Cu3-O7, respectively. The Cu-O(bridging carboxylate)-Cu bond angles are 97.6(2)\u00b0, 96.5(3)\u00b0 and 94.2(3)\u00b0 for Cu1-O3-Cu2, Cu2-O7-Cu3 and Cu3-O11-Cu1, respectively. The Cu1-O14 and Cu2-O14 bond length values between the copper(II) ions and the central \u03bc3-OH oxygen atom are almost identical at 2.069(6) and 2.002(6)\u00c5, respectively, while the Cu3-O14 distance is 1.966(6)\u00c5. The \u03bc3-O14 atom is located at 0.842\u00c5 above the plane defined by the three copper(II) ions. This opens the Cu-Ohydroxo-Cu bond angle to an average value of 103.69\u00b0. Unlike to complex 1, the Cu3 triangle in complex 2 is not equilateral as the Cu---Cu edges are at 3.115(2), 3.174(3) and 3.204(3)\u00c5 distances ( ). Again, the average Cu---Cu separation of 3.164\u00c5 is comparable to the values reported in the literature for similar complexes . Similar to complex 1, the crystal structure of complex 2 displays a 3D coordination network in which the trinuclear Cu3 units are connected to each other through K+ ions (). The complex 2 also shows an intricate hydrogen bonding among the coordinated water molecule, secondary amine and carboxylate groups of the ligand, contributing to the stabilization of the crystal structure.\n\nSolution UV-Vis and MS studies\n\nThe solution behavior of complexes 1 and 2 was analyzed using UV-Vis and mass spectrometric techniques. UV-Vis spectra were obtained on aqueous solutions (pH~7.5) of the complexes. The spectrum of complex 1 displays a broad absorption band at 705nm (\u03b5, 231lmol-1 cm-1) due to the d-d transition. The spectrum also shows two distinct metal ion bound ligand-based \u03c0\u2192\u03c0\u2217 transitions at 272nm (\u03b5, 7955lmol-1 cm-1) and 228nm (\u03b5, 27523lmol-1 cm-1). Similarly, the spectrum of complex 2 shows a broad absorption band at 719nm (\u03b5, 86lmol-1 cm-1) due to the d-d transition. The spectrum also indicates two distinct metal ion bound ligand-based \u03c0\u2192\u03c0\u2217 transitions at 274nm (\u03b5, 2074lmol-1 cm-1) and 225nm (\u03b5, 6771lmol-1 cm-1). No significant changes were observed in UV-Vis spectra when complexes 1 and 2 were measured in aqueous solutions (pH~7.5) after ~24h. The representative UV-Vis spectra for complex 1 are shown in the . Indeed, the solution stability of the cluster species has been authenticated previously using the spectrophotometric method .

For complex 1, the weight loss is from 30 to 123\u00b0C which is corresponded to the removal of one coordinated water molecule (calculated: 3.71%, found: 3.45%). The residual framework begins to decompose at 227\u00b0C and the retention weight is 14.73% (calculated: 14.62%), corresponding to MnO powder. Complex 2 and 3 remain stable up to 322\u00b0C and 300\u00b0C, respectively, then start to decompose.

The TGA curve of 4 shows a weight loss of 2.91% occurring in the range of 30-120\u00b0C corresponding to the removal of one water molecule (calculated: 2.61%). After the loss of the coordinated water molecule, the residue is stable up to 308\u00b0C and begins to decompose upon further heating. The departure of the structure finally leads to the formation of MnO (calculated: 10.29%, found: 10.79%).

As shown in  , the main emission peaks of the H2dpd, bpy and phen ligands are at 361, 390, 379nm (\u03bb ex =250nm), respectively, which may be attributed to the \u03c0\u2217-\u03c0 or \u03c0\u2217-n transitions of the intraligands .

The emissions of 1-6 may be assigned to intraligand transition upon the combination of the mixed ligands with metal ions . The different red shifts and intensities of the emission peaks of these complexes were observed compared with the emission of the free ligands, which may be assigned to the differences of the coordination environment and the different structures because the photoluminescence behavior is closely associated with the coordinated ligands and metal ions .

The crystal structure presents a novel 3D framework with the rare four-fold helical structure and open channels, exhibiting guest-coordination sites at channel walls and strong fluorescent emission.\n\nThermal properties of 1 \n\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) experiments were conducted to determine the thermal stability of 1, which is an important aspect for metal-organic frameworks. As shown in  , the first weight loss of 1 starts at 60\u00b0C and does not end until 330\u00b0C, which is mainly attributed to the strong interactions of DMF with metal ions. The consecutive weight loss from 330 to 600\u00b0C is probably caused by the decomposition of ligand, resulting in the collapse of host framework. For confirming that the host framework remains intact accompanying with the loss of DMF molecules, the PXRD measurements were performed, which indicate that the solid after removal of DMF by heating 1 to 330\u00b0C retains the initial framework which is consistent with the simulated one ( ).\n\nExchange of guest molecules of 1 \n\nDue to the strong interaction of DMF with metal ions, which makes it difficult to remove DMF from the open channels, a primary experiment immersing 1 in CH3CN solution for 3 days has been done to investigate whether DMF can be exchanged by CH3CN . The IR spectra exhibit that the strong CO stretching bands of DMF in 1662cm-1 disappear after immersing in CH3CN [IR (KBr, cm-1): \u03c5 =3449m, 2398s, 1574vs, 1469s, 1388s, 1242m, 1097s, 1016m, 814w, 660m], implying that DMF have been exchanged by CH3CN. The compound after guest exchange shows high crystallinity as indicated by sharp peaks observed in the PXRD pattern (). This observation shows that the cavity of 1 is so flexible that CH3CN molecules may be incorporated instead of DMF molecules without collapse or decomposition. From TG curve of the DMF-CH3CN exchanged product 1a, it can be clearly seen that 1a completely loses guest molecules below 300\u00b0C and the decomposition of ligand accompanying with the collapse of host framework occurs between 330 and 600\u00b0C. It should be noted that 1a shows a two-step desolventized process, in which the first one may be attributed to the loss of uncoordinated guest molecules included in the channels after guest exchange  and the second one is the loss of exchanged guest molecules coordinated to Zn atoms. Furthermore, the BET surface area measurement shows that the desolventized 1a possesses a surface area of 56.3m2/g, implying the permanent porosity of 1a.\n\nEmission property of 1 \n\nThe photoluminescence spectrum of 1 was measured in the solid state at room temperature ( ). Upon excitation at 310nm, complex 1 shows stronger fluorescent emission than that of the free H3 L ligand at 420nm. This may be attributed to the deprotonation of the ligand and the rigidity of framework .

As shown in  a, the Cd(II) ion is seven-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms (N8 and N4a) from two independent biimpy ligands and five carboxylate oxygen atoms (O8, O9, O6c, O7b and O7b) from three different Htci2- ligands, affording a slightly distorted pentagonal bipyramidal geometry. The CdO and CdN distances are in the range of 2.302(3)-2.544(3) \u00c5, 2.266(3)-2.270(3) \u00c5, respectively. In the self-assemble process, the H3tci ligand deprotonated two protons into Htci2-, and the Htci2- ligand adopts a cis-cis-trans conformation linking three different Cd(II) ions in \u03bc 3-(\u03b7 2-O,O'), (\u03b7 2-O\",O\u2034), O\u2034 coordination mode ( a). Two symmetry-related Cd(II) ions are bridged by two carboxylate groups into a dinuclear [Cd2(COO)2] subunit with the Cd\u22efCd separation of 3.897\u00c5. Under the synergetic bridging effect of Htci2- and biimpy ligands, the dinuclear [Cd2(COO)2] subunits are bridged together into a 2D layer (b). In this 2D layer, each dinuclear [Cd2(COO)2] subunit is connected to six adjacent identical ones via four biimpy ligands and four Htci2- ligands (each two Htci2- ligands links two dinuclear [Cd2(COO)2] subunits). Topologically speaking, the dinuclear [Cd2(COO)2] subunits can be regarded as 6-connected nodes, so this 2D layer represents a 6-connected 2D hxl plane topological network with the point symbol of {36,46,53} (c). Notably, there exist abundant hydrogen bonds between CH groups and O donors, which not only further consolidate the 2D layer but also extend the 2D layer into 3D supramolecular framework. The detailed hydrogen bond parameters are listed in .\n\nCrystal structure of compound 2 \n\n Via tuning the pH value of reaction mixture, another new compound 2 was obtained. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that compound 2 crystallized in the triclinic P-1 space group, and contains one and half Cd(II) ions, one tci3- ligand and one biimpy ligand. As shown in  b, the Cd1 ion is coordinated by two nitrogen donors (N4 and N8b) from two independent biimpy ligands and five carboxylate oxygen donors (O8, O9, O6b, O7b and O8c) from three different tci3- ligands, adopting a slightly distorted pentagonal bipyramidal geometry, and the Cd2 ion is four-coordinated by three carboxylate oxygen donors (O4, O5 and O7a) from two independent tci3- ligands and one coordinated water molecule (O1w), displaying a rare tetrahedral geometry. The CdO and CdN distances locate in the range of 2.087(7)-2.619(5) \u00c5, 2.253(5)-2.296(4) \u00c5, respectively.

The tci3- ligand using its carboxylate groups links the Cd(II) ions to form a 2D layer (b). These adjacent 2D layers are further pillared by the biimpy ligands, giving rise to a 3D pillar-layered framework (c).\n\nPowder X-ray diffraction patterns and thermogravimetric analyses\n\nIn order to confirm the phase purities of the synthesized two compounds, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) experiments were performed. As shown in , the experimental PXRD patterns of compounds 1 and 2 are in good agreement with the simulated patterns, which suggest that the as-synthesized samples are in single pure phase. In addition, thermal stabilities of compounds 1 and 2 were also investigated under N2 atmosphere in the temperature range of 30-800\u00b0C. For compound 1, it can be stable up to 267\u00b0C, and after that, obvious weight loss was observed owing to the decomposition of the organic ligand. The final residue of 19.95% may be powder CdO (Calcd: 198.28%) (). For compound 2, the first weight loss of 2.38% occurred in the temperature range of 125-150\u00b0C was resulted by the departure of the coordinated water molecule, and then, the skeleton can be stable up to 300\u00b0C. When heating above 300\u00b0C, continuous weight loss occurred until 450\u00b0C, leading to the formation of powder CdO (Obsd: 25.02%, Calcd: 26.02%) ().\n\nPhotoluminescent properties of compounds 1 and 2 \n\nThe solid-state luminescent properties of compound 1 and 2 as well as free organic ligands (H3tci and biimpy) were investigated at room temperature. As shown in  , the free H3tci ligand shows an emission peak at 425 nm upon excitation of 310 nm, which originates from \u03c0*\u2192n or \u03c0* \u2192 \u03c0 electronic transitions, and the free biimpy ligand is non-fluorescent in the visible range. Compared with that of the free ligand, compound 1 shows a luminescent emission band at 438nm (\u03bb ex=325nm), and compound 2 shows a luminescent emission band at 455nm (\u03bb ex=325nm) (). It can be observed that the emission spectra of compounds 1 and 2 have obvious red-shifts (13nm for 1 and 30nm for 2)with respect to the free H3tci ligand. Thus, the luminescent emissions of compounds 1 and 2 can be ascribed to the intraligand charge transfer. The red-shifts of emission spectra for compounds 1 and 2 were caused by the deprotonation of H3tci ligand and coordination effects to metal centers, which can effectively enhance the rigidity of organic ligand. In addition, the difference of emission peaks between 1 and 2 may be caused by the different deprotonated existent forms (Htci2- for 1 and tci3- for 2), different coordination environments for metal ions and different spatial frameworks [,]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['crystal_system', 'space_group', 'topology', 'decomposition_temperature', 'peak_spectrum']"}]}

As shown in Fig. S4, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) studies reveal that 1 gradually loses the free DEF and coordinated water molecules (obsd. 32.8%, calcd. 33.2%) in the temperature range 25-250\u00b0C to form the desolvated framework 1a. Typically, the free solvent molecules were lost first followed by the coordinated solvent molecules. However, because DEF has much higher boiling point (153\u00b0C) than water, DEF and coordinated water molecules might be released simultaneously from 1, so we cannot specifically assign the weight loss steps for these two types of solvent molecules from the TGA data. The temperature dependent PXRD patterns further confirm that desolvated framework keeps crystalline nature until 250\u00b0C, though the diffraction peaks were slightly broaden and shifted. After gas sorption, 1a still exhibits a moderately high crystalline nature, indicating that 1a displays a permanent porous structure.\n\nTo check the selective adsorption properties of 1a, hydrogen and nitrogen adsorptions were carried out at 77K; carbon dioxide, methane, and acetylene adsorptions were carried out at 273K and 296K, respectively. As shown in  , 1a can take up a relatively significant amount of hydrogen (24.4cm3/g) but a negligible amount of nitrogen (2.3cm3/g) at 77K and 1atm, underlying a good capacity of 1a for H2/N2 separation . 1a can also absorb 23.3cm3/g acetylene and 23.0cm3/g carbon dioxide, but a very limited amount of methane (7.3cm3/g) at 273K and 1atm ( ). Their adsorption isotherms at 296K (Fig. S6) further confirmed the different gas uptakes of 1a for these examined gas molecules, underlining the potential of these new MOFs for the selective gas separation of C2H2/CH4, CO2/CH4.\n\nThe coverage-dependent adsorption enthalpies of 1a to carbon dioxide, acetylene, and methane were calculated based on the virial method, a well-established and reliable methodology from fits of their adsorption isotherms at 273K and 296K (Fig. S7) . The enthalpies at zero coverage of gas were calculated to give the values of 38.3, 34.7, and 28.6kJ/mol for C2H2, CO2, and CH4 respectively. The adsorption enthalpies for C2H2, CO2, and CH4 in 1a are moderately higher than those reported values . The relatively high Qst  of this compound may be due to the pore size and open metal sites in the activated framework, which favors the selective gas separation for these large gas molecules. Henry's law selectivities (Sij ) for C2H2/CH4, CO2/CH4 calculated respectively based on the equation Sij  = KHi /KHj , are also shown in Table S1, which are moderately high .\n\nThe X-ray diffraction data was collected using synchrotron radiation, \u03bb=0.40663\u00c5, at Advanced Photon Source on beamline 15ID-C. Indexing was performed using APEX2 (difference vectors method). Data integration and reduction were performed using SaintPlus 6.01. Absorption correction was performed by multi-scan method implemented in SADABS. The structure was solved using SHELXL-2014 (direct methods) and refined using SHELXL-2014 (full-matrix least-squares on F2) contained packages. Despite of using synchrotron source and trying several crystals from different batches, diffraction experiment resulted in low quality diffraction data. This can be attributed to the presence of the solvent disorder and to the presence of bad quality, multiply twinned crystals. All non-H atoms were found in the difference Fourier map and were refined using the distance restraints. Hydrogen atoms were placed in geometrically calculated positions and included in the refinement process using riding model with isotropic thermal parameters: Uiso(H)=1.2Ueq(-CH). The DEF solvents could not be located. Contributions to scattering from all solvent molecules were removed using the SQUEEZE routine of PLATON; the structure was then refined again using the data.

Within the chain, there are two crystallographically independent Cu(I) and Cu(II) ions. The oxidation states of Cu ions are further confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS spectrum of 2 (Fig. S1) shows the evident peaks of 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 at 932.08eV and 952.08eV, respectively, which means the presence of Cu(I) in the compound. The satellite peaks at 942.08eV and 961.08eV indicate that 2 may also contain Cu(II) ions . In addition, the appearance of black crystals of 2 is the typical color of mixed-valence oxide state containing Cu(I)/Cu(II) ions . The coexistence of Cu(I) and Cu(II) is due to the partly reduction of Cu(II) under basic hydrothermal conditions , and methanol in this reaction may act as the reducing agent .\n\nThe thermalgravimetric analyses (TGA) are performed on the single crystal samples of 1 and 2 with a heating rate of 10\u00b0C\u22c5min-1 under nitrogen atmosphere, as shown in Figs. S2 and S3. The TGA curves of the two compounds show the similar process of thermal decomposition with three stages. For 1, the first mass loss stage from 60 to 125\u00b0C is confirmed as the loss of uncoordinated and coordinated water molecules with residual weight of 10.55% (cal: 10.32%). The second stage occurs between 125 and 190\u00b0C and is attributed to the loss of Hatrz ligand with 66.10% (cal: 65.86%). The third stage from 310 to 370\u00b0C is considered as the break of pda ligand and then the compound is completely converted to CuO with residual weight of 22.25%, which is in good agreement with calculated value 22.81%. For 2, the first stage is confirmed as the loss of coordinated water molecules with 5.10% (cal: 4.58%) during 30-90\u00b0C. The second and third stages in the range of 155 to 380\u00b0C are considered as loss of atrz and pda ligands, respectively, with residual weights of 74.00% (cal: 74.30%) and 40.80% (cal: 40.45%). Also, compound 2 is converted to CuO. Two remainders after thermal decompositions are evidenced by X-ray powder diffraction analysis (Fig. S4).\n\nHMX is a typical highly energetic material which has been widely used in the main component of solid rocket propellant. The performance of HMX can be enhanced by reduce the peak temperature of decomposition and increase the heat release . To check the effects of thermal decomposition of HMX after adding the as-synthesized compounds, 1, 2 and HMX are mixed at a mass ratio of 1:30 to prepare the target samples. The study is investigated by DSC measurement with a heating rate of 10\u00b0C\u22c5min-1 in N2 atmosphere in the range of 100-500\u00b0C with Al2O3 as reference. The Kissiger's method is used to investigate the activation energy (E a) and pre-exponential factor (A) of thermal decomposition for HMX and HMX with additives by DSC measurement with four different heat rates of 5, 10, 15 and 20\u00b0C\u22c5min-1 .   shows the DSC curves of HMX and HMX with 1 and 2. In a, the endothermic and exothermic peaks at 197\u00b0C and 289\u00b0C of HMX are attributed to the phase transformation and decomposition temperatures, respectively, and the heat release of exothermic process is 1200J\u22c5g-1. From b and c, we can see that the mixtures have no significant impact on the phase transition of HMX. The peak temperature of HMX containing 1 decrease from 289\u00b0C to 280\u00b0C and the heat release up to 1410J\u22c5g-1 while that of HMX containing 2 reach to 272\u00b0C and 1550J\u22c5g-1. It can be inferred that the compounds decompose and release much heat itself, as well as the formation of metal and oxide at molecular level on propellant surface may contribute toward their catalytic effects .\n\nThe single-crystal X-ray data for 1 and 2 were collected on a Bruker SMART CCD diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb=0.71073\u00c5) at room temperature. Absorption corrections were applied using SADABS.

The two compounds are isostructural as deduced from a Rietveld analysis of X-ray powder diffraction data of 2 simulated from the single crystal structure of 1. The crystal packing of 1 is formed by regular chains running along the crystallographic [-101] direction where the planar [Pt(CN)4]2- anion acts as a \u03bc2-bridging ligand via two nitrogen atoms of two different trans cyano groups, while the two abpt molecules act as chelating ligands. Along the neutral chains, the Fe\u22efPt distances are imposed by the cyano groups of the [Pt(CN)4]2- moiety (5.027 and 5.022\u00c5 at 294 and 150K, respectively), leading to Fe\u22efFe intrachain distances of 10.055 and 10.045\u00c5 at 294 and 150K, respectively.

As indicated above, despite several attempts to prepare single crystals of nickel analogue (compound 2) using different techniques such as slow evaporation, slow diffusion in H tube and gel diffusion technique, only polycrystalline powder has been prepared. In order to verify whether the Ni(II) and Pt(II) analogues are isostructural, the measured powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the two samples were analysed using the Rietveld method, and compared to the patterns simulated from the single crystal structure of 1. As shown in  , the diffraction pattern of 1 is well reproduced using the room temperature (294K) single crystal structure of 1, with refined cell parameters (a =8.480(1)\u00c5, b =9.039(1)\u00c5, c =10.070(1)\u00c5, \u03b1 =83.707(4)\u00b0, \u03b2 =65.384(3)\u00b0, \u03b3 =88.968(4)\u00b0) close to the results of the single crystal analysis.\n\nThe microcrystalline powder of 1 is a pure phase corresponding to the derived single crystal structure. The measured pattern of 2 is qualitatively similar to the pattern of 1; with noticeable variations in diffraction peak intensity most probably due to the contrast in X-ray scattering power between Pt (for 1) and Ni (for 2). The results of the Rietveld analysis indicate a small difference in refined unit cell parameters (a =8.525(1)\u00c5, b =9.241(1)\u00c5, c =9.658(1)\u00c5, \u03b1 =83.97(1)\u00b0, \u03b2 =65.262(6)\u00b0, \u03b3 =90.71(1)\u00b0) with respect to the structure of 1; the c cell parameter decreases by 0.412(1)\u00c5 (4.1%), while the unit cell volume is reduced by 8.6\u00c53 (1.2%). The major differences in the diffraction pattern, such as the observed quasi splitting of several peaks (e.g. at 2\u03b8 =9.8\u00b0, 11.5\u00b0), result from the large decrease in the c cell parameter from 1 to 2.

Photoluminescence properties of 1-4 in solid state at ambient temperature were studied, too.\n\nResults and discussion\n\nStructure description of 1 \n\nThe crystal structure determination reveals that compound 1 crystallizes in the orthorhombic crystal system of Pbcn. Theasymmetric unit contains one Zn(II) cation, one bimb ligand and one deprotonated L2- ligand and one DMF molecule, which is omitted for clarity ( a). In the asymmetric unit, the Zn(II) cation is coordinated by two carboxylic O atoms from two H2L ligand and two nitrogen atoms from two bimb ligands to form a distorted tetrahedron geometry. In an asymmetric unit, the two carboxylate groups of the H2L ligands take the same coordination modes. They all take a monodentate coordination mode ( a). The bond lengths of Zn-O bond distance vary in the range of 1.964(3)-1.970(3)\u00c5 and the Zn-N bond distance is 2.029(3)-2.030(3)\u00c5. All these distances and bond angles are within the normal range (). The N ligand connect Zn atoms to form a 1D chain. Then the L2- ligands join all infinite 1D chains into a 3D framework. If L2- and bimb are considered as linkers, Zn(II) centers can be clarified as four-connected nodes. Thus the topology of the structure can be simplified asa 3D framework of (66) topology (b). Because of the space nature of the single structure, four identical structure mutually interpenetrate each other into a 4-fold interpenetrated framework (c). Interestingly, in the structure the Zn centers are connected by organic ligands to build two different double helixes. Each double helixex can be split into two mirror-symmetric helical chains which combine together by sharing the Zn centers and L2- anions (d).\n\nStructure description of 3 \n\nCompound 3 crystallizes in themonoclinic crystal system in space group P2/n. In the asymmetric unit, it contains an independent Zn(II) cation, an L2- ligand, a half of a bimp ligand and three H2O molecules ( a). The coordination geometry for each Zn atom is a distorted octahedron with four O atoms from four different ligands forming the middle plane. One nitrogen atom and one Znatom are in the axial position of the distorted octahedron. In this compound, the H2L ligand acts asa \"V-shape\" link and the carboxylate group adopts a bismonodentate coordination mode (c) to bridge two Zn centers to form paddlewheel [Zn2(CO2)4] clusters, the distance of Zn-Zn is 2.9746(6)\u00c5. The Zn-O bond lengths are in the range of 2.0225(19)-2.1314(19)\u00c5 and the Zn-N bond length is 2.022(2)\u00c5. All these distances and bond angles are within the normal range (). Each L2- ligand links two Secondary building units (SBUs) to form a 2D layered network (b). Within the layer, there exists one 1D helical chain {- ZnL2-- ZnL2-}, with a pitch of 19.811\u00c5 based of the repeat unit three Zn(II) and two L2- motifs (e  and f). Then the bimp ligand links the layers to further generate an infinite 3D framework (c). The dinuclear Zn(II) SBUs can be regarded as 6-connected nodes with the L ligand acting aslinkers. A topology analysis reveals that the structure can be represented as the Schlafli symbol {412\u22c563}, as displayed in d. Because of the space nature of the single structure, two identical structures mutually interpenetrate each other into a 2-fold interpenetrated framework (d).\n\nStructure description of 4 \n\nThe crystal structure determination reveals that compound 4 crystallizes in themonoclinic crystal system in space group C2/c. Theasymmetric unit contains one Zn(II) cation, one bimp ligand, one deprotonated L2- ligand and seven H2O molecule, which is omitted for clarity ( a). In the asymmetric unit, the Zn(II) ions is coordinated by two carboxylic O atoms from two L2- ligands and two nitrogen atoms from two bimp ligands to form a distorted tetrahedron geometry. In an asymmetric unit, the two carboxylate groups of the L2- ligand take the same coordination modes. They all take a monodentate coordination mode (a). The bond lengths of Zn-O bond distance vary in the range of 1.933(3)-1.945(3)\u00c5, and the Zn-N bond distance is 2.028(4)\u00c5. All these distances and bond angles are within the normal range ().\n\nThermal analysis\n\nTo characterize the thermal stabilities of compounds 1-4, their thermal behaviors were investigated by thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) (). The experiments were performed on samples consisting of numerous single crystals of 1-4 under nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10\u00b0C/min. For 1, the weight loss in the range of 25-270\u00b0C is attributed to the release of one free DMF molecules (obsd 9.68%, calcd 10.75%). The destruction of the framework occurs at ca. 350\u00b0C. The remaining weight corresponds to the formation of ZnO (obsd 11.2%, calcd 11.9%). For 2, the weight loss in the range of 25-250\u00b0C is ascribed to the departure of six free water molecules (obsd 11.43%, calcd 8.52%). The destruction of the framework occurs at ca. 400\u00b0C, finally leading to the formation of the stoichiometric amount of ZnO as residue (obsd 11.5%, calcd 13.4%). For 3, the weight loss in the range of 25-350\u00b0C is ascribed to the departure of three free water molecules (obsd 9.78%, calcd 9.96%). The destruction of the framework occurs at ca. 370\u00b0C, finally leading to the formation of the stoichiometric amount of ZnO as residue (obsd 15.8%, calcd 15.1%). For 4, the weight loss in the range of 25-330\u00b0C is ascribed to the departure of three free water molecules. The destruction of the framework occurs at ca. 370\u00b0C, finally leading to the formation of the stoichiometric amount of ZnO as residue (obsd 11.0%, calcd 8.2%).\n\nPhotoluminescence properties\n\nBecause of the excellent luminescent properties of d10 metal coordination polymers , the Zn(II) ion that can usually have a low coordination number of four with a tetrahedral coordination geometry, the luminescent properties of the compounds 1-4, and H2L were investigated separately in the solid state at room temperature, as shown in ( ). The emission peaks at 427nm for H2L (\u03bbex =397nm). the emission peaks were at 452nm in compound 1 (\u03bbex =395nm), 455nm in compound 2 (\u03bbex =388nm), 445nm in compound 3 (\u03bbex =359nm), 446nm in compound 4 (\u03bbex =375nm). These emissions it can be assigned to the intraligand (\u03c0-\u03c0\u2217 or \u03c0\u2217-n) fluorescent emission within the molecular orbital manifolds of the imidazolyl of bimb and bimp moieties and phenyl rings of H2L moieties because almost similar emission are observed for the free H2L. Compound 1-4 exhibits mission characteristics similar to those of the H2L ligand but Compound 1 and Compound 2 shows an obvious red shift about 25 and 28nm as compared with that of the H2L ligand, Compound 3 andCompound 4 shows about 18 and 19nm. The phenomenon may be assigned to ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT). These compounds may be suitable as excellent candidates of blue-fluorescent materials, since they are highly thermally stable and insoluble in common solvents."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['crystal_system', 'space_group', 'topology', 'decomposition_temperature', 'peak_spectrum']"}]}

BUT-29 can be used as an efficient adsorbent for the selective removal of organic cationic dyes in N,N'-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution. The adsorption capacities of BUT-29 toward methylene blue and crystal violet at 298K can reach 1119mg/g and 832mg/g, respectively. Moreover, the adsorbed dyes can be released in the DMF solution of LiNO3 gradually.\n\nIn this work, a tetratopic acid ligand with double Lewis pyridine sites, 4,4',4\",4'\"-(4,4'-(1,4-phenylene)bis(pyridine-6,4,2-triyl)) tetrabenzoic acid (H4PBPTTBA) has been designed and synthesized. The assembly of H4PBPTTBA with In(NO3)2\u22195H2O in DMF yielded a new anionic MOF, [In(PBPTTBA)][(CH3)2NH2] (BUT-29, where BUT=Beijing University of Technology). BUT-29 can rapidly and selectively adsorb organic cationic dyes including acriflavine hydrochloride (AH), acridine red (AR), safranine O (SO), methylene blue (MB), crystal violet(CV) and rhodamine 6G (R6G) through an ion-exchange process. Organic anionic and neutral dyes such as congo red (CR), orange G, naphthol yellow S (NYS), orange II, acid fuchsin (AF), methyl orange (MO), methyl yellow (MY), tartrazine, and isatin cannot be adsorbed by BUT-29. Furthermore, adsorption isotherms measured at 298K demonstrate that the maximum adsorption amounts of MB and CV in BUT-29 are 1119 and 832mg/g, respectively, and BUT-29 could be fully reused after washing with DMF solution of LiNO3 several times. These results indicate that BUT-29 is promising adsorbents for efficient capture of MB and CV from waste water.\n\nSingle-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals BUT-29 crystallizes in an orthorhombic chiral space group of C2/c. In the structure of BUT-29, the InIII ion adopts a tetrahedral linkage geometry through coordinating to eight O atoms from four carboxylate groups of four different PBPTTBA4- ligands ( a). The In-O distances are in the range of 2.2617(1) \u00c5 to 2.2905(1) \u00c5, being comparable to those of reported indium complexes . As shown in c, the carboxylate groups in PBPTTBA4- ligand exhibit chelating coordination mode, with each one coordinates to one InIII ion. Thus, one InIII connect to four PBPTTBA4- ligands and one PBPTTBA4- ligand connect to four InIII atoms to form a 3D framework with one dimensional (1D) rhombic channel, the edge length of which is 16.8\u00c5 (atom to atom distance). Furthermore, two such frameworks are mutually interpenetrated (d). After removal of free solvent molecules, the total solvent-accessible volume of BUT-29 is estimated to be 71.3% by PLATON. From the topological viewpoint, each In(COO)4 node and PBPTTBA4- ligand can be viewed as 4-connected nodes, the 3D structure of BUT-29 can thus be simplified as a 4,4-c net with the point symbol of (42 \u00d784), corresponding to a Pts-type topology. It should be noted that in the framework of BUT-29, every InIII atom connect with four carboxylic groups, thus, in its pore, there should exist counter-cations to balance the charge of the framework. However, due to the disordered nature, these counter-cations could not be identified through single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. We speculate that these counter-cations should be (CH3)2NH2+, which is a common by-product in the solvothermal reaction when DMF was used as solvent. EA analysis was then carried out, which showed extra N content inside the pore, which implied the presence of (CH3)2NH2+. Furthermore, in the TGA curve of the as-synthesized BUT-29, there exist a 7.1% weight loss between 200\u00b0C and 340\u00b0C, which is well corresponding to the presence of one (CH3)2NH2+ ion per formula (Fig. S1).\n\nBased on the large rhombic channels and cationic framework of BUT-29, we sought to explore its application in the removal of organic dyes. Fifteen dyes including AH, AR, SO, MB, CV, R6G, CR, orange G, NYS, orange II, AF, MO, MY, Tartrazine, and Isatin were checked. Freshly prepared BUT-29 was well activated and then immersed in DMF solutions of these dyes at room temperature. The adsorption abilities of BUT-29 toward these dyes were determined by UV-vis spectroscopy. As shown in  a-d and Figs. S4 (Supporting information), nearly all the cationic dyes can be removed within 15min, while the anionic and neutral dyes could not be absorbed. To future demonstrate the selective adsorption of BUT-29 toward cationic dyes, the MOF samples were soaked in the binary mixtures of MB/MO, MB/RB with the concentration ratio is 50/50, respectively. The results were as expected: only the MB was absorbed by the BUT-29 in the solution mixture and the solutions exhibited the color of MO or RB at last and the color of the BUT-29 changed from yellow to blue (inset photograph of e and f). Moreover, compared to other absorbents using a few days, the absorption rate of cationic dyes by BUT-29 was really fast, and nearly 100% of dye molecules can be absorbed within 10min. The high adsorption rate is attributed to the large size of the cage windows (12.4\u00d77.1\u00c5) and negative charged framework.\n\nIn the above experiments, it was showed that MB and CV can be completely adsorbed within 6min and 4min in BUT-29, respectively (a and c). Thus, we further explored the adsorption isotherms of MB and CV in BUT-29 at 298K. As shown in  a, the maximum adsorption amounts of MB and CV in BUT-29 are 1119 and 832mg/g, respectively. These values are comparable and even higher than those in other porous materials reported so far (Table S2 in Supporting information). In addition, we further measured the of FT-IR spectra of MB loaded BUT-29 and found the appearance of an extra characteristic peak in the wavenumber of 1323cm-1, which should be the stretching vibration peak of C-N bond of MB molecules, indicating that MB molecules are indeed adsorbed into the pores of BUT-29 (Fig. S5 in Supporting information). The superior performances of BUT-29 in MB and CV adsorptions could be ascribed to their large specific surface areas, suitable pore size, as well as the ionic interactions between the cationic dye and anionic framework structure of BUT-29. Moreover, Langmuir  and Freundlich  models were used to fit and examine above adsorption isotherms respectively. The related parameters are given in Figs. S6 and S7 in Supporting information. Obviously, the data are well fitted by the Langmuir model, indicating a homogeneous and monolayer adsorption occurring in BUT-29 with a finite number of identical sites.\n\nIn summary, a new In(III)-based MOF, BUT-29, has been designed, synthesized, and used in the selective adsorption of organic cationic dyes in DMF solution. BUT-29 has a 3D framework with one dimensional (1D) rhombic channel, which is occupied by (CH3)2NH2 2+ counter ions. BUT-29 can be used as an excellent candidate for the selective adsorption of organic cationic dyes and its maximum adsorption amounts toward MB and CV are 1119mg/g and 832mg/g, respectively, comparable or higher than those in other porous materials reported so far. The adsorption isotherms of BUT-29 toward MB and CV can be fitted by the Langmuir model, indicating a homogeneous and monolayer adsorption process. In addition, BUT-29 can be fully reused after washing with DMF solution of LiNO3 several times."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['gas_adsorption', 'crystal_system', 'space_group', 'topology', 'decomposition_temperature']"}]}

It has been already reported earlier  that the spectra of the free ligand (LH) shows two intraligand charge transfer (CT) bands at 331 and 248nm whereas the spectra of all three complexes show three different CT bands at 450, 322, 266nm (1), 402, 324, 258nm (2) and 406, 328, 262nm (3). Accordingly in 1, 2 and 3 the bands obtained at 322, 266nm, 324, 258nm and 328, 262nm are assigned to intraligand charge transfer transitions respectively but since the spectrum of the free ligand has no CT bands in the region 402-450nm hence we can conclude that CT bands obtained at 450, 402 and 406nm in 1-3, respectively, are associated to L\u2192M charge transfer transitions. Besides these allowed bands, the three compounds also show much weaker and less well defined broad bands at 630nm (1), 600nm (2) and 634 and 682nm (3) which are assigned to the d-d transitions in the respective complexes. The band at 630nm for 1 is attributed 1 A 1g \u2192 1 T 1g transition for the distorted octahedral cobalt(III) ion, whereas d-d transition at 600nm for 2 is attributed to structurally well characterized square planar copper(II) complexes . Unlike 1 and 2, the two broad d-d bands obtained for 3 are in good agreement with the simultaneous presence of two different coordination environments in the complex. The band at 634nm is associated with a copper(II) center having a distorted octahedral geometry and the d-d transition at 682nm indicates the presence of copper(II) ions residing in a distorted square pyramidal geometry .\n\nMagnetic properties\n\nThe thermal variation of the molar magnetic susceptibility per copper(II) dimer times the temperature (\u03c7 m T) for compound 2 shows at room temperature a value of ca. 0.50emuKmol-1 ( ). This value is significantly lower than the expected one for two non interacting CuII S =1/2ions (0.75emuKmol-1 for g =2.0). When cooling down the sample, the \u03c7 m T product shows a pronounced decrease to reach a plateau of ca. 0.01emuKmol-1 at ca. 50K. Below this temperature \u03c7 m T remains constant and almost negligible down to 2K (). This behavior indicates that compound 2 presents a strong antiferromagnetic coupling, as indicated by the low \u03c7 m T value at room temperature and by the fact that the \u03c7 m T plot shows a pronounced decrease starting above room temperature. As expected, this strong antiferromagnetic coupling leads to an S =0 spin ground state. The very low \u03c7 m T value observed at low temperatures comes from the presence of a small amount of paramagnetic impurity (probably as copper(II) monomers). This strong antiferromagnetic coupling is also confirmed in the thermal variation of the molar magnetic susceptibility (\u03c7 m) that shows a broad maximum near room temperature (inset in ). The paramagnetic impurity is also clearly observed as a Curie-type tail at low temperatures.\n\nThis model reproduces very satisfactorily the magnetic data of 2 in the whole temperature range with g =2.240(9), J =-362(2) K =-252(1)cm-1, N\u03b1 =220\u00d710-6 emumol-1 and c =0.4(1)% (solid line in ).\n\nAs expected, the magnetic coupling is strong and antiferromagnetic, in agreement with the magneto-structural correlations established for azide-bridged copper(II) complexes and with DFT calculations. These calculations show that the \u03bc1,3-N3 bridges give rise to strong antiferromagnetic interactions when the azide bridge connects equatorial positions in a square planar or square pyramidal geometry () . These calculations, performed for an ideal square pyramidal geometry, indicate that, given the structural parameters of 2, the coupling should be very strong and antiferromagnetic, in agreement with the experimental value.\n\nCatalytic studies\n\nCatalytic properties of 1 for alkene oxidations\n\nThe ability of 1 to catalyze the oxidation of styrene was investigated using various oxidants including PhIO, H2O2, m-CPBA and O2. O2 was found not to be a good oxidant under conditions used here, but the complex showed to be an efficient catalyst for the styrene oxidation when PhIO is the oxidant. In Cl2CH2, the presence of 0.2mol% 1 catalyze the oxidation of styrene with PhIO to yield 75% conversion in 3h, and 90% conversion in 6h ( )."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['peak_spectrum', 'magnetic_susceptibility', 'catalytic_activity']"}]}

The Cd-O distances vary from 2.193 (4) to 2.756 (5)\u00c5 and the Cd-N distances vary from 2.342 (5) to 2.373 (5)\u00c5. The O-Cd-O angles are in the range from 51.51\u00b0 to 176.2\u00b0 and the O-Cd-N angles are in the range from 81.74\u00b0 to 171.0\u00b0.\n\nCrystal structure of {[Pb3(L)2\u22c5(NMP)2\u22c5(H2O)]\u22c5H2O}n (4)\n\nX-ray crystallography reveals that complex 4 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P\u012b. The asymmetric unit consists of one and a half crystallographically independent Pb(II) ions, one fully deprotonated L3-, one coordinated NMP molecule, and one half coordinated H2O molecule. Structural analysis reveals that there exists 1D infinite rod-shaped metal chain SBUs in the crystal structure (b). As shown in a, there are two types of Pb(II) atoms in the rod SBU. Pb1 is six connected by six O atoms from four L3- ligands, Pb2 is six connected by three O atoms from three L3- ligands, one H2O molecule and two NMP molecules. The Pb-O distances vary from 1.026 (13) to 2.748 (5) \u00c5, and the O-Pb-O angles are in the range from 50.12\u00b0 to 160.12\u00b0.\n\nPXRD and thermal analyses\n\nThe PXRD data reveals that the peak positions of the synthesized crystalline samples of 1-4 matched with the simulated results from the single-crystal data, indicating the phase purity of the synthesized samples (). The TGA of 1-4 were carried out under a N2 atmosphere from 35 to 700\u00b0C (). 1 releases three coordinated NMP molecule before 265\u00b0C with a total weight loss of 22.8% (calcd. 23.9%). No further weight loss is observed before the framework collapses at 380\u00b0C. 2 loses 9.7% (calcd. 9.8%) weight before 168\u00b0C, corresponding to the departure of one Diox molecule, and the framework could keep intact until about 415\u00b0C, showing good thermal stability. 3 loses 11.3% (calcd. 13.3%) weight before 140\u00b0C is assigned to the loss of one free NMP and three coordinated water molecules. The main framework is thermally stable up to 330\u00b0C and then decomposes at a higher temperature. 4 presents a weight loss of 2.1% (calcd. 2.5%) before 190\u00b0C, arising from the release of one coordinated H2O and one lattice H2O molecules.\n\nWater stability of 1-4\n\nIn order to further study the water stability of the 1-4, the experiments were carried out by immersing 40mg of 1-4 crystals in 5mL in water at room temperature for some time and the 1-4 crystalline structures were confirmed by PXRD, respectively. The PXRD patterns contained for 1-4@H2O are the coincidence of the experimental PXRD patterns with those simulated from the single-crystal structures, respectively, revealing excellent stability in water ().\n\nLuminescence properties\n\nComplexes constructed by d10 metal centers and conjugated organic linkers are promising candidates in photochemistry, chemical sensors, and electroluminescent displays . In this paper, the solid-state luminescence properties of the free ligands and 1-4 were studied at room temperature. As displayed in , the free H3L show a strong emission peak at 375nm (\u03bbex =330nm), which may be derived from the intraligand \u03c0*-\u03c0 and/or \u03c0*-n transition. Complexes 1-4 exhibit a maximum emission peak at 369nm (\u03bbex =319nm), 385nm (\u03bbex =330nm), 453nm (\u03bbex =343nm) and 515nm (\u03bbex =356nm), respectively. The emission spectrum of 1 exhibits a slight blue shift of 6nm at 375nm compared to that of H3L ligand, which can be assigned to the intraligand \u03c0-\u03c0* or n-\u03c0* transition of H3L. The emission spectrum of 2 displays the slight red shift of 10nm for the 375nm band compared to that of H3L ligand, which may arise from the ligandcentered \u03c0-\u03c0* electronic transitions compared to the reported luminescent d10 MOFs . Complexes 3-4 exhibit an obvious red-shifts of 78nm and 140nm for the 375nm band, respectively, which can be attributed to the ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) between the delocalized \u03c0-bond of carboxylate groups and p orbitals of Cd(II) and Pb(II) centers, respectively . Moreover, complex 1 has an enhanced luminescence intensity compared to 2-4, which can be explained by the differences in the structures. The different emission intensity for 1-4 mainly derives from the differences in the coordination modes of the L3- ligand, and the coordination environments of the metal ions and the rigidity of the solid-state crystal packing. Whereas the rigid and stable framework of 1 can reduce this loss of energy and thus maintaining enhanced luminescence intensity. More importantly, it is sensing properties were further researched to detect different metal ions in aqueous solution  ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['crystal_system', 'space_group', 'topology', 'decomposition_temperature', 'peak_spectrum']"}]}

The study of the photochemical properties of coordination polymers is of great interest since such materials often exhibit much higher thermal stability than the corresponding organic ligand, and the fluorescence of the ligand may be tuned by metal coordination . The solid-state emission spectra of free dppe and the complexes 1-5 were measured at room temperature. The dppe ligand exhibits an emission band at 435nm upon excitation at 306nm. Compared to the free ligand, the compounds show red- or blue-shifted emission bands with significantly enhanced intensities, which are attributed mainly to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). The red shift occurs for the iodide complexes 1 (479nm) and 4 (484nm), while the blue shift is observed for the chloride and bromide complexes 2 (394nm) and 3 (398nm) ( ). This is tentatively assigned to the lower transition energies for the iodo-to-metal charge-transfer processes compared to the chloro- or bromo-to-metal transitions . Nevertheless, it is possible that these ligand-to-metal transitions also mix with an intraligand transition. No detectable fluorescence was observed for the Hg(II) complex 5 under the experimental conditions, indicating a quenching of the fluorescence by the Hg(II) ion via the heavy atom effect . Interestingly, the fluorescent intensity of the cadmium iodide complex 4 is much stronger than that of the zinc iodide 1, which is probably due to the differences in the metal ion and the structure of the complexes since the photoluminescence behavior is closely associated with the metal ions and the ligands coordinated around them .

The porosity of the dehydrated compounds is 2170m2 g-1.     \n\nThe channels are filled by highly disordered crystallization water molecules. The dehydration of the compounds by freeze-drying is possible and most of the crystallization water molecules can be removed without destruction of the molecular skeleton. The partially dehydrated compounds have general chemical formula [Ln(abdc)(Habdc), 2H2O]\u221e with Ln=La-Eu except Pm. The porosity of the Nd-containing compound has been estimated by computational methods to 2170m2 g-1. This dehydrated compound reversibly binds water when exposed to wet atmosphere restoring the initial hydrated phase.\n\nResults and discussion\n\nThe crystal structure has been solved on the Nd-containing compound. The isostructurality of the other compounds have been assumed on the basis of their X-ray powder diffraction diagrams and single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. This compound crystallizes in the cubic system, space group Ia-3, with the following cell parameters: a =26.8056(5)\u00c5, V =19260.9(2)\u00c53 and Z =24. These parameters have already been reported previously for a Nd- and a Pr-containing compounds  but the quality of the crystals did not allow precise crystal structure determinations. Consequently, it has been suggested that these two compounds present different crystal structures despite their very similar cell parameters. Thanks to the good quality of the single crystals obtained in gel medium, it is now possible to demonstrate that all the compounds [Ln(adbc)(Hadbc), nH2O] with Ln=La-Eu are isostructural.\n\nConsequently, from a crystallographic point of view, the big square-cross cavities are empty and the calculated density of the compound is very low (1.11gcm-3). At this point, this compound looks like a \"spontaneously porous\" material. In order to evaluate its porosity we have used a computational method, based on Connolly's algorithm . This method has already been described and successfully used elsewhere . Thanks to it, the porosity profile of a partially dehydrated material can be design on the basis of its crystal structure. The porosity profile of [Nd(abdc)(Habdc), 2H2O]\u221e is reported in  .\n\nFrom this figure one can notice that molecules with kinetic radii  as big as 3.5\u01fa can penetrate the molecular framework. The potential porosity calculated with a probe sphere radius of 1.8\u00c5 (the kinetic radius of a N2 molecule) is 2170m2 g-1. This value is, to the best of our knowledge, the most important potential porosity reported for lanthanide containing coordination polymers .\n\nIt is noticeable (see  ) that the disordered crystallization water molecules are so weakly bound to the molecular network that it is possible to remove them at room temperature under a flux of N2.\n\nAt last this partially dehydrated compound spontaneously re-hydrates when exposed for 12h to wet atmosphere leading to the initial hydrated phase.\n\nConclusions and outlook\n\nWe have synthesized and characterized a new family of potentially porous lanthanide based coordination polymers with general chemical formula [Ln(abdc)(Habdc), nH2O]\u221e with Ln=La-Eu (except Pm) and 8\u2a7d n \u2a7d11. These compounds present large square-cross cavities (49\u00c52) fill by crystallization water molecules. These crystallization water molecules are so weakly bound to the molecular network that it is possible to remove most of them at room temperature by a simple flux of dry nitrogen. The partially dehydrated compound have general formula [Ln(abdc)(Habdc), 2H2O]\u221e with Ln=La-Eu (except Pm). Their porosity has been estimated by computational method to more than 2000m2 g-1 which constitutes a record in the field of lanthanide-containing coordination polymers. Despite their low thermal stability these compounds could be very interesting as far as technological applications with low temperature use are concerned. Indeed, they are obtained from relatively low cost reagents by a green synthetic process with a good yield, they present a very high porosity and their activation is energetically thrifty.

The dpa2- ligand offered two carboxylate groups to construct two monodentate configurations that connected two Co(II) centers to form a 1D chain. Multiple 1D chains stacked on each other to generate a 3D framework via the weak CH\u22ef \u03c0 interaction. Co(dpa)(2,2'-bipy)(H2O)2 exhibited an efficient catalytic performance for solvent-free allylic oxidation of cyclohexene by oxygen. The highest turn-over frequency (TOF) of 979h-1 was obtained at the molar ratio of Co(dpa)(2,2'-bipy)(H2O)2 to cyclohexene of 1:16000.\n\nHighlights\n\n   \u22c5 A novel Co(dpa)(2,2'-bipy)(H2O)2 was synthesized and characterized.   \u22c5 Co(dpa)(2,2'-bipy)(H2O)2 catalyzed allylic oxidation of cyclohexene by O2.   \u22c5 The efficient catalytic performance with a TOF up to 979h-1    \n\nTGA analysis was conducted to determine the thermal stability of Co(dpa)(2,2'-bipy)(H2O)2 (Fig. S6). A weight loss of 6.57% occurred in the temperature range from 130\u00b0C to 190\u00b0C due to the loss of the coordinated water (calcd. 7.33%). The anhydrous complex remained stable up to 250\u00b0C. It was collapsed and its organic ligands were completely decomposed between 250\u00b0C and 420\u00b0C, leading to a high weight loss of 70.34%. The residues weighted 23.09wt% of Co(dpa)(2,2'-bipy)(H2O)2 was presumed to be the cobalt dicarbonyl compound Co(CO)2 (calcd. 23.39wt%). A further weight loss of 9.15% was observed above 510\u00b0C, and the residue weighted 14.05wt% of Co(dpa)(2,2'-bipy)(H2O)2 might be attributed to the metal oxide, such as Co2O3 (calcd. 16.87wt%).\n\nThe catalytic performance of Co-CP was tested for solvent-free allylic oxidation of cyclohexene by oxygen. The oxidation mainly produced Cy-ol, Cy-one, intermediate 2-cyclohexene-1-hydroperoxide (Cy-HP) and cyclohexene oxide (Cy-oxide) (Fig. S9). The conversion of cyclohexene in the absence of Co-CP was 1.4% (  entry 1). The cyclohexene conversion increased from 7.5% to 36.7%, and TOF increased from 200h-1 to 979h-1 as the reaction temperature increased from 331K to 343K ( entries 2-4). The selectivity towards Cy-HP decreased from 61.0% to 30.5%, whereas those towards Cy-ol, Cy-one and Cy-oxide increased to different values, indicating the rapid transformation of Cy-HP to Cy-ol, Cy-one and Cy-oxide at high reaction temperatures. The cyclohexene conversions increased from 2.1% to 36.7%, and TOF increased from 56h-1 to 979h-1 as the reaction time prolonged from 2h to 6h ( entries 4-6). The selectivity towards Cy-HP reached the maximum of 64.3% at 4h and sharply decreased to 40.7% at 6h, while the conversion increased from 7.8% at 4h to 36.7% at 6h evidently. Cy-HP was the major product at the initial reaction stage. It was dissociated into cyclohexenyl peroxyl radical (Cy-OO\u22c5) via the homolysis of OH that acted as the main chain propagator. As the reaction proceeded, the free radicals (Cy-OO\u22c5) was gradually accumulated, which instantaneously promoted the chain transfer, the dissociation of Cy-HP and the formations of Cy-ol, Cy-one and Cy-oxide.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn summary, a novel Co(II) coordination polymer Co(dpa)(2,2'-bipy)(H2O)2 was synthesized via the hydrothermal assembly of Co2+ with 2,2'-diphenic acid and 2,2'-bipyridine. The flexible 2,2'-diphenic acid ligand played an important role in constructing 1D chains and the rigid 2,2'-bipyridine ligand provided a weak CH\u22ef \u03c0 interaction to form a 3D framework. The Co(dpa)(2,2'-bipy)(H2O)2 crystal exhibited a rod-like shape with a high crystallinity and low thermal stability. The pulverized Co(dpa)(2,2'-bipy)(H2O)2 powder was used as a novel catalyst for the solvent-free allylic oxidation of cyclohexene by oxygen. It showed an efficient catalytic performance for the cyclohexene oxidation with a TOF up to 979h-1, which might be attributed to the exposure of the Co (II) coordinatively unsaturated sites during the reactions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['catalytic_activity', 'decomposition_temperature']"}]}

It crystallizes in orthorhombic space group Pbcm. The asymmetric unit of complex 3 contains half crystallorgraphically independent Cd(II) atom, half of a isonic ligand and a half atz ligand, respectively. The Cd center lies on a crystallorgraphic 2-fold axis and coordinated with three nitrogen atoms from two different atz- ligands (N3 and N3(i)) and one isonic ligand (N1(iv)), four oxygen atoms (O1, O1(ii) and O1(iii)) from the three different isoinic ligands to form a octahedron ( ). The equatorial plane of N3-O1(ii)-N(i)-O1(iii) is slightly distorted. The bond length of    Cd  -    N        atz    -        in the equatorial plane is 2.254(3)\u00c5, which is close to those reported for the Cd-N complex , while the bond lengths of    Cd  -    N        isonic    -        (2.504(4)\u00c5) on the axially ligated isonic ligand is little longer than the usual value. The    Cd  -    O        isonic    -        bond lengths (Cd-O1=2.635(3)\u00c5, Cd-O1(ii)=2.419(3)\u00c5) are slightly longer than normal, but are still in the range of those observed in the Cd/isonicotinate or nicotinate when the carboxylato group coordinate to the Cd atom by the \u03bc 2,\u03b7 3-bridge fashion . In complex 3, the Cd atoms are linked into a double M-O-M (metal-oxygen-metal) chains by the \u03bc 2, \u03b7 4-carboxylato groups along the b-axis direction. The neighboring double M-O-M chains are associated by the pyridyl ring spacer to provide a 2D layer, parallel to the (001) plane (b). The adjacent 2D layers are connected by the \u03bc 2-atz bridging ligands into a three-dimensional pillared-layer structure (c). The 3D pillared-layer structure are further stabilized by the weak intralayer N-H\u2026O hydrogen bonding interactions (N2-H2\u2026O1(\u266f3), 2.954\u00c5), via the amino groups donating H atoms to the carboxylate oxygen atoms.\n\nThermal stability analyses\n\nThe thermal stability of the complexes in N2 were examined by the TG techniques in the temperature range of 40-900\u00b0C.   shows the TG curves for complex 1-3 at a heating rate of 10\u00b0C/min under N2 atmosphere. As shown in , there is no weight loss before 320\u00b0C. A sharp weight loss for 1 and 3 occurred about the temperature range of 320.0-550.0\u00b0C (for 1: obsd, 69.13%, calcd, 70.03%; for 3: obsd, 60.08%, calcd, 59.70%) corresponding to the release of the atz and nic (isonic for 3) ligands. In the wide temperature range of 320-800\u00b0C, weight loss of 76.02% was observed for 2, which is attributed to the departure of Hisonic free molecules and the release of the atz and isonic ligands (calcd: 75.06). Finally, the probable residua are metal-oxide from the calculating value of the weight loss.\n\nFluorescent properties\n\nThe solid-state fluorescent properties of the complexes were investigated at room temperature. As illustrated in  , upon excitation of these solid samples at \u03bb=340nm, the intense broad emission bands at 410nm for 1, 455nm for 2, 442nm for 3, are observed. For excitation wavelengths between 280 and 480nm, there is no obvious emission observed for the free Hisonic ligand under the same experimental conditions, while free Hatz ligand presents a weak photoluminescence emission at 325nm according to the reported literature. Therefore, the fluorescent emission of 2 and 3 may be proposed to originate from the coordination of isonic- to the Zn and Cd atom (ligand-to-metal charge transition, LMCT). Further compared with complex 2, the emission of complex 3 becomes stronger, which is probably due to the differences of the metal ions. The density of electron cloud for oxygen atoms and the nitrogen atoms may be changed by the coordination of the metal ions . The free Hnic exhibit fluorescent emission bands at 379 and 512nm (\u03bb ex=330nm). Taking the emission bands of these free organic ligands into consideration, the emissions of 1 may also be assigned as ligand-to-metal charge transition (LMCT). Complexes 1-3 are air-stable and insoluble in water and common organic solvents. These coordination polymers may be excellent candidates for potential photoactive materials because they are highly thermally stable."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['crystal_system', 'space_group', 'decomposition_temperature', 'peak_spectrum']"}]}

During the heating process, the TGA profile of 1 indicates the release of one coordinated water molecule at the first step of weight loss which is in the temperature range of 100-134\u00b0C (found, 3.81%; anal. calcd, 4.21%), resulting to the dehydrated form of Co(4,4'-bipy)(pro)2 (1A), which is stable up to ~215\u00b0C and then the structure rapidly decomposes at higher temperature, as shown in Fig. S4.\n\nThe dynamic structural behaviors of 1 relating to their dehydration and rehydration processes are studied by elemental analyses, XRPD, and spectroscopic techniques. When the single crystals of 1 were heated to 150\u00b0C in air for 20min, these crystals suddenly lose their crystallinity and the color changes from orange (1) to pink (1A). Then this non-crystalline solid was exposed to water vapor for 12h and the color of the solid 1A was returned to that of the original crystals 1', as shown in   and Fig. S5. For this, the solid-state UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra as shown in Fig. S6, clearly show that the bands observed in 1 and 1' correspond very well to the identical transitions causing the same color of products, and evidence that 1 and 1' have the same Co(II) environments. This spectral feature agrees with the typical d-d transitions of high spin Co(II) in distorted octahedral geometry with two broad bands at 471 and 1180nm, assigned to the \u03bd3: 4T1g \u2192 4T1g(P) and \u03bd1: 4T1g \u2192 4T2g, transitions, respectively . Whereas the amorphous form 1A shows different d-d transitions with three broad bands, \u03bd3: 4T1g \u2192 4T1g(P) which is splitted into two shoulders at around 484nm and 518nm (4Eg and 4A2g), \u03bd2: 4T1g \u2192 4A2g at 656nm and then \u03bd1: 4T1g \u2192 4T2g which is splitted into two shoulders at around 934nm and 1337nm (4B2g and 4Eg), giving the distinctive pink color and corresponding to the tetragonally distorted octahedral geometry . Furthermore, the IR spectra also confirm the structural transformation behavior in 1, as shown in Fig S7. In 1A, the broad and strong peaks of OH stretching around 3300cm-1 and HOH bending around 1500-1600cm-1 of coordinated water molecule disappear, resulting to the sharper IR spectrum with different splitting feature and a shift in some peak positions. In contrast, these features are removed in the IR spectrum of the rehydrated form 1', which are identical to that of the as-synthesized 1. The XRPD pattern of the as-synthesized product closely match the simulated one from the single-crystal data (Fig. S8). However, the XRPD pattern of dehydrated 1A shows peak disappearance, indicating that the dehydrated Co(4,4'-bipy)(pro)2 (1A) is in an amorphous phase (anal. calcd: C, 53.19; H, 5.02; N, 7.75%. Found: C, 52.26; H, 5.04; N, 7.61%) which is formed by the collapse of supramolecular structure of 1 accompanied with the destruction of hydrogen bonding networks when all water molecules are removed. Interestingly, this amorphous phase 1A can be restored to the original crystalline phase of 1' in which the color returns to that of the original color after being exposed in water vapor for 24h, as indicated by elemental analysis with the chemical composition of [Co(4,4'-bipy)(pro)2(H2O)] (1') (anal. calcd: C, 50.67; H, 5.32; N, 7.39%.

These irreversible peaks are related to typical redissolution oxidation peaks ( and ). The general patterns of the voltammograms of all complexes remained unchanged for hours, suggesting that there is no degradation of the dimer entities in solution. Moreover, the cyclic voltammetry of [Cu2(Ac)4] salt performed in the same conditions is different from the ones recorded for 1 and 2 demonstrating again the complexes stability in solution. The coulometry on the first reduction step for 1 and 2 exhibits an electron apparent number value equal to 2F/mole. Therefore, these processes correspond to the simultaneous Cu(II)\u2192Cu(I) reduction of both metal centers within the complexes.\n\nThe magnetic properties of compounds 1, 2 and 1' were then investigated by DC susceptibility measurements in the 2-300K temperature range under a field of 0.1T. Thermal evolution of magnetic susceptibility for both dinuclear complexes is given in . At room temperature, the \u03c7T values for 1 is 0.421cm3 Kmol-1 which is smaller than the theoretical expected \u03c7T value (0.75cm3 Kmol-1) for two non-interacting Cu(II) ions (d9, g =2.0, S =1/2). With decreasing temperature, the \u03c7T product continuously decreases and finally reaches a value close to zero (0.011cm3 Kmol-1) at 60K. This behavior indicates the presence of a strong antiferromagnetic interaction. The value of \u03c7T at 300K for 2 is 0.665cm3 Kmol-1. Upon cooling, the \u03c7T product continuously decreases and reaches the value of 0.014cm3 Kmol-1 at 7K, suggesting antiferromagnetic interactions in 2. In contrast, 1' is essentially paramagnetic as a consequence of the introduction of the bipyridine spacer (see  )."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['etc', 'magnetic_susceptibility]"}]}

Complex 1 exhibits an intense broad emission band with the maximum intensity at 501nm and a shoulder at ca. 430nm upon excitation at 370nm, while complex 2 produces an intense sharp emission at the maximum ca. 537nm and a shoulder at ca. 430nm with excitation at 370nm. To ascertain the adsorption of the emission bands, the photoluminescences for free ligands have been measured, in which 4,4'-bpp displays a luminescence at 484nm and 1,3-H2bdc at 379nm in the solid state. Generally, the intra-ligand fluorescence emission wavelength is determined by the energy gap between the \u03c0 and \u03c0\u2217 molecular orbitals of the free ligand, which is simply related to the extent of \u03c0 conjugation in the system. As for the metal complexes, the slightly red-shifted emissions by a factor of ca. 17nm for 1 and 53nm for 2 compared to the free ligand 4,4'-bpp, might be attributed to ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). And we tentatively assign the shoulder of the emission spectrum at ca. 430nm to the intraligand emission state from 4,4'-bpp ligand. The different emissions for 1 and 2 maybe result from their different structures with various coordination geometries of Ag(I) centers.\n\nOn the other hand, high thermal stability is an important precondition in the conversion of porous coordination frameworks from laboratory curiosities to practical materials.

The two ultimate steps of weight losses occur while the temperature is being increased to 540 \u00b0C, and they are attributed to the decomposition of H3btc ligands. No further weight loss occurs until 800 \u00b0C indicating an inorganic residuum in the form of metal oxides.\n\n\n\nFurther evaluationof the complex thermal behavior was conducted by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Fig. 6). Multiple endo- and exo-thermic effects in the DSC curve matched TGA results. The endothermic peak observed at the temperature region of 80-260 \u00b0C is related to the removal of coordinated water molecules, and two exothermic peaks at the temperature region 400-540 \u00b0C are attributed to successiveburning of organic parts.\n\n\n\nTransmission Electron Microscopy\n\nThe TEM images of the synthesized and reference catalysts are displayed in Fig. S1. The average crystallite sizes were respectively 15 and 22 nm for the fabricated catalysts with the SiO2 and Al2O3 support, while for the reference catalysts these values were 38 and 40 nm. This result shows that preparation of Co-Ni-Zn catalysts via thermal decomposition of inorganic precursors yields smaller crystallite sizes.\n\n\n\nThe catalytic performance of the catalysts that is prepared by different procedures grows with an increase in temperature from 200 to 300 \u00b0C (Figs. 13, 14). While the selectivity to the olefin and paraffin is reduced with an increase in temperature, the methane selectivities of both constructed and reference catalysts grow. The results revealed that the optimal operating temperature of the catalysts is 260 \u00b0C. At this temperature, the Co-Ni-Zn/SiO2 and Co-Ni-Zn/Al2O3 synthesized catalysts, prepared by thermal decomposition of inorganic precursor, have higher selectivity to light olefin products and lower methane selectivity. Moreover, the paraffin selectivity is favorable at the optimum temperature. Selectivity to C2H4 is 46% and 40% for silica and alumina supported, respectively. In addition, propylene selectivity of synthesized catalysts is about 16%. The selectivity into paraffin (C2-C3) of synthesized catalyst obtains about 19% and 17% for silica and alumina supported, respectively. As the data show, the synthesized catalysts have acceptable activity in FT reaction due to the catalyst physicochemical features. It can be seen that from SEM results of synthesized catalysts, these catalysts have low degree of agglomeration and small particle sizes, which is in good agreement with the results obtained from XRD. Moreover, the synthesized catalysts have high surface area. According to the explained catalysts feature, it can be concluded that the catalyst physicochemical features affect the catalysts activity. Comparing both synthesized catalysts, it can be concluded that the catalytic performance of Co-Ni-Zn/SiO2 is slightly better than alumina-supported Co-Ni-Zn catalyst. On the other hand, in both reference catalysts, methane selectivity is higher compared to the fabricated catalysts, and the production amount of olefins and paraffins is lower. All these data reveal that catalysts production through thermal decomposition of inorganic precursors based on complex 1 is a promising procedure due to good active phase dispersion, small particle size, low degree of agglomeration and formation of promoter phases.\n\n\n\n\n\nStability Test\n\nThe stability (Fig. 15) of the constructed catalysts was studied at 260 \u00b0C, and that of the reference catalysts was evaluated at 300 \u00b0C because they display the maximum CO conversion at this temperature. The catalysts prepared by thermal decomposition were stable for 10 h atoptimal operating temperature (260 \u00b0C). The stability test of the constructed catalysts was continued for 30 h, and only a slight decrease in the activity of the catalysts was observed. The activity of the reference catalysts was relatively constant for 7 h, and during the following 30 h, the activity decreased faster than for the synthesized catalysts."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['decomposition_temperature', 'crystal_size', 'catalytic_activity', 'surface_area']"}]}

As shown in Fig. 1, the Zn atom has a six-coordinate mode, provided by three oxygen atoms from different imip ligands plus a further two oxygen atoms from two coordinated water ligands. The remaining coordination site is occupied by a nitrogen atom from the third imip ligand. The relevant bond lengths are Zn-O3 = 2.027(7) \u00c5, Zn-O5 = 2.147(7) \u00c5, Zn-O6 = 2.461(8) \u00c5, Zn-O1(W) = 2.075(6) \u00c5, Zn-O2(W) = 2.051(6) \u00c5, and Zn-N2 = 2.036(7) \u00c5.

As shown in Fig. 10, an emission peak was observed at 359 nm for H2imip (\u03bbex = 274 nm), which can be ascribed to ligand-centered transitions [32]. Under the same excitation conditions, emission peaks were observed at 363 nm for complex 1 (\u03bbex = 268 nm), and 365 nm for complex 3 (\u03bbex = 294 nm). Thus, compared to H2imip, the emission maxima of 1 and 3 are redshifted. The most likely emission mechanism is ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) [33], given the similar emission bands observed for the free ligand and its complexes. The enhanced luminescence in the complexes can be attributed to the ligand coordination to the metal center, which enhances its rigidity and thus reduces the loss of energy through radiationless pathways [34].\n\nThermogravimetric analyses\n\nThermogravimetric (TG) analysis was performed in air on freshly grown air-dried crystals of the complexes, and the resulting TG curves are shown in Fig. 12. The first stage indicates that complexes 1 and 2 lose 16.2 and 17.1 % of their respective total weights at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 115 \u00b0C for 1 and 131 \u00b0C for 2. These weight losses are related to the loss of five water molecules (Calcd. 13.2, 13.5 %, respectively). The second stage occurs between 400 and 560 \u00b0C for both complexes 1 and 2 and corresponds to the release of the imip ligand. The corresponding weight losses are 60.7 and 60.1 % (Calcd. 62.9 and 64.1 % for 1 and 2, respectively). After 560 \u00b0C, there is no further weight loss. The residues (23.9, 22.0 %) are identified as ZnO and CoO, respectively (Calcd. 23.1 and 22.4 %, respectively). As for complex 3, the host framework was stable up to ca. 91 \u00b0C. The first weight loss of 6.4 % occurred between 91 and 160 \u00b0C, which is related to the removal of the three coordinated water ligands (Calcd. 7.3 %). The second stage came between 363 and 560 \u00b0C, corresponding to the release of the imip ligand; the observed weight loss was 60.7 % (Calcd. 58.0 %).

The emission spectrum of the 1 is depicted in Fig. S5. Polymer 1 exhibits a strong blue photoluminescence with emission maxima at 428 nm upon excitations at 376 nm. This is a red shift with respect to the free ligand, H2tzba (\u03bbem = 327 nm with excitation at 300 nm [27]). Other tetrazolate-based complexes, such as [Mn(4-TZBA2-)(H2O)2] and [Mn4(4-TZBA2-)4(\u03bc2-H2O)2(H2O) (py)], are bathochromically shifted to 434 nm (excitation at 361 nm) and 425 nm (excitation at 358 nm), respectively. The photoluminescent mechanism is attributed to a ligand-centered \u03c0-\u03c0* excitation mainly through the aromatic rings of tbza2-, which is characteristic of fluorescent emissions for Cd(II) complexes with other heterocyclic aromatic ligands [24]. The results suggest that the polymer may be used as a blue light-emitting material [1].\n\nSorption Properties\n\nThe porosity of 1 was estimated by methanol, ethanol and water gas adsorption isotherms at 298 K. As shown in Fig. 6, 1 exhibits Type-I behavior with a small hysteresis to water and methanol. The amount of water and methanol uptake increases with an increase in P/P0 and reaches 165 cm3 g-1 at P/P0 = 0.86. The saturated sorption amount of water is equivalent to the adsorption of about 5.8 mmol g-1. The sorption amount reaches 120 cm3 g-1 at P/P0 = 0.9, which is equivalent to the adsorption of about 4.4 mmol g-1. In contrast, the amount of ethanol sorption (2.3 cm3 g-1 at P/P0 = 0.9) is close to the surface adsorption and is negligible, which indicates that methanol cannot easily enter the channel. Polymer 1 can adsorb water and methanol molecules, but excludes the larger ethanol molecules. The above adsorption studies show that 1 is a promising material for separating methanol and water from bioethanol.

At room temperature the solid-state luminescence spectrum of [Zn(dpa)(bpp)]n shows a blue emission at about 354 nm upon excitation at 333 nm.\n\nTGA\n\nTo investigate the thermal stability of [Zn(dpa)(bpp)]n, TGA was performed (Fig. 3). [Zn(dpa)(bpp)]n is stable to 280 \u00b0C. Upon further heating, decomposition begins and the total weight loss at 600 \u00b0C is 84.37%, which corresponds to complete removal of the organic component. The final residue is ZnO (observed 15.63%, calcd. 16.15%).\n\nPhotoluminescent Properties\n\nThe solid-state photoluminescent spectra of [Zn(dpa)(bpp)]n and the H2dpa ligand at room temperature are depicted in Fig. 4. [Zn(dpa)(bpp)]n exhibits an intense blue photoluminescence with an emission maximum at ca. 354 nm on excitation at 333 nm. Free H2dpa and bpp display intense fluorescent properties in the solid state at room temperature with emission maxima at 354 and 523 nm [28], respectively."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['peak_spectrum', 'decomposition_temperature']"}]}

As presented in Fig. 1f, the distance between two adjacent layers B is 22.894(4) \u00c5, suggesting that the vertical distance between layer A and layer B is 11.447(2) \u00c5. On the other hand, the shortest Sm\u2026Sm distance between layer A and layer B is 11.5167(21) \u00c5. Therefore, a slippage distance of 1.2654(4) \u00c5 between layer A and layer B in compound 3 can be achieved. Such a small slippage distance between the neighboring 2D layers leads to the formation of small 1D channels running along c direction, which are occupied by guest water molecules (Fig. 1d). If only the uncoordinated water molecules are removed, compound 3 has a 1100.5-\u00c53 potential solvent volume (20 %) as calculated by PLATON [43].\n\nThermal stability analyses\n\nTo determine the thermal stabilities of the two types of CPs, thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of the representative compounds 3 and 5 were measured under an air atmosphere in the temperature range of 30-800 \u00b0C. As illustrated in Fig. 3, compound 3 has two steps of weight loss. The first weight loss of 3.7 % from 30 \u00b0C to about 130 \u00b0C can be attributed to the loss of one guest water molecule (calculated 2.7 %) in the asymmetric unit, and then this compound is stable up to 200 \u00b0C. The major weight loss occurred in the next step above 200 \u00b0C is probably caused by the gradual decomposition of the coordinated DMA and HTFMIDC2- ligands, leading to the collapse of the coordination framework. Seen from the TG curve of 5, an initial weight loss of 5.6 % between 30 and 200 \u00b0C may correspond to the release of a half DMA guest molecule per formula unit (calculated 6.9 %). Further weight loss between 200 and 600 \u00b0C also can be ascribed to the decomposition of the whole coordination structure.\n\nPhotoluminescent properties\n\nTaking into account the excellent luminescent properties of the Eu(III) ions in the visible region, the photoluminescence of compounds 4 and 5 in the solid state was measured at room temperature. In order to well compare the luminescence intensity, all of the spectra are measured with the same voltage of 400 V and identical pass width of 5.0 nm. When the emission wavelengths were fixed at 614 nm for 4 and 615 nm for 5, both the excitation spectra of 4 and 5 display a broadband roughly covering from 230 to 300 nm, as well as four sharp peaks in the range of 350-420 nm, giving the maximum peaks at 394 and 395 nm for 4 and 5, respectively (Figs. S11 and S12). As presented in Fig. 4, compound 4 exhibits intensity red luminescence and shows the characteristic f-f transition of a Eu(III) ion upon excitation at 394 nm. The strong intense emission at 614 nm is assigned to electric-dipolar 5D0 \u2192 7F2 transition, while the medium strong intensity of emission at 592 nm is attributed to magnetic-dipolar 5D0 \u2192 7F1. Three weak peaks at 579, 652 and 701 nm can be ascribed to the 5D0 \u2192 7F0, 5D0 \u2192 7F3 and 5D0 \u2192 7F4 transitions, respectively [45, 46]. Compound 5 emits red light upon excitation at 395 nm (Fig. 4), and it also exhibits a typical Eu(III) emission spectrum as compared to compound 4. The characteristic peaks at 580, 593, 615, 655 and 704 can be assigned to the characteristic emissions of Eu(III) corresponding to electronic transitions from the excited state 5D0 to the multiplets 7FJ (J = 0 \u2192 4), respectively [45, 46]. The intensity ratios of 5D0 \u2192 7F2/5D0 \u2192 7F1 for 4 and 5 are calculated to be 5.4 and 5.1, respectively, indicating that the Eu(III) ions in both 4 and 5 adopt noncentrosymmetric coordination environments without inversion centers. These results are in agreement with the X-ray single-crystal structure of compounds 4 and 5. In addition, the luminescence intensity of 4 is relatively stronger than that of 5, which may be assigned to the quenching effect of the water molecule coordinated with Eu(III) center in 5 [47]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['porosity', 'decomposition_temperature', 'peak_spectrum']"}]}

Na2mtms shows an emission peak at 460 nm when excited at 301 nm. Upon excitation at 304 nm, complexes 1 and 2 display emission maxima at 353 and 362 nm, respectively, which are both greatly blue-shifted compared to the free Na2mtms ligand. Since the Cd(II) center has d10 electronic configuration, the emissions of complexes 1 and 2 can be tentatively assigned to ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) [26-28]. These complexes may be suitable as blue-light-emitting materials, since they show luminescence in the blue region [29].\n\nCyclic voltammetry\n\nThe cyclic voltammogram of 3 was measured with a conventional three-electrode cell in aqueous solution with complex concentration of 1.0 \u00d7 10-5 mol L-1, as shown in Fig. 6\u2020.

As the scan rate is increased to 80 and 100 mV s-1, the anodic peak appears at 0.479 and 0.567 V, respectively.

The framework collapsed in the temperature range 270-600 \u00b0C before the final formation of a metal oxide.

The first corresponds to the loss of both lattice and coordinated water (at the range of 85-264 \u00b0C, the weight loss observed is 19.16%; theoretical 19.04%). The second weight loss above 250 \u00b0C is attributable to decomposition of the organic ligand.

At 300 K, the value of \u03bceff is 1.72 \u03bcB for compound 1, which is as expected for the spin-only value of 1.73 \u03bcB for one Cu(II) atom. Upon cooling, this value remains constant before rapidly decreasing at low temperature. This magnetic behavior reveals a weak antiferromagnetic interaction as expected. In 1, large Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu distances of and absence of effective overlap make the possible interactions weak [15, 16]. For complex 2, the value of \u03bceff at 300 K is 2.2 \u03bcB per two Cu(II) atoms which is slightly less than that of two non-interacting Cu(II) atoms. The value gradually rises as the temperature decreases, to reach 2.91 \u03bcB at around 20 K. This behavior is typical of ferromagnetically coupled Cu(II) dinuclear compounds [14, 17, 18]. Below that temperature, \u03bceff decreases to 2.56 \u03bcB at about 3 K, which may originate from intermolecular antiferromagnetic interactions or from zero-field splitting of the S = 1 state of the dinuclear species. This overall ferromagnetic behavior has been observed earlier for many other oxo-bridged compounds. For Cu-O-Cu dinuclear compounds, a ferromagnetic interaction was found when the Cu-O-Cu angle was smaller than 97.5\u00b0, but when the angle is larger than 97.5\u00b0, an antiferromagnetic interaction would be expected [19]. In compound 2, the Cu-O-Cu is 80.12(1)\u00b0 (Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu 2.821(8) \u00c5), which suggests the presence of ferromagnetic interactions involving the dimeric units."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['decomposition_temperature', 'magnetic_moment']"}]}

Both the micropore volume and micropore surface area are 0.023 cm3/g and 15.27 m2/g, whereas the external surface area is 30.10 m2/g with a correlation coefficient of 1.000. This is almost the same as the BET surface area. The pore size distribution pattern was obtained from desorption branch by employing the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model (see Fig. S5, Supplementary Material). The plot shows that there is a wide distribution of pores in the polymer with diameters ranging from 3 nm to more than 13 nm with an average of 5.6 nm. The total pore volume is 0.06357 cm3/g for pores smaller than 21.57 nm at P/P0 = 0.90386.\n\nPhotoluminescence studies\n\nFigure 6 shows the photoluminescence excitation and emission spectra of [Ho2(PDA)3H2O]n\u22c52nH2O. The excitation spectrum shows an excitation peak at about 390 nm which is assigned to 5I8 \u2192 5G5 electronic transition in Ho3+ ion. The emission spectrum for [Ho2(PDA)3H2O]n\u22c52nH2O upon excitation at 390 nm shows three emission bands peaking at ~460, ~490, and ~545 nm corresponding to 5F2 \u2192 5I8, 5F3 \u2192 5I8, 5F4 \u2192 5I8 transitions. Similar emission bands (not shown here) were observed with 430 nm excited wavelength. In general, purity in color of substance can be recognized by means of color coordinates. Hence, in our present work, the chromaticity coordinates of [Ho2(PDA)3H2O]n\u22c52nH2O have been calculated from the emission spectrum using the commission international De I'Eclairage (CIE) system. The CIE chromaticity diagram for [Ho2(PDA)3H2O]n\u22c52nH2O upon excitation at 390 nm is shown in Fig. 7. The CIE coordinate is found to be (0.28, 0.38) which lies within the blue/hue region. Therefore, it may be concluded that the developed polymer could serve as a blue/hue producing material for display applications and light emitting diodes.\n\nThermal analysis\n\nThe thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) of coordination polymer [Ho2(PDA)3 H2O]n\u22c52nH2O are shown in Fig. 8. The thermal decomposition was investigated in a nitrogen atmosphere from 293 to 1,273 K at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min-1. The coordination polymer network is stable up to 373 K. The thermogravimetry (TG) curve shows that decomposition of the polymer takes place in three steps. The first step starts at 373 K and ends at 463 K. The residual weight at 463 K is 88 % (calculated weight loss = 88.55 %) corresponding to loss of three water molecules and two molecules of carbon monoxide. The DTA curve has a sharp endothermic peak at 453 K, indicating the loss of three water molecules. The second step of thermal decomposition has onset at 463 K and ends at 793 K. The residual weight at 793 K is 72 % (calculated weight loss = 72.3 %) indicating the loss of four molecules of carbon monoxide and one molecule of acetaldehyde. The third step has onset from 793 K with gradual weight loss up to 1,250 K, this step involves the loss of two molecules of phenyl acetaldehyde. Sharp DTA curve at 683 K and broad DTA curve at 963 K indicate decomposition of organic ligand. The residual weight at 1,267 K is 47.5 % (calculated weight loss = 46.5 %) corresponding to formation of Ho2O3 and carbon as end product."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['crystal_system', 'space_group', 'lattice_parameters', 'pore_diameter', 'surface_area', 'peak_spectrum', 'decomposition_temperature']"}]}

The copper(II) polymer shows three absorption bands with varied intensities. The intense band at 203 nm is assigned to intra-ligand (\u03c0-\u03c0*) transition associated to tpa ligand. While the less intense band at 275 nm corresponds to the charge transfer transition from tpa ligand to the metals. Besides, the broad band observed at the lower frequency of 645 nm in the spectrum matches well with the reported d-d transition of five-coordinated copper(II) in the square-pyramidal geometry [42]. The spectroscopic data of the copper(II) polymer are in agreement with the determination of the crystal structure (vide infra).\n\nCytotoxic Activity of the Polymeric Copper(II) Complex\n\nThe cytotoxicity assays of the polymeric copper(II) complex and cis-platin against two cancer cell lines human hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721 and human lung adenocarcinoma A549 were conducted in our study. It is noteworthy that the IC50 values of the polymeric copper(II) complex are 19.0 \u00b1 0.3 and 11.0 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcM for SMMC-7721 and A549, respectively, which are much higher than those of cis-platin (5.4 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcM for SMMC-7721 and 7.6 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcM for A549), indicating that the cytotoxic activity of the polymeric copper(II) complex is less than that of cis-platin. However, the inhibition of cell proliferation produced by the polymeric copper(II) complex on the same batch of cell lines is still rather active. The polymeric copper(II) complex possessing cytotoxic activity may be attributed to the extended planar structure induced by the p-\u03c0* conjugation from the chelation of the metal ion with the ligands. These findings of cytotoxic activities in vitro prompt us to explore the DNA-binding studies on the polymeric copper(II) complex.\n\nIn order to quantitatively evaluate the binding strength of the copper(II) complex with HS-DNA, the intrinsic binding constant Kb was determined by monitoring the changes in absorbance at 203 nm using the following equation [51]:1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}     \\usepackage{amsmath}     \\usepackage{wasysym}     \\usepackage{amsfonts}     \\usepackage{amssymb}     \\usepackage{amsbsy}     \\usepackage{mathrsfs}     \\usepackage{upgreek}     \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}     \\begin{document}$$ \\left[ {\\text{DNA}} \\right]/\\left( {\\varepsilon_{\\text{a}} - \\varepsilon_{\\text{f}} } \\right) = \\left[ {\\text{DNA}} \\right]/\\left( {\\varepsilon_{\\text{b}} - \\varepsilon_{\\text{f}} } \\right) + 1/K_{\\text{b}} \\left( {\\varepsilon_{\\text{b}} - \\varepsilon_{\\text{f}} } \\right) $$\\end{document}where [DNA] is the concentration of DNA, \u03b5f, \u03b5a and \u03b5b correspond to the extinction coefficient, respectively, for the free polymeric copper(II) complex, for each addition of DNA to the polymeric copper(II) complex and for the polymeric copper(II) complex in the fully bound form. As shown in Fig. 3b, in the plot of [DNA]/(\u03b5a-\u03b5f) versus [DNA], the binding constant Kb for the polymeric copper(II) complex was estimated to be 1.07 \u00d7 104 M-1, (R = 0.9911 for nine points), lower than those of typical intercalators (e.g., EB-DNA, ~106 M-1) [52], and has the same level as those of well-established intercalation agents [53].\n\nThe Ethidium Bromide Fluorescence Displacement Experiments\n\nTo further investigate the interaction mode between the polymeric copper(II) complex and HS-DNA, the EB fluorescence displacement experiments were used. In general, the intrinsic fluorescence intensity of DNA is very low, and that of EB in Tris-HCl buffer is also not high due to quenching by the solvent molecules. However, on addition of DNA, the fluorescence intensity of EB will be enhanced because of its intercalation into the DNA. Thus, EB can be used to probe the interaction of complexes with DNA. If the complexes can intercalate into DNA, the binding sites of DNA available for EB will be decreased, and hence the fluorescence intensity of EB will be quenched [54]. In our experiment, it has been used to monitor the interaction of the polymeric copper(II) complex with HS-DNA, and the results are shown in Fig. 4. As illustrated in Fig. 4a, the fluorescence intensity of EB at 584 nm shows an obvious decreasing trend with the increasing concentration of the polymeric copper(II) complex, suggesting that the polymeric copper(II) complex binds strongly with HS-DNA. The quenching of EB bound to DNA by polymeric copper(II) complex is in agreement with the linear Stern-Volmer equation [55]:2\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}     \\usepackage{amsmath}     \\usepackage{wasysym}     \\usepackage{amsfonts}     \\usepackage{amssymb}     \\usepackage{amsbsy}     \\usepackage{mathrsfs}     \\usepackage{upgreek}     \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}     \\begin{document}$$ I_{0} /I = 1+ K_{\\text{sv}} \\left[ {\\text{Q}} \\right] $$\\end{document}where I0 and I represent the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of quencher, respectively. Ksv is a linear Stern-Volmer quenching constant, Q is the concentration of quencher. In the quenching plot (see inset in Fig. 4b) of I0/I versus (complex), Ksv is given by the ratio of the slope to intercept. The Ksv value for the polymeric copper(II) complex is 6.14 \u00d7 104 (R = 0.9927 for 14 points).\n\nCyclic Voltammetric Studies\n\nCyclic voltammetry (CV) has been widely employed to study DNA-binding properties for complexes with electronic activity, whether the electrochemical processes are reversible [56], quasi-reversible [57], or irreversible [58, 59]. In order to get a deeper insight into the mutual donor-acceptor electronic influence, we have undertaken CV studies of the copper(II) polymer. The cyclic voltammograms of the polymer (1.0 \u00d7 10-5 mol L-1) at different scan rates (from 0.06 to 0.24 V/s) were investigated (Supporting information, Fig. S1). The results indicated that the oxidation and reduction peak currents (ipa and ipc) both exhibit the linear relationship versus the scan rate (ipc = 3.4436 \u00d7 10-6 + 7.198 \u00d7 10-7 v, R = 0.9663; ipa = -2.966 \u00d7 10-7-7.835 \u00d7 10-7 v, R = 0.9707). These relationships indicate that the electrode processes in Tris-HCl buffer solution are absorption controlled [60]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['peak_spectrum', 'etc']"}]}

R1 = 0.0427, wR2 = 0.1410 [I > 2\u03c3(I)]. Structural analysis also revealed that the btc3- ligands bridge four-coordinate Zn(II) centres to form a 2-D grid-like layer network on the bc plane. The protonated acridines fill up the cavities formed between adjacent layers and combine the 2-D layers to generate a non-interpenetrating 3-D supramolecular framework through the hydrogen bondings and \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 packing interactions. The fluorescence investigation disclosed that 1 shows multiband emissions over a wide range.\n\nThermal Analysis\n\nTGA analysis was carried out to examine the thermal stability of 1. As illustrated in Fig. 5, the first thermal decomposition stage occurred in the range of 76-130 \u00b0C with a corresponding weight loss 10.31 %, which was assigned to two lattice water and one coordinating water molecules (calc. 10.69 %). The second weight loss was 35.20 % in the temperature range of 200-350 \u00b0C and was consistent with the decomposition of protonated acridines (calc. 35.43 %). The third decomposition stage continued with a weight loss of 30 % up to 500 \u00b0C. This process suggested the thermal decomposition of benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate.\n\nUV-Vis Spectrum\n\nThe UV-Vis spectrum of 1 in DMSO (c = 5 \u00d7 10-5 mol L-1) is shown in Fig. 6, which exhibits a series of bands in the UV range of 250-400 nm. A strong absorbance band centred at 260 nm with high molar extinction coefficient could be attributed to \u03c0-\u03c0* type transition within protonated acridines. A series of bands centered at 347, 357, 379 and 397 nm could be attributed to the \u03c0\u2192\u03c0* transitions within the btc3- ligands [27]. The maxima of absorption wavelengths with the molar extinction coefficients as well as the assignment of the absorption spectra are summarized in Table 3.\n\nFluorescence Emission\n\nA number of polynuclear d10 transition metal complexes, such as Zn(II) and Cd(II) coordination polymers, exhibit interesting luminescence properties [28-30]. Fluorescent investigation of 1 was carried out in the solution and the solid phase at room temperature. As illustrated in Fig. 7a, upon a single-wavelength photo-excitation at 274 nm, the fluorescence spectrum of 1 in the solution phase shows three overlapping emission bands in the range of 380-650 nm (peak at 407, 431 and 455 nm), which is similar to the emission property of original acridine ligand in Fig. 7b. So the multiband emission of 1 could be assigned to the emission of the pure organic component [19]. Study of the photoluminescence properties of 1 in the solid state at room temperature is shown in Fig. 7c. Excitation at \u03bbex = 270 nm leads to a broad emission from 350 to 500 nm compared with the emission of 1 in the solution phase. This is presumably due to the combination of ion electronic state induced by strong face-to-face \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions between protonated cations and btc3- ligands as well as strong hydrogen bonding interactions in the solid phase [31, 32].

Before the decomposition of the complexes, DSC curve shows one endothermic peak at 235 \u00b0C, which may be indicative of possible phase transition or structural modification occurring during the measurement. Above 268 \u00b0C, this complex experiences successive weight losses, corresponding to the decomposition of triazolato ligands. The final residue accounts for 34.5% of the total mass, suggesting the residue might be Ag, based on the calculated residual percentage (34.1%).\n\nOwing to the poor quality of crystal data of 1, only a preliminary structure analysis was carried out.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Figure S2a) reveal that the Ni-BTC presents a spherical-shaped structure and Cu-BTC possesses a typical octahedral structure (Figure S2e). For the bimetallic NiCu-MOFs, with the increasing of Cu content, the structure turned to be a more obvious octahedral-like shape, indicating the successful incorporation of Cu in the bimetallic MOFs. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis (Figure S3) confirms the bond formation process. The peak positions of the three MOFs precursors are very similar. The strong and wide adsorption peak at 3400 cm-1 results from the stretching vibration of the O-H group from water molecules. The peaks around the range of 1370 cm-1 can be attributed to the symmetrical bending vibration of -CH2. All these bands were red-shifted compared with typical -CH2 bonds, illustrating that the -CH2 groups were replaced by electron-donating groups. The peaks around 730 cm-1 might be assigned to the Cu-O stretching vibration. The corresponding infrared absorption peaks also confirmed the successful synthesis of bimetallic MOFs. The thermal stability of materials was investigated by thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), and the results are revealed in Figure S4a-e. Apart from the weight loss (~8 to 9 wt % in general) of the physically adsorbed water around 100-120 \u00b0C, the broad exothermic peaks from 300 to 500 \u00b0C could be attributed to the decomposition of organic matter.

However, the SPAN cathode needs to be enhanced to demonstrate more excellent electrochemical performance and kinetic characteristics encouraged by the chemical makeup of the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their effectiveness in the redox reactions of the battery. ZIF67 nanoparticles are grown in situ onto the fiber networks of a high-density glass fiber (GF) separator. They are dynamically activated in a vacuum oven. The open metal sites created after ZIF67 activation can effectively trap anions and improve Li+ transport properties. The transference number (t Li+ ) was predicted to be 0.49, thereby improving the electrochemical performances of the Li-SPAN battery. The anode and cathode exhibited better compatibility with the separator. The Li//Li symmetrical cells based on the ZIF67@GF separator exhibited low polarization and were stable for up to 600 h. A Li/ZIF67@GF/SPAN full cell also showed a small voltage polarization effect and had a starting capacity of 1590 mAh g-1 at 0.1C rate. The improved high-rate capability (ca. 714 mAh g-1 at 10C) of Li/ZIF@GF/SPAN cells was better than that of the Li/bare GF/SPAN cells. The long-term cycling performance was improved significantly, with a decay rate of 0.05% per cycle at 2C over 600 cycles and the ability to perform 1000 cycles at a rate of 5C with 75.3% capacity retention. Thus, our findings support that the Li-SPAN cell equipped with a GF separator with in situ grown ZIF67 nanoparticles substantially improved the electrochemical performance.\n\nIn this study, we generated ZIF-67 nanoparticles in situ onto a GF and then employed the ZIF67@GF as a separator for a cell containing a SPAN cathode and a Li metal anode. Here, we chose a GF separator because of its excellent wettability and good electrolyte uptake. One discharge plateau was found while employing the SPAN cathode, and the dissolving of the polysulfide was inhibited completely. Our modified ZIF67@GF separators to the system increased the transference number to 0.49 because the active sites in the ZIF67 particles interacted with the anions in the electrolyte, thereby decreasing cell polarization. The analysis of symmetrical cells demonstrated that the catalytic activity and stable morphology of the ZIF67 nanoparticles inhibited the growth of Li dendrites and limited the buildup of dead Li. Our Li//Li symmetrical cells equipped with the ZIF67@GF separator survived for more than 600 h without undergoing shorting. Compared with cells featuring bare GF separators, the cells with ZIF67@GF separators have displayed superior high-rate capabilities (notably at higher rates of 36.5% at 2C and 36.8% at 5C) and more excellent discharge capacity retention. Furthermore, the ZIF-67@GF separator-equipped cells had discharge capacities of 961.2 mAh g-1 after the first cycle and 670.71 mAh g-1 after 600 cycles at 2C; the capacity attenuation was approximately 0.05% per cycle. Finally, our Li-SPAN batteries incorporating ZIF67@GF separators markedly improved the transport and kinetic characteristics, enhanced the electrochemical operation, and protected the Li anode.\n\nThermal Behavior of Separators\n\nGF separators are known for their excellent thermal stability. c presents the TGA profiles of the GF separator and ZIF67@GF separators. From the TGA curves, it is obvious that the GF separator is stable up to 800 \u00b0C. The ZIF67 particles are thermally stable up to 200 \u00b0C. The initial 3.5% weight loss at nearly 130 \u00b0C was caused by the complete evaporation of tiny water crystals and moisture captured by the glass fiber separator. Eliminating excess particles from the fillers and unreacted linker species generated a steady weight loss from 150 to 450 \u00b0C. After 450 \u00b0C, the ZIF67 particles begin to decompose. The framework started to disintegrate due to the disappearance of 2-methyilimidazole after 450 \u00b0C.\n\nThe total weight loss of the ZIF67 particles is estimated to be 15%, which is also the mass loading of ZIF67 in the glass fiber separator. The TGA results show that ZIF-67 particles are relatively thermally stable; thus, these particles will improve the thermal characteristics by adsorbing thermal energy. Hence, it prevents thermal assault and makes the battery system more stable. These findings suggested that operating our Li-SPAN corresponding batteries at elevated temperatures would be possible.\n\nIonic Conductivity and Separator Compatibility\n\nIonic Conductivity\n\nIonic conductivity is a crucial parameter when estimating the ion regulating properties of ZIF67 nanoparticles. Here, the ionic conductivities were measured with the help of AC impedance spectroscopy by sandwiching the separators between stainless-steel electrodes, followed by the addition of the liquid electrolyte inside the glovebox. The ionic conductivity value was analyzed at 25-60 \u00b0C to obtain the Arrhenius plot, displayed in a. The ionic conductivities and the activation energies of bare and ZIF67@GF separators are given in Table S2. At room temperature (25 \u00b0C), the ionic conductivities of bare and ZIF67@GF separators are ca. 9 \u00d7 10-3 S cm-1 and 1.08 \u00d7 10-2 S cm-1, respectively. When the temperature is increased to 60 \u00b0C, there seems to be an improvement in the ionic conductivity of both separators. For the bare separator, the conductivity is ca. 1.36 \u00d7 10-2 S cm-1, and for the ZIF67@GF, it is ca. 1.78 \u00d7 10-2 S cm-1. The slight improvement of ionic conductivities of the ZIF67@GF separators is attributed to the abundant porosity of ZIF67, and the compact nature of the as-grown ZIF67 particles supplies handfuls of ion transport channels with shorter ion diffusion lengths. The activation energy (E a) was not affected by the presence of ZIF67 particles. The E a values are ca. 3.8 and 5.0 kJ mol-1 for bare GF and ZIF67@GF separators, respectively. The difference is not that much between both cases. A lower activation energy means a lower energy barrier for the Li+ ion transport, which eventually increases the ionic mass transport rate and reduces the overpotential.\n\nWettability and Electrolyte Uptake\n\nThe wettability of the separator is a notable parameter for maintaining the electrolyte during the charge/discharge process. The contact angle measurements were conducted to examine the wettability of the separator. A drop of the liquid electrolyte is added to the separator surface, and the angle that the drop formed with the surface is measured. The contact angles of the bare GF separator and the ZIF67@GF separator are almost zero (Figure S3), which means that it can immediately uptake the electrolyte, hold a large amount of the electrolyte, and keep the separator wet for a prolonged time. The perfect wettability of the glass fiber separator generated a well-distributed lithium-ion flux, which lowered the increasing lithium-ion concentration polarization locally and contributed to the lithium dendrite suppression. Moreover, it reduces the surface tension, causing a smooth separator/electrolyte interface. The wettability of a separator is related to its electrolyte uptake tendency. The electrolyte uptake was calculated by . The electrolyte uptake of the bare glass fiber and ZIF67@GF separators is calculated to be 87 and 89%, respectively, proving a good interaction between the ZIF67 particles in the separator with the liquid electrolyte.\n\nElectrochemical Performance Studies\n\nThe galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) profiles of the Li/SPAN cells with the bare GF and ZIF67-modified separators are demonstrated in a,b, characterized at 0.1C between the voltages in the range of 1-3 V (vs Li/Li+). The upper potential is decreased to 2.5 V for the second and third cycles for the cells containing both the bare GF and ZIF-grown GF separators, with the lithiation process starting at 1.8 V in the first discharge step. The Li/SPAN cell displayed considerable voltage hysteresis (polarization) during the initial discharge, resulting in a significant buildup of irreversible capacity loss. This voltage hysteresis may be due to the inadequate electrical contact at the original grain boundaries between the SPAN and the conducting carbon particles. The discharging and charging profile of the Li/SPAN cell, in contrast to typical Li/S batteries, exhibited only a single voltage plateau. This behavior suggested that the SPAN underwent a single-phase direct solid-to-solid reaction without forming any soluble polysulfides. The initial discharge capacity of the Li/SPAN cell assembled with the ZIF67@GF separator was ca. 1591 mAh g-1, and for the cell with the bare glass fiber separator, the capacity was ca. 1469 mAh g-1 at 0.1C at room temperature. It is noted that the initial discharge capacity of the full cell was increased by 8% and the overpotential (\u03b7) was reduced from 0.45 to 0.37 V after incorporating ZIF67 nanoparticles on the GF separator. This is because the active sites in the ZIF67 particles strongly regulated the Li+ ion transport flux at the electrolyte-separator interface and markedly reduced the overpotential. The high Li+ ion transfer number permits fast reaction kinetics throughout the Li nucleation and lithium growth processes at the Li anode; it may be responsible for the decreased overpotential. It should be emphasized that the increased overpotential in the cells with bare glass fiber separators is also caused by ongoing SEI generation. The higher capacities of the cells associated with the SPAN cathode may be due to the rough and porous nature of the electrode surface, which has more room for the Li+ ion interaction. \n\nThe oxidation peak potential was noted at approximately 2.31 V. The single reduction and oxidation peaks resembled the single voltage plateau in the GCD profile, suggesting the direct conversion of S to Li2S without forming any of the soluble intermediate polysulfides responsible for the shuttle reaction. In the Li/SPAN cells incorporating the ZIF67@GF separator, the sharp and highly intense oxidation and reduction peaks appeared with an enhanced peak current. This is due to the redox nature of ZIF67 nanoparticles and their compatibility with the electrolyte interface. Notably, the overpotential in the first scan significantly drops from 1.01 to 0.75 V when ZIF67 nanoparticles are present. The extended cycle performance of the cell would be favored by the rapid reaction kinetics resulting from the lower peak potential difference (\u0394E).\n\nTo explain the Li insertion behavior, the reaction mechanism involves producing Li2S and a lithiated polymer backbone through the cleavage of the S-S bonds and the formation of Li-C-N-Li bonding. Because of the existence of the S2 and S3 chains, no polysulfide production occurred. Nevertheless, the complete desulfurization of SPAN during the discharging has not been proven and is still disputed. It has been proposed that the lithiated polymeric backbone would resist delithiation and stay lithiated after recharging. Following the initial discharging, it has been suggested that Li-SPAN and Li2S would undergo a reversible redox reaction. The Li+ diffusion coefficient trend was found to be higher in the cells with the ZIF67@GF separator, as shown in b. As a result of the conversion of the lithiated SPAN into desulfurized SPAN, there is an increase in electronic conductivity, which is consistent with the electronic structure of SPAN during the discharging/charging process. The Li+ ion diffusion coefficient of the Li/SPAN cells incorporating the ZIF@67-modified GF separators increased; it is ca. 1.64 \u00d7 10-8 cm2 s-1 from initial SOC(%). We assumed that the effective active sites, high surface area, and nanoscale size of the ZIF-67 particles shortened the Li+ ion diffusion length and immobilized most large anions (PF6 -) in the liquid electrolyte to improve the Li+ ion transport rate. In comparison, the Li+ ion diffusion coefficients of the Li/SPAN cell featuring the bare GF separator were calculated to be ca. 5.82 \u00d7 10-9 cm2 s-1 from initial SOC(%)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['etc', 'decomposition_temperature']"}]}

They also help understand the polarization degree on the surface of the lithium foil. The stability and the short-circuit failure are frequently and qualitatively correlated with the Li plating/stripping voltage shape. These voltage changes are significantly influenced by the electrolyte composition, depth of charge/discharge, and current density. Symmetrical cells were made with bare GF and ZIF67@GF separators to examine the electrochemical capabilities of the bare glass fiber and ZIF67@GF separators with lithium metal anodes. 1 M lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) in ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC) was used as the electrolyte. Each cell was treated with an optimized amount (100 \u03bcL) of the electrolyte. As shown in a-d, the comparisons were made between the cells with ZIF67@GF and bare GF separators regarding their rate performance, plating/stripping voltage profiles, and current density. To measure the consistency and endurance of the electrolyte/electrode stability, the symmetrical cells operated at an extremely high current density, namely, the critical current density (CCD). The CCD profiles of the Li//SPAN cells with the bare GF and ZIF67@GF separators are displayed in a,c, respectively. In contrast to the spike-like voltage profiles of the cell with the bare glass fiber separators, the voltage plateau formed by the symmetry cells containing ZIF67@GF separators is flat and stable and features a slight polarization. The polarization difference completely diminished when the current density reached 2 and 5 mA cm-2. However, the symmetrical cells with the bare GF separator showed overpotentials of ca. 41, 66, and 171 mV at 0.2, 0.5, and 1 mA cm-2, respectively. In contrast, the overpotential of symmetrical cells with ZIF67@GF separators displayed approximately 36, 60, and 123 mV for 0.2, 0.5, and 1 mA cm-2, respectively. The cells were instructed to return to the lowest current density of 0.2 mA cm-2 after the highest current density of 5 mA cm-2. In both cases, the voltage profiles were accurately reproduced, and the bare one's voltage profile became smoother after a high current rate. The presence of ZIF67 nanoparticles on the GF separator is responsible for the reduced overpotential and smooth voltage profiles, which effectively enable the substantial amount of lithium to get fully utilized during the stripping and plating and prevent the formation of Li dendrites and dead lithium. b,d shows the voltage profiles of the symmetry cell at 1 mA cm-2 with an areal capacity of 1 mAh cm-2 for the bare GF and the ZIF67@GF separators. The plating/stripping profile shows no difference in cells with the bare GF and ZIF67@GF separators. A marked difference arose, however, at 500 h. Even the symmetrical cells with bare glass fiber separators underwent a short circuit at 547 h, revealing a trend of increasing polarization. In contrast, the symmetrical cell with the ZIF67@GF separator prevented the cell from undergoing a short circuit. Notably, around 300 h, a sharp voltage drop is observed at the cells containing bare GF and ZIF67@GF separators. This happened due to the unstable power supply/shutdown during the measurement.\n\nThe enlarged voltage profiles are shown in Figure S4. The calculated values of polarizations are ca. 577 and 300 mV for the cells with the bare GF and ZIF67@GF separators, respectively. During the final hours of cycling, the cells provided spiking or arcing voltage profiles. However, the arcing behavior of the cells with a bare GF separator is severe. This arcing profile featured a distinctive arc that plateaued at the halfway point of the half cycle. This change in the voltage curve suggested that its voltage shape, following prolonged cycling, could not be captured fully by morphology-driven reaction kinetics, implying that the dead Li layer continued to accumulate and that the diffusion length through the dead Li layer continued to increase. Thus, during cell cycling, this buildup of dead Li resulted in restricted mass transport. The interfacial stability of the symmetry cells incorporating the bare GF separators and the ZIF67@GF separators is investigated using the EIS measurements. In Figure S5, the AC impedance spectra are illustrated. The AC impedance was measured for the fresh Li//Li symmetry cells and cells that had undergone five cycles of polarization at 1 mA cm-2 with an areal plating capacity of 1 mAh cm-2. In the higher frequency region, one semicircle was observed with charge transfer resistance (R ct) and conductance (C 1). For the cells with the bare GF separator and the ZIF67@GF separator, the R ct values are around 138 and 96.2 \u03a9, respectively, before cycling, and they drop to 97.8 and 73.6 \u03a9 after five cycles. The ZIF67 particles with a high surface area provided more free void or space for better lithium mass transport. They decreased the interfacial polarization, which resulted in lower charge transfer resistance for the cells using ZIF67@GF separators.\n\nRate Capability and Electrochemical Performance\n\nThe GCD measurements at various current densities ranging from 0.2C to 10C were used to study the rate capabilities for the cells with two separators. a displays the GCD profiles of the rate capabilities. The cells are generally activated for 2 to 3 cycles prior to performing the rate capability test to form some stable SEI layer. At rates of 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, 2C, 5C, and 10C, the Li/SPAN cell assembled with the ZIF-67@GF separator offered high initial capacities of 1420, 1375, 1278, 1192, 960, and 714 mAh g-1, respectively. A high reversible capacity of 1395 mAh g-1 occurred when we switched the current density from 10C to 0.2C. At 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, 2C, 5C, and 10C, the cells built with the bare GF separators had capacities of 1293, 1188, 1102, 874, 702, and 297 mAh g-1, respectively. When we reversed the current density to 0.2C from 10C, the discharge capacity returned to 1273 mAh g-1. At low current densities, the cells assembled with the ZIF-67@GF separator produced 9.8% (0.2C) and 16.7% (0.5C) more capacity than that of the cell with the bare GF counterpart. When the current density was much higher, however, the situation was more drastic, with the cells containing ZIF-67@GF separators achieving 36.5% (2C) and 36.8% (5C) more capacity than that of the cell with the bare GF separators. The lower overpotential and enhanced ionic conductivity that arose after modifying the GF with the ZIF-67 particles were primarily responsible for the increased discharge capacity and more reversibility after applying the high current density. The overpotential or polarization has the most detrimental effect at higher current densities. The use of GF separators in SPAN systems, capable of adapting to temperature variations inside the cell and withstanding even higher current densities, is noteworthy.\n\nWe used EIS to analyze the interfacial stability; b shows the Nyquist plots. A depressed semicircle in the medium- to high-frequency range and an inclined line in the low-frequency range make up each Nyquist plot before cycling. The former is related to the charge transfer resistance (R ct) at the electrode-electrolyte interface as well as the bulk resistance (R b) from the electrolyte, with the latter being the Warburg diffusion impedance (Wo) of lithium-ion diffusion in the bulk of the electrode. In this case, the charge transfer resistance of the cell prepared with ZIF67@GF (ca. 23.6 \u03a9) was slightly lower than that of the cell with the bare GF (ca. 27.8 \u03a9). Here, we can state conclusively that the separator prepared with the in situ grown ZIF-67 nanoparticles did not increase the impedance and enabled fast charge transfer kinetics. The interfacial contact between the electrode-electrolyte and the separator was also increased by the higher wettability of the separator, thereby promoting the ionic conductivity and increasing the discharge capacity.\n\nThe cells were evaluated at 0.5C and 2C at room temperature, as shown in c,d, to examine the electrochemical performance of the separators at various current densities. The cells incorporating the bare glass fiber separator had an initial capacity of 1283 mAh g-1 at 0.5C; after 200 cycles, its capacity was ca. 921 mAh g-1. Here, the capacity retention was ca. 82% and the capacity attenuation was 0.08% per cycle (from the second cycle). The ZIF67@GF separator-equipped cell delivered a high initial capacity of 1414 mAh g-1; after 200 cycles, its capacity was ca. 1019 mAh g-1 again, with a capacity retention of 82% and a capacity decay per cycle of 0.08%. The cells fabricated with the bare GF and ZIF67@GF separators had initial coulombic efficiencies of 86 and 97.9%, respectively. In both cases, the coulombic efficiencies reached a stable value of 100% throughout the cycles. The cell with the ZIF67@GF separator had a high initial coulombic efficiency because the catalytic activity of the ZIF67 nanoparticles increased the sulfur conversion efficiency, starting from the first cycle. The cell with the bare GF delivered an initial capacity of 821.6 mAh g-1 at a high current density 2C; after 600 cycles, it attenuated by 0.05% per cycle, resulting in 567.6 mAh g-1. Furthermore, the ZIF67@GF separator-equipped cell had a higher initial capacity of 961.2 mAh g-1 and a capacity of 674.71 mAh g-1 after 600 cycles, giving a capacity attenuation of 0.05% per cycle.\n\nHigher Current Density and Long-Term Cycling Examination\n\nAs shown in Figure S7, the cells were evaluated at 5C for 1000 cycles. After 669 cycles at this rate, the cell with the bare GF separator no longer functioned. The cell with the ZIF67@GF separator, on the other hand, completed 1000 cycles successfully; its initial capacity of 394 mAh g-1 decreased to 297 mAh g-1 at the 1000th cycle, with a capacity retention of 75.3%. The survival of the cells with the ZIF67@GF was due to the distinctive porous structure of the GF separator, leading to a high ionic conductivity when placed in the electrolyte and facilitated rapid ionic transport; furthermore, the SPAN cathode, in which S atoms were covalently attached to the polymeric backbone of the PAN, prevented the shuttle mechanism. This rationale also explains why the cells containing the bare GF separators also functioned well. Most significantly, the long-range order and high porosity of the ZIF-67 particles facilitated directional Li+ ion conduction, which resulted in faster reaction kinetics and stable long cycle life."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['etc']"}]}

The related luminescent sensing mechanism of the CsPbBr3@Eu-BTC is also discussed, and this work provides an effective strategy for the rational design of a reliable and stable thermometer by integrating CsPbBr3 QDs and a carrier of a luminescent lanthanide organic framework.\n\nHerein, a novel dual-emissive CsPbBr3 QD encapsulated Eu-MOF material has been successfully prepared through a simple liquid-phase synthetic route with expected FIR self-calibrated temperature sensing activities, in which the CsPbBr3 QDs display a thermo-quenching response, while the Eu3+ ions in the Eu-MOF show an opposite thermo-enhancing luminescence property when the temperature is increased. Accordingly, it is demonstrated that the thermo-response luminescence intensity ratio of CsPbBr3 QDs to Eu3+ emitters shows an exponential function versus temperature changes, which can effectively serve as an ultrastable self-calibrating temperature sensor. The as-obtained novel CsPbBr3@Eu-BTC thermometer shows a very high relative sensitivity (S r) of 3.9% \u00b0C-1 at 20 \u00b0C and excellent cyclic sensing stability.\n\n a illustrates the chromaticity diagram of CsPbBr3@Eu-BTC at different temperatures. It can be found that with an increase in temperature, the emissive colors evolved from green (0.275, 0.674) to orange (0.536, 0.423) (inset in a). b illustrates the relative luminescent intensity ratio of Eu3+ ions (618 nm) to CsPbBr3 (528 nm) versus temperature, and the results can be well fitted by the exponential function equation (a)         I   618  nm       I   528  nm     = - 0.536 + 1.422 \u00d7   e   0.031 T     1 where I 618nm and I 528nm denote the emission intensities of Eu3+ ions in Eu-BTC and CsPbBr3 QDs, respectively, and T is the temperature. Such a fitting result with R 2 = 0.995 demonstrated that the luminescent emission intensity ratio I 618nm/I 528nm from CsPbBr3@Eu-MOF nanoparticles can be intrinsically used for temperature monitoring, showing an excellent ratiometric temperature-sensing ability.\n\nIn addition, we also calculated the absolute sensitivity (S a) and relative sensitivity (S r) to quantitatively evaluate the ratiometric temperature-sensing activity of the CsPbBr3@Eu-BTC nanothermometer. S a and S r can be calculated by the equations       S   a   =  |   \u2202\u0394   \u2202 T   |    2        S   r   =  |     S   a     \u0394   |    3 where \u0394 is used to represent the PL intensity ratio I 618nm/I 528nm, and T is the temperature. As a result, b shows the calculated S a and S r values as a function of temperature. It can be easily observed that the maximum value of S r is 3.9% \u00b0C-1 measured at 20 \u00b0C, which is higher than those of most of the reported MOF-based ratiometric thermometers (). In addition, the temperature resolution (\u03b4T), another crucial parameter for evaluating the thermometer, can be estimated from the equation 4    \u03b4 T =   1     S   r       \u2202\u0394   \u0394     where \u03b4\u0394/\u0394 denotes the relative error in the thermometric parameter measurements defined by the experimental detection equipment. The fluorescence spectrometer used has a signal to noise ratio of 16000:1, which means that the value of \u03b4\u0394/\u0394 is about 0.0125%. The calculated \u03b4T curve of CsPbBr3@Eu-BTC versus temperature is shown in c, which also indicates that \u03b4T is better than 0.004 \u00b0C across the entire measured temperature range. To evaluate the reversibility of the CsPbBr3@Eu-BTC nanocomposite toward temperature switching operations, the luminescent intensities of CsPbBr3@Eu-BTC upon heating/cooling at 20 and 65 \u00b0C were recorded. The cycling experimental results are shown in d and indicate that the luminescent switching operation can be repeated for at least six consecutive cycles without significant change, illustrating its excellent reversibility and reliability as an optical sensor for thermometer applications. The above results demonstrate that the CsPbBr3@Eu-BTC nanocomposite can serve as an optical ratiometric nanothermometer with high relative sensitivity and temperature resolution for potential temperature-sensing applications.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn summary, we have successfully prepared a self-calibrated optical luminescent nanothermometer of CsPbBr3 QD encapsulated lanthanide metal-organic frameworks (Eu-BTC). The different thermo-response luminescence behaviors of CsPbBr3 QD emission at 528 nm and 5D0-7F2 emission of Eu3+ at 618 nm were investigated in the temperature range of 20-100 \u00b0C. The as-obtained CsPbBr3@Eu-BTC hybrid exhibits excellent FIR ratiometric temperature-sensing properties with a high relative sensitivity (S r) of 3.9% \u00b0C-1 at 20 \u00b0C and an excellent temperature resolution of 0.004 \u00b0C, indicating its superiority to serve as a nanothermometer for optical temperature sensing.

We optimized the catalyst loading by adjusting the ZZU-281 amount with 5, 10, 20, 30, and 50 mg, respectively (Figure S10). With the increase of the catalyst amount, the removal efficiency gradually enhanced and achieved nearly 100% at 20 mg under both dry (RH \u2264 5%) and wet (RH = 90%) humidity conditions. When the catalyst loading was further increased to 30 and 50 mg, ZZU-281 still maintained 100% O3 decomposition efficiency. Therefore, a catalyst dosage of 20 mg was used in this reaction system. a and Figure S11 show that ZZU-281 achieved nearly 100% persistent O3 decomposition efficiency at \u22645%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 90% RH, and the efficiency remained stable even after continuous reaction for 70 h. These results verified that ZZU-281 not only is an excellent humidity-resistant O3 elimination catalyst but also performs efficiently under dry conditions. The catalytic turnover frequency (TOF) for this catalytic reaction was determined to be 10 min-1 after 70 h test. This catalyst with such remarkable and stable O3 decomposition performance under different humidity levels thus significantly outperformed other reported catalysts (Table S2) and met the demands of practical application under various environmental conditions. We hypothesized that the high O3 removal efficiency of ZZU-281 under both low and high-RH conditions may correlate with the intrinsically abundant coordination water molecules in ZZU-281. To determine the role of coordination water molecules in the O3 decomposition process, we carried out an O3 removal experiment with dehydrated ZZU-281, which was obtained by heating the sample at 200 \u00b0C for 2 h. The TGA curve indicated that the water molecules in ZZU-281 were removed (Figure S6). All intense PXRD peaks of dehydrated ZZU-281 reproduced the pristine ones, indicating that the framework was basically maintained. A new tiny PXRD signal at 9.6\u00b0 may have been caused by the loss of abundant coordinated water molecules around the Mn nodes. (Figure S12). The O3 decomposition efficiency of dehydrated ZZU-281 was much lower (50%) than that of pristine ZZU-281 at RH \u2264 5%, while the O3 conversion increased to 70% when the RH was increased to 90%. When the sample was switched again to dry conditions (RH \u2264 5%), the O3 conversion was obviously enhanced compared to that of the pristine dehydrated sample (Figure S13). Moreover, we found that the O3 conversion performance was increased each time the catalyst was treated with a high RH. After four consecutive dry-wet cycles, the O3 decomposition performance returned to nearly 100% at 90% RH, revealing that water indeed helped to improve the O3 conversion efficiency. We inferred that the water molecule recoordinated to the Mn nodes under high RH and recovered the original structure as evidenced by TGA (Figure S14), thus endowing the recycled sample with enhanced O3 conversion efficiency. These results confirmed the potential of using ZZU-281 to degrade O3 under dry conditions by using the water present in the pores, circumventing the need for added water. Importantly, as evidenced by PXRD and FT-IR, the structural integrity of ZZU-281 was fully retained after the 70 h O3 decomposition experiment (c and Figure S16).\n\nFurther, we investigated the catalytic performance of ZZU-281 for O3 decomposition in the presence of other gases at room temperature, including CO, CO2, NO, and NO2. The inlet concentration of these gases was maintained at 100 ppm by controlling the gas flow. When CO or CO2 were introduced, ZZU-281 still showed excellent performance (nearly 100% O3 decomposition efficiency) at a moderate RH of 30% within a 12 h test (a). For NO and NO2, a slight performance decay from 100% to 96% was observed during the first 5 h and was maintained at 95% after 12 h. This was probably caused by competitive adsorption between O3 and NO x  on the active sites, which eventually blocked the catalytic activity. Moreover, the outlet concentrations of CO, CO2, NO, or NO2 after catalytic reaction were consistent with the inlet one, confirming that these gases were not involved in the O3 conversion reaction. In addition, ZZU-281-catalyzed O3 conversion under different temperatures was studied (b). At 0 \u00b0C, the O3 conversion performance (~94%) is slightly lower than that at room temperature (25 \u00b0C, ~100%). When the temperature was further increased to 50 and 80 \u00b0C, the O3 removal efficiency remained nearly 100%. Overall, ZZU-281 showed great potential for O3 elimination in various environments."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['catalytic_activity']"}]}

These results indicated that the chirality of UCNP@ZIF-NiSx-L was from the chiral NiSx-L NPs. To confirm this assumption, dispersed chiral NiSx-L NPs were prepared. The TEM image in Figure S10 shows that the diameter of the chiral NiSx-L NPs was about 3.5 nm. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was conducted to analyze the changes in mercapto groups (-SH). As shown in Figure S11, FTIR of the chiral L-pen showed a peak at 2586 cm-1, which was assigned to the stretching and vibration of the S-H bond. After formation of the chiral NiSx-L NPs, the peak completely disappeared, indicating cleavage of the S-H bond by the strong covalent binding of thiol groups to Ni atoms on the surface of the NiSx-L NPs. The CD spectrum of the chiral NiSx-L NPs (Figure S12) showed a similar CD response to UCNP@ZIF-NiSx-L, further confirming the existence of chiral NiSx-L NPs in the nanoassemblies. Notably, the NiSx-L and NiSx-D NPs which were induced by the chiral L-pen and D-pen displayed mirror image CD lines (Figure S12). Absorption spectra were carried out to characterize the optical activity of the prepared nanomaterials. As displayed in Figure S13, chiral NiSx NPs showed absorption peaks at 415 and 535 nm, and the absorption of UCNP@ZIF-NiSx-L was in accordance with chiral NiSx-L, demonstrating that NiSx-L NPs were assembled into UCNP@ZIF successfully. Concurrently, the UCL of UCNP@ZIF-NiSx-L at 540 nm was dramatically quenched by NiSx-L NPs (Figure S14).\n\nMore importantly, the change of CD signal exhibited a perfect linear relationship with the H2O2 concentration ranging from 0.05 to 20 \u03bcM, and the LOD was 0.032 \u03bcM. (A and S20). We next tested the feasibility of this probe for its ability to detect H2O2 using a luminescent signal. As shown in Figure S21, the absorption of the probe spectrally overlaps with the green emission (540 nm) of the UCNPs. Reaction of H2O2 with the probe caused a decrease in probe absorption at 660 nm, which will then increase the I 660/I 540 ratio of the probe (B). A plot of I 660/I 540 ratio versus H2O2 concentration in the range of 0.05 to 20 \u03bcM shows a linear response, and LOD was calculated to be 0.037 \u03bcM (Figure S22). Next, the selectivity of this probe was tested. In the presence of ROS, the CD signal disappeared, and the luminescent signal was restored, whereas no obvious changes in the CD or luminescent signals were observed with possible interfering components. This suggested that this detection probe had a perfect specificity (C,D and S23, S24). Therefore, the UCNP@ZIF-NiSx probe had adequate sensitivity and excellent selectivity for the detection of ROS under physiological conditions.\n\nTo confirm general applicability of this probe, the detection of intracellular ROS levels was also carried out in human epithelial cancer cells (HeLa cells) and human melanoma SK-MEL-2 cells (A and S28). For HeLa cells, the intracellular H2O2 level was calculated to be 2.29 \u00b1 0.21 \u03bcM and 2.43 \u00b1 0.17 \u03bcM from the CD mode and UCL mode, respectively. For SK-MEL-2 cells, the CD and UCL detection results were 1.33 \u00b1 0.23 \u03bcM and 1.37 \u00b1 0.18 \u03bcM, respectively. All the results were consistent and comparable to those found using the H2O2 Kit, demonstrating that the nanoassemblies displayed excellent versatility among various cell lines. For the HeLa cells treated with NAC, the intensity of the CD response was much higher than that of the original untreated cells, whereas after treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, an upregulator of ROS), the CD signal intensity was much weaker than that of untreated cells (Figure S29), suggesting that this probe could be applied to detect changes of intracellular H2O2 levels. It was found that the sensitivity of UCL detection was lower than that of CD detection which could be attributed to the high sensitivity and responsiveness of chiral NiSx NPs to the H2O2 analytes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['etc']"}]}

Change in optical property of fluorescent chemosensor CPP-16 was easily recognized by FM image (Figure b), with the initial green emission (Figure b) of CPP-16 almost absent after interaction with Cu2+. A photograph image obtained after the addition of Cu2+ solution (after 10 s.) revealed the disappearance of the initial emission (). Incorporation of Cu2+ ions within CPP-16 was further verified by EDX spectrum analysis, as Cu atoms were detected, in addition to Zn, C, N, and O atoms (Figure c). CO2 sorption isotherms of CPP-16 and CPP-16\u22c5Cu2+ were measured at 195 K. CO2 uptake abilities of CPP-16 (70 cm3g-1) decreased after the incorporation of Cu2+ within CPP-16 to 51 cm3g-1 for CPP-16\u22c5Cu2+ ().\n\nSelective sensing of CPP-16 on Cu2+ has been validated by thorough observation of parallel relations using a variety of other metal ions in place of Cu2+ (Figures  and ). Specifically, CPP-16 was immersed in several different kinds of MeCN solutions, which contained different kinds of metal ions, such as Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Ag+, and Cd2+ (10 mM). Fluorescence intensity changes of CPP-16 following immersion in the various metal ion solutions were dependent on the specific identity of the metal ions (Figures a and ). Alkaline-earth metal ions such as Mg2+ and Ca2+ had nearly no effect on the fluorescence intensity of the initial CPP-16. Moreover, little effect was found for transition metal ions such as Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Ag+, and Cd2+. The only considerable quenching effect on CPP-16 fluorescence intensity was found for Cu2+. Specifically, the quenching effect of metal ions was quantified by the Stern-Volmer equation (I 0/I = 1 + K sv[M]), where I 0 and I are emission intensity of CPP-16 before and after reactions with metal ions, K sv is the quenching effect coefficient of the metal ions, and [M] is the concentration of the metal ions. As shown in Table , the largest and distinguishable K sv value was obtained for Cu2+ at 7846.7 M-1. The selectivity on Cu2+ was confirmed again by photograph showing the response of CPP-16 to various metal ions (Figure b). In addition, the selective response to metal ions was visualized by FM (Figure c). The influence of interrupting Cu2+ sensing by other metal ions was studied by conducting Cu2+ sensing in the presence of many other metal ions. Emission spectra () described no disturbance on selective Cu2+ sensing by any of the other metal ions.

We investigated the ethanol sorption properties and EER activity of R2dtoaCu. We analyzed the ethanol sorption isotherms of the (HOC3H6)2dtoaCu at 298 K as shown in Figure ; 0.6 mol of ethanol per 1 mol of Cu dimer was adsorbed on the (HOC3H6)2dtoaCu at P/P 0 = 0.95 where P 0 is the saturated vapor pressure of ethanol, while the ethanol uptake of (HOC2H4)2dtoaCu was about 0.8 mol ethanol per mol of Cu dimer. Furthermore, (HOC3H6)2dtoaCu gives smaller hysteresis than (HOC2H4)2dtoaCu. This lower ethanol adsorption amount and the smaller hysteresis of (HOC3H6)2dtoaCu compared with (HOC2H4)2dtoaCu coincide with the theoretical calculations showing the smaller adsorption energy of ethanol on (HOC3H6)2dtoaCu than that on (HOC2H4)2dtoaCu.\n\nFigure  shows the cyclic voltammogram (CV) of (HOC3H6)2dtoaCu in an aqueous solution of 0.5 M H2SO4 with different concentrations of ethanol. From the CV curve without ethanol in Figure , a quasireversible oxidation couple was observed with a half-wave potential of 0.30 V vs Ag/AgCl (Peak I) (E pa = 0.35 V and E pc = 0.25 V) and an irreversible wave with E p = 0.95 V (Peak II). Here, E pa and E pc are the anodic and cathodic peak potentials, respectively. The peaks I and II were assigned to the CuI/CuII and CuII/CuIII oxidation couples, respectively. These characters are similar to that of (HOC2H4)2dtoaCu. Two characteristics were observed when the ethanol was added to the electrolyte. One is the considerable increase in the current density of both peaks. The other is that the potential in peak I was almost constant while the shape of peak II changed and the current became almost constant at a higher potential than peak II. These results suggest the occurrence of a catalytic EER reaction. The current density for the (HOC3H6)2dtoaCu is about 2.7 mA/cm2 when the ethanol concentration is 2.0 M.\n\nWe further conducted a controlled-potential (0.37 V) electrolysis experiment combined with gas chromatography analysis to identify the oxidation products. It was found that acetaldehyde is the sole oxidation product and no acetic acid was detected, which was the same as for (HOC2H4)2dtoaCu under 0.39 V. The maximum conversion ratio of 4.6% within a period of 20 min (based on the area ratio of acetaldehyde and ethanol) was found, for which the initial concentration of ethanol was 0.5 M and the electrolyte volume was 20 mL. The conversion amount was smaller than that for (HOC2H4)2dtoaCu (6.8%), which indicated that the EER activity of the present catalyst is lower than that of (HOC2H4)2dtoaCu. This difference can be explained by the different activation energies of the proton-transfer reaction from ethanol between (HOC2H4)2dtoaCu and (HOC3H6)2dtoaCu obtained by DFT calculations."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['gas_adsorption', 'etc']"}]}

In this new trimeric SBU, two Co2+ centers (Co2 and Co3) display a trigonal-bipyramidal configuration and coordinate with one \u03bc3-OH (Co-O 1.9723-2.1390 \u00c5, Co3-\u03bc3-OH 2.0526 \u00c5, and Co2-\u03bc3-OH 2.0768 \u00c5) and four different O species from different COO units, while the third Co2+ center (Co1) is four-connected with one \u03bc3-OH (Co-O 1.9633-1.9957 \u00c5) and three different O atoms from different COO units. The second SBU (Figure b) is a mononuclear [Co(COO)4] species that is constructed by one Co2+ center and four O atoms from four different COO units with monodentate coordination mode (Co-O 1.9520-1.9874 \u00c5). The ratio between these two SBUs in NTU-Z30 is 1:1. Moreover, there are three independent BTC linkers in NTU-Z30: one BTC is linked with Co cations through two different -COO groups with one bridging \u03bc2-\u03b71:\u03b71 mode and a monodentate \u03b71 mode (Figure c), the second one has two bridging \u03bc2-\u03b71:\u03b71 modes (Figure d), and the third one has one bridging \u03bc2-\u03b71:\u03b71 mode and two monodentate \u03b71 modes (Figure e). The two SBUs are further linked together through BTC units to form three-dimensional structures with an intercrossed channel along the a and b axes (Figure f,g). Protonated HTEA+ and guest H3O+ cations act as charge-balance species and fill up the empty space in the channels. TGA (Figure S3, ) for NTU-Z30 reveals that the weight loss (22.85%) in the first stage between 80 and 375 \u00b0C is attributed to the loss of TEA and H2O (calcd 23.30%), and the weight loss of 64.35% in the second stage between 375 and 600 \u00b0C can be explained by the loss of BTC linkers (calcd 63.74%).

In Co2(COO)6 clusters, one Co atom has an inversion center symmetry to the other. Each Co center has a distorted tetrahedral geometry (Co-O 1.9488-2.0048 \u00c5) and coordinates with four O atoms from four different but symmetrically equivalent BTC ligands through a bridging \u03bc2-\u03b71:\u03b71 mode and two monodentate \u03b71 modes (Figure b), resulting in a three-dimensional network (Figure c).

The guest H2O and guest HTEA+ occupy the vacancies made by asymmetric units and have strong interaction with the network via hydrogen bonds. The weight loss of 28.35% (first stage) between 150 and 260 \u00b0C in TGA is attributed to the loss of guest TEA and H2O (calcd 27.03%), and the weight loss of 54.26% in the second stage from 260 to 700 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of BTC linkers (calcd 55.40%).

As shown in Figure a, the linear Co3 SBU consists of three crystallographically independent Co centers (Co1, Co2, and Co3). The central Co atom (Co2) has an octahedral configuration with all bridging -COO species from six different BTC ligands, while the terminal centers Co1 and Co3 adopt a four-coordinated distorted tetrahedron, which is completed by bridging four -COO groups from three different BTC ligands. The lengths of the Co-O bonds are in the range of 1.9452-2.1642 \u00c5. The Co1-Co2-Co3 angle is ca. 144.556\u00b0 (30), and the distances between metal centers are about 3.3969(11) \u00c5. In addition, two independent BTC linkers are observed in NTU-Z32: one BTC is linked to Co centers via -COO groups through \u03bc2-\u03b72 mode, \u03bc2-\u03b71:\u03b71 mode, and monodentate \u03b71 mode (Figure b), and the second one has \u03bc2-\u03b71:\u03b71 mode and \u03b71 mode (Figure b). The framework of NTU-Z32 has channels with a diameter of ~12.56 \u00c5 along the b axis, where HTEA+ cations were filled for charge balance (Figure c). In NTU-Z32, each Co3 SBU connects with eight BTC ligands, and every BTC ligand links two or three Co3 SBUs, leading to the formation of a three-dimensional framework (Figure d). Noting that NTU-Z32 is an analogue of Ni3(NMe4)(BTC)3(DMF)2 except the coordination environments of metal atoms. TGA for NTU-Z32 (Figures S3, ) shows that the weight loss (20.05%) in the first stage (150-300 \u00b0C) belongs to the evaporation of guest TEA (calcd 20.28%), and the weight loss (59.58%) in the second stage (300-600 \u00b0C) comes from the loss of coordination BTC ligands (calcd 57.06%). The final residue of 21.37% is close to the calculated amount of CoO (22.66%; Figure S3, ).\n\nMagnetic Properties\n\nThe magnetic properties of NTU-Z30 (a), NTU-Z31 (b), and NTU-Z32 (c) have been examined for possible applications as molecular magnets. The magnetic susceptibilities (\u03c7M) of all samples were tested from 300 to 2 K under 100 Oe (Figure ), and \u03c7M of all materials follows the Curie-Weiss law in the testing temperature range. The calculated Curie (C) and Weiss (\u03b8) constants for NTU-Z30, NTU-Z31, and NTU-Z32 are 3.10 cm3 K mol-1 and -33.50 K, 2.92 cm3 K mol-1 and -24.51 K, and 2.34 cm3 K mol-1 and -33.10 K, respectively. These results suggest that the neighboring Co cations in all three MOFs have weak antiferromagnetic interactions.\n\nAlthough they could show some certain catalytic activities, NTU-Z31 and NTU-Z32 are unstable in DMF and are screened out for catalytic examination. The stable NTU-Z30 is the main object to be examined on the catalytic activity in the aerobic epoxidation as below. Figure  displays the relationship between the time and epoxidation ratio of trans-stilbene, where the conversion (98.2%) and selectivity (95.6%) toward the epoxide can be observed after 7 h of reaction. The average turnover frequency (TOF) of 17.6 h-1 based on the cobalt mass was obtained for a reaction lasting for 6 h at 100 \u00b0C with an O2 flow rate of 30 mL min-1. Elevating the reaction temperature or O2 flow rate could further improve the average TOFs (TOF = 20.5 h-1 when the reaction temperature is 120 \u00b0C). The catalytic activity of NTU-Z30 has been compared with the reported representative catalysts for the same reaction, and the results are summarized in Table . For transformation from trans-stilbene to its corresponding epoxide, NTU-Z30 shows high epoxide selectivity, excellent conversion ratio, and high TOF value, surpassing most of the reported MOF-based heterogeneous catalysts for the same reaction, and even rivals some traditional catalysts. Note that most reports involving MOF-based catalysts have to involve either cocatalyst or peroxides because of their poor catalytic behaviors. Clearly, the NTU-Z30 catalyst takes the lead among all MOF-based catalysts to approach a good catalytic performance.\n\nThe stability of NTU-Z30 has been carefully investigated because it is an important factor in evaluating the heterogeneous catalyst. The recycle experiments of NTU-Z30 were performed, and the results are summarized in Figure . Surprisingly, after the first run, the recycled NTU-Z30 showed an even greater catalytic activity. In the second run, the conversion and selectivity of trans-stilbene toward epoxide reaches 92.5% and 99.3%, respectively. After the third run, the conversion got increased to 97.4% and the selectivity is 98.6%. According to the calculation from Diamond software, the larger pore size of NTU-Z30 is 12 \u00d7 10 \u00c5 along the a axis; hence, the molecule as large as trans-stilbene is unable to enter the pore and contact with the active cobalt sites inside. Here we attribute the active cobalt sites to the cobalt sites on the outer surface of NTU-Z30. Therefore, the improved catalytic activity in the recycle test infers that NTU-Z30 turns to fragments to some extent and then a larger surface area is exposed or rather the number of active sites increases, which leads to the improved catalytic activity. The catalyst stability was further examined by PXRD and FTIR spectra. The PXRD (Figure S5, ) study of both pristine and spent NTU-Z30 shows no phase change, while no obvious peak shifts in the FTIR spectra (Figure S6, ) further confirm the stability of NTU-Z30, which is in agreement with the result of recycle usage. However, according to the ICP-MS result, only a negligible amount of cobalt species leaches into the solution, which might be due to expansion of the cobalt coordination sphere or removal of the cobalt ion, causing the collapse of the framework."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['crystal_system', 'space_group', 'decomposition_temperature', 'magnetic_susceptibility', 'catalytic_activity']"}]}

To evaluate their potential as adsorbents, the adsorptive removal of formaldehyde (FA) in aqueous environments was investigated using four materials, two water-stable metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) of UiO-66 (U6) and U6-NH2 (U6N) and two covalent organic polymers (COPs) with amine-functionality, CBAP-1-EDA (CE) and CBAP-1-DETA (CD). U6N exhibited the highest removal capacity of 93% (0.56 mg g-1) of the tested materials [e.g., CE (81.1%, 0.53 mg g-1) > CD (67.2%, 0.43 mg g-1) > U6 (66.9%, 0.42 mg g-1)], which was 2 times higher than that of the reference sorbent, activated carbon (AC: 50%, 0.30 mg g-1). The results of Fourier transform infrared and powder X-ray diffraction analyses confirmed the interactions between FA molecules and the amine components of the materials (U6N, CD, and CE). According to density functional theory calculations, the formation of hydrogen bonds between FA molecules and amine components was apparent and was further verified by FA/amine distance (CD: 2.83, CE: 2.88, and U6N: 2.66 \u00c5) along with enthalpy values (CD: -32.4, CE: -45.5, and U6N: -272 kJ mol-1). In case of U6, the major interactions occurred in the metal-clusters (-19.3 kJ mol-1) via electrostatic interactions (distance: 5.49 \u00c5). Furthermore, the sorption by amine-functionalized materials such as U6N is suggested to be dominated by hydrogen bonding which ultimately led to the formation of imine. If the performance of the tested materials is evaluated in terms of partition coefficient, U6N (1153 mg g-1 mM-1) is found as the outperformer in all tested subjects. Regeneration of spent MOFs/COPs was also plausible in the presence of ethanol to maintain their structural integrity even after 10 adsorption-desorption cycles. Overall, the selected MOFs/COPs were seen to have very high removal capacity for hazardous FA molecules in aqueous phase.\n\nTGA curve of U6 (Figure S3a; blue curve) showed two weight-loss steps. An initial solvent and water weight loss of ca. 20% was detected in the broad initial temperature range of 100-300 \u00b0C. The second weight-loss step of ca. 30% was observed in the temperature range of 500-600 \u00b0C, which can be ascribed to the decomposition of organic linkers. However, the TGA pattern of U6N (Figure S3a; red curve) was characterized by a relatively slow weight-loss process. Except for the water or solvent lost, the U6N MOFs did not exhibit any substantial weight loss patterns until 350 \u00b0C. Likewise, two COPs materials (CE and CD) exhibited similar weight-loss steps throughout the TGA measurements (Figure S3b). Both COPs showed evaporation of solvent and water molecules around 100 \u00b0C, and the majority of the weight-loss took place between 350 and 500 \u00b0C due to decomposition/network collapse. \n\nThe BET surface area and pore volume of U6/U6N were 1328/963 m2 g-1 and 0.79/0.58 cm3 g-1, respectively (Table S3). In the case of COPs, CE (674 m2 g-1 and 0.23 cm3 g-1) showed higher BET surface area and pore volume than CD (667 m2 g-1 and 0.32 cm3 g-1). In addition, it should be noted that the pore sizes of all four synthesized materials were similar. For instance, the adsorption average pore diameter (4V/A) of U6, U6N, CD, and CE was 1.56, 1.55, 1.90, and 1.69 nm, respectively. More specifically, the two selected MOFs followed the type I adsorption isotherm, indicating the microporous nature of the MOFs. In the type I model, the rate limiting step for sorption of guest molecules on these MOFs should be based on micropore volume rather than surface area. In short, adsorption in the MOFs was mainly monolayer adsorption. In contrast, although COPs followed the type I isotherm pattern, the adsorption track was different from that of desorption at an increased P/P 0 value (Figure S6). This result clearly indicates the heterogeneity of the pores, that is, a mixture of micro- and mesopores. In this case, at a relatively high P/P 0 value, the rate limiting factor for adsorption was capillary condensation rather than the pore filling phenomenon.\n\nFA Adsorption Studies\n\nThe adsorption performance of four porous materials tested in this study [i.e., two MOFs (U6, U6N) and two COPs (CE, CD)] was explored for aqueous FA in reference to AC. The RE (%) and adsorption capacity (mg g-1) of adsorbents are compared and presented in  and . The maximum adsorption capacity values of U6 and U6N were 0.42 and 0.56 mg g-1, respectively, while their RE values were 67 and 94%. In the case of COPs, the corresponding RE [adsorption capacity (mg g-1)] values of CE and CD were 81% (0.53) and 67% (0.43), respectively. The results indicated that the RE of FA by U6N was higher than those of U6 and CD by almost 1.4 times and was 1.8 times higher than that of AC. Overall, the sequence of adsorption capacities of the various porous materials tested for FA sorption was in the order of U6N > CE > CD > U6 > AC. Thus, it was suggested that the amine-functionalized materials U6N and CE (functionalized with EDA) showed enhanced FA removal over their counterparts. In contrast, the considerable reduction in sorption capacity of amine-functionalized CD toward FA suggests that, apart from the influence of -NH2, there should be other factors, such as steric hindrance (because of the longer side chain) and pore properties, that play an important role in determining the sorption performance of MOFs and COPs. In order to clearly understand the sorption mechanism of the selected sorbents, the acquired kinetic data were fitted to various kinetic models.\n\nResults of Kinetic Modeling Studies\n\nThe results obtained from various kinetic models are summarized in  and Figure S7. From the results, a pseudo-second-order kinetic model was found to show the best fit with a correlation coefficient (R 2) value <0.998. In addition, the predicted q e value from the pseudo-second-order kinetic model was almost equal to the experimentally derived maximum adsorption capacity values (). For instance, the estimated q e (mg g-1) values for U6N, U6, CE, and CD were 0.57, 0.43, 0.54, and 0.44 mg g-1, respectively, which were similar to the obtained q exp values of 0.56, 0.42, 0.53, and 0.43. In addition, the rate constant (k 2) value of U6N (3.13 g mg-1 h-1) was higher than that of others, which represents the effectiveness of the amine functionalization of the framework. In contrast, the decrease in rate constant value of another amine-functionalized COP (CD: 1.33 g mg-1 h-1) should be ascribable to the rigidity of the aliphatic chains of DETA. In summary, an increase in chain length of COPs could reduce the probability of interaction between the -NH2 group of COPs with the oxygen group of FA. \n\nAlthough the observed equilibrium capacities of U6 (0.43 mg g-1) and CD (0.44 mg g-1) were comparable to each other, the predicted k 2 value was higher in U6 (1.90 g mg-1 h-1) than in CD (1.33 g mg-1 h-1). This discrepancy between the k2 values of U6 and CD could be explained based on their removal efficiencies with respect to the time/loading rate. As shown in , U6 showed faster adsorption kinetics even at the initial time of the adsorption (3 h). This might be possible because of its larger available surface area (1328 m2 g-1) along with its extended pore volume (0.79 cm3 g-1). On the other hand, the active sites on the surface of U6N gradually decreased as time passed, which stabilized the sorption capacity at higher loading conditions (6 and 48 h). In contrast, the sorption behavior of CD was mainly dependent on -NH2 functionalization. The rigidity of the longer aliphatic side chain slowed the interaction of FA with the -NH2 groups of CD at lower loading conditions. However, at a higher loading of FA, the formation of hydrogen bond should have taken place on the surface of CD. Thus, hydrogen bond formation appeared to help enhance the RE of CD at higher loading conditions (3 and 6 h: 35.6 and 60.8%, respectively). On the basis of a study by Xiao et al., it was not possible to predict this kind of time dependent change in adsorption capacities from the pseudo second order kinetic model; thus, we concluded that U6 was able to rapidly remove aqueous phase FA even at a shorter contact (3 h) time than CD. For example, CD required at least 2 times longer contact time (i.e., 6 h: 60.8%) to reach the RE of U6 at 3 h (55.4 mg g-1).\n\nFurthermore, the C values obtained from the intraparticle diffusion model for U6N, U6, CE, and CD were 0.068, 0.003, 0.019, and 0.012, respectively. It should be noted that, in the intraparticle diffusion model plot, the initial portion of the q  t  versus t 1/2 plot was attributed to the liquid film mass transfer, while the linear portion was associated with intraparticle diffusion. This smaller deviation of C with respect to the origin indicated the boundary layer effect, that is, the greater the C value, the larger the boundary layer effect. Accordingly, the higher C values of U6N (0.068) and CE (0.019) indicated the greater contribution from the surface sorption phenomenon. This result was in accordance with the corresponding K ID values of 0.20 and 0.19 mg/g/h0.5. Similarly, the lower C value of U6 (0.003) compared to CD (0.012) confirmed that the slower mass transfer of U6 should have taken place at a higher loading rate (linear portion). This result was also in accordance with the higher \u03b1 (initial adsorption rate) value of U6 (0.65 mg g-1 min-1) than of CD (0.59 mg g-1 min-1). Apparently, all of the selected models were useful to meaningfully predict the adsorption kinetics of FA. Nonetheless, among all of those models, the one based on the pseudo-second order was found to have the best fit (>R 2 = 0.995). Thus, adsorption of FA on the selected material should be based on the chemical bond formation between the adsorbent and adsorbate.\n\nAccordingly, the q max values for U6N and U6 derived using the Langmuir model were 0.75 and 0.56 mg g-1, respectively. However, the q max values for CD and CE were 1.80 and 1.26 mg g-1, respectively. These values were almost 3.3 and 2.9 times larger than the experimentally calculated q e values. On the other hand, the estimated R L values for CE (0.17) and CD (0.39) were larger than those for U6 (0.14) and U6N (0.04). This comparison confirmed that the monolayer adsorption of FA on U6N was highly spontaneous and more favorable than other materials (R L < 1). This result was also verified with the obtained 1/n values from the Freundlich isotherm. For instance, the calculated 1/n values of U6N (0.25), U6 (0.41), CE (0.58), and CD (0.65) were between 0 and 1 (1/n \u226a 1). On the other hand, their calculated E values from the Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm model were 10000, 7071, 7071, and 5000 kJ mol-1, respectively. In this study, the E value represents the transfer of free energy for 1 mol of solute from the solution to the adsorbent's surface. An E value >8 kJ mol-1 indicates that chemisorption was the predominant mechanism in accordance with the kinetic studies. In contrast, the values of B from the Temkin isotherm were in the range of 0.09, 0.11, 0.31, and 0.34 kJ mol-1, respectively (except for U6, the R 2 values for this model were satisfactory). As such, this indicated that physisorption was also responsible for the adsorption of FA on MOFs and COPs. Overall, according to the isotherm model, adsorption of FA on the selected solid sorbent was accompanied by both physisorption and chemisorption."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['etc', 'decomposition_temperature', 'surface_area', 'pore_volume', 'pore_diameter', 'gas_adsorption']"}]}

It should be noted that, although a fairly large number of studies are available on the adsorption of FA in gas phase, only a limited number of studies were conducted on the sorption of FA in aqueous phase. In light of this limitation in the database, we narrowed our discussion with recognition of this constraint. The common traditional adsorbent of untreated AC (U-AC) was treated and modified with amino groups (N1-AC and N2-AC). The equilibrium (after 72 h) sorption capacities of N1-AC, N2-AC, and U-AC were 0.14, 0.2, and 0.13 mg g-1, respectively. The enhanced adsorption capacity of novel materials (MOFs/COPs) over that of AC clearly indicated the effectiveness of amine functionalization. Nonetheless, we obtained 0.56 mg g-1 of FA adsorption on U6N with shorter equilibration time (6 h). Accordingly, the superiority of MOFs over traditional sorbents in FA removal can be confirmed. Recently, Afkhami et al. reported that alumina nanoparticles coated with DNPH could be used as a sorbent for removal of FA from water. At an initial FA concentration of 250 ppm, the RE was 97% (411 mg g-1) (after 1 h). They conducted experiments at a significantly higher concentration than ours (0.2 ppm) to observe a much shorter duration of removal than that of the present study. It should be noted that DNPH has been commonly used as a capture medium for FA, because it exhibits excessive affinity toward FA. As such, the performance was studied at significantly high concentrations of FA. Likewise, a 3D nanoporous MOF [[Zn4O(C24H15N6O6)2(H2O)2]\u22c56H2O\u22c5DMF] n  (called: 1) was synthesized and used for absorptive removal of FA at an initial concentration of 100 ppm.

Considering overall water splitting for practical applications, catalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) should be performed in the same electrolyte, especially in alkaline solutions. However, designing and searching for highly active and inexpensive electrocatalysts for both OER and HER in basic media remain significant challenges. Herein, we report a facile and universal strategy for synthesizing nonprecious transition metals, binary alloys, and ternary alloys encapsulated in graphene layers by direct annealing of metal-organic frameworks. Density functional theory calculations prove that with an increase in the degree of freedom of alloys or a change in the metal proportions in FeCoNi ternary alloys, the electronic structures of materials can also be tuned intentionally by changing the number of transferred electrons between alloys and graphene. The optimal material alloys FeCo and FeCoNi exhibited remarkable catalytic performance for HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH, reaching a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at low overpotentials of 149 mV for HER and 288 mV for OER. In addition, as an overall alkaline water electrolysis, they were comparable to that of the Pt/RuO2 couple, along with long cycling stability.\n\nThe performance of catalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was explored in a 1 M KOH solution by a typical three-electrode electrochemical cell. Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) and platinum foil electrodes were used as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. As illustrated in a, we conducted linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) to assess the activities of the oxygen evolution reaction for metal, binary alloys, and ternary alloys. We also measured the performance of Ir/C (20 wt % Ir on Vulcan carbon black purchased from Premetek Co.) and RuO2 (Alfa aesar) as references. In general, all catalysts except Co had OER activity much higher than that of RuO2. Ir/C is superior to most of our alloy samples; however, the overpotential to reach 10 mA/cm2 of FeCoNi-2 is still lower than that of Ir/C, indicating the excellent OER performance of FeCoNi-2. The overpotential of ternary alloys to reach a current density of 10 mA cm-2 is lower than that of the binary alloy and pure metal, indicating that incorporating transition metal and binary alloys into ternary alloys will improve their OER activity. In addition, FeCoNi-2 exhibits the best catalytic performance (overpotential of 325 mV at 10 mA cm-2) among all ternary alloys, proving that further altering metal proportions of ternary alloys could also enhance their properties. The Tafel plot of FeCoNi-2 was recorded and compared with that of RuO2 (b). The Tafel slope of FeCoNi-2 is 60 mV dec-1, which is much lower than that of RuO2 (92 mV dec-1), showing FeCoNi-2 is a better catalyst for driving the OER process than RuO2 is at a lower overpotential. The durability of FeCoNi-2 was also assessed by measuring polarization curves after particular cyclic voltammetric (CV) sweeps as illustrated in c. The polarization curve of FeCoNi-2 after 10000 cycles retained a performance almost similar to that of the initial test, exhibiting excellent cycling stability. Moreover, from the potential values recorded at different current densities of 10 and 40 mA cm-2 before and after the test (d), FeCoNi-2 exhibits high stability, obviously superior to the durability of its RuO2 counterpart. To further prove the material is wholly alloyed, we also obtained a mixture by mechanical mixing of FeCo and CoNi with a precursor ratio that is the same as that of FeCoNi-2. As shown in Figure S8, the mixture of FeCo and CoNi also exhibits OER activity obviously inferior to that of FeCoNi-2, indicating the core of our sample is also successfully alloyed. As illustrated in enlarged a (Figure S9), a slight peak emerging around 1.4 V versus RHE might be ascribed to partial oxidation of alloys during cycling according to previous research. However, the peak intensity is relatively lower compared with those of other transition metal-based OER catalysts without the protection of a graphene layer. In addition, the oxidation peak remained almost same after the 1000th cycle, indicating further oxidation was prevented by the graphene layer. We also used the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as a reference electrode to verify the activity and stability of FeCoNi-2 as an OER catalyst, and the results were compared with those of the Ag/AgCl electrode. The difference between two electrodes of measured overpotentials to a reach current density of 10 mA cm-2 is only 5 mV as illustrated in Figure S10a. Besides, a long cycling test using the SCE also shows a similar result with the Ag/AgCl electrode: FeCoNi-2 exhibits negligible activity degradation even after the 10000th cycle, indicating the excellent stability of our catalyst (Figure S10b). The excellent activity as well as stability of FeCoNi-2 makes it a promising alternative for highly active nonprecious metal electrocatalysts for OER.\n\nUtilizing a standard three-electrode electrochemical system, we assess the catalytic activity of samples for HER in 1 M KOH. The electrocatalytic activity of 20 wt % Pt/C (Sigma-Aldrich) was also measured to make a comparison. The polarization curves of the samples are illustrated in a. Pt/C is still one of the best HER catalysts in a basic electrolyte; meanwhile, pure Co exhibited relatively poor HER activity. We chose potentials at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 as criteria for comparing activities of various catalysts. The potentials increase in the following order: Pt < FeCo < FeCoNi-1 < FeCoNi-2 < FeCoNi-3 < CoNi < FeNi < Co. Unlike the OER test results, the binary FeCo alloy exhibits the best HER catalytic activity among all nonprecious samples, reaching a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at low overpotentials of only 211 mV. Tafel plots of the FeCo alloys and Pt/C are shown in b, which are usually used to reveal the inherent reaction mechanism of HER. The Tafel plot of the FeCo catalyst shows a value of 77 mV dec-1, demonstrating that the HER process is following the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism according to previous research. We also measured OER and HER activity of our best catalysts (FeCo and FeCoNi-2) in 0.1 M KOH (Figure S11) and compared them with those measured in 1 M KOH. As shown in Figure S11, both FeCo and FeCoNi-2 exhibit inferior activity in 0.1 M KOH compared to that in 1 M KOH; this phenomenon also exists in other electrocatalysts and even for Pt/C and Ir/C. The TEM images of FeCo and FeCoNi-2 after 10000 HER and OER cycles are also provided. As shown in panels a and c of Figure S12, the electrocatalysts maintained their original morphology after cycling, and from the enlarged TEM images (Figure S12b,d), we can still see the core-shell structure, further confirming the stability of the electrocatalysts.\n\nIn the practical application of electrochemical water splitting, the catalysts were usually grown or transferred onto conductive substrates with an increased amount of loading, especially for nonprecious catalysts. Therefore, we also measured the catalytic activity of HER and OER of our materials on carbon fiber paper with a loading amount of 1.0 mg/cm2. Compared with nickel foam or carbon cloth, carbon fiber paper exhibits negligible intrinsic activity, which will weaken the influence of measurement for catalysts. As illustrated in panels a and b of , bare carbon paper exhibited negligible activity of HER and OER; however, carbon paper loaded with FeCo and FeCoNi-2 catalyst reached a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at low potentials of 149 mV for HER and 288 mV for OER, which were extremely excellent among those of nonprecious electrochemical catalysts. The comparison of HER and OER activity measured on a glassy carbon electrode and three-dimensional substrates are illustrated in Tables S7 and S8. To demonstrate the practical application of catalysts for overall water splitting, a simple water electrolyzer was measured by using FeCo on carbon paper as a cathode and FeCoNi-2 on carbon paper as an anode. As shown in c, a current density of 10 mA cm-2 could be achieved by applying a potential of 1.687 V between two electrodes, which is even smaller than that of its Pt-RuO2 counterpart (1.696 V). The simple water electrolysis exhibited vigorous gas evolution on both electrodes, as shown in the Supplementary Video at a potential of 1.7 V. In addition, the very stable current density at a high potential of 1.8 V in i-t curves (d) further demonstrated the strong stability of the alloys. Bare carbon fiber papers were also measured at 1.8 V for comparison. The negligible activity of carbon paper further proved the activity came from the catalysts. The excellent activity of the alloy catalyst, accompanied by high stability, made it a potential alternative for precious catalysts in practical water splitting."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['etc']"}]}

The E HOMO and E LUMO of COF-B surface are -9.31 eV and -0.49 eV, respectively, with E H-L energy gap of 8.82 eV, while the E HOMO and E LUMO of COF-Al surface are -9.13 eV and -0.15 eV, respectively, with E H-L energy gap of 9.28 eV. Following the interaction of the pure surfaces with drugs, the orbital densities and energy gaps are altered. The pure surfaces and complexes orbital densities are presented in . The E H-L energy gaps of BGN@COF-B and MET@COF-B are 8.29 and 7.42 eV, respectively, while the E H-L energy gaps of BGN@COF-Al and MET@COF-Al are 7.89 and 7.87 eV, respectively. The energy gaps of COF-B complexes are lower than that of pure COF-B. This is as a result of the destabilization of energies of HOMO and stabilization of the energies of the LUMO, which in turn enhance the transfer of charge from HOMO to LUMO. Nonetheless, BGN@COF-B is comparatively less conductive than that of MET@COF-B due to its high energy gap. Likewise, the energy gaps of COF-Al complexes are lower than that of pure COF-Al. This is also due to the destabilization of energies of HOMO and stabilization of the energies of the LUMO, which in turn enhance the transfer of charge from HOMO to LUMO. This result suggested that it is easy to form a chemical bond between COF-B and COF-Al and the drugs (BGN and MET). Nevertheless, MET@COF-Al is slightly more conductive than that of BGN@COF-B due to its low energy gap.\n\nThe ionization potential values are 9.31, 9.13, 8.80, 8.17, 7.88, and 7.85 eV for COF-B, COF-Al, BGN@COF-B, MET@COF-B, BGN@COF-Al, and MET@COF-Al, respectively. This result agrees with the energy values of HOMO (), which shows that the ionization potential values are directly proportional to the energies of the HOMO values. The interaction of the isolated surfaces with the drugs molecules to form complexes resulted in the destabilization of the HOMO and stabilization of LUMO in all the complexes. The electron affinity values for COF-B, COF-Al, BGN@COF-B, MET@COF-B, BGN@COF-Al, and MET@COF-Al are 0.49, -0.15, 0.51, 0.75, -0.01, and -0.02 eV, respectively. The values of electron affinities of the studied systems indicate that the complexes are more reactive than the pristine surfaces that are in line with the ionization potential and electronegativity values. The chemical hardness and softness values for COF-B, COF-Al, BGN@COF-B, MET@COF-B, BGN@COF-Al, and MET@COF-Al are 4.41, 4.64, 4.15, 3.71, 3.95, and 3.94 eV (chemical hardness) and 0.113, 0.108, 0.121, 0.135, 0.126, and 0.127 eV-1 (chemical softness), respectively. The low values of chemical softness and high values of chemical hardness point to the fact that the isolated COF surfaces and complexes formed with drugs are naturally stable.

The composite was then used as a catalyst in the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA500) in which poly(PEGMA500) could be synthesized with monomer conversion of 76.1% and M n of 45900 g/mol, stronger than that obtained when using free DhHP-6 as a catalyst. More importantly, it could efficiently overcome the drawbacks of free DhHP-6 and achieve the easy separation of DhHP-6 from the catalytic system and the elimination of iron residues in the synthesized polymer. In addition, it exhibited an enhanced recyclability with monomer conversion of 75.7% after five cycles and favorable stability during the ATRP reaction with <3.0% of DhHP-6 release within 100 h. Thus, the enzyme mimic-ZIF-8 composite developed through biomimetic mineralization can be potentially used as an effective catalyst for preparing well-defined polymers with biomedical applications.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nSynthesis and Characterization of DhHP-6@ZIF-8\n\nThrough the biomimetic mineralization approach shown in , enzyme mimic DhHP-6 could be embedded in a porous nanomaterial ZIF-8, in which Zn(OAc)2, HMeIM, and DhHP-6 were incubated with trace methanol at room temperature. The addition of trace methanol was used to facilitate the dissolution of HMeIM in water. The morphology of composite DhHP-6@ZIF-8 was characterized by SEM and TEM (). The SEM image clearly showed that DhHP-6@ZIF-8 possessed a uniform rhombic dodecahedral morphology, which was similar to that of blank ZIF-8, and the average particle size could be determined to be ca. 700 nm. The TEM image of DhHP-6@ZIF-8 also showed the same morphology, indicating that the loading of enzyme mimic DhHP-6 did not influence the morphology of ZIF-8. Meanwhile, EDS mapping of DhHP-6@ZIF-8 demonstrated the presence of a Fe signal in the composite, which provided direct evidence for the loading of enzyme mimic harboring iron porphyrin in ZIF-8 through biomimetic mineralization ( and S2). Through ICP-MS, the Fe and Zn contents in DhHP-6@ZIF-8 were measured to be 780.4 and 2.1 \u00d7 104 ppb, respectively, from which the DhHP-6 loading in ZIF-8 was calculated to be 16.8 wt %. Elemental analysis showed that the contents of C, H, and O of DhHP-6@ZIF-8 were kept at similar levels to those of me-ZIF-8 (Figure S3). In addition, the morphology of DhHP-6@ZIF-8 could be transformed to flower shape when the molar ratio of HMeIM and Zn(OAc)2 was decreased to 4:1 during biomimetic mineralization (Figure S4).\n\nTo ascertain that DhHP-6 was indeed encapsulated by a ZIF-8 crystalline shell, DhHP-6@ZIF-8 obtained through biomimetic mineralization was characterized by FT-IR and PXRD. As shown in a, the PXRD pattern of DhHP-6@ZIF-8 exhibited peaks matching well with those of simulated ZIF-8 and me-ZIF-8, suggesting that ZIF-8 frameworks were formed in the biomimetic mineralization and the structural integrity of ZIF-8 could be retained in the presence of DhHP-6. In the FT-IR spectra of DhHP-6@ZIF-8, characteristic peaks of DhHP-6 at 1640-1660 and 1510-1560 cm-1 could be clearly observed, attributing to amide I (mainly from C-O stretching mode) and II (mainly from a combination of N-H bending and C-N stretching modes) bands, respectively (b). Moreover, no new peaks and significant peak shifts were observed, implying that the encapsulation of DhHP-6 in ZIF-8 during biomimetic mineralization was executed in a self-assembly manner with no formation of covalent bonding. Composite FITC-DhHP-6@ZIF-8 was then detected by CLSM in a layer-by-layer scanning manner to trace the status of particles at different depths along the z-axis position (). Clearly, the fluorescence intensity of FITC displayed an increasing tendency from the top to middle and then decreased from the middle to bottom, which provided direct evidence for the loading of DhHP-6 in ZIF-8 during the crystal growth of porous nanomaterials. On the basis of the absorbance at 387 nm, DhHP-6 loading in ZIF-8 was calculated to be ca. 23.4 wt % with a loading efficiency of almost 100%, much higher than that for its encapsulation in other inorganic materials. \n\nFurthermore, nitrogen sorption isotherms were measured at 77 K to assess the porosity of DhHP-6@ZIF-8 (Figures S5 and S6). The isotherm of DhHP-6@ZIF-8 exhibited a type I isotherm with a narrow hysteresis loop at P/P 0 = 0.05-0.10. Meanwhile, the pore width values of DhHP-6@ZIF-8 were determined to be 10.1 and 11.6 \u00c5, which were similar to me-ZIF-8 (9.7 and 10.6 \u00c5), revealing that the DhHP-6 loading through biomimetic mineralization did not influence the pore volume or width. The phenomenon was consistent with the previous research on the encapsulation of BSA in ZIF-8, which was attributed to the formation of ZIF-8 around the biomolecules and has been considered as a typical characteristic of biomimetic mineralization. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method was then employed to measure the surface area of samples, suggesting that there were no obvious differences between the surface areas of me-ZIF-8 and DhHP-6@ZIF-8 (Figure S7 and Table S1). The phenomenon was probably caused by the coordination of the histidine imidazole group in DhHP-6 with Zn2+ during the formation of ZIF-8, thereby achieving the assembly of enzyme mimic in the ZIF-8 backbone. The strategy of biomimetic mineralization did not involve the physical adsorption or encapsulation of enzyme mimic DhHP-6 into large pores of MOFs, thus no obvious structural changes could be observed between me-ZIF-8 and DhHP-6@ZIF-8. The assumption could also be confirmed by the fact that there was no peroxidase activity detected for DhHP-6@ZIF-8, as shown in Figure S14. Notably, TGA curves also demonstrated the presence of DhHP-6 in the composite (Figure S8), in which the first weight loss (about 21.0 wt %) of the DhHP-6@ZIF-8 composite in air happened in the range of 100-150 \u00b0C could be attributed to the decomposition of enzyme mimic molecules. The ratio was consistent with the DhHP-6 loading determined through the absorbance at 387 nm (23.4 wt %), as mentioned above.\n\nProduct poly(PEGMA500) was characterized by 1H NMR. As shown in Figure S10, the characteristic chemical shifts of poly(PEGMA500) could be clearly observed at 0.86-1.01 and 1.83 ppm, attributing to protons a and b, indicating the successful proceeding of ATRP. The monomer conversion could be calculated according to the integration of two vinyl protons of the residual monomer (5.71 and 6.13 ppm) and the methyl signal of poly(PEGMA500) (3.32 ppm). The catalytic profile of the DhHP-6@ZIF-8-mediated ATRP reaction is summarized in . Whereas no ATRP occurred using me-ZIF-8 as a catalyst, DhHP-6 and DhHP-6@ZIF-8 could achieve ATRP of PEGMA500 with high monomer conversion (65.6-86.5%). Remarkably, the DhHP-6@ZIF-8-catalyzed ATRP reaction could produce higher monomer conversion and product M n values than those for free DhHP-6 under the same ratio of monomer to initiator. However, HRP@ZIF-8 obtained through biomimetic mineralization could not execute the ATRP reaction at a [monomer]/[initiator] of 62:1, with only 29.4% monomer conversion and no products obtained (entry 10 in ). For instance, poly(PEGMA500) could be obtained with a monomer conversion of 76.1% and M n of 45900 g/mol using DhHP-6@ZIF-8 as a catalyst with [monomer]/[initiator] of 62:1. The enhanced ATRP catalytic ability of DhHP-6@ZIF-8 was probably induced by the better dispersion of DhHP-6@ZIF-8 in the catalytic system, which has effectively solved the issue of DhHP-6 aggregation during the reaction. Except for this, other two reasons could account for the improved ATRP catalytic ability: (1) hydrophilic HMeIM around enzyme molecules might facilitate the access of water-soluble monomers to the active site of enzyme and (2) only peptide was involved in the formation of porous crystals during biomimetic mineralization, and iron porphyrin was mainly located on the surface of ZIF-8, which would cause a high concentration of active sites on the ZIF-8 surface and thereby produce enhanced ATRP catalytic activity. Meanwhile, the synthesized polymer possessed uniform molecular weight distribution with low polydispersity index (PDI) values (1.10-1.27). Except for PEGMA500, DhHP-6@ZIF-8 could catalyze the ATRP reaction of PEGA and NiPAAm, but no catalytic activity could be observed for monomer PDMAEMA (Table S2). To further elucidate whether the reaction was triggered from the ATRP initiator, we synthesized a macroinitiator PEO-Br (M n = 3100 g/mol, PDI = 1.06; Figure S11) and then employed it in the ATRP reaction. As shown in Figure S12, the shift of molecular weight after chain extension could be clearly observed in GPC curves, yielding a block copolymer with M n and PDI values of 13100 g/mol and 1.07, respectively. Thus, poly(PEGMA500) synthesis catalyzed by DhHP-6@ZIF-8 was performed in an ATRP manner, in which the lower oxidation state of DhHP-6 was in equilibrium with its higher oxidation state in the presence of Asc during polymerization."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['catalytic_activity', 'material_shape', 'peak_spectrum', 'decomposition_temperature', 'chemical_formula_weight']"}]}

The details of the synthesis process of the MOF compound is discussed in the Supporting Informations. The structural analysis of the MOF compound was performed by a single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) study, as shown in Figure S2. To utilize the MOFs for device fabrication, the rectangular-shaped single crystal of the MOF compound was first ground to the size of nanoparticles, and then these nanoparticles were dispersed into an ethanol solvent. For good dispersion of the MOF compound into the ethanol solution, the solution containing the MOF was stirred with a magnetic stirrer. For a morphological analysis by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image, we used the solution of dispersed MOFs. The microstructural analysis of the MOF compound was performed by SEM, as shown in Figure S3. From the SEM micrograph, we observed strong uncontrolled agglomeration behavior with random shapes in the crystalline MOF due to nanocrystal formation. Because of this uncontrolled agglomeration effect, they look like an amorphous thin film in the SEM image. The optical properties of the MOF compound were investigated by photoluminescence and absorption measurements, as shown in Figure S4a,b. The optical investigations reveal strong white light emission from the MOF compound having photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) for light emission of ~58%. The PL spectrum covers the whole visible regime indicating the broadband light emission from the MOF compound. The PL spectrum having a CIE color coordinate (0.34, 0.35), as shown in Figure S5, with color rendering index (CRI) of 88 and color correlated temperature (CRT) of 5200, clearly reveals the white-light emission from this MOF compound. The broad emission spectra of the MOF compound mainly originated from the superimposition of multiple emissions from different radiative transitions because of the charge transformations between interligand, intermetallic, and metal to the ligand or vice versa. For a more precise analysis of the broadband emission spectrum from the MOF compound, we deconvoluted the PL spectrum, which contains the different emission blocks, as shown in Figure S6a. The strong blue emission block having an emission peak centered around ~455 nm corresponds to a \u03c0-\u03c0* interligand charge transformation. For further clarification of the emission of the free ligand, the PL spectrum of the ligand was measured, as shown in Figure S6b. The other emission blocks containing the emission peaks centered around ~405, 640, and 548 nm are associated with the charge transfer between intermetallic and metal to ligand, respectively. Broad emission from the MOF compound is also possibly due to our unique synthesis by a judicious choice of strontium metal in combination with a suitable organic linker. Because of its isotropic behavior, strontium itself has several strong radiative transitions that provide the emission spectrum covering the wide wavelength. The single-layer graphene was grown on copper foil by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique and transferred on polymer PVDF. The monolayer of the synthesized CVD graphene on PVDF has been confirmed from a Raman spectroscopy study. The synthesis and Raman investigation details of graphene have been provided in the Supporting Information and Figure S7. The light-emissive self-powered vertical phototransistor was fabricated by sandwiching the MOF between graphenes on flexible substrate PVDF/PDMS as shown in the schematic of a. The details of the device fabrication procedure are provided in the  section. The corresponding SEM image of our fabricated vertical GrT/MOF/GrB/PVDF phototransistor device is shown in b. From the SEM micrograph, the estimated thickness of the MOF layer for optimized performance is ~300 nm. An optical microscope image of the top view of the actual fabricated device and a mobile photograph of the fabricated flexible device is shown in b and Figure S8, respectively. We measured the current-voltage (I-V) curve of our fabricated vertical phototransistor in the dark and under excitation from a 530 nm laser with a power density of 50 nW cm-2 on the device area of 2 mm \u00d7 300 nm, as shown in c. The nonlinear I-V curves indicate the existence of asymmetric Schottky barriers at the GrB/MOF and MOF/GrT interfaces. The mechanism responsible for asymmetric I-V curves is mainly because of the polarization effect of the ferroelectric PVDF layer below the bottom graphene, which enables one to induce polarization in the bottom graphene with respect to the top graphene and changes the density of states of GrB as compared to GrT. The optimized performance of the device was obtained by several photocurrent measurements through the thickness variation of the MOF compound, as shown in Figure S9. To investigate the induced polarization effect of the PVDF layer, we measured the I-V curves of the phototransistor device with and without a PVDF layer, as shown in Figure S10. The asymmetric Schottky junctions at different interfaces produce a strong built-in electric field, which facilitates generation of the photocurrent from this device without the application of an external electric bias. The built-in electric field produces a large depletion region, which can assist the dissociation of photogenerated excitons and the transport of electrons and holes to the electrodes. The Schottky barrier efficiently prolongs the lifetime of photogenerated excitons due to reduced recombination, which results in rapid exciton separation and their transport to the electrodes. d shows a dynamic photoresponse from our fabricated photodetector device without applications of electric bias having switched on/off under the illumination of a 530 nm laser. This clearly indicates that our fabricated device is a self-powered photodetector. The excellent self-powered photoresponse performance was confirmed through ultrahigh and ultrafast photoresponse (the photoresponsivity under 0 bias is ~1.3 \u00d7 103 A W-1 with response time of ~220 \u03bcs), reduced noise, and large detectivity. The observed self-powered photoresponse performance from our fabricated device is ~103 times higher than that of a reported similar device using silicon, versatile two-dimensional (2D) materials, and metal oxides. Such a self-powered photodetector has tremendous demand in next-generation IoT (Internet of things) technology, space exploration, and wireless environmental monitoring.\n\nThe photodetection performance of our fabricated vertical GrT/MOF/GrB/PVDF phototransistor was investigated under light illumination and application of electric bias through photoresponsivity (Rph), photocurrent gain (G), EQE, and detectivity (D*). The estimation details of all these optical parameters related to photodetection with a physical formula and their variation with illuminated light power are discussed in the Supporting Information. In order to investigate the photoresponse performance of our fabricated device, we measured the light power-dependent I-V characteristics and transient photoresponse curves, shown in a,b, respectively, under the illumination from a 530 nm laser on the device active area of 2 mm \u00d7 300 nm. This investigation indicates the generation of positive photocurrent from our fabricated vertical phototransistor device. The observed positive photoresponse from the phototransistor can be explained by the energy band diagram shown in c. The energy band is bent with a created band slope due to the mismatch between the Fermi energy of photon-absorbing MOF (-5.0 eV) and single-layer graphene (-4.6 eV). As described earlier, because of the asymmetric Schottky junction formations due to the polarization-induced effect of PVDF, the work function of GrB is higher as compared to that of GrT, which bends the energy band toward the bottom graphene, and the effective built-in electric field drives the photogenerated electrons toward the top graphene and generates a positive photocurrent. It is notable that there is the presence of asymmetry in the Schottky barriers at GrT/MOF and MOF/GrB/PVDF interfaces because of the different doping levels of the top and bottom graphene due to the utilization of the piezoelectric PVDF layer at the bottom of the GrB. It is expected that the Schottky potential of the MOF/GrB interface is higher than that of the GrT/MOF interface because of the doping effect from PVDF, which may bend the MOF layer band slope downward toward the top graphene contact, and the resultant built-in electric field drives the photogenerated electrons toward the GrT. A similar concept of the photoresponse from a GrT/MOS2/GrB heterojunction on a SiO2/Si substrate has been reported by Yu et al. for a GrT/MOS2/GrB heterojunction. In their device, the Schottky barrier height in the GrB/MoS2 contact is higher than that of the GrT/MoS2 contact, probably due to a p-type doping effect to the graphene by the substrate oxide. The variations of Rph, G, and EQE with illumination light-power density are shown in Figure S11a-c, respectively. We estimated the Rph, G, and EQE values are ~1.2 \u00d7 108 A W-1, 4.7 \u00d7 108, and 3 \u00d7 1010%, respectively, under the illumination power density of 12.7 nW cm-2 from a 530 nm laser and applied bias voltage 2 V, which are comparable with those of recently reported graphene-organometallic perovskite heterostructure phototransistors and 104 times higher than those of previously reported graphene-nanomaterials hybrid photodetectors. We measured the laser power from a 530 nm laser source by utilizing a power meter. We took into account the beam spot size in the calculation of laser power density falling into the vertical phototransistor device. We consider the maximum beam spot diameter 2 mm in our calculation to get minimum photoresponsivity. The actual laser beam spot size from the 530 nm laser source is smaller than this, which can give a higher value of photoresponsivity than our present reported results. In addition to its ultrahigh photosensitivity, our fabricated vertical phototransistor also shows ultrafast photoresponse, as shown in Figure S11d. This observed ultrahigh photoresponse from our fabricated vertical phototransistor can be explained by multiple aspects associated with our design and fabrication processes, which are provided in the Supporting Information. The estimated D* and noise equivalent power (NEP) are ~2.9 \u00d7 1015 cm Hz1/2 W-1 and 8.6 \u00d7 10-19 W, respectively. Such a high D* is 103 times higher than that of reported flexible hybrid photodetectors by using recently emerged hybrid perovskites, versatile two-dimensional materials, and similar architecture of Schottky contact-based graphene sandwich vertical photodetectors. The high detectivity is mainly attributed to the suppression of noise due to the decrease in dark current because of efficient charge separation and reduced trap-state occupancy. The estimated NEP is 103 times lower than that of the recently reported hybrid 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs)-graphene and hBN/graphene/hBN heterojunction photodetectors. Such a low NEP (NEP < pW Hz-1/2) is advantageous for the detection of low-frequency (THz) light, which has multiple applications including quantum optics, imaging, biomedicine, tomography, and security. \n\n a represents a schematic of a PVDF/GrB/MOF/GrT/PMMA vertical flexible photodetector under downward bending conditions. Because of its highly polarized unit cells and a strong concentration of \u03b2-phase having a trans-torsional distribution, PVDF possesses high piezoelectricity. Because of the different polarization effects of the piezoelectric PVDF layer below the bottom graphene under different applied mechanical strains, we investigated the device flexibility under upward and downward bending and measured the transient photoresponse characteristic curves, as shown in b. This investigation clearly reveals the different photoresponse under different bending conditions due to the induced polarization effect of PVDF, which can control the effective built-in electric field in the device. The schematic of the cross-sectional view of the device with the direction of the effective built-in electric field under different bending conditions is shown in c,d. We estimated the bending strain by using the following equation, bending      strain  ( % )  =   L - L '   L   \u00d7 100    , where L is the radius of curvature when the device is under the unbending condition, and L' is the radius of curvature under the bending condition, as shown in Figure S12. Figure S13 shows the photoresponse curve with a variation in bending diameter. The bending strain-dependent photoresponse under downward bending and upward bending conditions is shown in e,f, respectively. Evidently, the decrease of photocurrent with the enhancement of downward bending strain phenomenon is reversed for the application of upward bending strain. This interesting observation can be mainly ascribed to the induced polarization effect of the underlying PVDF layer of the bottom graphene. The application of mechanical strain electromechanically modulates not only the Schottky barrier of GrB/PVDF and GrT/MOF heterojunctions but also the Dirac point of graphene. Under downward bending strain, the electric field corresponding to the induced polarization of the PVDF layer is reversed to the built-in electric field of the GrB/MOF/GrT heterojunction, which is responsible for a decrease in photocurrent under downward bending strain. For upward bending strain, the induced piezoelectric field due to the deformation of the PVDF layer acts in the same direction as the built-in electric field of vertical GrB/MOF/GrT heterojunction, which enhances the photocurrent. More importantly, our investigation of the strain-dependent photoresponse from the flexible vertical GrT/MOF/GrB/PVDF photodetector clearly reveals that the magnitude and polarity of the photocurrent can be controlled by the induced piezoelectric field of the underlying PVDF layer, which shows an excellent potential of strain sensor performance of our designed vertical phototransistor device. The induced piezoelectric field produces different barrier heights of Schottky junctions at GrT/MOF and MOF/GrB interfaces. The sensitivity of the strain sensor in photoconduction under mechanical bending strain can be evaluated by a standard gauge factor estimation. The estimation details of the gauge factor are provided in the Supporting Information. The calculated gauge factors for upward and downward bending are ~4 and 1.2, respectively, under the application of large bending strain (66%), and they are comparable with the recently reported sensitivities (13.5 and 4.02 for compressive and tensile strain, respectively) of a piezoelectric-based graphene/GaN/PDMS strain sensor under the application of very small bending strain (0.1%)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['material_color', 'material_shape', 'crystal_size', 'etc']"}]}

At the screw speed of 180 rpm, the accomplished throughput was around 23 g/min, equivalent to almost 1.4 kg of product per hour. The obtained pale-yellow powder was washed with a small volume of MeOH and identified as UiO-66-NH2 using PXRD analysis (c). The particles in the sample are smaller than 100 nm in diameter and agglomerate to loosely bound spheres, similar to UiO-66-NH2 obtained on a 200 mg scale by LAG procedure using a laboratory mixer mill (b, left).\n\nPorosity Measurements\n\nIn addition to confirming crystallinity and topology, it is important to determine how the proposed mechanochemical procedures affect the MOF porosity. Zirconium MOFs are generally considered to be highly stable in aqueous environments, which is a basis for their potential application in remediation of chemical warfare agents and other pollutants. The surface area of UiO-66, UiO-66-NH2, MOF-801, and MOF-804 samples, prepared by LAG with water and activated by a standard procedure, shows that the proposed laboratory mechanochemical LAG procedure did not influence significantly the porosity of prepared materials (). The measured Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) areas for samples of UiO-66, UiO-66-NH2, MOF-801, and MOF-804 were 1145, 815, 540, and 755 m2/g, respectively ( and ). These results are consistent with the literature values for analogous materials synthesized solvothermally or by mechanochemical batch synthesis using LAG in the presence of MeOH additive. The hysteresis observed in the isotherm of the UiO-66 sample is most likely due to small particles (<100 nm diameter) which are compacted strongly (a), thus creating interparticle voids that may act like larger mesopores. UiO-66-NH2 prepared in a planetary mill on a 10 g scale with water additive displayed an excellent BET surface area (885 m2/g), while the sample made on a 100 g scale by TSE showed somewhat lower surface area (610 m2/g)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['material_color', 'surface_area']"}]}

The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area for PCN-224 is 2296(8) m2/g. The corresponding pore size distribution was analyzed by the nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT).\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nThe crystal structure of PCN-224 has a she topology with Im3\u0305m space group that contains three-dimensional open channels with the size of 1.9 nm. As biocompatible Zr(IV) has strong interaction with the carboxylate linker, Zr nodes provide the framework robustness and thus ensure that the drug is delivered to cancer cells stably. In addition, the porphyrinic linker in the MOF framework allows efficient PDT without aggregation in the aqueous solution. PCN-224 nanoparticles were synthesized using a synthetic method described in a previous report. Synthesized PCN-224 nanoparticles were observed to have a spherical morphology with the diameter of 100 nm by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) (a,b). Nanoparticles of this size have a higher cellular uptake ability than that of other sizes. The structure of synthesized nanoparticles was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). The experimental PXRD pattern of the MOF nanoparticles matches well with the simulated pattern (c) and still maintains crystallinity after HA coating, implying that the MOF structure remains during the synthesis process. The nanoMOF has a large Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 2296(8) m2/g by N2 adsorption studies at 77K (d, S1a). This high surface area allow drug loading in large quantities, demonstrating the potential of the PCN-224 nanoparticles as a drug delivery carrier. We investigated the loading capacity of the hydrophobic Dox in nonmodified PCN-224 through physical entrapment. The drug encapsulation mechanism is caused by noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions, allowing PCN-224 to interact more effectively with the drug molecule. As shown in Figure S2, PCN-224 showed high loading capacity ability (108%, weight ratio between Dox and nanoMOFs). The porosity of Dox-PCN was confirmed by N2 adsorption. The BET surface area of Dox-PCN is 1353(5) m2/g. Although the surface area and pore size of Dox-PCN decrease, the porosity of Dox-PCN still remains after drug loading (Figure S1c)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['surface_area', 'pore_diameter']"}]}

The TGA curve shows a weight loss of 29.0% up to about 320 \u00b0C, ascribed to the departure of two coordinated DMSO molecules. Upon further heating from 400 to 500 \u00b0C a weight loss of 45.0% was observed, which is consistent with the decomposition of the btca4- organic linkers and a collapse of the 3D structure. A residual weight of about 15% is attributed to the formation of ZnO.\n\nAnalytical Parameters and Performance\n\nThe emission spectra of the Zn-MOF sensor in the presence of various concentrations of cimetidine indicated an obvious enhancement in the emission intensity of the sensor. Upon the addition of cimetidine to the Zn-MOF suspension in the optimized experimental conditions, the fluorescence intensities gradually increased with drug concentrations (). The enhanced fluorescence intensity displayed two linear relationships at two concentration areas from 1.0 to 10.0 ng mL-1 and from 20.0 to 80.0 ng mL-1 (inset of ). The fitted linear equations would be expressed as F/F 0 = 0.0352 [Cimetidine] + 0.9611 (r 2 = 0.9922), F/F 0 = 0.012 [Cimetidine] + 1.1794 (r 2 = 0.9912), and the results show a good linear relationship.\n\nLimit of detection (3Sd/K) was calculated based on the standard deviation (Sd) of 10 times measuring of F 0 and the slope (K) of the calibration graph. The limit of quantification (10Sd/K) was also evaluated by the above assumptions. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) is 0.31 and 1.05 ng mL-1. The precision is stated as the relative standard deviation (RSD) for two concentrations of cimetidine (7 and 60 ng mL-1). Their RSD were, respectively, obtained 4.1 and 3.2% for 10 replicate measurements.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn summary, a new zinc-tetracarboxylate MOF was synthesized via in situ ligand formation by the solvothermal reaction. The synthesized MOF reveals a three-dimensional structure with open rhomboidal channels. The channels were occupied by the guest solvent molecules. The compound acts as an effective room-temperature fluorescent sensor for selective and sensitive detection of cimetidine. The fluorescence response of the sensor was enhanced in the presence of various concentrations of cimetidine (on-mode). The phenomenon was investigated by FE-SEM, DLS, and EDX mapping analyses. Based on these findings, this luminescence turn-on sensor illustrates good sensitivity and selectivity over two linear ranges of 1.0-10.0 and 20.0-80.0 ng mL-1, respectively. The LOD and LOQ are calculated to be 0.31 and 1.05 ng mL-1, respectively. Further, the proposed sensor has been successfully conducted for cimetidine detection in the human plasma, urine, commercial ampule, and tablet. The applicability of the sensor was established using the obtained good recovery percentages. Considering the simplicity of the operation methodology, the current method is recommended to be applied for typical routine analysis. This work suggests a new strategy that may open a new level of interest in MOF-based sensors for on-site and real-time analytical detection of drugs in pharmaceutical factories and medical laboratories."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['decomposition_temperature', 'selectivity', 'etc']"}]}

The CO2 adsorption capacities of the coated MOF-74 and UTSA-16 were 1.7 and 1.1 mmol/g (1 bar), respectively, which were only 28% and 29% of the powder samples. Although the experiments demonstrated that the CO2 adsorption amount was essentially unabated after cycling, it was lower than expected, corresponding to the reduction in the BET surface area and pore volume (). Lawson et al. improved the coating technique using a Torlon polymer solution to preseed the MOF powder on the monolith, obtaining MOFs loading more than 70 wt %. The heat exchanger surface with aluminum fumarate MOF coating improves the cyclic hydrothermal stability owing to its good water adsorption properties. Jeremias et al. proposed an interesting route for HKUST-1 film fabrication, where the substrate for coating was immersed in the solution required for MOF synthesis that was actively cooled, while the substrate surface was heated to the temperature for MOF crystallization. This thermal gradient method enables MOF coatings with porosity, mechanical stability, and high thermal coupling that allows for applications in heat exchangers as well as in adsorption and catalysis. Their group also grew MOF films onto the carbon hollow fibers, and the CO2 adsorption capacity of MOF-74/carbon composite was 2 mmol/g (25 \u00b0C, 1 bar), which is comparable to that of the powders. Furthermore, the CO2 adsorption kinetics was evaluated using the adsorption response time, given that the composites had faster kinetics than the powders, with the UTSA-16 composite taking only 2.6 min to reach 90% of the adsorption capacity, while the powder took 4.1 min. Another coating process improved the cycling stability of the MOFs, maintaining an adsorption capacity at 10000 water adsorption and desorption cycles with no observed degradation of the adsorption capacity of 0.26 g/g, allowing CAU-10-H to show good performance in heat pump applications. \n\nGel and Spongy Blocks\n\nThe formation of gel monolithic materials generally does not require pressure and binders, which can serve as precursors for MOFs films, and aerogels typically possess variable porosities and specific surface areas. The unconventional ZIF-8 gel material was derived by utilizing a high-concentration reaction, revealing that mechanical stimulation can lead to a reversible solution-gel conversion. Tian et al. followed a sol-gel synthesis process () to obtain a dense monomer under mild drying conditions, whereas powder was obtained when dried at higher temperatures or under a vacuum without any binders or pressure. The shaped HKUST-1 monolith has a methane capacity of 259 cm3 (standard temperature and pressure (STP)) cm-3 at 65 bar with a BET surface area of 1193 m2\u22c5g-1, making it the first qualifying adsorbent to meet the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) volumetric target for methane storage (263 cm3 (STP) cm-3), and it has a strong mechanical hardness. UiO-66 gels can also be converted to layered porous monomers as xerogels and aerogels, with surface areas and pore volumes (1459 m2\u22c5g-1, 2.09 cm3\u22c5g-1, and 1255 m2\u22c5g-1, 1.66 cm3\u22c5g-1, respectively) that far exceed that of UiO-66 powders. MIL-100(Fe) aerogel with a permanent porosity and pore volume was synthesized by Lohe et al. According to the nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms, aerogels were obtained with a single-point BET surface area of 1618 m2\u22c5g-1, which is much higher than the powdered sample value of 1183 m2\u22c5g-1. It is clear from the pore size distribution that the aerogel has a relatively wide range of micropores and mesopores distribution, with the pore volume maximum at 1.3 nm. However, the mechanical strength was not discussed in the research, which is essential for practical applications such as adsorption and catalytic processes.\n\nKim et al. fabricated MIL-100(Fe) granules with a size of 1.18-1.70 mm by adding 10% silica sol as a binder. The adsorption and desorption isotherms at 77 K showed the BET surface area of 1619 m2/g for MIL-100(Fe) granule, which is about 90% of the powders without additional reduction. In addition, the MIL-100(Fe) granules had a better SF6 adsorption capacity, and the breakthrough time is 40 min faster at 1 bar than that of commercial zeolite 13X granules, which offers greater possibilities for practical industrial applications. Moreira et al. have used 1% graphite and 99% UiO-66 powder pressed into a tablet composite (), but the BET surface area was reduced by 22% compared to that of pristine UiO-66, which is unfavorable for the gas adsorption process. In most cases, the properties of MOFs with inorganic binders are retained (), but there is still a need for extensive research on the mechanical properties and stability performance of the composite monoliths.\n\nInspired by the earlier works of printing structural adsorbents, Thakkar et al. first applied 3D printing technology to MOFs shaping and successfully printed MOF-74(Ni) and UTSA-16(Co) monoliths (1.5 cm in height and 1.5 cm in diameter). The process of fabricating MOFs monoliths using 3D printing through direct ink writing is shown in , where bentonite clay and PVA were used as the binder and plasticizer, respectively. CO2 adsorption experiments showed that the working capacities of MOF-74(Ni) and UTSA-16(Co) monoliths were 4.0 and 3.0 mmol/g, respectively, corresponding to 5.7 and 3.5 mmol/g for the powder sample. The compressive strengths of the MOF-74(Ni) and UTSA-16(Co) blocks exhibited in the mechanical tests were approximately 0.48 and 0.56 MPa, respectively. Although the mechanical strengths are lower compared to that of the ceramic architecture obtained by 3D printing, typically showing strengths on the order of 1-5 MPa, they can also be applied well in adsorption devices. Lawson et al. systematically investigated the kinetics of 3D printed MOF-74(Ni) monolith by varying parameters such as feed velocity and adsorption time and pressure. It was demonstrated that the adsorption kinetics was affected by multiple factors, and the MOF-74(Ni) monolith showed the best separation performance of CO2/H2 at low CO concentration, high pressure, low feed velocity, and short adsorption time. Bible et al. printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) metal and MOF (ZIF-8 and HKUST-1) composites using a commercial 3D printer, and the structure was retained even after immersion in water. The specific surface area of the mixture was close to the theoretically calculated specific surface area; therefore, it is reasonable that the N2 adsorption capacity was also preserved. However, the MOFs content was only 10%, and the authors proposed the necessity for improving the fabrication process to increase the MOFs content and improve the application efficiency. Another study also demonstrated the potential of 3D printed MOFs (ZIF-67) in organic dye removal applications, with an average removal rate of 97-98% for rhodamine B after 10 continuous degradation cycles. The differences in performance for 3D-printed MOFs do not merely relate to additives; they also depend heavily on the process conditions and structure of monoliths. Denayer's group printed ZIF-8 monoliths for the biobutanol recovery by layer-by-layer printing using 16.7 wt % bentonite and 16.7 wt % methylcellulose as an additive. The advanced selectivity of the block for butanol recovery was verified from dynamic breakthrough experiments."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['gas_adsorption', 'surface_area', 'pore_volume', 'etc']"}]}

MIL-53(Sc) demonstrated an essentially nonporous structure with no significant NP \u2192 LP transition, and the two xylene isotherms (mX and oX) collected for this material showed negligible adsorption (Figure S4, Supporting Information). MIL-53(Al) has the highest gravimetric oX saturation capacity (4.5 mmol/g) and the lowest transition pressure for oX uptake. MIL-53(Cr) and MIL-53(Ga) show the lowest transition pressures for pX adsorption, but the highest pX capacity is exhibited by MIL-53(Al). MIL-53(Fe) had the highest mX capacity at saturation but had the most difficulty in reaching the NP \u2192 LP transition. Even after the transition pressure was reached,  isotherm collection took an unusually long amount of time, indicating that the structure may not have fully reached the LP form.

There is no statistically significant difference between the oX/pX and the oX/mX selectivities of MIL-53(Al), the mean values of which were computed to be 5.2 and 5.1, respectively. This is in agreement with previous work on MIL-53(Al) that reports no relative pX and mX selection in this adsorbent from binary liquid-phase breakthrough experiments. However, MIL-53(Cr) and MIL-53(Ga) both show a significant mX/pX selectivity of around 1.4. The oX/EB selectivity in MIL-53(Cr) is 4.9, which is much less than MIL-53(Al), where it is around 8.

In Zhu's work, CH2Cl2 was used as exchanged solvent, which make the activated sample partly collapse and result in classical type-I N2 adsorption isotherm. By contrast, the PXRD pattern of the activated JLU-Liu33 indicates that the sample will not collapse after soaking in CH3CN for 2 days (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Meanwhile, the solvent molecules can almost be removed, which can be seen from the TGA data (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). Interestingly, as shown in , JLU-Liu33 exhibits an unusual adsorption property, which shows two steps in the adsorption branch of the isotherm. At low pressure, the material adsorbs a small amount of N2. To our surprise, up to a relative pressure of 0.06, the amount of N2 adsorption suddenly increases to a saturated uptake of 319 cm3 g-1. The desorption part of the isotherm do not trace the adsorption process, resulting in a large hysteresis loop. This peculiar phenomenon reveals that a breathing behavior happens in the process of N2 adsorption, giving rise to a significant increase in volume.\n\nOn the other side, JLU-Liu33L and JLU-Liu33H were also measured for N2 adsorption at 77 K. JLU-Liu33L exhibits three distinct steps, which are different from JLU-Liu33. It shows slight N2 uptake at low pressure. Up to a relative pressure of 0.12, the amount of N2 adsorption suddenly increases up to 110 cm3 g-1, which is much lower than that of JLU-Liu33. To our surprise, up to a relative pressure of 0.89, a second abrupt increase is observed. The maximum adsorption amount reaches to 290 cm3 g-1, which is similar to JLU-Liu33. By contrast, JLU-Liu33H does not show breathing behavior up to 1 atm. As revealed by the isotherms, the breathing behavior of JLU-Liu33 can be tuned by introducing Co ions into Zn4O clusters. In addition, to corroborate our hypothesis that the gate opening effect of the materials is caused by the removal of coordinated DMF, the crystal was soaked in CH3CN for 5 days to remove excess DMF. However, the Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FT-IR) of the sample still shows a resonance at 1665 cm-1, which can be attributed to the C\ue5fbO stretch of DMF (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information). This confirmed that some coordinated DMF cannot be removed totally after solvent exchange. The amounts of C, H, and N of the materials after solvent exchange and N2 adsorption characterization are also performed (Table S4 in the Supporting Information). The result indicates that the remaining coordinated DMF will be shifted during the N2 adsorption measurement. Upon removal of DMF, a shift between two nets may happen and result in transformation of the framework, which was indicated by the shift of the peaks and the change of their intensity in the PXRD (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). In parallel work, Jaheon Kim's group also found that, upon removal and addition of coordinated DMF, the degree of interpenetration of the framework will be changed and the material shows a dynamic behavior upon N2 adsorption. Those exhaustive parallel studies largely support our proposed mechanism. Some examples of interpenetrated MOFs that exhibit a gate opening effect are also listed in Table S5 in the Supporting Information.\n\nThe CO2 adsorption properties at 195 K were carried out to further investigate the breathing performance. Similar to the N2 adsorption isotherm, JLU-Liu33 is also found to exhibit the breathing behavior upon CO2 (a). In the first step, the adsorption amount of CO2 is ~50 cm3 g-1 at P/P 0 = 0.04, then it reached up to 205 cm3 g-1 in the second step. Similarly, the desorption part of the isotherm does not coincide with the adsorption branch, resulting in a small hysteresis loop. As shown in b, JLU-Liu33L also exhibits a dynamic response to CO2 sorption, but it shows three distinct steps, which is consistent with its N2 adsorption isotherm. The gate opening pressures of JLU-Liu33L are P/P 0 = 0.02 and 0.3. However, JLU-Liu33H exhibits a highly reversible type-I isotherm, reaching a saturated uptake of 111 cm3 g-1, which is much lower than JLU-Liu33 and JLU-Liu33L (c). The analysis data indicates that the skeleton of JLU-Liu33H will not change during the gas sorption, but the frameworks of JLU-Liu33 and JLU-Liu33L come to phase transition, which make the pores in the materials expand during the process of adsorption.\n\nIn order to calculate the isosteric heat (Q st), the CO2 adsorption isotherm of the materials were examined at 273 and 298 K. The CO2 uptake at 273 and 298 K under 1 bar for JLU-Liu33, JLU-Liu33L, and JLU-Liu33H are 32 and 20 cm3 g-1, 48 and 32 cm3 g-1, and 61 and 39 cm3 g-1, respectively (see Figure S8 and Table S6 in the Supporting Information). Furthermore, at zero loading, the Q st of JLU-Liu33, JLU-Liu33L, and JLU-Liu33H are 33.9, 35.5, and 37.8 kJ mol-1, respectively (d). All these Q st values are impressive and exceed many MOFs with Lewis basic sites (LBSs), such as JLU-Liu20 and ZTF-1, similar to that of NH2-MIL-53(Al). Such high Q st values are attributed to the narrow pores, and this character may make a contribution to molecular sieving. The above analysis data fully indicates that the adsorption amount and isosteric enthalpy values of JLU-Liu33 for CO2 will be improved with the increasing amount of Co ions in the framework. Lots of parallel examples also confirmed the fact that Co ions could make a contribution to improving the capacity of CO2 adsorption. \n\nThe CH4, C2H6, and C3H8 isotherms for the three compounds then were also measured at 273 and 298 K. The CH4 uptake at 273 and 298 K under 1 bar for JLU-Liu33, JLU-Liu33L, and JLU-Liu33H are 14 and 7 cm3 g-1, 25 and 13 cm3 g-1, and 17 and 8 cm3 g-1, respectively. The C2H6 uptake at 273 and 298 K under 1 bar for JLU-Liu33, JLU-Liu33L, and JLU-Liu33H are 41 and 33 cm3 g-1, 39 and 30 cm3 g-1, and 42 and 35 cm3 g-1, respectively. The C3H8 uptake at 273 and 298 K under 1 bar for JLU-Liu33, JLU-Liu33L, and JLU-Liu33H are 44 and 38 cm3 g-1, 42 and 31 cm3 g-1, and 43 and 31 cm3 g-1, respectively (see , as well as Figures S9 and S10 and Table S6 in the Supporting Information). The amount of CH4, C2H6, and C3H8 adsorption changed inconspicuously as the amount of Co2+ in the framework increased. Interestingly, only JLU-Liu33 shows breathing behavior upon C2H6, and its gate opening pressures are P/P 0 = 0.24 and 0.48 at 273 and 298 K, respectively (). On the other hand, all these materials show breathing behavior upon C3H8 adsorption, and the gate opening pressures of JLU-Liu33, JLU-Liu33L, and JLU-Liu33H are as follows: P/P 0 = 0.03 and 0.06; P/P 0 = 0.039 and 0.264; P/P 0 = 0.033 and 0.302 at 273 and 298 K, respectively (see , as well as Figures S10a and S10b). The above analyses also indicated that the gate opening pressures of JLU-Liu33 for C2H6 and C3H8 could be tuned through doping Co ions into the framework.\n\nTo evaluate the affinity of the interpenetrated MOFs for small molecules, the Q st of the series of JLU-Liu33 for small gases, which possess normal gas adsorption behavior (CH4 and C2H6) were calculated. The Q st of CH4 for JLU-Liu33, JLU-Liu33L, and JLU-Liu33H is 25.50, 24.05, and 26.90 kJ mol-1, respectively. The Q st of C2H6 for JLU-Liu33L and JLU-Liu33H is 36.2 and 34.6 kJ mol-1 (Figures S11 and S12 in the Supporting Information)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['gas_adsorption', 'peak_spectrum', 'etc']"}]}

The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory was used to deduce the surface area of all of the samples, the pore size distributions of ZnO@C550 and ZnO@CC/SSQDm were determined using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda method on account of their mixed macroporosity and mesoporosity, and density functional theory was employed to find the pore size distribution of the mesoporous ZnO@CC sample. ZnO@C550 has a BET surface area of 222 m2 g-1, with pore sizes distributed over around 49 and 545 nm and a pore volume of 0.352 m3 g-1. ZnO@CC has a BET surface area of 252 m2 g-1, a pore size below 20 nm, and a pore volume of 0.387 m3 g-1. ZnO@CC/SSQDm shows 231 m2 g-1, with pore sizes over around 41 and 576 nm and a pore volume of 0.366 m3 g-1. The enlarged surface area and pore volume of ZnO@CC and ZnO@CC/SSQDm indicates that the penetrated glucose in the pores larger than microsize has decomposed in hydrothermal and calcination treatment to become amorphous carbon, which contributes more pore area and volume. The total carbon contents of ZnO@C550, ZnO@CC, and ZnO@CC/SSQDm are 20, 17.4, and 14.3%, respectively, as shown in Figure S4. f displays the Raman spectra of ZnO@C550 and ZnO@CC/SSQDm. ZnO has optical phonons represented as A1, E1, 2E2, and 2B1, amongst which the A1 and E1 modes are polar modes active for both Raman and infrared, the E2 mode is nonpolar and only active for Raman, and the B1 mode is a silent mode. A1 and E1 modes split into longitudinal and transverse components, and the E2 mode comprises low-frequency phonons, E2(L), and high-frequency phonons, E2(H). The bands around 435 and 327 cm-1 (inset of f) are due to the E2(H) mode and multiphonon scattering consisting of predominant A1 and smaller E2 and E1 symmetry. The bands at 1340 and 1589 cm-1 are typical D and G modes of carbon materials, and the intensity ratio I D/I G is indicative of the fraction of the graphite structure. The I D/I G ratios of ZnO@CC/SSQDm and ZnO@C550 are 0.83 and 0.95, respectively, indicating that the degree of graphitization increases as glucose decomposes in ZnO@C550.\n\n  displays the high-resolution XPS spectra of Ag, S, and Zn of ZnO@CC/SSQDm. The spectrum of Ag 3d in a shows characteristics typical of a metal. This spectrum contains two components: one at 368.3 eV for Ag 3d5/2 and the other at 374.3 eV for Ag 3d3/2; the difference in binding energy of 6 eV results from spin-orbital effects. The orbital spin of silver metal leads to the loss of features at the higher binding energy side of each component. The intensity of the S 2p spectrum, as shown in b, is considerably weaker than that for Ag. The S 2p spectrum is consistent with the presence of ZnS and a very small amount of S in the as-prepared composite, with the absence of Ag-S confirming that all the SSQDs have been reacted to Ag nanoparticles, in agreement with the Ag 3d XPS deconvolution and XRD analysis. The S 2p3/2 of ZnS is located at 161.7 eV and that of S is at 163.8 eV. The spin-orbit of S 2p results in 1.16 eV difference between S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2. In agreement, the Zn 2p spectrum, as shown in c, displays two 2p3/2 components at 1022.1 and 1021.9 eV pointing to Zn-O and Zn-S, respectively. The spin-orbital of Zn 2p results in a pair of 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 with a difference of 23 eV in binding energy. The atomic ratio of S/Ag/Zn is 0.9:7.6:91.5 through the XPS survey of S 2p3/2, Ag 3d5/2, and Zn 2p3/2; see Figure S8. The small amount of ZnS in the composite, consistent with a sub-monolayer of ZnS on the ZnO surface, explains the absence of ZnS signals in the XRD patterns and the Raman spectra. Figure S9 shows the atom ratio of S/Ag/Zn is 2.9:7:90.1 in ZnO@CC/SSQDm; thus, the ratio of ZnS/ZnO increased from 1:90 to 1:30 when three times more SSQDs are added in the synthesis of ZnO@CC/SSQD3m. The Ag content is found to be lower than that in ZnO@CC/SSQDm, indicating the Ag particles aggregate during the sulfidation reaction, consistent with the EDX mapping."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['surface_area', 'etc']"}]}

For this purpose, the images of the CYCU-3' 50_50 material were obtained using a transmission electron microscope, and the ED data of a selected area were recorded. The crystals have long ribbon-like morphology (Figure S3), as previously observed in the corresponding SEM images (Figure S2). The 3D reciprocal lattice of CYCU-3' 50_50 was reconstructed from the ED frames (Figure S4) and used for the determination of the unit cell parameters (a = 16.35 \u00c5, b = 62.15 \u00c5, c = 6.73 \u00c5, \u03b1 = 89.7\u00b0, \u03b2 = 94.5\u00b0, and \u03b3 = 88.1\u00b0). These values showed some differences, particularly in the a-axis and \u03b2 angle, in comparison to those of pristine CYCU-3 (a = 34.067 \u00c5, b = 60.07 \u00c5, c = 6.312 \u00c5, \u03b1 = 90.0\u00b0, \u03b2 = 90.0\u00b0, and \u03b3 = 90.0\u00b0), which may suggest that CYCU-3' 50_50 is a new structure of the original MOF. Unfortunately, the CYCU-3' 50_50 structure is disordered along the b axis, as severe diffraction streaks along this direction were observed in the reconstructed 3D reciprocal lattice (Figure S4). Thus, this disorder, together with the flexible behavior of the crystals (bending, twisting, and coiling) (Figure S4a-c), avoids a direct structure solution using the CRED data. For this reason, the Pawley fit was applied to the PXRD data to confirm and refine the unit cell parameters (Figure S5). The refinement was conducted using a Pearson VII-type peak profile function, followed by the refinement of the unit cells and zero-shift. The R-value was converged to R p = 0.110, R wp = 0.0634, R exp = 0.267, and goodness of fit (GOF) = 0.237. The high R exp and low GOF values are due to the broad peaks caused by the disorder and preferred orientation. The new refined unit cell parameters (a = 16.971 \u00c5, b = 64.039 \u00c5, c = 6.694 \u00c5, \u03b1 = 90.0\u00b0, \u03b2 = 94.447\u00b0, and \u03b3 = 90\u00b0) confirmed that CYCU-3' 50_50 changes to a new structure. On the basis of these data, an average structural model for CYCU-3' 50_50 was built (Figure S6). The crystal structure is based on the corner-shared AlO6 octahedra, leading to 1D chains, as in CYCU-3. However, there are more Al chains in the unit cell of CYCU-3' 50_50 than in CYCU-3, as the a axis of the former is halved (a = 16.35 and 34.067 \u00c5, respectively). As a consequence, the CYCU-3' 50_50 framework is 61% more dense than pristine CYCU-3 (0.731 and 0.453 g/cm-3, respectively), resulting in a material with a lower Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area (see the preparation of hybrid materials for more details). In addition, the new CYCU-3' 50_50 structure has 1D channels that represent the small pores of CYCU-3. On the other hand, the disordered nature of the CYCU-3' 50_50 crystals (Figure S4) could be caused by the coordination of acetate instead of the SDC ligands to the Al centers, not only in the crystal surface but also in the inner structure, creating defects (a). This hypothesis is further supported by the elemental analysis, in which a high acetate/SDC ratio of 1.63 was found. To confirm the structural model, ED pattern simulation was applied (b). The experimental ED pattern of CYCU-3' 50_50 (b-I) was compared with the CYCU-3' 50_50 average model (b-III) and the simulated ED pattern of CYCU-3 (b-II, generated from the previously reported CYCU-3 structure). Extra diffraction rows are observed in b-I, which agrees well with the pattern from the CYCU-3' 50_50 average model (b-II), whereas the simulated ED pattern of CYCU-3 lacks these rows (b-III). This suggests that the proposed model of CYCU-3' 50_50 is correct, and it is of a different phase from the original CYCU-3. However, the high degree of disorder found in CYCU-3' 50_50 may be caused by the previously mentioned ligand defects and/or by the missing AlO6 chains.\n\nAfterward, the matrixes were activated (150 \u00b0C under vacuum for 24 h), and the TGA measurements of the desolvated materials were recorded, confirming that, in all cases, the CYCU-3 materials were free of ligands and/or solvent molecules, as no mass loss was observed up to ~350 \u00b0C (Figure S7). Regarding thermal stability, the decomposition temperature increases with particle size (ca. 351, 408, and 473 \u00b0C for CYCU-3 20_0, CYCU-3 50_5, and CYCU-3' 50_50, respectively). In addition, we evaluated the permanent porosity of these materials by measuring the nitrogen adsorption isotherms at 77 K (Figure S8). In all cases, the isotherm profiles were characteristic of the materials with both micro- and mesopores. Besides, CYCU-3 20_0 and CYCU-3 50_5 exhibited a similar BET surface areas (2225 and 2270 m2 g-1, respectively) than that previously reported for pristine CYCU-3 (2760 m2 g-1), whereas the adsorption capacity of CYCU-3' 50_50 was markedly lower (265 m2 g-1), probably because of its more dense framework compared to that of pristine CYCU-3 (see the structural studies for more details). The pore size distribution of the different porous frameworks was also determined (Figure S9).\n\nEvaluation of ALF794@CYCU-3 Hybrid Materials as Potential CORMAs\n\nTo test the potential biological application as CORMAs of ALF794@CYCU-3 50_5 and ALF794@CYCU-3' 50_50, their photoinduced CO release properties were first investigated in solution (10 mM PBS, 37 \u00b0C) by UV-vis spectroscopy using the myoglobin assay. Although both the hybrid materials released appreciable amounts of CO (0.46 and 0.24 mmol of CO per mmol of CORM, respectively, upon 24 h of irradiation with visible light, Figure S12), molybdenum leaching was also detected (94 and 25%, respectively, after 6 h of incubation with no further leaching in the next 72 h) (Table S1). The high extent of metal leaching from ALF794@CYCU-3 50_5 might be attributed to its smaller particle size, which unfortunately leads to a high degradation of the framework in PBS. In contrast, ALF794@CYCU-3' 50_50 shows a significantly lower metal leaching (25% of Mo) related to its less porous structure and larger particle size. Taking into account the latter fact, ALF794@CYCU-3' 50_50 is the only hybrid material that can be considered as a real CORMA in solution.\n\nTo further explore the ability of these hybrid systems as CORMAs, we decided to study their CO delivery properties in the solid state, envisaging their potential use for topical applications (i.e., anti-inflammatory bandages). In this context, the previously reported innovative application of photoactive CORMs for topical treatment of epidermal cancer should be highlighted. Indeed, CORM-2, [Ru2Cl4(CO)6], lotions were shown to reduce the acute and chronic inflammation and tumor multiplicity in hairless mice with induced photocarcinogenesis. Thus, an in-line CO detector was customized to measure the CO released from the ALF794@CYCU-3 50_5 and ALF794@CYCU-3' 50_50 solid matrixes (Figure S13). In particular, both hybrid materials were spin-coated and irradiated at 250-385 nm with 50 mW cm-2 of light power to promote the CO release. The delivered CO was transferred using N2 as the carrier gas to the in-line detector. The CO release efficiencies of the ALF794-loaded materials were compared to that of free CORM (). Thus, pristine ALF794 behaves also as a photoCORM in the solid state, releasing 0.42 mmol of CO per mmol of CORM after 220 min (photo-releasing efficiency: 42%). In addition, both hybrid materials retain the photoactive properties of the molybdenum tricarbonyl complex, showing an average CO delivery of 0.44 and 0.35 mmol of CO per mmol of CORM (44 and 35% of CO release efficiency) for ALF794@CYCU-3 50_5 and ALF794@CYCU-3' 50_50, respectively."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['material_shape', 'lattice_parameters', 'density', 'surface_area', 'porosity', 'decomposition_temperature', 'gas_adsorption', 'etc']"}]}

Herein, employing a different sulfurization process, well-aligned NiCo2S4 and CoS2 nanoarrays with a hollow/porous configuration derived from pentagon-like ZIF-67 are successfully designed and constructed on Ni foam. The hollow/porous structure grown on a conductive matrix can significantly improve electroactive sites, shorten charge/ion diffusion length, and enhance mass/electron transfer. Consequently, the obtained NiCo2S4 possesses an excellent specific capacitance of 939 C/g, a fast charge/discharge rate, and a favorable life span. An advanced asymmetrical supercapacitor is fabricated by engaging NiCo2S4 and CoS2 as cathode and anode materials, respectively, with a well-separated potential window. The obtained device delivers an exceptional energy density of 55.8 W h/kg at 695.2 W/kg, which is highly considerable to the recent transition metal sulfide-based devices. This facile tactic could be employed to construct other electrode materials with superior electrochemical properties.\n\n a discloses the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared NiCo2S4, NiCo-LDHs, and ZIF-67. The three strong peaks situated at 44.3, 51.7, and 76.4\u00b0 could be ascribed to the metallic nickel substrate (JCPDS card no. 65-2865). Besides the peaks originating from the nickel substrate, a series of peaks of ZIF-67 are observed. After the crystallization process between ZIF-67 and Ni(NO3)2, the typical peaks of ZIF-67 vanish for the as-prepared products with the emergence of a series of new peaks, pointing the change of crystal structure for ZIF-67. After the sulfurization process, a series of peaks emerge at 16.1, 22, 31.8, 38.2, 47.2, and 55\u00b0, which coincide well with the (111), (220), (400), (422), (511), and (440) planes, signifying the formation of NiCo2S4. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum of these three electrodes is illustrated in b, and the peaks between 600 and 1500 cm-1 are attributed to the imidazole ring in ZIF-67. Moreover, the peak located at 2929 cm-1 is ascribed to the aromatic nucleus in 2-methylimidazole, which confirms the successful preparation of ZIF-67. After the sulfurization treatment, the typical peaks disappear for the as-prepared products, which further confirm the successful change of crystal structure. Nitrogen isothermal adsorption/desorption test is implemented to analyze the textural properties of NiCo2S4. A model of IV isotherm and H3 hysteresis loop can be seen from c. The hysteresis at a relatively higher pressure (P/P 0 > 0.4) reveals the typical characteristic of the mesoporous structure. Furthermore, the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda curve further manifests the existence of the mesoporous structure (d). Besides, the specific surface area of NiCo2S4 is estimated to be 79.3 m2/g. The unique hollow/mesoporous structure could provide continuous ion diffusion pathways.\n\n c indicates the galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) profiles of NiCo2S4 at different current densities. The obvious potential platform further confirms the subscription from the Faradaic redox process. Besides, these curves are substantially symmetrical, which reflects that NiCo2S4 possesses a favorable reversibility. Furthermore, Figure S1 shows the CV profiles of ZIF-67, NiCo-LDHs, and NiCo2S4 at the same scan rate, and it shows that NiCo2S4 possesses a much enhanced capacitance with respect to the other samples. Such a notably enhanced electrochemical performance is also proved through the GCD profiles. For comparison, the specific capacitances of these three products against different current densities are plotted in d. The NiCo2S4 electrode exhibits a superior specific capacitance of 939 C/g at 1 A/g and still retains 712 C/g at 10 A/g (about 75.8% capacitance retention). Besides, NiCo2S4 possesses a high areal capacitance of 2.5 C/cm2 at 1 mA/cm2 (e). Obviously, the specific capacitance and areal capacitance of NiCo2S4 are quite competitive to that of the previously recorded NiCo2S4-based composites in  and Table S1. Such a superior electrochemical behavior benefits from their desirable porous/hollow nanostructures. In particular, the inner hollow configuration and the mesoporous structure could offer more reactive sites and larger electrode/electrolyte interfaces.\n\nIn addition, the unique structure also performs well in promoting the transport of ions/electrons. As confirmed in f, the charge-transfer resistance (R ct) values of ZIF-67, NiCo-LDHs, and NiCo2S4 are 0.38, 1.09, and 0.12 \u03a9, respectively, which imply that NiCo2S4 possesses an enhanced conductivity and a rapid charge transfer. In addition, the internal resistance values of each of them are 0.58, 0.56, and 0.37 \u03a9, respectively. To validate the cycling stability of NiCo2S4, continuous GCD tests are investigated at a current density of 10 A/g (Figure S2). An outstanding life span has been manifested by NiCo2S4, that is, only 7.2% capacitance decay is witnessed after 5000 consecutive cycles. The excellent cycling stability might be attributed to the void space that figures as an ion-buffering reservoir for the electrolyte ions, shortening the ion/electron diffusion path and buffering the structural expansion and contraction during the charge/discharge cycles.\n\nThe electrochemical properties of CoS2 are shown in . The CV profiles at various scan rates reveal distinct redox peaks, reflecting its characteristic pseudocapacitive feature (a). The pseudocapacitance originates from the electron transfer course among the Co2+/Co3+/Co4+ redox couples. The relatively symmetrical GCD curves demonstrate a relatively high Coulombic efficiency by reason of the high reversibility of the Faradaic redox process during the charge/discharge course (b). The maximum specific capacitance calculated from the GCD plots is 343.5 C/g at 1 A/g. In addition, it possesses 146.3 C/g at 20 A/g with a superior rate capacity of 45.2% (c), and the areal capacitances of CoS2 at various current densities are displayed in Figure S5. From the Nyquist plots in d, the intersection at real axis indicates a low internal resistance. Besides, the small semidiameter at the high-frequency region demonstrates the facile charge-transfer process at the electrode/electrolyte interface.\n\nNonlinear GCD profiles further confirm the subscription from the Faradaic redox process (c). The maximum specific capacity achieved with this device is 287 C/g at 1 A/g. The correlation between the critical parameters, energy and power density, is depicted in d. Remarkably, the highest energy density of the obtained device could reach up to 55.8 W h/kg at a power density of 695.2 W/kg; even at an ultrahigh power density of 6788.6 W/kg, the energy density could still be maintained at 23.8 W h/kg. The activity of our devices is fairly considerable to the recently reported TMS-based devices, such as NiCo2S4@Ni3V2O8//AC, NiCo2S4/CT//AC, NiCo2S4//AC, NiCo2S4@CNFs//AC@pCNFs, NiCo2S4@Co(OH)2, NiCo2S4/Co9S8//AC, NiCo2S4//AC, and NiCo2S4@NiO//AC, indicating the excellent pseudocapacitive properties of NiCo2S4 and CoS2.\n\nMoreover,  illustrates the capacitance retention of the asymmetrical device upon operating consecutive GCD cycles. More interestingly, an approving capacitance retention behavior of 91.9% over 5000 consecutive cycles at 10 A/g is witnessed. The feature of NiCo2S4 and CoS2 after the cycling test is further investigated (Figure S6). Obviously, the nanoarrays and pentagon-like morphology of NiCo2S4 and CoS2 are well-preserved even after cycling. The excellent cycling behavior of the asymmetrical supercapacitor NiCo2S4//CoS2 reveals that the electrode materials can maintain good mechanical integrality and high electrochemical stability.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn summary, the pentagon-like ZIF-67 nanoarrays have been directly assembled on Ni foam, and via different sulfurized treatments, they can be transformed into NiCo2S4 and CoS2, suitable as a cathode and an anode, respectively, in an advanced asymmetrical supercapacitor. Owing to the highly hollow/porous configuration and their direct contact with a conductive matrix, the obtained NiCo2S4 delivers a superior specific capacity of 939 C/g, which is quite competitive to that of the previously recorded NiCo2S4-based composites. The asymmetrical supercapacitor achieved by NiCo2S4 and CoS2 shows a favorable energy density of 55.8 W h/kg. Therefore, this versatile method to prepare TMS-based materials would open up vast opportunities for energy storage applications."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['etc', 'peak_spectrum']"}]}

In this work, we introduce thin films of nanosized metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as atomically defined and nanoscopic materials that function as catalysts for the efficient and selective reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide in aqueous electrolytes. Detailed examination of a cobalt-porphyrin MOF, Al2(OH)2TCPP-Co (TCPP-H2 = 4,4',4\",4\u2034-(porphyrin-5,10,15,20-tetrayl)tetrabenzoate) revealed a selectivity for CO production in excess of 76% and stability over 7 h with a per-site turnover number (TON) of 1400. In situ spectroelectrochemical measurements provided insights into the cobalt oxidation state during the course of reaction and showed that the majority of catalytic centers in this MOF are redox-accessible where Co(II) is reduced to Co(I) during catalysis.\n\nBalancing reactant diffusion and charge transport is essential for electrochemical catalysis. To this end, the thickness of the MOF catalyst film was tuned to optimize the performance of the MOF catalyst by varying the starting ALD alumina layer thickness from 0.5 to 10 nm (D). Upon testing a carbon disk electrode with only 5 layers (0.5 nm) of ALD precursor converted to the MOF, resulting in an ~10 nm thick MOF layer, we observed a twofold increase in the catalytic current density (measured at -0.57 V vs RHE at a sweep rate of 100 mV/s) relative to that of the bare carbon disk substrate. The performance of the MOF catalyst increased with increasing active-site loading until reaching a maximum at 50 ALD cycles (MOF thickness of ~30-70 nm). Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission absorption (ICP-AES) was utilized to quantify the total cobalt loading on this sample and indicated an upper limit of 6.1 \u00d7 1016 cobalt atoms (1.1 \u00d7 10-7 mol) per square centimeter. The performance decrease observed for higher active-site loading is likely due to charge-transport limitations from the electrode to the MOF periphery or impedance through a thin insulating alumina layer not fully converted to the MOF. This result highlights the strength of our ALD-based MOF conversion technique, which allows nanometer precision of catalyst loading to balance active-site density with mass/charge transfer.\n\nComprehensive product analysis using gas chromatography (GC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was carried out to reveal the nature of the chemical processes occurring within our MOF catalysts (Figure S7). As illustrated in E, the two main products measured were CO and H2, with current selectivity for CO reaching up to 76% at -0.7 V vs RHE. The average steady-state current density from these measurements is displayed in F. In contrast, the unmetalated MOF produces primarily H2 (Figure S8). When plotting the partial current density for CO production on a logarithmic scale versus the thermodynamic overpotential (G), we obtain a Tafel slope of 165 mV/decade in the low-overpotential region, which points to a one-electron reduction of CO2 to form the CO2 \u22c5 radical as a probable rate-limiting step, though the reaction is likely to be at least in part diffusion-limited. However, the exact nature of the rate-limiting step is difficult to determine from the Tafel slope alone, especially in a more complicated system such as ours. For comparison, studies of porphyrin homogeneous catalysts have measured Tafel slopes ranging from 100 to 300 mV/decade; thus, the rate-limiting step and mechanism may depend on more than just the active site itself. We stress that this is the first incarnation of our MOF electrocatalyst, and efforts are being undertaken to further exploit the modular nature of such systems for the next generation of catalyst.\n\nThe stability of the MOF catalyst was next tested over an extended period of time. In controlled potential electrolysis at -0.7 V vs RHE in CO2-saturated aqueous bicarbonate buffer, the current density reached a stable state after several minutes and subsequently showed no sign of decrease for up to 7 h, generating 16 mL of CO (0.71 mmol, 5.25 cm2 substrate; A, S8, and S9). The lower limit of the TON of the MOF catalyst is quantified through ICP analysis of the electrode after testing and is determined to be 1400 assuming every cobalt atom is an electrochemically active site (turnover frequency (TOF) ~ 200 h-1). The MOF largely retains its crystallinity after electrolysis, and preservation of the framework was evidenced through the retention of the major powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks (B). Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis reveals that the platelike morphology has been retained (C,D). In situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) was utilized to confirm the integrity of the organic units throughout the catalytic process (Figure S11). At each applied potential, the primary SERS peaks attributed to the porphyrin linker remain in the SERS spectrum."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['catalytic_activity', 'selectivity', 'etc']"}]}

For example, a recent report demonstrated the use of in situ spectroelectrochemical and electroanalytical techniques to interrogate the influence of defect sites within the Ni-MOF-74 structure on a model electrochemical hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). In situ Raman and attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) spectroelectrochemical techniques showed that defects in the Ni-MOF-74 structure were systematically incorporated by modulating the ratio of linkers containing the absence of free hydroxyl functionalities capable of binding to nearby Ni sites. Additionally, ex situ spectroscopic techniques were able to identify signals corresponding to the presence of highly electron dense NiO4 defect sites in XPS, while Raman spectroscopic measurements were able to further corroborate this by identifying shifts in the Ni-O bands. The defect-rich Ni-MOF-74 converted HMF to FDCA at a 95% yield with an 80% Faradaic efficiency. Moreover, the difference in the Tafel slopes for HMF oxidation between the defect-rich Ni-MOF-74 (160 mV/decade) and defect-free Ni-MOF-74 (300 mV/decade) reveals the influence of Ni coordination defects on the electrocatalytic activity of the defective material. Here, the systematic integration of defect sites enabled investigations into the reaction mechanism, which showed that an adsorbed *OH could abstract protons from adsorbed HMF intermediates on adjacent exposed Ni nodes and push the reaction toward FDCA formation. While this indicates that defective Ni-MOF-74 shows promise as a viable electrocatalyst for HMF oxidation to FDCA, additional investigations should focus toward maintaining a similar level of performance under larger, more industrially relevant current densities than those reported here (~1-20 mA/cm2).\n\nDefects can also be produced post-synthetically, as exemplified in a report that showed that photoirradiation of a bimetallic NiFe node MOF (with 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid ligands) can induce lattice strain and systematically increase the fringe lattice parameter from 1.16 nm in the pristine MOF to 1.18, 1.20, and 1.21 nm. The lattice-strained NiFe MOF demonstrated specific activities of 500 A/gmetal at a half-wave potential of 0.83 V for the ORR, which outperformed the benchmark Pt/C specific activity of 262 A/gmetal at 0.83 V. Similarly, the lattice-strained MOF demonstrated a 2000 A/gmetal at 0.30 V overpotential for the OER, which outperformed benchmark RuO2 OER catalysts by 2 orders of magnitude (~17 A/gmetal at 300 mV overpotential). Notably, the electrocatalytic OER and ORR experiments showed stable current densities of 200 mA/cm2 and -100 mA/cm2 with near unity Faradaic efficiencies for both reactions across an operational lifetime of 200 h. The corresponding benchmark materials (RuO2 for OER and Pt/C for ORR) both showed a 50% decrease in current density over the same operational lifetime, indicating that the strain-defect-containing MOFs exhibit both increased activity and stability over corresponding benchmark materials. The increase in electrocatalytic performance of the defect-strained MOFs was suggested to derive from the strain-induced Ni 3d-O 2p hybridization in the valence band, which promoted electron transfer from the N 3d band into the O 2p band and enabled favorable binding of oxo species to more electron-deficient Ni sites. Mechanistic insights using synchrotron radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed a band at ~1050 cm-1 that was observed for both ORR and OER applications, which the authors assigned to adsorbed superoxide *OOH intermediate present in both OER and ORR proposed mechanisms.\n\nWhile MOFs can be used and manipulated as electrocatalysts, similar tunings in electrocatalyst performance can be achieved by using a MOF as a non-catalytic layered component over a more traditional electrocatalyst. A proof-of-concept example of this process incorporated thin layers of UiO-66(Zr) MOFs over Ag electrocatalyst surfaces for CO2 reduction. UiO-66-layered Ag electrodes showed an improved Faradaic efficiency for CO production (FECO = 79%) compared to the bare Ag electrode (FECO = 43%) at -0.8 V vs RHE, despite similarities in the electrochemically active surface area between the two electrodes. These results suggested that the MOF overlayer could enhance the CO2 reduction activity through three mechanistic routes: (i) enhancing CO2 reduction activities by increasing local CO2 concentrations via increased mass transfer through MOF pores, (ii) second coordination sphere hydrogen-bonding stabilization between MOF acid sites and adsorbed *COO- intermediates, and (iii) ion functionalization for controllable proton delivery. To decouple the effects of second coordination sphere acid site stabilization from the effects of mass transport, OH groups on Zr6O4(OH)4 node components were titrated using benzoic acid. This modified overlayer showed a decrease in FECO to ~60%, suggesting that, while limiting mass transport can improve the FECO of the MOF-overlayered Ag electrodes, the additional effect of proton stabilization for pendant OH groups on Lewis acid sites can further stabilize CO2 reduction intermediates. Further enhancements were achieved through the incorporation of 3-(carboxypropyl)trimethylammonium (TMA) into the MOF overlayer backbone, resulting in a semipermeable ion-selective membrane that showed an improved FECO (90%) compared to the non-functionalized MOF membrane at 79% and the bare Ag electrode at 49%. This utilization and systematic evaluation of UiO-66(Zr) as a model overlayer to enhance electrochemical CO2 reduction demonstrates the utility of MOFs as tandem materials that can indirectly enhance catalysis on catalytically active surfaces; however, the translational utility of this strategy will require a demonstration of electrocatalytic activity at partial current densities above ~-1.0 mA/cm2."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['etc']"}]}

Indicators of cation-complexed imides (e.g., IR peak near 1000 cm-1 and 13C chemical shift at 168 ppm) were much stronger for KPHI than for CaPHI. XPS quantification showed cation:N ratios of 0.64 for KPHI but only 0.02 for CaPHI. This discrepancy is much too large to be explained by charge-balance alone, so a large proportion of the imide-complexed Ca2+ cations were likely displaced by protons during water washing. Additionally, as XPS is a surface sensitive technique, the cation concentration in the top few nanometers of the PHI particles could have been much smaller than the bulk. To more closely investigate the cation content of the bulk PHI frameworks, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was employed, and the results are summarized in SI Table S2. These studies suggested that KPHI exhibited around 17 wt % K+, implying a charge-balanced structural formula close to (C12N17)3K6H3. On the other hand, CaPHI exhibited only 6.4 wt % Ca2+, suggesting a formula of (C12N17)3Ca2H5. This difference in extent of proton exchange could have been caused by changes in the pH of the washing solution upon salt removal or slight changes in the pK a of the resulting polymeric backbones. Further investigation of the acid-base characteristics of these PHI materials was achieved via potentiometric titration experiments, and discussion can be found in the SI.\n\nThese differences in crystal structure, despite chemical similarity of the backbone, are likely related to the difference in ionic radius (152 pm for K+ vs 114 pm for Ca2+), more than doubled charge to radius ratio, valence, and resulting Lewis acidity of the framework-complexed cations. While K+ ions interact predominantly with a single layer of the sheet-like PHI, the much more polarizing Ca2+ ions interact with as many as three PHI sheets, acting as bridging moieties. This heightened interaction of the Ca2+ sites with Lewis base sites on neighboring PHI sheets is present during structure assembly. To accommodate this difference in the templating cation, the crystal structure flexes in the ab plane and expands slightly along the c-axis as evident by the shift of the 002 peak in b from ~28.3\u00b0 to ~27.9\u00b0, corresponding to d-spacings of 3.14 and 3.19 \u00c5 in H+/KPHI to H+/CaPHI, respectively. Scherrer analysis on this 002 reflection of the synthesized H+/CaPHI and H+/KPHI indicated comparable average crystallite sizes of 8.7 and 11.4 nm, respectively, along the c-axis (SI Table S3). This disrupting in the planar crystal structure of CaPHI compared to KPHI might be the cause of the loss of crystallinity upon exchange of K+ with Ca2+ previously observed by Savateev et al.; once the sheets stack in a planar fashion, they likely cannot easily flex to accommodate Ca2+. However, despite the apparent disruption in planarity of the PHI sheets, the CaPHI structure exhibits a similar stacking motif to the previously studied KPHI, where heptazine units align along the c-axis to form an ordered pore channel filled with the templating cation, Ca2+. This feature of the PHI family is in stark contrast to most allotropes of carbon nitride, such as the popular graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4). The fully condensed g-C3N4 differs from PHI materials in that there are no bridging amines between heptazine monomers, resulting in an AB stacking motif and an absence of ordered pore channels.\n\nThe optoelectronic properties of these two different carbon nitride allotropes varied significantly as a result of the altered crystalline structure and morphology. The band structure (d) of CaPHI, KPHI, and H+-exchanged counterparts was quantified with diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectroscopy (DRUV-vis) (a) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (c). In contrast to KPHI and H+/KPHI, which show relatively sharp absorption onsets near 450 nm, CaPHI and H+/CaPHI exhibit at least two different electronic transitions. Further insight was extracted from DRUV-vis data by employing analysis proposed by V. Kumar et al. to quantify the band gaps in these PHI materials (b). The measured optical band gaps for KPHI and H+/KPHI were 2.72 and 2.93 eV, respectively. CaPHI and H+/CaPHI, alternatively, showed comparatively larger band gaps of 2.82 and 3.07 eV. In each case, ion exchange of the frameworks led to ~0.2 eV increase in the observable band gaps. This primary transition was associated with the \u03c0-\u03c0* transition in the conjugate heptazine moiety as previously observed by Sahoo, Ku\u0308hne et al. Additionally the Ca2+-derived materials showed evidence of additional electronic transitions of 2.21 eV for CaPHI and 2.43 eV for H+/CaPHI that are likely associated with additional n-\u03c0* transitions involving the lone pair of pyridinic N atoms, accessible due to the corrugation of the PHI sheets. Similar states residing within the bandgap were observed to a lesser extent for KPHI by Savateev et al. associated with slight disorder and flexibility in the planar arrangement that allowed for out-of-plane conformations. While DRUV-vis data here shows a slight indication of these intraband states for KPHI (e.g., small absorption onset near 600 nm), these transitions were not as prevalent as in CaPHI or H+/CaPHI and seem to be totally absent in H+/KPHI. With UPS, the valence band positions of these PHI materials were also estimated (c). KPHI and H+/KPHI showed an onset of photoelectron emission at 2.79 and 3.12 eV, and CaPHI and H+/CaPHI exhibited valence positions around 4.84 and 4.64 eV, respectively. Further confirmation of n-\u03c0* transitions in CaPHI and H+/CaPHI is evident in the UPS data, with gradual onsets occurring at energies around 3.4 eV. Combined with the extracted optical band gaps, the information on the valence band positions allowed an estimation of the band structure of the PHI class of materials (d). This relative comparison of the optoelectronic structure between the various allotropes of PHI frameworks demonstrates that despite similar polymeric backbone, the corrugated and compressed crystalline structure associated with Ca2+-templating shifted the bands of CaPHI and H+/CaPHI toward more oxidizing positions than the more planar KPHI structure.\n\nTextural properties of the various synthesized carbon nitride framework materials were quantified with N2 porosimetry. All of KPHI, CaPHI, and their proton-exchanged analogues exhibited a convolution of Type I and Type IV isotherm shapes with H4 hysteresis (a), indicating a hierarchical pore structure composed of both micro- and mesopores. After proper point selection, BET analysis (SI Figure S5) revealed that, despite similar average primary crystallite sizes, the surface area of CaPHI (43.5 m2 g-1) was more than three times smaller than the surface area of KPHI (152 m2 g-1). These differences therefore likely stem from differences in the secondary particle size, as larger particles would be associated with a smaller external N2-accessible surface area. As visible in the extracted pore size distributions in b,c, these cation-complexed frameworks exhibited near negligible microporosity (<0.01 cc g-1), and most of the surface area was composed of mesopores larger than 4 nm, likely due to stacking faults between the primary nanocrystals that comprised the micron-sized particles. However, upon removal of Ca2+ or K+ via washing with acid, the interior pore channels of these frameworks were accessible for N2 adsorption, and the BET surface area increased to 264 m2 g-1 and 334 m2 g-1 for H+/CaPHI and H+/KPHI, respectively. Pore size distributions (b) revealed that a considerable amount of microporosity was generated in both PHI allotropes after acid washing. As evident in c, H+/CaPHI exhibited almost twice as much ultramicroporosity as H+/KPHI, with nearly 0.04 cc g-1 of pores with width less than 0.7 nm. This increase in volume of these narrow pores has been shown to be critical for enhanced low-pressure CO2 uptake and was likely associated with the altered crystalline structure of H+/CaPHI as compared to H+/KPHI. On the other hand, H+/KPHI exhibited more than 0.12 cc/g of micropores (<2 nm), with most having a width of 1 nm. In addition to this increase in micropore volume and BET surface area, proton exchange was also associated with a large increase in volume of larger mesopores (>4 nm) for both allotropes, with the total measured porosity of H+/CaPHI exceeding 0.5 cc g-1. Overall, while the cation-complexed frameworks exhibited moderate external surface areas stemming from the secondary particle agglomerations, acid-washed counterparts H+/CaPHI and H+/KPHI showed that the cation exchange for much smaller protons allowed N2 to access at least a portion of the inner porosity of the ordered pore channels formed by the stacked PHI sheets.\n\nWhile the adsorption saturation capacities between the two carbon nitride frameworks were very different, the energetics of adsorption were more comparable, which is indicative of similar modes of adsorption likely due to the analogous composition and surface chemistry of the two PHI materials. For \u0394H ads,i  in both H+/CaPHI and H+/KPHI, the primary site exhibited an enhancement of nearly 15 kJ mol-1 as compared to the secondary site, which helps to explain the order of magnitude difference in the pressure-response between these two sites. Despite this similarity between the materials, H+/CaPHI did however exhibit about 5 kJ mol-1 increase in affinity for CO2 compared to H+/KPHI. For H+/CaPHI and H+/KPHI, the extracted \u0394H ads,A  in the primary sites were -42.2 kJ mol-1 and -38.3 kJ mol-1; in the weaker site, the \u0394H ads,B were -28.6 and -23.7 kJ mol-1, respectively. The magnitudes for \u0394H ads,A, while smaller than those typically encountered for chemisorptive mechanisms (>80 kJ mol-1), were much larger than commonly measured for conventional physisorption which operates by pore filling alone (~25 kJ mol-1). Extracted \u0394H ads,B  values, on the other hand, fall in this range expected for traditional physisorption mechanisms.\n\nIn contrast to the large differences in \u0394H ads,i observed between the two adsorption sites, the \u0394S ads,i were of comparable magnitude, differing only by about 5 J mol-1 K-1 between the primary and secondary sites. For H+/CaPHI, the \u0394S ads,A and \u0394S ads,B were -70.2 and -65.1 J mol-1 K-1, and for H+/KPHI, the \u0394S ads,A and \u0394S ads,B were -65.9 and -50 J mol-1 K-1, respectively. These similar values of entropic losses likely indicate that the pore columns in the PHI architecture confine CO2 and restrict the translational and rotational motion to similar extents at both adsorption sites, despite the difference in enthalpic interactions. The slightly larger \u0394S ads,i  could be indicative of a more restrictive environment in the H+/CaPHI material, but further work on the exact physical mechanisms contributing to the entropic losses on gas adsorption in covalent frameworks are needed for a more comprehensive understanding. Overall, H+/CaPHI exhibited both larger capacity and affinity for CO2 than H+/KPHI in both adsorption sites despite their similar polymeric structure, which demonstrates the critical importance of the altered crystal structure and pore configuration for endowing CO2 adsorptive capacity."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['crystal_size', 'surface_area', 'porosity']"}]}

In this article, two series of EMOFs with different ligands were obtained by reacting 1-(trinitromethyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxylic acid (tntrza) with metal iodide and metal nitrate, respectively. Furthermore, their structure, thermal stability, thermal decomposition kinetics, and energy performance are fully characterized. The research results revealed that the synthesized EMOFs possess a wide range of density (\u03c1 = 1.88~2.595 g cm-3), oxygen balance (OB(CO2) = -21.1~ -4.3%), and acceptable energy performance (D = 7.73~8.74 km s-1 and P = 28.1~41.1 GPa). The difference in OB(CO2) caused by the ligand structure and metal properties has a great impact on the distribution of gas-phase products after the decomposition of these EMOFs. Noteworthy, [Ag(tntrza)] n  is particularly prominent among these EMOFs, not only because of its excellent detonation performance (D = 8.74 km s-1 and P = 41.1 GPa) endowed by its extremely high density (\u03c1 = 2.595 g cm-3) and oxygen balance (OB(CO2) = -4.3%) but also because of its effective catalytic effect on the decomposition of ammonium perchlorate (AP). This article broadens the horizon for the study of oxygen-enriched EMOFs with catalytic effects and helps understand the mechanism of thermal decomposition of EMOFs with nitroform and dinitro groups.\n\nStructure Characteristics\n\nAs an energetic ligand with high oxygen content, tntrza crystallizes in the triclinic space group P-1 containing two energetic molecules and two water molecules in a unit cell. Different from the high density of energetic molecules with high oxygen balance, the crystal density of tnrza at room temperature is 1.77 g cm-3, which is caused by the water molecules in the crystal (A). Obviously, the energetic molecules in the same layer are arranged in the form of head-to-head, and there is a relatively short distance of 2.329 \u00c5 between the two heads. (with the nitroform group as the head and carboxyl as the tail) (B). It is undeniable that water molecules play an important role in the formation of hydrogen bonds in tntrza crystals (O(2)-H (2)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O (9), O(9)-H(9A)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5N (2), O(9)-H(9A)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O(5A), O(9)-H(9A)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O (1), and O(9)-H(9B)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O (1)). It not only participates in the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the same layer but also connects two adjacent molecular layers through hydrogen bonds (C, D).\n\n[Rb(dntrza)] n  crystallizes in the monoclinic space group Pn with a calculated density of 2.297 g cm-3 at the temperature of 170 K. Interestingly, the coordination of rubidium and dntrza is very similar to that of potassium, that is, there are six rubidium to coordinate with each dntrza molecule (A). Even so, there are differences between Rbdntrza and Kdntrza, and the main difference is reflected in the coordination of metal atoms and carbon atoms. In [Rb(dntrza)] n , rubidium atoms and carbon atoms form three coordination bonds (Rb-C3 (3.717 \u00c5), Rb-C4 (3.690 \u00c5), and Rb-C4 (3.461 \u00c5), while in [K(dntrza)] n , there is only one kind of coordination between potassium and carbon atoms (K-C3 (3.428 \u00c5)) (A, C). Except for the formation of coordination bonds consistent with [K(dntrza)] n , the formation of hydrogen bonds (O5-H5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O3, O5-H5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O4, O5-H5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5N1, and C2-H2\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O1) is also similar to that of [K(dntrza)] n  (D).\n\n[Cs3(dntrza)2(H2O)3] n  crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group cmca with a calculated density of 2.301 g cm-3 at the temperature of 296 K. Unlike [K(dntrza)] n  and [Rb(dntrza)] n , each unit cell of [Cs3(dntrza)2(H2O)3] n  has two dntrza molecules which form coordination bonds with the surrounding 10 cesium atoms and two water molecules (A). Although there are three coordination metals in different environments, their distribution has strong regularity. That is, Cs1 and Cs2 are distributed on the vertical centerline of the crystal, and Cs3 is distributed on both the sides of the centerline (B-D). C shows the coordination of Cs3 and dntrza molecules in the same plane; each Cs3 is coordinated with two nearby dntrza molecules, and the lengths of the coordination bond are Cs3-O (3.158~3.272 \u00c5) and Cs3-N (3.363 \u00c5). D shows the coordination of Cs1 and Cs2, both of which have coordinated with six energetic molecules. It is worth noting that the coordination of Cs1 and Cs2 with energetic molecules only occurs on the oxygen atom of the nitro group.\n\nFor complex [K(tntrza)] n , it crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/c with a calculated density of 1.88 g cm-3 at the temperature of 296 K. Each potassium atom forms a coordination bond with eight surrounding tntrza molecules, and this can be clearly seen from A. From the top of the small diamond-shaped area at the horizontal center line of the stacking diagram (B), it is clear that the distribution of intermolecular hydrogen bonds is generated by the C-H on the triazole and the oxygen atoms on the carboxyl group (C). D shows the acute-angled top (with the angle of 58.64\u00b0) of the horizontally arranged rhombus chain. Obviously, each rhombus is not separated from each other, and they are closely connected to each other through the coordination bond K-O8 (3.200 \u00c5). Although the tntrza molecules are arranged in a compact manner, this did not contribute to the formation of 3D-MOF (this can be clearly seen from the Supporting Information).\n\nAs for [Ag(tntrza)] n , its crystal belongs to triclinic space group P-1 with a calculated density of 2.595 g cm-3 at the temperature of 296 K. Each tntrza molecule forms a coordination bond with the surrounding four silver atoms (A). Unexpectedly, unlike other MOFs described above, the nitro group of [Ag(tntrza)] n  does not participate in the formation of the coordination bonds. In addition, there are only intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the crystal (C). Similar to [K(tntrza)] n  and tntrza, the adjacent 2D layers inside the crystal of [Ag(tntrza)] n  are close to each other with nitroformyl groups (the distance between the two parallel MOF blocks is 1.633 \u00c5) (B, C), which makes the MOFs prone to generate \"hot spots\" in the cavities near the nitroform group that cause combustion or detonation when MOFs are subjected to external mechanical stimulation. It is worth noting that inside the 2D layer, the thin layers, as shown in C, are close to each other (with a distance of 3.11 \u00c5) through the coordination bond Ag-N3 (2.735 \u00c5).\n\nThermal Stability and Decomposition Product Analysis\n\nTo illustrate the thermal stability and the decomposition processes of these complexes, DSC at a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C min-1, TGA at a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C min-1, and thermogravimetric mass spectrometry (TG-MS) at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min-1 were applied. As shown in A, it is obvious that the EMOFs with tntrza and dntrza as the ligands show better thermal stability (T d = 168.1, 153.9, 144.4, 161.9, and 189.9 \u00b0C for [K(dntrza)] n , [Rb(dntrza)] n , [Cs3(dntrza)2(H2O)3] n , [K(tntrza)] n , and [Ag(tntrza)] n , respectively) than the nitroform tetrazolium MOFs (RbTNTz (119.6 \u00b0C), AgTNTz (123.4 \u00b0C), and Cu(NH3)3(TNTz)2 (117.3 \u00b0C)), and the onset decomposition temperature is also higher than that of the ligand compound tntrza (137.0 \u00b0C). Interestingly, there is a regular phenomenon between the thermal stability of the dntrza-based EMOFs and the atomic number of the alkali metal, that is, the larger the atomic number, the worse the thermal stability of the EMOFs will be. From B, it is clear that there is a significant difference in the decomposition process of the dntrza-based EMOFs and the tntrza-based EMOFs. As for the former, there are two stages of mass loss during the decomposition process. The first stage occurs at the exothermic peak in the DSC curves, which are 159~171 \u00b0C ([K(dntrza)] n ), 150~157 \u00b0C ([Rb(dntrza)] n ), and 143~148 \u00b0C ([Cs3(dntrza)2(H2O)3] n ), respectively, and the corresponding quality loss values at this stage are 15.13, 16.75 and 14.21%, respectively. The second stage occurred in the temperature range of 173~176 \u00b0C (K(dntrza)] n ), 159~162 \u00b0C ([Rb(dntrza)] n ), and 151~155 \u00b0C ([Cs3(dntrza)2(H2O)3] n ), and the corresponding mass loss values are 15.89, 20.16, and 11.87%, respectively, while the decomposition process of the tntrza-based EMOFs has only one stage of quality loss. As for the latter, the mass loss only occurs in the vicinity of the exothermic peak, which is 159~171 \u00b0C ([K(tntrza)] n ) and 190~198 \u00b0C ([Ag(tntrza)] n ), and the mass loss accounts for 76.14 and 45.39% of the total mass, respectively. TGA revealed that the abovementioned compounds exhibited a violent energy release process, especially the tntrza-based EMOFs. According to the TG-MS test results (), the main gas-phase products of tntrza decomposition include CH4 (16), H2O (18), HCN (27), CO (28), CH2O (30 and 29 (CHO)), N2O (44), and NO2 (46). Obviously, CH2O and N2O occupy the largest proportion in the entire gas-phase product. When tntrza reacts with metal iodides to form the dntrza-based EMOFs, the types of gas-phase products produced by decomposition are simplified compared with tntrza, and the main gas-phase products are CO, CH2O, and N2O. It is worth mentioning that with the increase in the sequence of alkali-metal atoms, the proportion of heavy gases (N2O) gradually decreases, while the proportion of light gases (CO and CH2O) increases, especially CH4 ([Cs3(dntrza)2(H2O)3] n ). For tntrza-based EMOFs, their decomposition gas-phase product distribution is similar to that of tntrza, with the obvious difference being CH2O and NO2. In summary, the high OB can promote the decomposition of compounds, that is, it can lead to the production of more small molecule gases."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['crystal_system', 'space_group', 'density', 'decomposition_temperature']"}]}

Based on the peak temperature of decomposition at different heating rates, the nonisothermal kinetic parameters of the above six compounds can be obtained (). Obviously, the values of E calculated using the Kissinger (E k) and Ozawa (E o) methods are in good agreement with each other and range from 125.7 kJ mol-1 (tntrza) to 231.1 kJ mol-1 ([K(tntrza)] n ). It is worth noting that tntrza-based EMOFs exhibited significantly higher E than dntrza-based EMOFs, which implies that the thermal stability of tntrza-based EMOFs is better than that of dntrza-based EMOFs. In order to further estimate the rate constant of the initial decomposition process of the six complexes and also to determine their thermal decomposition mechanism, the Arrhenius equation can be expressed as follows: lnk = 25.3 - 125.7 \u00d7 103/(RT), lnk = 24.6 - 129.6 \u00d7 103/(RT), lnk = 26.9 - 133.4 \u00d7 103/(RT), lnk = 28.9 - 137.3 \u00d7 103/(RT), lnk = 53.1 - 231.1 \u00d7 103/(RT) and lnk = 35.2 - 176.7 \u00d7 103/(RT).\n\nwhere D is the detonation velocity (km s-1), P is the detonation pressure (GPa), N is expressed as the number of moles of detonation gases per gram of explosive (mol g-1), M\u0305 is the gaseous product of the average molecular weight (g mol-1), \u03c1 represents the density (g cm-3), and Q is the heat of detonation (kcal g-1). It should be pointed out that the calculation of the detonation velocity and the pressure of the above complexes is carried out in accordance with the explosion equation of the largest exothermic principle (H2O-CO2) (Supporting Information). For the calculation of the heat of detonation of the above energetic complexes, their constant pressure reaction heat (\u0394C U) was measured using an oxygen bomb calorimeter (Supporting Information). To express the energy performance of the above complexes intuitively, their detonation velocity (D), detonation pressure (P), and heat of detonation (Q) are listed in . The calculation results show that tntrza exhibits excellent detonation performance superior to RDX and comparable to HMX, and this can be attributed to its higher density (1.82 g cm-3) and oxygen balance (-6.4%) than RDX. These favorable conditions also profoundly affect the energy performance of MOFs based on tntrza and dntrza. The obtained EMOFs show a good detonation velocity higher than 7.0 km s-1, especially for [Ag(tntrza)]i n . Its exceptionally high density (\u03c1 = 2.595 g cm-3), nearly zero oxygen balance (-4.3%), and appropriate heat of detonation lead to its superior detonation properties (D = 8.74 km s-1, P = 41.1 GPa) over the energetic precursor tntrza (D = 8.72 km s-1, P = 33.9 GPa).\n\nFor safety evaluation, the impact and friction sensitivities of the above complexes were measured using the BAM standard method, and all the obtained data are summarized in . For energetic ligands, the nitroform structure of tntrza results in a higher mechanical sensitivity (IS = 5.0 J and FS = 100 N) than RDX. Therefore, it can be expected that the EMOF based on tntrza exhibits extremely high mechanical sensitivity, especially [Ag(tntrza)] n  (IS = 1.5 J and FS = 50 N). In general, tntrza-based MOFs exhibit higher mechanical sensitivity than dntrza-based MOFs. Among them, [Cs3(dntrza)2(H2O)3] n  exhibits the lowest mechanical sensitivity, which is caused by the water molecules in the crystal.\n\nEffects on the Decomposition of AP\n\nAs the main oxidant of the composite solid propellants, the amount of added AP reached 60 to 90%. Unfortunately, the extremely high decomposition temperature of AP has a negative effect on the combustion performance of the propellant. It is reported that MOFs containing silver generally have a good promoting effect on the decomposition of AP. In this article, [Ag(tntrza)] n  showing an excellent overall performance (high oxygen balance, acceptable detonation performance, and thermal stability) has been reported. Therefore, the catalytic activity of [Ag(tntrza)] n  on the thermal degradation of AP was examined as a reference for its catalytic performance in the composite solid propellant (the effect of other EMOFs prepared in this study and the effect of AgNO3 on the decomposition of AP have also been explored, see the Supporting Information). The thermal decomposition curve of the same quality of pure AP (at the heating rate of 5 \u00b0C min-1) and AP mixed with 10% [Ag(tntrza)] n  (at the heating rates of 5, 10, 15, and 20 \u00b0C min-1) is shown in . The thermal decomposition of pure AP exhibits three peaks, including one endothermic peak and two exothermic peaks. The endothermic peak temperature at 241.9 \u00b0C is caused by the transformation of the crystal from orthorhombic to cubic. The first exothermic peak appeared at 311.2 \u00b0C, representing the partial decomposition of AP (LTD), and the second exothermic peak was at 420.7 \u00b0C, representing the complete decomposition of AP (HTD). As can be seen from , AP mixed with 10% [Ag(tntrza)] n  exhibits the same exothermic peak at 239.1 \u00b0C similar to pure AP, which implies that the crystal transition process of AP is hardly affected by [Ag(tntrza)] n . As for the values of LTD and HTD, they are reduced by 47.0 and 85.5 \u00b0C, respectively, than pure AP when AP is mixed with [Ag(tntrza)] n . [Ag(tntrza)] n  can not only make LTD and HTD advanced obviously but also weaken the peaks of HTD. This result indicated that compound [Ag(tntrza)] n  can be regarded as a catalyst to promote the thermal decomposition of AP."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['etc', 'density']"}]}

We have architected a hybrid membrane by uniform dispersion of MIL-101(Cr) (Cr-MOF) in a partially fluorinated polymer grafted with sulfonic acid groups (PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0)). The single cell VRFB performance of the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane was studied in comparison with the Cr-MOF incorporated Nafion membrane (NafionCr-MOF(1.0)) and showed an excellent result with 97.5% Coulombic efficiency (CE) at 150 mA/cm2 without any significant deterioration in the charge-discharge process for 1500 cycles (over 650 h). Meanwhile, the CE value of the NafionCr-MOF membrane (94.5%) deteriorated after 800 cycles (about 360 h) under similar conditions. The high VRFB performance of the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane has been attributed to the synergized properties and good interactions between Cr-MOF and partially fluorinated polymer matrix responsible for the creation of hydrophilic proton-conducting channels to achieve high selectivity. Furthermore, the cost-effective polymer and thus membranes may open new windows for practical applications in other energy devices such as fuel cells, electrolysis, and water treatment.\n\nIn Figure S9A-D, the SEM image confirms the octahedral shape of Cr-MOF, whereas elemental mapping and EDX spectra reveal the presence of the Cr3+ metal center and successful synthesis of Cr-MOF. Figure S9A depicts the SEM image of crystals in a cluster of MIL-101(Cr), whereas Figure S9B shows the magnified image of a single crystal (not in the cluster) in which chromium (Cr) metal has been mapped. Figures S9E,F and S7A-E also support the absence of Cr3+ in the pristine PHP@AMPS membrane. Furthermore, elemental mapping and EDX spectra (top and bottom) of the NafionCr-MOF membrane show the successful interaction of Cr-MOF with the Nafion matrix, with uniform distribution without any agglomeration (Figure S9G-I (top) and J-L (bottom)). Figure S9M,N (top) and P-R (bottom) also reveals similar information in the case of the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF membrane because of the good dispensability and uniform dispersion of Cr-MOF with the PHP@AMPS matrix. The EDX spectra (Figure S9O) reveal the elemental compositions, which are close to the Cr-MOF precursor, implying its successful incorporation in the PHP@AMPS matrix. The amount of Cr in the membrane matrix was analyzed by SEM/EDX and ICP-MS, which reveal 0.11 wt % and 1.72 ppm, respectively.\n\n Figure S10 exhibits AFM height images of pristine PHP@AMPS, PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0), and NafionCr-MOF membranes. The pristine PHP@AMPS membrane shows a smooth surface (Figure S10A,B), whereas 3D images of PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) and NafionCr-MOF membranes show a rough surface due to the regular distribution of Cr-MOF in the polymer matrix (Figure S10D,F). The phase-aggregated morphology of PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) and NafionCr-MOF membranes is further supported by AFM phase images. This is a result of the separation of hydrophobic (light regions) and hydrophilic (dark regions) domains, as well as the excellent compatibility between Cr-MOF and the polymer matrix (Figure S10C,E). The surface roughness value for the pristine PHP@AMPS (R q: 0.499 nm) membrane increases to R q: 1.057 nm for PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0), whereas NafionCr-MOF shows a comparatively low surface roughness value (R q: 0.899 nm).\n\nOxidative and chemical stabilities of membrane are crucial in determining the lifespan of VRFB activities in highly acidic (H2SO4) and oxidative (VO2+) environments. Formation of oxidative species is expected during redox reaction of VO2+, responsible for membrane degradation. Oxidative and chemical stabilities for different membrane samples were analyzed by percentage weight/conductivity loss after treatment with Fenton's reagent (3% H2O2 containing 3 ppm FeSO4) (80 \u00b0C for 10 h) and 1.5 M VO2+ solution in 3.0 M H2SO4 (3 months at 30 \u00b0C) (Table S1). Hybrid membranes (PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(0.5), PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0), and NafionCr-MOF) show <2.0% weight/conductivity losses under an oxidative environment, which may be due to the lack of accessibility of active sites for attack of oxidative species due to the strong interaction between Cr-MOF and the polymer matrix. Moreover, the fact that membrane stabilities improved following the addition of Cr-MOF into the polymer matrix demonstrates that Cr-MOF functions as an efficient modifier to prevent membrane deterioration, hence boosting its suitability for VRFB application. Figure S11 illustrates that the tensile strength of the PHP@AMPS membrane (20 MPa) increases after the inclusion of Cr-MOF, and PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(0.5) (25 MPa), PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) (27.5 MPa), and NafionCr-MOF (26 MPa) membranes with about 300 \u03bcm thickness show good tensile strength. Tensile strength measurements were repeated to check the variability of the data represented by the error bars in the graph of Figure S11. The three-step weight loss process of Cr-MOF, pristine, and hybrid membranes illustrates their thermal stability (Figure S12). For Cr-MOF, in the first step (50-250 \u00b0C), weight loss indicates the evaporation of absorbed/bound water, and in the second step (250-400 \u00b0C), weight loss confirms the dereliction of functional groups. The weight loss at >400 \u00b0C reveals the decomposition of the polymer skeleton. The prepared Cr-MOF was thermally stable up to 350 \u00b0C. Pristine PHP@AMPS and all hybrid membranes exhibit thermal stability up to 400 \u00b0C followed by degradation of functional groups and the polymer matrix. The fluorinated polymer matrix was considered as thermally robust, and incorporation of Cr-MOF also did not alter the thermal degradation because of the stable nature of the filler and inter/intramolecular hydrogen bonding.\n\nWater uptake (WU), swelling ratio (SR), and ion-exchange capacity (IEC) are necessary characteristics for validating the CEM for VRFB applications (). With the addition of Cr-MOF to the membrane matrix, the WU (20.2%) of the pristine PHP@AMPS membrane increases; however, the SR (12.1%) value significantly decreases. The improved WU for hybrid membranes PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(0.5) (22.8%) and PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) (23.7%) may be credited to the amended hydrophilic nature (existence of the Cr-MOF framework and allied functional groups). Similarly, the progressive reduction in SR value may be elucidated by entrenching of Cr-MOF in the soft PHP@AMPS matrix that confines the swelling of the polymeric membrane matrix. The NafionCr-MOF membrane also exhibits comparative WU (21.6%) and SR (10.1%) values, which reveal the good dimensional stability of hybrid membranes in spite of the Cr-MOF hydrophilic nature. Moreover, ion-exchange capacity (IEC), which represents the concentration of functional groups in the membrane matrix, plays a crucial role in ionic conductivity. The IEC value of pristine PHP@AMPS (1.38 mequiv/g) increases with the inclusion of Cr-MOF, and PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) shows an IEC value of 1.64 mequiv/g. A similar trend has been also observed for membrane conductivity. Conductivity values for pristine PHP@AMPS, PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(0.5), PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0), and NafionCr-MOF membranes were estimated at 30 \u00b0C from Nyquist plots (Figure S13A-D) and are summarized in .\n\nThe conductivity of the pristine PHP@AMPS membrane increases with the incorporation of Cr-MOF, and PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) shows 15.05 \u00d7 10-2 S cm-1 \u03ba m  at 25 \u00b0C, which is significantly high in comparison to NafionCr-MOF (12.21 \u00d7 10-2 S cm-1). The significantly high conductivity of the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane is attributable to the formation of ion-conducting nanochannels and is an indicator of coordinatively unsaturated metal sites in Cr-MOF, which exhibits a Lewis acid behavior. The presence of OH- and H+ groups (generated by the hydrolysis of unsaturated metal sites) results in the augmentation of the membrane acidic nature that causes the establishment of dynamic H-bonding and thus ionic clusters (ion transport pathways) responsible for ionic transmission. Additionally, membrane conductivity also increases with temperature (40-80 \u00b0C) (Figure S14)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['proton_conductivity', 'material_shape', 'decomposition_temperature', 'etc']"}]}

To check the variability of the data, experiments were repeated three times for determining standard deviation represented by the error bars in the graphs (A-C). The PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane shows a relatively high CE in comparison with Nafion117Cr-MOF and PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(0.5), which also reveals the dominance of VO2+ permeability and electrolyte cross-mixing (Figure S18A-C). The VE is dependent on the inner cell resistance and decreases gradually with increasing current density as a result of overpotential (Ohmic resistance). The PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane depicts ~90% VE because of the lower IR drop in comparison to Nafion117Cr-MOF and PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(0.5) membranes (Figure S18D-F). EE values may be a key indicator of the performance of energy storage systems. The EE indicates energy loss during charge-discharge testing, and its behavior with current density is depicted in Figure S18G-I. The EE values for all three membranes similarly vary with current density. At 150 mA/cm2, the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane demonstrates a relatively high EE (~87.3%), indicating its imminent and effective candidacy for VRFB applications. The PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane shows synergized conductivity and VO2+ permeability and therefore elevated EE in comparison with other studied membranes. Single cell VRFB with the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane at 150 mA/cm2 exhibits relatively higher CE (97.0%), EE (87.3%), and VE (90.0%) than NafionCr-MOF (D-F). These results demonstrate advancement in VRFB performance with a battery of enhanced characteristics, including stability, selectivity, conductivity, and capacity retention.\n\nAt low and high current density (100 and 0.125 mA/cm2), the pristine PHP@AMPS membrane shows incompetent performance for VRFB application (Figure S19A,B and video). This observation rules out the suitability of the membrane for high-performance VRFB. A long-time durability test was performed with different membrane samples in single cell VRFB, as represented in A. Figure S20A,C and B show the long-term cycling test of the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane in single cell VRFB at 100-150 mA/cm2 for 500 cycles. The cell shows a regular charge-discharge behavior without any electrolyte rebalance. Synthesized PHP@AMPSCr-MOF (1.0) shows extremely low VO2+ permeability (CE > 98%) CEM has a very steady nature with no voltage drop for 1000 h. Supporting videos for the validation of the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane long-term cycling test are also included in the Supporting Information. The capacity loss during VRFB operation is closely related with VO2+ crossover during the cyclic charge-discharge process. The corresponding capacity retention remained at ~97.8% up to 1500 cycles for PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) (C), which is significantly higher than that of NafionCr-MOF and PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(0.5) membranes. Therefore, the reported hybrid membrane with optimized inclusion of Cr-MOF in the partially fluorinated polymer shows potential for VRFB applications in view of its ultrarobust and high performance. The PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane also exhibits unaltered capacity retention up to 1500 cycles (studied in this case) at 100-150 mA/cm2 current density (Figure S20B).\n\n D-F and Figure S18 reveal the lifetime test of the single VRFB cell assembled with different membranes at 100-150 mA/cm2 current density. In the case of PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(0.5) and NafionCr-MOF membranes, cycle tests are terminated after 800-865 cycles when discharge capacity decays significantly. In contrast, the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane demonstrates continuous efficiencies up to 1500 cycles. The VRFB cell with the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane demonstrates 97% initial CE at 150 mA/cm2 and is stable even after 1500 cycles, but for the NafionCr-MOF membrane, the initial CE decreases from 94.5 to 92.5% even after 800 cycles. Similarly, the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane nearly maintains EE (87.3%) and VE (90.0%), respectively, at 150 mA/cm2 up to 1500 cycles, whereas for the NafionCr-MOF membrane, EE (80.7 to 77.5%) and VE (85.5 to 84.7%) values decline moderately even after 800 cycles. After 1500 cycles, the integrity of the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane is well-maintained and intact, as confirmed by PXRD and the optical image (D and Figure S3A,B). These data demonstrate the longevity of the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane.\n\nConclusions\n\nCr-MOF (MIL-101 Cr) and sulfonated PVDF-co-HFP (PHP@AMPS) are successfully synthesized to architect the hybrid membranes of ~300 \u03bcm thickness by the solution casting method. The hybrid membrane incorporating 1.0 wt % Cr-MOF (PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0)) exhibits superior dimensions; oxidative, mechanical, and chemical stabilities; conductivity; strong ion selectivity; and low vanadium ion permeability. Favorable properties arise because of the dispersion strengthening effect of the Cr-MOF, as follows: (1) obstructed and elongated ion transmission path; (2) partially fluorinated polymer matrix; and (3) appropriate interactions and arrangement of functional groups. The well-optimized PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane shows excellent VRFB performance and elevated efficiencies (CE: ~97.5% and EE: ~88.5% at 150 mA/cm2) with an almost constant charge-discharge process for 1500 cycles (over 650 h). Capacity retention percentage remains at ~97.2% after 1500 cycles, in good divergence with the NafionCr-MOF membrane with ~91.5% capacity retention in just 800 cycles (about 360 h). The proven hybrid fabrication technique for the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF (1.0) membrane is promising for VRFB use because of its ultraresilient performance; it is also applicable to other electromembrane devices and other relevant fields."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['etc']"}]}

Compound 1 was stable up to 180 \u00b0C, and then a rapid weight loss of ~34% (exptl) was observed between 180 to 320 \u00b0C, which can be attributed to the loss of bpmh linkers (calcd = 39.8%) and then decomposes to an unidentified product. Compound 2 was found to be stable up to 260 \u00b0C; the first step weight loss of 31% (calcd = 37%) in the range of 260-350 \u00b0C could be due to the loss of the bpmh linker, and the second step weight loss of ~40% (calcd = 44%) in the temperature range of 350-500 \u00b0C is due to the decomposition of the 1,3-adaa ligand, and the remaining organic ligands start burning above 500 \u00b0C. Compound 3 was stable up to 120 \u00b0C, and a weight loss of 45% was observed between 120 and 320 \u00b0C and then gradually decomposed in the temperature range of 320-500 \u00b0C, whereas compound 4, also stable up to 120 \u00b0C, then started losing the 1,4-pdaa ligand, which was confirmed by 40% weight loss (calcd = 42%). The second step weight loss started at 270 \u00b0C probably due to decomposition.\n\nLuminescence Properties\n\nThe ligand-based luminescence in MOF's is an attractive research topic for the selective sensing and detection of the metal ions. Apart from the conventional applications, MOFs have been used as photoluminescent materials, owing to their higher stability compared to the organic materials and some typical advantages over inorganics. Generally, d10 complexes are promising to exhibit the photoluminescence properties. We have investigated the solid-state emission properties of both the ligands as well as complexes 1 and 2 (Figure ). The solid-state fluorescence maxima of 1,3-adaa and bpmh was observed at 406 and 403 nm excited at \u03bbex = 280 nm, respectively (Figures S19 and S20 of the ). The emission spectra of 1 and 2 resembles both ligands, but the intensity of both the complexes were different. Complexes 1 and 2 exhibit an emission band with a maxima at 406 nm for an excitation at \u03bbex = 280 nm (Figures S21 and S22 of the ). For d10 complexes, no emission originates from metal-centered MLCT/LMCT excited states, since the d10 metal ions are difficult to be oxidized or reduced. Thus, the emission observed in the complexes is tentatively assigned to the (n \u2192 \u03c0* and \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0*) intraligand fluorescence (i.e., ligand-based emission). The difference in the intensity of the emission band of compounds 1 and 2 from the ligands may be attributed to a different rigidity of the crystal packing in the solid state. The slight differences in the positions of luminescent peaks in compounds 1 and 2 may be due to the different coordination modes of the ligands. It is surprising to note that there is no emission band observed for compound 3 on excitation in the range of 280 to 372 nm, although intense fluorescent emissions were observed for free ligands. [Fluorescence maxima was observed at 456 nm (\u03bbex = 372 nm) for free 1,4-H2pdaa and at 402 nm (\u03bbex = 208 nm) for free bpmh]. Although the reason for the absence of the emission band for complex 3 was not clear, it might be attributed to the difference in the dicarboxylate ligand. Since in 1 and 2, the 1,3-adaa ligand contains a rigid adamantane ring which, upon coordination [Zn(II) for 1 and Cd(II) for 2, respectively], increases the rigidity of the ligand and reduces the loss of energy by radiationless decay, thereby enhancing the luminescence in comparison to 3. In compound 3, the 1,4-pdaa ligand does not have such a type of rigid moiety, which might contribute to the absence of the luminescence.\n\nMagnetic Properties\n\nFor magnetic investigation, dc susceptibility data was collected for compound 4 on the polycrystalline sample in the temperature range of 1.8-300 K at 0.1 T. The dc magnetic susceptibilities are shown in the form of the \u03c7M T (where \u03c7M is the molecular magnetic susceptibility) versus temperature (T) plot in Figure . The room temperature \u03c7M T value of 4.88 cm3 mol-1 K is higher than the expected spin-only value of 3.75 cm3 mol-1 K (for 2 isolated Co2+, g = 2.0) due to the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment. Once the temperature is lowered from 300 K, the \u03c7M T value decreases gradually, due to the antiferromagnetic interactions between metal centers and shows a plateaulike behavior between 20 to 10 K, probably owing to the spin-orbit coupling effect. With further decline of temperature, the \u03c7M T value decreases rapidly to reach the value of 2.55 cm3 mol-1 K at 1.8 K. The decline at a low temperature is probably due to zero-field splitting. \n\nThe magnetic susceptibility above 50 K nicely follow the Curie-Weiss law [\u03c7M T = C/(T - \u03b8)], giving C = 5.3 cm3 K mol-1 and \u03b8 = -29.6 K (Figure S23 of the ). The negative value of \u03b8 indicates antiferromagnetic coupling between the Co(II) ions. To understand the low-temperature behavior, the experimental data (Figure ) were fitted using the noncritical-scaling theory with the following simple phenomenological equation.     \u03c7   M   T = A \u2061 exp  ( -   E   1   / k T )  + B \u2061 exp  ( -   E   2   / k T )   where E 1 > 0 represents the activation energies corresponding to the spin-orbit coupling, E 2 signifies the antiferromagnetic exchange interactions, and (A + B) equals the Curie constant. The best fit to the above equation was obtained with the fitting value of E 1/k = 0.38 cm-1, E 2/k = 85.21 cm-1, and (A + B) = 5.4 cm3 K mol-1. Obtained A + B values agrees well with the fitting of the Curie-Weiss equation at high temperature. The low E 1 value suggests little contribution of the spin-orbit coupling, and a high value of E 1 indicates significant antiferromagnetic exchange between adjacent Co2+ centers.\n\nThe M/N\u03bcB verses H plots from 2 to 10 K (Figures S24 of the ) show a steady increase with the field that reaches up to 3.44 \u03bcB at 7 T and 2 K, which is inconsistent with the expected value of 6 \u03bcB (for 2 isolated Co2+, g = 2.0). This indicates the presence of antiferromagnetic interactions, even at the highest field of 7 T. The M/N\u03bcB verses the H/T plot (Figure S25 of the ) further confirms the presence of the little anisotropy of Co2+ centers, which prevents single molecular magnetic behavior from being shown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['decomposition_temperature', 'peak_spectrum', 'magnetic_susceptibility']"}]}

It is characterized by a symmetric butterfly shape and a capacitance consistent with previously reported values of about 400 F/g. A clear deviation from the rectangular shape expected for a purely EDL-based capacitive mechanism indicates substantial contributions from redox-based charge storage. The contribution of the double layer is small as the specific surface area of the MOF is low, about 100 m2/g (Figure S2), which would only account for <5% of the capacitance in the material (see Supporting Information).\n\n In situ Ni K-edge XAS measurements were performed during cyclic voltammetry (CV) with a potential scan rate of 1 mV/s in the potential range from -0.75 to -0.25 V vs Ag/AgCl, utilizing a pouch-type three-electrode cell (Figure S3a). CVs collected in the in situ cell are shown in Figure S3b. c shows the Ni K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra at different potentials during CV. All of the spectra have a distinct, weak pre-edge peak (\"A\") at 8334 eV, a relatively strong, second pre-edge peak (\"B\") at 8340 eV, and a strong main absorption peak (\"C\") at 8351 eV. Peak A is assigned to the dipole-forbidden but quadrupole-allowed transition 1s \u2192 3d, which signals 3d and 4p orbital hybridization of the Ni central atoms. Peak B is associated with the transition from 1s to 4p z  orbitals typical for four-coordinate, square-planar Ni complexes, whereas peak C is the dipole-allowed transition of 1s electrons to unoccupied Ni 4p states. As can be seen from c, all XAS spectra overlap perfectly, indicating a lack of changes in the Ni oxidation state upon charge and discharge within the operational potential range. To confirm the lack of Ni oxidation state changes, we also obtained XAS spectra in the steady state to rule out possible undesired reaction delays in the window region in the in situ cell, a problem previously reported in the battery research community. In this type of measurement, the applied potential during CV was held constant until a steady-state current was attained before and during the XAS measurement. Again, no spectral changes were observed at any of the potentials tested (Figure S3c,d). By comparing the edge energy position derived by the integral method with Ni-oxide reference materials (NiO and LiNiO2; Figure S4), the nominal Ni oxidation state is estimated as +2.5. Thus, we confirm that the pseudocapacitive mechanism of the charge storage for the NiHAB MOF is based on reversible redox reactions related to the conjugated ligand. It is important to note that even though Ni does not change its oxidation state during cycling, the transition metal cations play two important ancillary roles in the electrochemical response of the HAB MOF. First, they prevent solubilization of the ligand. Second, they define materials' electronic structure and the position (potential) of the redox peaks as can be seen by comparison of the respective electrochemical response of the isostructural CuHAB MOF. \n\nAs the redox reaction is ligand-based, it is important to better understand its state in the as-synthesized MOF. To this end, we performed a number of XPS measurements in the N 1s region that allowed us to identify and quantify the specific nitrogen bonding environments present in the MOF (d). These N 1s XPS spectra show that nitrogen in the ligand is present in a combination of states in the following ratio: 75% quinoid nitrogen (-N\ue5fb) and 25% benzenoid nitrogen (-NH-). Based on these XPS data, the original state of the ligand in pristine NiHAB MOF can be represented as 25% of motif \"A\" (Ni1.5C6N6H3) and 75% of motif \"B\" (Ni1.5C6N6H5) (e). Therefore, we propose that the electrochemical process responsible for the promising capacitive response of NiHAB is related to electroreduction of the quinoid nitrogen to benzenoid nitrogen. Assuming a complete reduction of the ligand to hexaaminobenzene, we estimate that theoretically each Ni3C12N12H9 can accept 8e -. It is important to note that such electrochemical reduction generates a negative charge on the ligand and will be compensated by external cations during charging. From the experimentally observed capacitance of 400 F/g, the voltage range of 0.5 V, and the capacity of 200 C/g measured herein, we calculate that each NiHAB unit (Ni3C12N12H9) accepts about 1e - in the potential range between -0.25 and -0.75 V, and specifically during this process, motif \"A\" get electrochemically reduced following the reaction shown in f. Hence, experimental capacity constitutes 12.5% of the theoretical capacity. To examine the reasons for this relatively low experimental capacity, we performed further studies on the charge storage mechanism of NiHAB in aqueous electrolytes.\n\nPowder X-ray Diffraction\n\nPowder XRD was performed using a Bruker D8 Advance (Bruker Corp., Billerica, USA) using a Cu K\u03b1 source.

The crystallographic structures, thermal stabilities, photoluminescence, and magnetic properties have been studied. 1 and 2 share the identical structural features based on planar pentanuclear clusters except for the central ions, where the one-dimensional chain structures are constructed from the pentanuclear secondary building units linked with bct2- ligands, while 3 and 4 have similar layered structures. Magnetic analyses of 1 and 2 reveal that an overall antiferromagnetic coupling within the pentanuclear Co(II) cluster nodes are observed, which can be switched to strong ferromagnetic coupling when using Ni(II) to replace the Co(II) sites. Both 3 and 4 show intense blue emission under ultraviolet excitation. Moreover, 4 can be applied as a selective sensor for quantitatively testing the concentration of acetone in water based on the luminescence quenching effect, with a quenching constant (K sv) value of 12.89 L mol-1 in water.\n\n{[Cd(bct)(tib)]\u22c5H2O\u22c5DMF} n  (4)\n\n 4 adopts triclinic space group P1\u0305, and the crystallographically independent Cd atom exhibits a pentagonal bipyramid coordination geometry with five carboxylic O atoms constituting an equatorial plane and two imidazole N atoms of tib ligands in the fixed points (a). The chelating-bridging tridentate coordination types of the carboxyl groups result in the edge-shared dinuclear [Cd2(\u03b72-CO2)2] SBUs, in which the distance of neighboring Cd(II) centers is 3.884 \u00c5 (b). The normal Cd-N and Cd-O distances are 2.2712(19)-2.292(2) \u00c5 and 2.3260(18)-2.5160(18) \u00c5, respectively. \n\nPXRD, Thermal Analyses and Magnetic Properties\n\nThe purity of 1-4 was confirmed by PXRD, as shown in Figure S9. The experimental PXRD matches well with the simulated SCXRD. In addition, TGA cures of 1-4 are also given in Figure S10. Taking 4 as an example, we can see three platforms: first, the mass loss of 2.69% at 110 \u00b0C due to the release of H2O molecule (theoretical value: 2.29%); then the continuous loss of 9.54% at 300 \u00b0C is ascribed to the decomposition of DMF (theoretical value: 9.31%); and above that, the weight loss suggests the decomposition of the organic component.\n\nThe temperature-dependent \u03c7M T and \u03c7M -1 curves of 1 and 2 are given in . The experimental \u03c7M T values match well with the calculated values at 300 K, such as 15.01 vs 14.65 cm3 K mol-1 for 1 and 5.57 vs 5.51 cm3 K mol-1 for 2.\n\nIn 1, with decreasing temperature, the \u03c7M T value decreases gradually to 9.46 cm3 K mol-1 at 28 K, and then increases to 10.27 cm3 K mol-1 at 9.5 K. Upon further cooling, the \u03c7M T value continues to decline to 7.75 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K. The \u03c7M-T curve in 75-300 K can be well described by the Curie-Weiss rule. The calculated C and \u03b8 are 17.06 cm3 K mol-1 and -43.27 K, respectively, which indicates an overall antiferromagnetic interaction. The increase of the \u03c7M T value below 28 K could be attributed to ferrimagnetism or spin-canting.\n\nFor 2, the maximum value of \u03c7M T is 9.12 cm3 K mol-1 at 3.47 K, suggesting a ferromagnetic (FM) coupling between the Ni(II) ions within the planar pentanuclear clusters. Further cooling resulted in the decrease of the value to 8.16 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K, which could be caused by the zero-field splitting (ZFS) effects and/or the antiferromagnetic interaction between adjacent clusters at low temperature. On the basis of the Curie-Weiss law in 75-300 K, the calculated \u03b8 is 18.64 K. Such positive \u03b8 confirms that the FM interactions between Ni(II) ions.\n\nLuminescence Properties and Luminescence Sensing of Small Organic Molecules\n\nMOFs based on d10 metal centers usually exhibit luminescence properties and thus could be used as luminescent materials. Accordingly, solid-state luminescence spectra of 3 and 4, as well as ligands H2bct, bipy, and tib, were measured at room temperature. The emissions at 376, 415, and 407 nm were observed for H2bct, bipy, and tib ligands, with excitation wavelengths of 273, 344, and 360 nm, respectively (Figure S11). Such emissions could be attributed to \u03c0* \u2192 \u03c0 or \u03c0* \u2192 n transitions. With excitation maxima at 369 and 368 nm, the emission spectra of 3 and 4 at room temperature give intense blue emission bands centered at 425 and 450 nm, respectively (). Due to the similar emission bands for both samples, the emissions of 3 and 4 can be attributed to metal-perturbed intraligand charge transfers (ILCT) and/or ligand-to-ligand charge transfers (LLCT).\n\nTaking advantage of the porous structure and luminescence properties of 4, further study on luminescence sensing of small molecules was undertaken. It was anticipated that free DMF and H2O molecules located in the void space of 4 could be replaced by other different common solvents. We have first recorded the room-temperature emission and excitation spectra of 4 suspended in water with the concentration of 0.5 mg mL-1. As shown in a, 4 in water gave an intense \u03bbem(max) = 375 nm (\u03bbem = emission wavelength) in water, under \u03bbex = 300 nm (\u03bbex = excitation wavelength). To investigate the feasibility of luminescence sensing, the solid powder of 4 was immersed in different solvents, and kept still for 1-2 min to reach equilibrium, to carry out the solvent-dependent emission spectra. These solvent molecules have appropriate sizes for entering the pores of 4. b gives the luminescence responses of 4 for the various solvents, showing the solvent-dependent emission intensity. All emission spectra in these solvents were measured under the same experimental conditions. Among all the tested solvents, acetone exhibited the drastic luminescence quenching effect to 4, leading to the disappearance of the emission. Nevertheless, except for the enhancing effect of DMF, the other tested solvents only resulted in quite moderate reduction of the luminescence of 4. The phenomena suggest that 4 exhibits a highly selective luminescence quenching effect for acetone and therefore can be used as a convenient sensor simply coupled with a handy UV lamp to detect acetone. Such phenomenon could be attributed to the energy transfer from the organic ligands of 4 to acetone molecules. \n\nMoreover, to evaluate the quenching effect, quenching constant (K sv) was estimated by the Stern-Volmer equation, as follows: 1      (     I   0     I   )  =   K   s v    [ M ]  + 1    where the luminescence intensity before (I 0) and after (I) the addition of acetone was obtained by experiment, and [M] is molar concentration of acetone. A linear relation can be found at low concentrations (0-0.15 mol L-1), and the K sv value can be calculated to be 12.89 L mol-1 (d), further attesting to the luminescence sensing ability of 4 for acetone in aqueous solution."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['etc', 'crystal_system', 'space_group', 'decomposition_temperature', 'magnetic_susceptibility', 'spectrum_peak']"}]}

These are in good agreement with previously reported BET surface areas for UiO-67 and with geometrical calculations (see Supporting Information). N2 isotherms acquired after activation from water confirm the decomposition of 1 and 2; following only one cycle of activation from water, sample 1 loses its porosity (s A (BET) < 5 m2 g-1), and the surface area of 2 was reduced to 1112 m2 g-1. For 3, however, only a slight increase was observed, to 1452 m2g-1. After repeated syntheses and measurements of 3 only slight deviations in s A (BET) between as-synthesized and water-activated samples have been observed.\n\nThe newly synthesized MOFs 2 and 3 were found to be slightly less thermally stable than 1, and started to decompose around 400 \u00b0C (see Supporting Information for TGA).\n\nSingle Crystal Structure Analysis\n\nThe structures of the two linkers, 1,1'-binaphthyl-4,4'-dicarboxylic acid (as a DMF solvate) and biphenyl-4,4'-dicarboxylic acid (crystal structure previously unreported of the pure compound), and MOFs 2 and 3 were characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. In the structure of 2 and 3, two positions of the carboxylate oxygen were observed and allocated to missing linkers, in accordance with previous literature reports. TGA measurements also indicate the presence of missing linker defects in the powder samples. The SC-XRD refinement statistics are summarized in .\n\nThe adsorption isotherm has three distinct parts; before, during, and after the water condensation. Initially (p/p 0 = 0.0-0.4), it exhibits a non-negligible rise in adsorption (for p/p 0 = 0.0-0.02), followed by a linear segment (for p/p 0 = 0.02-0.4). If we consider the crystal density of 0.937 for this material, the initial amount of water adsorbed (n 0) corresponds to 0.645 mmol cm-3, or to about 7.5 water molecules per unit cell, which is in good agreement with the 8 water molecules (2 per Zr6-cluster) expected to undergo chemisorption upon rehydroxylation of the cluster. According to the Langmuir equation, more than 90% of the rehydroxylation is completed at a relative partial pressure as low as p/p 0 = 0.015.\n\nThe second part of the adsorption isotherm consists of a water condensation phenomenon which occurs at p/p 0 = 0.53 with a significant rise in water adsorption equivalent to 92% of the total water adsorption capacity. This large uptake is followed by the third part, a linear increase that could originate from further ordering of adsorbed water molecules into additional layer(s) with higher pressure, thus increasing the density in the larger pores and allowing some additional adsorption. The total water uptake finally reaches 27.4 mmol/g (0.495 cm3/g) at p/p 0 = 0.90 (see ).\n\nThe CH4 adsorption capacity (), derived from isotherms at 25 \u00b0C (), is moderate for all three MOFs, and below the best performing MOFs. Despite the steric shielding of the cluster corners (which are the preferred gas adsorption sites) and above all the reduction of porosity (by 26% in the case of 3), the volumetric capacity of 3 is 147 cm3(STP) cm-3 at 65 bar, whereas it is 127 for 1 and 135 for 2. This observation seems to encourage the adopted strategy of functionalizing the linker with pending methyl or aryl groups to enhance the interaction with the framework and thus the methane adsorption capacity."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['surface_area', 'decomposition_temperature', 'gas_adsorption']"}]}

In addition, PCN-136 was characterized by thermalgravimetric and infrared (IR) spectra analysis (Figures S6 and S7). The architectural stability and permanent porosity of PCN-136 were confirmed by nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurement at 77 K with a reversible type-I isotherm feature (Figure S8a). The result suggests that PCN-136 is highly porous with a BET (Langmuir) surface area of 1768 m2\u22c5g-1 (2009 m2\u22c5g-1). The pore volume of PCN-136 calculated at 0.95 P/P 0 is 0.73 cm3 g-1. The pore size was calculated to be 15 \u00c5 from the nitrogen adsorption isotherm. This is consistent with the pore size determined from crystallographic analysis (Figure S8b). For comparison, the N2 sorption isotherm of pbz-MOF-1 was also performed at 77 K (Figure S9). The BET surface area and pore volume of pbz-MOF-1 are similar to those of PCN-136. As shown in Figure S10, carbon dioxide adsorption-desorption isotherms of PCN-136 at 273 K were measured. Carbon dioxide uptake was as high as 61.01 cm3 g-1 at saturation. This result suggests that the interactions between sp2-bonded carbon atoms from the hexabenzocoronene fragments and CO2 molecules may play an important role in the carbon dioxide uptake. In a previous computational study, the utilization of hexabenzocoronene unit as a central part of the linker resulted in a significant enhancement of the uptake of gases for the entire family of MOFs in the study. The successful construction of PCN-136 provides a platform for the comparison of structure-dependent photocatalytic performance between PCN-136 and pbz-MOF-1.\n\nPhotoelectrochemical Properties\n\nAs suggested by the UV-vis data results, PCN-136 exhibits a broad-band absorption covering the whole UV-visible-light region (a). This feature is desirable for photocatalytic applications. However, the visible-light absorption of pbz-MOF-1 is only up to ~450 nm (a). The optical absorption of PCN-136 shows large broadening compared to the free ligand HCHC (Figure S11). This difference is mainly derived from the aggregation of the HCHC ligands in the framework on the basis of fluorescence results (Figure S12). These results suggested that the electrons of PCN-136 can be more easily promoted to an excited state upon the visible-light irradiation when compared to free HCHC or pbz-MOF-1. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the possible difference in the optical bandgap in pbz-MOF-1 and PCN-136 that may have resulted from the \u03c0-conjugated organic fragments. As shown in Figure S13, the frontier molecular orbital distributions for organic linkers (HCBB and HCHC) in pbz-MOF-1 and PCN-136 are presented. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) in HCBB is mainly delocalized over the exterior biphenyl carboxylic acid fragments, while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is delocalized over both the central benzene ring and the exterior biphenyl carboxylic acid fragments. The HOMO in the HCHC ligands mostly delocalizes over the central \u03c0-conjugated hexabenzocoronene unit, while the LUMO is formally delocalized over both the central \u03c0-conjugated hexabenzocoronene unit and the terminal benzoic acid fragments. It can be clearly seen that more extended conjugation generally leads to a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap (4.26 eV for HCBB vs 3.32 eV for HCHC). This accordingly enhances the degree of charge transfer from the ground state to the excited state. The DFT calculations confirm that the MOFs containing larger \u03c0-conjugated fragments would be more efficient for the utilization of the solar spectrum with similar metal nodes and frameworks. In addition, the photocurrent profiles of PCN-136 and pbz-MOF-1 also indicated that PCN-136 is more active than pbz-MOF-1 under visible-light illumination (b). The replacement of the central phenyl core in pbz-MOF-1 with the hexabenzocoronene moiety in PCN-136 did not lead to a significant change in the structural feature, but the optical absorption ability was greatly tuned. It is postulated from this result that the presence of a flat hexabenzocoronene central core will improve the light harvesting of a desired MOF. With this in mind, the use of HCHC linkers can be shown to endow PCN-136 with light-harvesting capabilities in order to be utilized as a suitable platform for photocatalytic studies.\n\nThe Mott-Schottky measurements on PCN-136 and pbz-MOF-1 were performed at a frequency of 500, 1000, and 1500 Hz, in order to elucidate their semiconductor characters and the possibility for the subsequent CO2 photoreduction study. As shown in c and S14, the positive slope of the obtained C2- values (vs the applied potentials) is consistent with those of typical n-type semiconductors. The intersection points are independent of the frequency, and the flat-band position of PCN-136 is determined from the intersection to be ~-0.95 V vs Ag/AgCl (i.e., -0.75 V vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)). Generally, the bottom of the conduction band (LUMO) in n-type semiconductors can be determined to be approximately equal to the flat-band potential. According to this, the LUMO of PCN-136 is estimated to be -0.75 V vs NHE. The optical bandgap of PCN-136 was calculated to be 1.18 eV based on the UV-vis spectrum (Figure S15), and its valence band (HOMO) was estimated to be 0.43 V vs NHE (c). Given the much more negative potential of the LUMO in PCN-136 than the reduction potential for the conversion of CO2 to formate, it is theoretically feasible for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to generate formate to be accomplished utilizing PCN-136 as a catalyst. Furthermore, the Mott-Schottky plots suggest that pbz-MOF-1 can be employed as a visible-light-harvesting material utilizing the same method (Figure S14).\n\nPhotocatalytic CO2 Reduction\n\nConsidering the permanent porosity, broad optical absorption, and semiconductor characteristics exhibited by PCN-136, the photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide over PCN-136 was further evaluated in the presence of triisopropanolamine (TIPA) as a sacrificial agent under visible-light irradiation. Similarly, TIPA was employed in the reaction serving as an electron donor and hydrogen donor to recycle the catalytic process like the role of triethanolamine (TEOA). Moreover, TIPA is a milder alkaline medium when compared to TEOA. In order to determine the optimized catalytic experimental conditions, the photocatalytic conversion reaction was conducted over a wide variety of experimental conditions (). The concentration of HCOO- was detected and quantitatively analyzed by in situ ion chromatography. HCOO- anions were continuously produced and analyzed as time increased for the reaction. Remarkably, PCN-136 shows a higher photocatalytic activity for carbon dioxide reduction in a mixed MeCN/H2O system than in a single solvent. No other products can be detected in the gas and liquid phases, suggesting that the catalyst is highly selective toward the conversion. No HCOO- was detected in the absence of PCN-136, demonstrating the critical role of the photocatalyst in the reaction. Moreover, no HCOO- was generated when the reaction was carried out in the dark, demonstrating a truly photocatalytic process. A total amount of 10.52 \u03bcmol formate anions was produced within 12 h in the mixed solvents of acetonitrile (40 mL) and water (5 mL) in the presence of TIPA (5 mL) under continuous visible-light illumination. According to the above results, the following photocatalytic reduction of CO2 was carried out in the presence of TIPA (5 mL) in a mixed solvent systems (CH3CN/H2O, v:v (mL) = 40:5) under Xe light (300 W, \u03bb \u2265 420 nm). For comparison, HCHC was also used as a catalyst for CO2 photoreduction under similar conditions. However, HCHC has no activity on CO2 photoreduction (Figure S17), suggesting that the photocatalytic activity can be greatly improved by assembling the HCHC linkers into MOFs. Furthermore, pbz-MOF-1 was studied as the photocatalyst under the same conditions, and the amount of HCOO- anion produced was only 3.53 \u03bcmol after 12 h (a). The turnover numbers of PCN-136 and pbz-MOF-1 are 1.12 and 0.40, respectively, suggesting that the HCOO- yield of PCN-136 is nearly 3 times higher than that of pbz-MOF-1 under the same reaction conditions. The results suggest that PCN-136 is superior to pbz-MOF-1 for applications as an active photocatalytic material in the conversion of CO2 to HCOO- under visible-light irradiation. The presence of extended \u03c0-conjugated hexabenzocoronene-based linkers in PCN-136 not only improves the optical absorption of the materials but also largely increases the yield of the photocatalytic reaction. As a comparison, Ru(bpy)3Cl2 (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) was introduced into the pbz-MOF-1 (20 mg) system as the photosensitizer with an amount of 11.2 mg (15 \u03bcmol) under similar conditions (Figure S18). Under these conditions, the amount of HCOO- anion produced from pbz-MOF-1 increased from 3.53 \u03bcmol after 12 h to 11.11 \u03bcmol in 12 h, which is comparable to that of PCN-136. These results demonstrate that PCN-136 is very active and capable of selectively converting CO2 to HCOO- under visible-light irradiation. PCN-136 exhibits one of the highest performances of visible-light-driven CO2 photoreduction to formate among reported MOFs or crystalline photocatalysts. In addition, PCN-136 can be easily separated and recovered from the reaction media by centrifugation for continued use. The recycling performance of the material was further investigated to examine the stability of PCN-136. The results of the cycling performance suggested that no obvious change in the yield rate of HCOO- occurred during the four continuous runs (b). After the photocatalytic experiments, the PXRD pattern was analyzed demonstrating that the structure of PCN-136 was maintained after reaction cycling (Figure S5)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['surface_area', 'pore_volume', 'gas_adsorption', 'porosity', 'catalytic_activity']"}]}

Subsequent N2 isotherm measurements indicated 85-96% porosity retention for SALI-BA and 94-98% retention for SALI-PPA, as judged by BET surface areas. PXRD patterns (Figures E,  F, and SI-5, ) were unchanged.\n\nLigand Binding Mode in SALI-PPA \n\nExposure to an organic base, piperidine (pK a of the conjugated acid ~11) in DMF, left SALI-BA essentially unchanged: 1H NMR data (Figure SI-15, ) indicated no loss of BA ligands, no residual base, and no change in N2 isotherm at 77 K and corresponding BET surface area. In contrast, 1H NMR data for a digested sample of a piperidine-exposed sample of SALI-PPA (Figure A) revealed incorporation of 0.8 piperidines per PPA ligand. An attractive interpretation consistent with the mode of phosphonate coordination proposed in Scheme  is reaction of the added base with PPA's P-O-H moiety. DRIFTS data for the piperidine-exposed SALI-PPA sample (Figure C) clearly show diminished band intensities at 3662 and 3650 cm-1 relative to the 3674 cm-1 transition. Among these, the band at 3650 cm-1 is especially affected by the piperidine treatment, suggesting that the transition is associated with the acidic hydroxyl group of the bound phosphonate ligand. We attribute (speculatively) a broad band at 3598 cm-1 to an H-bonded species formed by the piperidinium moiety with the Zr-bound phosphonate, hydroxyl, and residual solvents; note a corresponding band in the SALI-PPA sample, prior to piperidine treatment, appearing at 3614 cm-1. Regardless of the assignments, it is clear that piperidine binds via an acid/base interaction that is unavailable in SALI-BA.

The compound [Cu(pic)2] is only slightly soluble in methanol. At low pH and in the presence of Cu(II) salt it is progressively dissolved as it reacts to form compounds 1, 2, and 3, depending on the anion of the used Cu(II) salt. When copper(II) perchlorate or fluoroborate was allowed to react with the suspension of [Cu(pic)2], a two-dimensional, rectangular grid-like polymeric structure (compounds 1 and 2) resulted (Scheme ). This grid-like structure results from the union of Cu(II) chains with a very unusual \u2018fish backbone' structure. On the other hand, when copper(II) nitrate was added to [Cu(pic)2], a one-dimensional polymer (compound 3) having the same metal to ligand ratio (3:2) but with very different carboxylate-bridging connections than those in 1 and 2 was formed (Scheme ). It is to be noted that the amount of added Cu(II) salt is higher than the stoichiometric requirement. When we added [Cu(pic)2] and the copper salt in a stoichiometric 3:1 ratio, a considerable amount of the former remained as an insoluble product and the yield became very low. For the alternative method of synthesis (see Experimental Section) when we increased the copper salt:picolinic acid ratio from 2:3 to 1:1 the amount of initial separation of [Cu(pic)2] decreased and consequently the yield of the products was higher. Besides elemental analysis all three complexes were initially characterized by IR spectra and thermogravimetric analysis. The compound [Cu(pic)2] is a \u2018inner metallic' neutral complex and does not contain any anion, whereas all three compounds, 1, 2, and 3, contain the corresponding counteranions and their characteristic intense peak in the IR spectra can easily be detected (1102, 1071, and 1384 cm-1 for ClO4 -, BF4 -, and NO3 -, respectively). The TG curves of the three complexes show a mass loss corresponding to the water molecules present in the structure (for 1 calcd 3.0%, found 2.86% in the temperature range 120-180 \u00b0C; for 2 calcd 3.0%, found 2.99% in the temperature range 120-170 \u00b0C; for 3 calcd 6.0%, found 6.23% in the temperature range 100-200 \u00b0C). \n\n Magnetic Properties.  Compounds   1   and   2  . The magnetic properties of complexes 1 and 2 in the form of a \u03c7m T vs T plot (\u03c7m is the molar susceptibility per two copper(II) ions) are shown in Figures  and , respectively. As expected from the structural similarities, both complexes show very similar  magnetic behavior. Thus, the room temperature \u03c7m T values are 0.78 and 0.79 emu\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1 for 1 and 2, respectively. These values are the expected ones for two magnetically quasi-isolated spin doublets. On cooling, the \u03c7m T values increase gradually in the temperature range 300-50 K and then abruptly below 50 K, reaching a value of 0.96 emu\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1 for both 1 and 2 at 2 K. This behavior indicates the presence of overall weak ferromagnetic exchange interactions between the Cu(II) ions in both compounds.   \n\nThis model also very satisfactorily reproduces the magnetic data of both compounds in the whole temperature range (not shown) with the following parameters: g = 2.03 and J = 0.64 cm-1 for compound 1 and g = 2.05 and J = 0.37 cm-1 for compound 2. As expected, the average coupling constant in compounds 1 and 2 is weak and ferromagnetic, as also observed in compounds 1 and 2 with the chain model. Note that with this model we obtained an average J value since the complexity of the model precludes a precise determination of each of the coupling constants since they are correlated and, therefore, are not independent in the fitting procedure (there are many sets of different values that reproduce the magnetic data). \n\n Compound   3  . The magnetic properties of complex 3 are shown in Figure  in the form of \u03c7m T vs T (\u03c7m is the molar susceptibility per two copper(II) ions). It shows a room-temperature value of 0.81 emu\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1 that remains constant in the temperature range 300-100 K. Below ca. 100 K the \u03c7m T product shows a smooth increase to reach a value of ca. 1.3 emu\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1 at 2 K (Figure ). This behavior indicates, as in compounds 1 and 2, the presence of ferromagnetic exchange interactions between the Cu(II) ions. Since the structure of compound 3 shows a chain of Cu(II) ions connected through alternating syn - anti carboxylate bridges we used a chain model with two alternating (J and J\u2018) exchange coupling constants (Figure )."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['peak_spectrum', 'decomposition_temperature', 'magnetic_susceptibility', 'etc']"}]}

The emission has a small Stokes shift of ~2000 cm-1 with respect to the lowest-lying absorption peak and is considered as a normal emission. A normal emission of SNNU-153 was also observed in solid samples (Figure S2). The lack of ESIPT, i.e., the proton transfer from -OH to the carboxylate oxygen, can be rationalized by the weak basicity of the coordinated carbonyl oxygen where its electron density has been shifted to the metal (In) center upon coordination.\n\nThe absorption and emission spectra of SNNU-153 in DMF as a function of the added N2H4 concentration were then studied. Despite the smooth change of the N2H4 absorption titration spectra (Figure S1), drastic changes in ratiometric emission were observed. As shown in a, upon adding N2H4, the strong 450 nm blue emission drastically decreased, accompanied by a long wavelength shoulder that became obvious with a peak wavelength at 543 nm at a N2H4 concentration of, e.g., 100 ppm. After continually adding N2H4 from 100 to 5500 ppm, the emission intensity at 543 nm dominated the spectra with the disappearance of the 450 nm emission band. The titration established a ratiometric fluorescence pattern for hydrazine detection. The fluorescence quantum yield (QY) of the SNNU-153 450 nm band and its saturated 543 nm emission with N2H4 was measured to be as high as 18 and 49%, respectively, in DMF (Table S2). Due to the strong fluorescence intensity for both 450 and 543 nm bands, amid the N2H4 titration, SNNU-153 showed an apparent emission color change from blue to yellow that can be clearly visualized by the naked eyes under a conventional 366 nm UV light (inset of a). The sensitive fluorescence emission changes match well with the CIE chromaticity diagram (Figure S3a).\n\nSNNU-153 acts as a molecular sieve; therefore, the kinetic domain, i.e., the time course of reaching equilibrium for luminescence intensity at 450 and 543 nm amid N2H4 titration, is important, which was measured by in situ monitoring the real-time fluorescence intensity (b). It can be seen that the fluorescence intensity at emission 450 nm sharply decreased and quickly reached a minimum constant value in 7 and 88 s with the addition of 3.2 ppm (0.1 mM) and 1000 ppm (31.25 mM) of N2H4, respectively, showing an extraordinarily fast response for MOF-based sensors. For a fair comparison, we summarize the performance data of other reported sensors in Table S3, where the response time for most N2H4 sensing probes always exceeds 10 min. For example, the MOF sensor phthalimide-UIO-66 showed a response time of 18 min for 2.25 mM N2H4, and a common molecule sensor, EPH, exhibited a response time of 60 min when adding 1 mM N2H4.\n\n c shows the plot for the emission intensity at 543 nm (I 543) versus that at 450 nm (I 450) as a function of the added N2H4 concentration ([M]). Note that each measurement was made 5 min after adding N2H4 to ensure the establishment of equilibrium between N2H4 and the SNNU-153 MOF sensor (vide supra). As a result, a straight-line behavior was obtained within the added N2H4 concentration of 0-700 ppm. The linear relationship was then fitted by the Stern-Volmer relationship, i.e., I 543/I 450 = A + K SV[N2H4], and a K SV value of 406.4 M-1 was deduced. The detection limits (DLs) or limit of detection (LOD) can be estimated by the relationship DL = 3\u03c3/k, where \u03c3 denotes the standard deviation of 10 blank tests and k is the slope of the linear relationship, which is equivalent to K SV. As a result, the detection limit was calculated to be 0.0595 ppm or 1.86 \u03bcM. Upon increasing the concentration up to 700 ppm, the deviation from the linearity gradually appeared, accompanied by the decrease of the titration slope, i.e., the ratio of I 543/I 450 versus [N2H4] (c). Nevertheless, in the [N2H4] range of 700-5500 ppm, if we qualitatively impose a linear plot, a Stern-Volmer plot with K SV of 37.76 M-1 can be obtained. The cause of perturbation in the high concentration of [N2H4] will be discussed in the later section. It is noted that the detection limit of the SNNU-153 MOF probe is superior when compared with that reported in the literature, such as BTP-LB (2.74 \u03bcM), HFP (2 \u03bcM), and CD2 (4.5 \u03bcM). Nevertheless, it is also slightly inferior to some probes, such as phthalimide-UIO-66 (0.87 \u03bcM) and 2-Ac (0.96 \u03bcM). Furthermore, the K SV value is comparable with some N2H4 probes such as BTP-LB (3.81 \u00d7 103 M-1) and BTP-LN (5.53 \u00d7 103 M-1). Overall, taking the ultrafast response performance into account, the SNNU-153 MOF probe is very promising for sensing N2H4.\n\nThe time-resolved experiments for the SNNU-153 probe in DMF with and without N2H4 were also conducted (Figure S4). The average lifetime of the SNNU-153 probe in DMF (\u03bbem = 450 nm) is 3.21 ns. After addition of 10, 50, 100, 200, and 500 ppm of N2H4 to SNNU-153 in the DMF solution (\u03bbem = 450 nm), the average times are 2.94, 2.96, 2.99, 3.03, and 3.32 ns, respectively. The average lifetime at \u03bbem = 543 nm of SNNU-153 is 6.40 ns; after addition of 10, 50, 100, 200, 300, and 500 ppm of N2H4 to SNNU-153 in the DMF solution, the average times at \u03bbem = 543 nm are 8.06, 8.56, 9.49, 9.50, and 9.65 ns, respectively. Within the experimental error, the essentially unchanged average lifetime indicates that the fluorescence response of SNNU-153 for N2H4 originates from the ground state."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['peak_spectrum', 'etc']"}]}

Since direct activation requires a high enough temperature to remove guest molecules, we substituted DMF with low boiling acetone. This sample is then activated under dynamic vacuum for 6 h at 60 \u00b0C without any structural degradation. Then, textural characteristics of the activated sample were studied. Due to the rather narrow cross section of the channel, the compound practically does not sorb nitrogen at 77 K. For this reason, the determination of the inner surface area was carried out according to carbon dioxide sorption data at 195 K (Figure S11). Framework NIIC-30(Ph) demonstrates the type I isotherm (IUPAC) typical of microporous compounds, and a small hysteresis between the sorption-desorption curves is explained by the kinetic effect of a narrow and tortuous channel aperture. The BET surface area was found to be 451 m2/g, and the pore volume was 0.241 cm3/g. This corresponds to the volume of channels found in the structure according to X-ray diffraction data (0.206 cm3/g).\n\nSince the exclusive sorption of carbon dioxide with respect to nitrogen was demonstrated already at the stage of studying the textural characteristics, we studied the sorption of these gases at different temperatures in more detail. The adsorption isotherms of N2 and CO2 were measured at 273 and 298 K (). The selectivity factors (SFs) of the adsorption of CO2 over N2 were estimated by three commonly used methods (see the SI): (i) as a ratio of adsorbed volumes, (ii) as a ratio of Henry's constants, and (iii) by the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST).  shows the results of the selectivity factor calculations for NIIC-30(Ph) at 273 and 298 K for an equimolar gas mixture. According to IAST, the SF values at P total = 1 bar were 10.7 and 24.5 for 298 and 273 K, respectively. In addition, the IAST calculations (see the SI) made it possible to obtain the selectivity factors as a function of the gas mixture composition or the absolute pressure for the CO2/N2 mixture at both 273 and 298 K (b). The compound demonstrates moderately high IAST SF, which is way behind record reported values for Qc-5-Cu-sql-b (40000 IAST) and SIFSIX-3-Zn (1818 IAST); nevertheless, framework NIIC-30(Ph) has a slightly higher CO2 uptake of 2.855 mmol/g in comparison with 2.16 and 2.54 mmol/g for Qc-5-Cu-sql-b and SIFSIX-3-Zn, respectively. These data demonstrate the good potential of the obtained MOF for gas separation applications.\n\nBenzene/Cyclohexane Sorption and Separation\n\nIn our previous work, we showed the successful separation of benzene and cyclohexane on an isostructural framework based on nitroterephthalate ligand [Li2Zn2(bpy)(NO2-bdc)3]. The driving force of the separation process was narrow channels combined with the formation of specific interactions between the functional groups of the ligands of the framework and the guest benzene molecules. Since compound NIIC-30(Ph) has unique narrow tortuous channels that are capable of forming several types of weak interactions with a benzene molecule, the obvious next step in the study was an attempt to carry out the selective separation of benzene and cyclohexane. First, individual vapor sorption isotherms for benzene and cyclohexane at 298 K were obtained (). Both isotherms are type I (IUPAC), which is typical for microporous materials. Some noticeable adsorption-desorption hysteresis observed at low relative pressures for both benzene and cyclohexane should probably be attributed to the effect of a narrow and tortuous channel aperture. The capacity in the case of benzene was found to be 59 mL/g (2.5 mmol/mmol) and only 15 mL/g (0.6 mmol/mmol) in the case of cyclohexane. The resulting volume ratio is 4, which is a rather significant difference that prompted us to investigate the adsorption properties of NIIC-30(Ph) for the real separation of mixtures of benzene and cyclohexane, as well as to elucidate the nature of such remarkable selectivity in detail."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['pore_volume', 'surface_area', 'gas_adsorption']"}]}

For comparison, we first studied the water uptake properties of the prototypical Zr-MOF, UiO-66 (Figure a, black squares), and compared it to data reported by other researchers. The water isotherm of UiO-66 (group 1) has a sigmoidal shape with a moderate hysteresis loop at P/P 0 = 0.3-0.4. Maximum water uptake at 25 \u00b0C reaches 535 cm3 g-1 (43 wt %) at P/P 0 = 0.9 (Table ). These results, recorded on a volumetric instrument (uptake vs P/P 0), show the same trend as those previously reported and measured on a gravimetric system (uptake vs relative humidity, RH%). \n\nThe water isotherm of MOF-801-SC measured at 25 \u00b0C is shown in Figure a, blue squares. The adsorbed amount of water gradually increases with increasing pressure up to P/P 0 = 0.05, followed by abrupt water uptake in the pressure range from P/P 0 = 0.05 to 0.1, and the maximum uptake is 350 cm3 g-1 (28 wt %) at P/P 0 = 0.9. The step pressure is much lower than that of UiO-66, indicating a higher water affinity for this material. A similar trend is observed by MOF-801-P (Figure a, red squares), while the maximum water uptake is now 1.3 times greater than MOF-801-SC [450 cm3 g-1 (36 wt %) at P/P 0 = 0.9]. This difference in maximum uptake between the two forms of MOF-801 was also observed in the N2 sorption measurements, and we attribute this to the possibility of a large amount of missing linker defects in MOF-801-P. MOF-802 shows a type I isotherm (Figure a, green squares). Although this compound does not show significant N2 and Ar uptake, the total water uptake is 100 cm3 g-1 (8.0 wt %) at P/P 0 = 0.9, indicating that the pore is large enough to allow inclusion water molecules due to its smaller kinetic diameter (2.6 \u00c5).\n\nThe water isotherms for group 2 MOFs display significant steps with a hysteresis loop (Figure b). The limited water uptake at lower pressure from these steps indicates that the affinity of water to the MOF surface is low. This is related to the hydrophobicity of the organic linker; therefore, higher water vapor pressure is required to induce the pore filling. This is clearly illustrated by the behavior of PIZOF-2, which has a large pore diameter and does not take up water up to P/P 0 = 0.7. Once the uptake starts, it reaches a total water storage capacity of 850 cm3 g-1 (68 wt %) at P/P 0 = 0.9. This high uptake capacity at high relative pressure indicates a strong correlation between porosity and total water uptake (Figure S50 in ). The maximum uptake of DUT-67 and MOF-808 is 625 cm3 g-1 (50 wt %) and 735 cm3 g-1 (59 wt %), respectively. DUT-67 shows several steps in its isotherm, which can be correlated to the filling of the variously sized cavities that are present in this structure. MOF-841 shows an isotherm with a steep adsorption commencing at P/P 0 = 0.2 and reaching 550 cm3 g-1 at P/P 0 = 0.3 (640 cm3 g-1 at P/P 0 = 0.9).\n\nIn the case of group 3 MOFs, MOF-804 shows a type I isotherm profile (Figure c, red circles), while sigmoid isotherms are observed for the larger pore materials MOF-805 and MOF-806 (Figure c, blue and green circles, respectively). All three MOFs in this group show relatively low maximum uptakes, compared to the other studied MOFs: MOF-804 has a maximum uptake of 295 cm3 g-1 (24 wt %) at P/P 0 = 0.9, while MOF-805 and MOF-806 have a maximum uptake of 415 cm3 g-1 (33 wt %) and 425 cm3 g-1 (34 wt %), respectively. \n\nTemperature Dependency of Water Uptake\n\nSince water adsorption is an exothermic process, a large amount of heat can be utilized if the adsorption enthalpy is large. With that in mind, released heat can increase the temperature in adsorbent beds so that the uptake capacity can be drastically influenced by this temperature change. Therefore, we have measured the water isotherms for the best performers, MOF-801-P and MOF-841, at various temperatures between 15 to 55 \u00b0C (Figure S52, S54 in ). These isotherms show that the maximum uptake capacity is not significantly influenced by the temperature, indicating that water molecules are easily condensed within the MOF pores. We have estimated the isosteric heat of adsorption (Q st) of water from the isotherms measured at various temperatures (Figures S53, S55 in ). The Q st value in the low water coverage range for MOF-841 is around 50 kJ mol-1, which remains nearly constant throughout the entire adsorption process, and represent 25% greater energy than the latent energy of water (40.7 kJ mol-1). The Q st value for MOF-801-P is even greater than for MOF-841, approximately 60 kJ mol-1.\n\nApplications to Thermal Battery and Water Delivery in Remote Desert Regions\n\nWith these values, we can estimate how much heat can be stored in 15 kg of MOF-801-P. Assuming that the storage capacity and Q st of MOF-801-P are 20 wt % (at P/P 0 = 0.1) and 60 kJ mol-1, respectively, the total heat expected to be released is 10 MJ. If such a system is operated for 1 h with 65% efficiency, the power capability is equivalent to 1.8 kW: a value approaching the 2.5 kW power target for typical thermal batteries as set by DOE."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['gas_adsorption', 'etc']"}]}

X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed that only one crystallographically independent CoII center is involved in the fundamental asymmetric unit. CoII locates in the center of a distorted octahedral coordination geometry, defined by three nitrogen atoms from three independent tipb ligands and three oxygen atoms from two different adc2- ligands (Figure S1). Each tipb ligand connects three CoII atoms, affording a 63 layer parallel to the ab plane (Figure S2). The 63 layers packed in an ABCD fashion were interconnected by adc2- ligands to give an overall three-dimensional (3D) framework with one-dimensional (1D) channels (0.96 \u00d7 0.73 nm in size) along the c axis (). After removing the DMF and H2O molecules from the channels, PLATON calculations show that the porous structure of 1 composes a void of 3706.0 \u00c53 that represents 35% per unit cell volume [10586.0 \u00c53]. Taking into account the vdW surface, the free volume is 5352.4 \u00c53, occupying ~51% volume of a unit cell. Topology analysis (see the Supporting Information for more details) revealed that the framework of 1 could be simplified into a rare self-interpenetrated gra net (Figure S4). Additionally, a stability test confirmed that 1 has high thermal and chemical stability (see the Supporting Information for more details).\n\nSelective Gas Adsorptions\n\nIn order to characterize the nature of the pores and gas adsorption properties of 1, isotherms are measured for N2, H2, O2, CH4, and CO2. The N2 adsorption isotherm of activated 1 is measured at 77 K (Figure S10). It shows a classic type I isotherm with a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 514 m2 g-1 and Langmuir surface area of 680 m2 g-1. The fit of the adsorption data to the Horvath-Kawazoe method demonstrated the pore width distribution from about 0.5 to 0.9 nm (Figure S11).\n\nAt 195 K, 1 exhibits a type I isotherm toward CO2 gas and gives an uptake of 28.51 wt % (145 cm3 g-1 at STP) at 620 mmHg. Most interestingly, 1 shows high adsorption selectivity for CO2 over N2 and O2 as shown in . The adsorption selectivities are calculated via ideal adsorption solution theory (IAST). The CO2/N2 (in a 15:85 molar ratio) selectivity is estimated as 2094 at 195 K (80 KPa) and 27.8 at 273 K (100 KPa). The predicted CO2/CH4 selectivity is 113 at 195 K (80 KPa), 7.4 at 273 K (100 KPa), and 5.4 at 303 K (100 KPa) from equimolar gas-phase mixtures (Figures S14-16). At 303 K, almost no N2 and O2 is adsorbed (Figure S13). It is insignificant to calculate the selectivity.\n\nThis is verified by periodic DFT calculations (see the Supporting Information for more details): The calculated interaction energy is -4.2 kcal/mol for N2, -6.2 kcal/mol for CH4, and -7.8 kcal/mol for CO2.

Herein, we report a facile strategy to fabricate ultrathin metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheet arrays doped with two rare-earth elements, Y and Ce, and self-supported on nickel foam (NF) to enhance the HER and OER performance by constructing abundant active sites and bimetallic synergistic effects. The NiYCe-MOF/NF features an ultrathin nanosheet array structure and is uniformly and richly codoped by Y and Ce. When it was explored as both the anode and cathode electrocatalysts for overall water splitting, it achieved 10 mA cm-2 at 136 and 245 mV for the HER and OER in an alkaline electrolyte, respectively. Notably, an extremely low cell voltage of 1.54 V was required to achieve 100 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH solution, making it a promising substitute for noble-metal catalysts.\n\nHerein, we report the synthesis of Y- and Ce-doped ultrathin MOF nanosheet array electrocatalysts by a simple hydrothermal method using Ni-MOF as a template. The obtained NiYCe-MOF/NF was employed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst to explore the overall water splitting. In particular, the structural characterizations verified that the doping of rare-earth atoms at the Ni sites induced electron transfer to the Ni sites. Benefiting from the unique electronic and structural features of the constructed catalyst, the resulting NiYCe-MOF/NF showed excellent electrochemical HER and OER activities with overpotentials of 136 and 245 mV at 10 mA cm-2, respectively, which are significantly better than those of previously reported Ni-MOF-based catalysts.\n\nXANES and EXAFS were measured to further explore the chemical states of typical Ni-MOF and NiYCe-MOF using Ni foil, NiO, and Ni(OH)2 as references. As shown in a, the peaks of the samples located at approximately 8349 eV in the pre-edge region can be attributed to the dipole-forbidden but quadrupole-allowed transition from 1s to 3d, which were equivalent to the NiO benchmark. The positions of the rising edges of the samples compared to the reference value of the Ni foil indicated that the oxidation state of Ni was between Ni0 and NiII. Meanwhile, the rising-edge positions of Ni-MOF were negatively shifted compared to those of NiO, while NiYCe-MOF showed a similar trend. This phenomenon indicated that some electrons were transferred to the site of Ni after the introduction of Y and Ce, which may be due to the rearrangement of electron distribution caused by the interaction of Ni with rare-earth elements. As presented in b, the FT-EXAFS intensities of all the corresponding peaks for the NiYCe-MOF were decreased relative to those of Ni foil, NiO, Ni(OH)2, and Ni-MOF control samples, indicating an increase in the coordination number of the Ni atoms. The EXAFS spectra of Ni-MOF and NiYCe-MOF showed a main peak at 1.62 \u00c5, corresponding to Ni-O coordination, which indicated that Ni ions were dominant in the oxidation state. The above results showed that the coordination number of the Ni-O shell remained nearly constant after Y and Ce codoping, suggesting a well-preserved stability structure. At the same time, the maximum intensities of Ni states in the WT contour map of Ni-MOF and NiYCe-MOF were also significantly different from those of Ni foil and NiO (c-f), suggesting that the Y and Ce heteroatoms were successfully doped into the Ni-MOF matrix. g shows that NiYCe-MOF exhibited a highly abundant porous structure along with the highest absorption capacity, resulting in the highest specific surface area (124.6 m2/g); additionally, the specific surface areas of Ni-MOF, NiCe-MOF, and NiYCe-MOF were 106.4, 112.0, and 94.2 m2/g, respectively (Figure S13). In addition, the porous structure of NiYCe-MOF further exhibited a hierarchical porous size, extending from nanometers to sub-micrometers, with an average pore size of 30 nm (see the inset in g). These results indicated that NiYCe-MOF contained a substantial number of mesopores, which favored the mass transfer process.\n\nThe electrocatalytic performances of the samples were evaluated in 1.0 M KOH solution with a typical system of commercial Pt/C (20 wt %) and RuO2 catalysts as benchmarks. The quantitative analysis data of doping elements and the amounts of catalyst loadings are detailed in Figured S14-S16 in the Supporting Information. A representative LSV test (a) shows that NiYCe-MOF/NF exhibited superior OER activity compared with Ni-MOF/NF, NiY-MOF/NF, and NiCe-MOF/NF. Even the OER performance of NiYCe-MOF/NF is significantly better than that of commercial RuO2. Likewise, the line-fitting Tafel plot of 65 mV dec-1 for NiYCe-MOF/NF in b was lower than those of Ni-MOF/NF, NiY-MOF/NF, NiCe-MOF/NF, and commercial RuO2, indicating the more effective reaction kinetics of NiYCe-MOF/NF for the OER. As shown in c, a chronopotentiometric test was employed to estimate the stability of NiYCe-MOF/NF. The retention rate of the initial catalytic activity can reach 94% after 100 h at 100 mA cm-2, while NiYCe-MOF/NF a suffered slight performance degradation (10%) at 200 mA cm-2. The above analysis results illustrated that NiYCe-MOF/NF possessed excellent stability in the long-term OER operation process. As shown in Figure S17, the EIS of the samples showed that NiYCe-MOF/NF exhibited a small polarization resistance and demonstrated faster catalytic kinetics and an enhanced electron transfer rate relative to Ni-MOF/NF, NiY-MOF/NF, and NiCe-MOF/NF due to the abundant active catalytic sites and the synergistic effect between different metal centers. In addition, the electrochemical active surface areas (ECSAs) were also calculated by measuring the Cdl values from CV curves (d and Figure S18). NiYCe-MOF/NF exhibited a Cdl value of nearly 36.5 mF cm-2, higher than those of Ni-MOF/NF (4.1 mF cm-2), NiY-MOF/NF (25.9 mF cm-2) and NiCe-MOF/NF electrodes (29.8 mF cm-2), indicating that NiYCe-MOF/NF was equipped with more active sites. The mass activity (the current density normalized to the mass) of NiYCe-MOF/NF was 614 A g-1 at 1.5 V vs RHE, which was approximately 6-fold higher than that of RuO2 (e). The corresponding specific activity (the current density normalized to the ECSA) of NiYCe-MOF/NF was 22.6 mA cm-2, which was 7 times higher than that of the commercial RuO2 catalyst. In contrast, Ni-MOF/NF had almost no catalytic activity toward the OER. As shown in f and Table S1, the as-prepared NiYCe-MOF/NF showed remarkable catalytic performance compared with state-of-the-art RuO2 and other recently reported OER electrocatalysts, suggesting that NiYCe-MOF/NF was a promising substitute for noble-metal electrocatalysts.\n\nAs shown in a, the HER activity was first evaluated by LSV at 10 mV s-1; NiYCe-MOF/NF showed the highest HER activity with the lowest overpotential of 136 mV vs RHE, which was obviously better than those of Ni-MOF/NF (260 mV), NiY-MOF/NF (236 mV), and NiCe-MOF/NF (180 mV) at 10 mA cm-2. Moreover, the catalytic HER reaction kinetics were investigated by fitting the corresponding Tafel slopes to the LSV curves (b). The Tafel slope of NiYCe-MOF/NF was 74 mV dec-1, lower than those of Ni-MOF/NF (148 mV dec-1), NiY-MOF/NF (126 mV dec-1), and NiCe-MOF/NF (91 mV dec-1), indicating a more favorable electrocatalytic kinetics for the HER. The HER durability of NiYCe-MOF/NF was also tested by running 3000 consecutive LSV cycles and long-term chronopotentiometric tests over 100 h (c). In all, 3000 LSV cycles under a low-voltage window showed negligible current degeneration. Meanwhile, the chronopotentiometric test results showed that NiYCe-MOF/NF can be stably operated for more than 100 h with almost no attenuation.\n\nTo evaluate the electrocatalytic stability of the constructed samples in practical applications, overall water-splitting measurements were performed in a two-electrode cell (d). As shown in e, NiYCe-MOF/NF exhibited excellent overall water-splitting performance with a total cell voltage of 1.54 V at 100 mA cm-2, which was obviously better than those of NiY-MOF/NF (1.68 V) and NiCe-MOF/NF (1.59 V). Furthermore, NiYCe-MOF/NF also exhibited impressive durability for the overall water-splitting reaction at different current densities from 10 to 150 mA cm-2. f shows that the water electrolysis voltage of NiYCe-MOF/NF can not only steadily increase with the increasing current density but also return to the initial state, suggesting fast recoverability. g shows that the current density can be kept stable at 300 mA cm-2 during a long-term stability test over 240 h; moreover, the surface morphology of NiYCe-MOF nanosheet arrays showed almost no change after a durability test for 240 h as shown in the insets. The chemical compositions of NiYCe-MOF were also deeply investigated after a 240 h long-term test (Figures S19 and S20). It can be seen that the morphology of NiYCe-MOF can still be well maintained, and the XRD pattern of NiYCe-MOF/NF after testing showed that the characteristic peaks were still tightly held without the formation of the other phase, demonstrating that the MOF structure effectively prevented the corrosion of the metal. The elemental mapping and EDS showed that C, O, Ni, Y, and Ce were uniformly distributed throughout the region. Additionally, NiYCe-MOF/NF also showed superior durability in alkaline solution after 3000 CV cycles (h). The above analysis results demonstrated the excellent stability of NiYCe-MOF/NF during the overall water-splitting process. The ultralow total cell voltage and excellent stability for overall water splitting may provide a potential candidate for practical industrial applications.\n\nIn summary, we reported a facile method for the fabrication of ultrathin MOF nanosheet arrays doped with Y and Ce self-supported on NF to enhance performances toward the HER and OER. The doping of Y and Ce atoms into Ni-MOF has been proven to promote water-splitting performance by creating a bimetallic synergistic effect and constructing abundant active sites. The electronic structure of NiYCe-MOF/NF was controllably tailored by Y and Ce doping. When it was explored as an OER electrocatalyst, it achieved a low overpotential of 245 mV and a low Tafel slope of 65 mV dec-1 at 10 mA cm-2. Additionally, it also exhibited outstanding HER activity with a moderate overpotential of 136 mV at 10 mA cm-2. Notably, the required cell voltage was 1.54 V to achieve 100 mA cm-2 when NiYCe-MOF/NF was used as both the anode and cathode electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. Meanwhile, NiYCe-MOF/NF also exhibited superior stability during a 240 h durability test. The proposed doping of rare-earth elements into MOF catalysts to boost overall water splitting provides new insight into the design and synthesis of low-cost, highly efficient, and stable MOF catalysts for other electrocatalysis fields."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['surface_area', 'pore_diameter', 'etc']"}]}

Nevertheless, it suffers from intrinsically low electrical conductivity. Herein, we report an in situ synthesis of Co2+-doped TiO2 through the thermal treatment of metal organic frameworks precursors of MIL-125(Ti)-Co as a superior anode material for NIBs. The Co2+-doped TiO2 possesses uniform nanodisk morphology, a large surface area and mesoporous structure with narrow pore distribution. The reversible capacity, Coulombic efficiency (CE) and rate capability can be improved by Co2+ doping in mesoporous TiO2 anode. Co2+-doped mesoporous TiO2 nanodisks exhibited a high reversible capacity of 232 mAhg-1 at 0.1 Ag1-, good rate capability and cycling stability with a stable capacity of about 140 mAhg-1 at 0.5 Ag1- after 500 cycles. The enhanced Na-ion storage performance could be due to the increased electrical conductivity revealed by Kelvin probe force microscopy measurements.\n\nN2 adsorption-desorption isotherms measurements were adopted to investigate the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and pore size distribution of the as-prepared samples, as presented in . It is clearly shown that all the samples have a type IV curves. The BET surface area and the pore volume of antase TiO2 were determined to be 101 m2 g-1 and 0.20 cm3 g-1, respectively. As shown in b, TiO2 possesses a narrow pore size distribution located aroud 6 nm according to BJH analysis. TiO2-16Co has a larger surface area (146 m2 g-1) and pore volume (0.36 cm3 g-1). As to TiO2-32Co, it exhibits a largest surface area (175 m2 g-1) and pore volume (0.37 cm3 g-1). TiO2-32Co has a similar pore size with TiO2-16Co, where is mostly located aroud 5 nm. Accordingly, the obove three samples exhibit a relatively uniform mesoporous structure. The pore size of both the prepared TiO2 and Co2+ doped TiO2 with mesoporous structure is larger than that of the previous report of porous TiO2 (1-2 nm) derived from MIL-125(Ti). It is notable that a relatively large pore size is necessary for Na-ion intercalation, which is also in favor of cycling stability for NIBs. \n\nIt is demostrated that electrode material with a high electrical conductivity is crucial for Na-ion batterites with enhanced electrochemical performances. Generally, an electron escaping from the material was hindered by the forces of interaction with a crystal lattice, leading to the creation of a potential barrier on a material surface. Herein, surface potential of the samples was measured by means of Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM). In this measured technique, surface potential is defined by the work function difference between the tip and the sample:       V   cpd   =     W   tip   -   W   sample     e     Here, W tip and W sample are work functions of the tip and the sample, respectively. V cpd is the contact potential difference, e is the elementary charge. As show in a, the surface potential map of Au foil was measured as a reference sample. b-d depicts the surface morphology and the corresponding surface potential maps of TiO2 and TiO2-32Co, respectively (the corresponding measurements of TiO2-16Co are shown in Figure S5). It is observed that the surface potential of TiO2 increased with the doping content of Co2+ and TiO2-32Co has a largest surface potential among them, suggesting a decreased work functions after, and thus leading to improved electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the work functions of TiO2, TiO2-16Co and TiO2-32Co were calculated, as shown in f. It is notable that the work function decreased from 5.02 eV for TiO2 to 4.74 eV for TiO2-32Co (4.87 eV for TiO2-16Co).\n\nRecently, MOFs have been also explored as the ideal templates for the synthesis of porous metal oxide nanostructures with good electrochemical properties. Herein, mesoporous TiO2 doped by Co2+ with uniform morphology was constructed from metal organic frameworks precursors, which would be expected with a good performance for NIBs. As shown in a, a couple of redox peaks between 0.5 and 1.0 V vs Na/Na+ with a scan rate of 0.5 mV s-1 are observed from cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement, which would be ascribed to the reversible reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+. CV curve at the first cycle reveals the irreversible side reactions with electrolyte at the first reduced process. Nevertheless, the subsequent cycles basically have the same profile, suggesting a reversible Na-ion storage process. b-d shows the charge-discharge profiles of TiO2-32Co, TiO2-16Co, and TiO2 from the selective cycles at 0.1 Ag1- in the voltage window of 0.01-3 V. All the samples did not exhibit a well-defined voltage plateaus during charge/discharge process, which is typical for TiO2 anode for NIBs. TiO2-32Co displays a discharge capacity of 498 mAh g-1 and charge capacity of 232 mAhg-1 at the first cycle. The first charge capacity of TiO2-16Co and TiO2 is 184 and 168 mAhg-1, respectively. Thus, the reversibe capacity of TiO2-16Co is larger than that of TiO2, and TiO2-32Co is largest among them. The first Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 47%, 43%, and 38% were obtained for TiO2-32Co, TiO2-16Co, and TiO2, respectively. Generally speaking, the three samples all dispaly a large irreversible capacity at the first cycle, which could be mainly ascribed to the formation of a solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) formation of TiO2 accroding to the previous report. Nevertheless, The reversible capacity and CE could be improved after Co2+ doping, which may be due to the smaller work functions.\n\n a shows the rate capability of TiO2, TiO2-16Co, and TiO2-32Co. The electrodes were cycled for the initial five cycles at 0.1 Ag1-, and the current density gradually increased to 2 Ag1-, and finally returned to 0.2 Ag1-. Although all the three samples display a relatively low (<50%) first Coulombic efficiency, it will increased to 98% after 5 cycles. The reversible capacity (average) of TiO2 is about 168, 140, 105, 77, and 43 mAhg-1 at the current density of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 Ag1-, respectively. TiO2-16Co exhibits a larger reversible capacity than that of TiO2. It is notable that the reversible capacity of TiO2-32Co is up to 220, 193, 156, 121, and 94 mAhg-1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 Ag1-, respectively. Therefore, the reversible capacity of TiO2-32Co is largest capacity among them, which also demonstates a high rate performance. This may be due to the largest surface area and pore volume, as well as the smallest thickness, which can provide most electrochemical active sites and short ions/electronics diffusion path, leading to improved Na-ion storage capacity and high rate performance. At the same time, the increased electrical conductivity due to the oxygen vacancies would also be favor for the rate capability, which will be discussed in the following text. b presents the cycling performance of the above three samples at 0.1 Ag1-. The reversible capacity of 127, 141, and 170 mAhg-1 could be maintained after 100 cycles for TiO2, TiO2-16Co and TiO2-32Co, respectively. The long-term cycling performance of TiO2-32Co was shown in c. It is notable that the reversible capacity starts at 162 mAhg1 and still maintains at 139 mAhg-1 after 500 cycles at 0.5 Ag1-, suggesting excellent cycling stability. These results suggest that the prepared mesoporous anatase TiO2 derived from metal-organic frameworks basically exhibited a very good cycling stability and rate capability for Na-ion storage.\n\nAC impedance measurements were performed on the fresh batteries made of TiO2, TiO2-16Co, and TiO2-32Co to investigate their characterizations of electrochemical performance for Na-ion storage. As presented in d, the Nyquist complex plane impedance plots are composed of the electrolyte resistance (R s) at high frequencies, a depressed semicircle at the middle frequencies reflected the impedance of the charge transfer reaction (R ct) and a slope at low frequencies arising from the Warburg impedance (W) corresponded to the Na+ diffusion in the electrode. By fitting the impedance data, the R ct of 521, 332, and 273 \u03a9 was obtained for TiO2, TiO2-16Co, and TiO2-32Co, respectively. Thus, it is verified that the R ct of mesoporous TiO2 decreased with the increasing content of Co2+ doping, which could be due to the increase of oxygen vacancies caused by heteroatom doping, leading to the decrease in work functions. Besides, the large surface area and pore volume can offer abundant electrode-electrolyte interfaces to store sodium ions, which may be in favor of kinetic performance. The crystal structure of Co2+-doped mesoporous TiO2 electrode during chage/discharge process was sudied by XRD, the results are shown in Figure S6. It is obseved that the TiO2 diffraction peaks become weaker compared with the pristine electrode after first discharge, which may be due to the partial transformation of anatase into a rather amorphous sodium titanate structure upon sodium insertion. In the subsequent charged process, the diffraction peaks of TiO2 can be basically recovered, suggesting its reversibility during the Na-ion insertion/extraction process."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['etc', 'surface_area', 'pore_volume']"}]}

Another weight loss of 56.15, 56.75, and 58.14% (calcd 55.98, 56.80, and 58.01%) occurred during 190-568 \u00b0C, respectively. They are attributed to the destruction of the coordinated ligands.

The results are consistent with results of elemental analysis.\n\nIn order to assess the electronic band structures and optical character of HNU-64, UV-vis absorption spectra and Mott-Schottky plots were tested (Figure S10a,b). It is found that HNU-64 has a broad absorption band in the range of 360-500 nm, suggesting the ability to capture visible light. It is also found that the band energy level of HNU-64 is in the range of -0.87 to 1.65 V, in comparison with the oxygen photoreduction potential (E red = -0.24 V vs Ag/AgCl) and amine oxidation potential (E oxi = +0.56 V vs Ag/AgCl), which indicates that HNU-64 has photocatalytic potential. Therefore, HNU-64 was explored for oxidative coupling of amines, and benzylamine was selected as the reaction substrate example. The catalytic reaction was performed under an oxygen atmosphere and 25 \u00b0C, and experimental results are listed in . With the increase of time, the conversion of benzylamine also increases. Within 7 h, benzylamine is almost completely converted to N-benzylbenzaldimine (entry 1-4) with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 3994 \u03bcmol\u22c5g-1\u22c5h-1 (entry 4). Compared with the reported photocatalysts, HNU-64 shows a higher catalytic activity than inorganic semiconductor materials under similar reaction conditions and better performance than MOF NH2-MIL-125(Ti) and is comparable to other porphyrin or pyridine-based MOF photocatalysts (Table S2). In addition, HNU-64 has good recyclability. After five catalytic cycle reactions, HNU-64 still has good catalytic performance and maintains its crystal structure well (Figure S11)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['decomposition_temperature', 'etc']"}]}

In addition, the same FTIR spectra of HP-ZIF-8-20 (400, 4) and N-ZIF-8-20 indicate that the four characteristic peaks belonging to the phenyl ring of PS disappeared (b), proving that PS is completely removed. HP-ZIF-8-20 (400, 4) was further investigated by nitrogen-sorption measurements (c). HP-ZIF-8-20 (400, 4) and ZIF-8@PS show similar type IV isotherms at P/P0 of ~0.05 and ~0.95, demonstrating the existence of mesopores in the two products, which is ascribed to the occurrence of capillary condensation in the mesopores. And it increases sharply at very low relative pressure, which is consistent with the uniform microporous characteristics of ZIF-8. This confirms that micropores and mesopores of HP-ZIF-8-20 (400, 4) keep unchanged after etching. The distributions of micropores, mesopores,  and macropores of the products were tested by NLDFT, BJH, and mercury intrusion porosimetry. As shown in d-f, the formed mesopores and macropores have sizes of about 9 and 400 nm, respectively. The formation of mesopores is due to the close arrangement of N-ZIF-8-20 particles in the spray drying process. Moreover, HP-ZIF-8-20 (400, 4) has the BET surface area and pore volume of 1646.3 m2 g-1 and 1.28 cm3 g-1, respectively, which slightly increase compared with those of N-ZIF-8-20 (1537.7 m2 g-1 and 0.95 cm3 g-1) (SI Figure S4). As a result, HP-ZIF-8 including macro-meso-microporous structure is thus obtained after etching. TGA and DTG results (SI Figure S5) of HP-ZIF-8-20 (400, 4) indicate that HP-ZIF-8-20 (400, 4) decomposes thermally at 600 \u00b0C to form zinc oxide. Under the same treatment conditions, the weight losses of HP-ZIF-8-20 (400, 4) and N-ZIF-8-20 are similar. SEM image, N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, and pore size distribution of HP-ZIF-8-20 (400, 4) after being calcined at 300 \u00b0C (SI Figure S6) prove that the skeleton can maintain thermal stability at this temperature.\n\nKnoevenagel Reaction Performance\n\nTo further demonstrate the structure advantage of HP-ZIF-8 with macro-meso-microporous structures, the catalytic experiments were performed based on the Knoevenagel reaction. As shown in a, HP-ZIF-8 exhibits significantly enhanced activities compared with M-ZIF-8 (SI Figure S9). The benzaldehyde can be completely converted in 3 h for the HP-ZIF-8-20 (400, 4) and N-ZIF-8-20, whereas only 72% conversion is achieved for M-ZIF-8 after 8 h (SI Figure S10). Furthermore, with the increased macropore diameter of HP-ZIF-8-20 from 100 to 400 nm, the reaction efficiency increases and the reaction time is obviously shortened from 6 to 3 h. The obvious difference in catalytic performances suggests that the improved catalytic efficiency may benefit from the unique pore structure and larger BET surface area of HP-ZIF-8 (SI Table S1 and SI Figure S11), which offer larger channels to accelerate the diffusion of molecules in the material. Compared with the traditional microsized ZIF-8, HP-ZIF-8 provides more accessible active sites. Compared to N-ZIF-8-20, HP-ZIF-8-20 (400, 4) has similar catalytic efficiency that the conversion of benzaldehyde is completed within 3 h. However, HP-ZIF-8-20 (400, 4) exhibits much better recyclability than N-ZIF-8-20. HP-ZIF-8-20 (400, 4) can be recycled at least five times (b), and the conversion of benzaldehyde only decreases from 96.1 to 82.9% in 3 h. In contrast, a decrease of >5% in catalytic performance is observed in every following run for N-ZIF-8-20 and decreases to 60% after 5 cycles. Owing to the small particle size of N-ZIF-8-20 and wall hanging in the Knoevenagel reaction process, N-ZIF-8-20 is difficult to be centrifuged in the recovery process, which is the main reason for its poor recyclability. The PXRD pattern and SEM image show the pristine and constructed hierarchical porous structures are both well preserved after catalytic cycling (c,d). As shown in d,e, the BET surface area and pore size distribution of HP-ZIF-8-20 (400, 4) after reaction are about 1634 m2 g-1 and 7 nm, respectively, which are not much different from those before reaction."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['surface_area', 'pore_volume', 'decomposition_temperature', 'catalytic_activity']"}]}

Large adsorption capacities, up to almost 40 wt% at 70 \u00b0C were measured, corresponding to a pore filling degree of 3.4 molecules per unit cell or 1.7 molecules per channel segment (see Figure ). At the same temperature, all isomers show a very steep isotherm. The largest adsorption capacity is measured for pX, in order followed by oX, mX, and EB. pX reaches its plateau at a partial pressure of 0.005 bar, but for the other isomers the amount adsorbed keeps on increasing over the whole experimental pressure range. It therefore cannot be ruled out that all C8 alkylaromatics reach the same adsorption capacity at sufficiently high pressures.\n\nCompared to the C8 alkylaromatic components, significantly smaller amounts of n-octane are adsorbed under all conditions, in spite of the higher adsorption enthalpy of this component (Table ). n-Octane only reaches an adsorption capacity of 23 wt% or 1.9 molecules/unit cell at 70 \u00b0C (about 1 molecule per channel segment). This confirms the hypothesis that linear alkanes adsorb with their main carbon chain in the direction of the longest pore axis (see Figure ). Because of steric constraints, only 1 alkane molecule fits in the cross section of the pore, limiting the adsorption capacity to 1 molecule per channel segment at maximum.

Along with the expected 12 \u00c5 micropore, the density functional theory (DFT)-calculated pore size distribution (b) shows a 27 \u00c5 mesopore with a smaller pore volume compared to the micropore. The presence of this mesopore suggests two possibilities: (1) the obtained NU-901-RT is phase impure, where a small fraction of NU-1000, a MOF constructed from identical building blocks but with large mesoporous channels (~31 \u00c5), is present or (2) the crystals have defect sites (i.e., missing linkers/nodes) creating larger mesopores, analogous to the case of UiO-67. The PXRD pattern of NU-901-RT (Figure S2) does not exhibit a detectable peak characteristic of the (100) plane in NU-1000 (2\u03b8 = 2.5\u00b0). The cumulative pore size distribution of NU-901-RT (Figure S3b) suggests a minimum of 16 mol % NU-1000 impurity if all the apparent mesopores are from NU-1000. Yet, the PXRD pattern of a physical mixture of 16/84 mol % NU-1000/NU-901 shows a sharp peak at 2\u03b8 = 2.5\u00b0 (Figure S2). Thus, we conclude that NU-901-RT may contain defect sites, presumably creating significantly larger pores due to a missing Zr6 node making the resulting mesopore comparable in dimensions to that of NU-1000 (). It is worth noting that a similar phenomenon has been observed for UiO-66 synthesized at room temperature. Supporting evidence accrues from the diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (DRIFTS) of NU-901-RT, nondefective NU-901, and the H4TBAPy organic linker (Figure S4). The C\ue5fbO stretches at 1700 and 1736 cm-1 observed for NU-901-RT suggest the presence of some carboxylic groups on the linker that are not coordinated to the Zr6 node. Note that whereas the same stretches were observed for the H4TBAPy linker, that of nondefective NU-901 did not exhibit the C\ue5fbO stretches.\n\nRoom temperature synthesis of MOFs is ideal for encapsulating NPs as thermally induced aggregation of nanoparticles can effectively be mitigated. Pt NPs, synthesized according to a reported procedure, were dispersed in 10 mL of the acetic acid/DMF/Zr6 node solution under the same conditions as listed previously. The concentration of Pt NPs in this solution is ~700 ppm. The remaining protocol of the MOF synthesis is identical to that without the NPs. The resulting composite (Pt@NU-901) possesses a slightly lower BET surface area (1650 \u00b1 40 m2/g) when compared to NU-901-RT due to mass gain from the Pt NPs, but it retains a similar DFT pore size distribution, suggesting that the encapsulation of Pt NPs does not significantly affect the pore structure of the MOF (Figure S3c). Approximately 70% of the volumetric surface area of NU-901-RT was retained in Pt@NU-901 (i.e., from 1500 \u00b1 40 to 1050 \u00b1 30 m2/cm3, see the SI for details), further suggesting the retention of the porous network upon the NP encapsulation. Through an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) measurement, 11 \u00b1 1 wt % loading of Pt was confirmed in Pt@NU-901. Similar wt % loading was determined through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Figure S7). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show no difference in the crystallite morphology of NU-901-RT versus Pt@NU-901 (300-500 nm tear-shaped crystals), and the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image shows that in Pt@NU-901, most Pt NPs are encapsulated within MOF crystals while small amount are perhaps physisorbed onto the surface of the crystals (Figures S8 and S9). The size distribution of the NPs in the composite was confirmed to be similar to that of bare NPs, with an average diameter of 4.0 \u00b1 0.5 nm (Figures S9 and S10). A diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectrum of Pt@NU-901 shows significant enhancement of extinction in the 500-800 nm region as compared to that of NU-901-RT (Figure S10). This is presumably a result of close packing between the NPs and the framework, resulting in high scattering. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to verify that the oxidation state of Pt in Pt@NU-901 is Pt0 (Figure S11).\n\nAs Pt NPs are known as effective alkene hydrogenation catalysts, we chose to test the propensity of Pt@NU-901 to perform hydrogenation reactions (for details in experimental, see the SI). Namely, we chose cis-stilbene as the substrate; given the 7.8 \u00c5 kinetic diameter, it should readily diffuse through the pores of NU-901 (ca. 12 \u00d7 26 \u00c5). Indeed, when Pt@NU-901 was subjugated to the reaction condition for 1 h, a conversion of 31 \u00b1 1% was confirmed (see Figures S13 and S14 for 1H NMR and GC-MS spectra that were used to identify the substrate/product). PXRD patterns confirm that the framework retained its crystallinity after the NP encapsulation and after the catalysis (Figure S15). N2 isotherm of the composite after catalysis also reveals that much of its porosity has been retained (Figure S16). A TEM image of the composite after catalysis (Figure S17) shows no significant agglomeration of NPs and ICP-OES measurements confirmed no detectable loss of Pt. In comparison, bare Pt NPs undergo rapid agglomeration in the reaction mixture, as shown by SEM and TEM images (Figures S18 and S19). Consequently, after 1 h, no detectable catalysis was observed. When a composite with Pt NPs only on the exterior of the crystals (named Pt/NU-901; for synthesis and characterization, see the SI) was instead used as a catalyst, conversions ranging from 25 to 42% were detected. The high variability is attributed to the uncontrolled MOF crystal agglomeration induced due to the low solubility of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) surfactants on the NPs in the reaction mixture, as shown by the TEM image (Figure S20).

The asymmetric unit consists of six crystallographically unique Cd atoms, three X4-ligand, and six coordinated water molecules. As illustrated in Figure A, six Cd atoms have three coordination modes. The odd-numbered Cd atoms are in an octahedral geometry coordinated by two O atoms from two aqua ligands and four O atoms from four different X4- ligands (Cd-O 2.203-2.325 \u00c5). Cd2 and Cd4 atoms are in a distorted octahedral geometry coordinated by six O atoms from four different X4- ligands (Cd-O 2.185-2.489 \u00c5). Cd6 atom is in a trigonal bipyramidal geometry coordinated by five O atoms from four different X4- ligands (Cd-O 2.295-2.364 \u00c5). X4- ions link each [Cd6(CO2)12(H2O)6]\u221e rod in the a and b directions to nine neighboring rods, resulting in three-dimensional (3D) frameworks with two types of one-dimensional (1D) rhombic channels running along the [1 1 0] direction (Figure B,C): one is hydrophilic, with the coordinated aqua ligands aligning the channel walls and a channel size of 4.4 \u00d7 4.0 \u00c52. The other is hydrophobic, surrounded by aromatic rings of X4- ligands, with a size of 5.8 \u00d7 5.4 \u00c52. The void volume in 1 occupied by the guest solvent molecules is 42.3% calculated by the PLATON/VOID routine.\n\nThermal Stability\n\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) studies were conducted to characterize the thermal stability of frameworks in compounds 1-3. TGA of compound 1 shows a two-step weight loss of about 18.2% starting at room temperature (RT) and finishing at 210 \u00b0C, implying the removal of water molecules first and then the trapped DMF solvent molecules. No further weight loss was observed until 350 \u00b0C at which the compound starts degrading quickly. Compound 2 shows a rapid weight loss of about 31% between RT and 150 \u00b0C, corresponding to the loss of DMF and water molecules in 2. No further weight loss was observed until 360 \u00b0C. Compound 3 shows the loss of coordinated water molecules and guest DMA molecules from RT up to 250 \u00b0C. The compound starts to decompose at 360 \u00b0C. The PXRD patterns of 1 before and after activation at 200 \u00b0C confirm the stability of the host framework upon solvent removal. However, for 2 and 3, both structures collapse after heating the sample at 150 \u00b0C (see ).\n\nGas Adsorption Measurements\n\nThe thermal stability of the framework of 1 upon desolvation has encouraged us to examine its gas adsorption properties. The BET surface sorption experiments were performed on desolventized 1 using nitrogen at 77 K and CO2 at 273 K in order to determine its potential use for gas separation and storage purposes. As shown in Figure A, the activated 1 displays a reversible type-I adsorption isotherm of CO2, which is typical of microporous materials. Derived from the adsorption data, 1 has the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface and Langmuir surface areas of 231 m2/g and 249 m2/g, respectively. To our surprise, no nitrogen diffusion is observed at 77 K (BET surface area <1 m2 g-1) even though the framework is stable and has seemingly adequate pore size, implying the N2 molecules are only absorbed on the surface of the material and could not enter the pores (Figure B). BET surface area measurements on 2 and 3 show negligible uptake of either N2 or CO2 and imply the frameworks become nonporous after guest removal, consistent with their PXRD measurements.\n\nThe activated 1 solid was also investigated for adsorption of CO2 and CH4 at low and high pressures at room temperature using a volumetric gas analyzer (HPVA-100). At 1 bar (Figure A), the solid sorbs 6.0 wt % of CO2 (30 mL/g at STP), six times of the uptake of CH4 (1.0 wt %, 14 mL/g at STP). From the CO2 sorption isotherm, it suggests that there is no saturation at 1 bar; therefore, high pressure adsorption measurements are performed and show complex 1 sorbs 14 wt % of CO2 at 30 bar (70 mL/g at STP, Figure B), where the CH4 uptake is 2.8 wt % (39 mL/g at STP). The selective adsorption of CO2 over CH4 in 1 could be ascribed to the higher quadrupole moment and polarizability of CO2 compared to CH4. These gas adsorption results imply complex 1 holds great potential for CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 separation applications."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['porosity', 'decomposition_temperature', 'surface_area', 'gas_adsorption']"}]}

In the asymmetric unit of 1 (a), there exist one crystallographically identical Cd(II) center, one BDC ligand, one DPBT ligand, and two free water molecules. The Cd(II) center adopts a six-coordinated octahedron geometry (CdO4N2) by coordinating to four oxygen atoms from three BDC anions and two nitrogen atoms from two DPBT molecules. The Cd-N and Cd-O distances are in the ranges of 2.304(2)-2.334(2) \u00c5 and 2.273(2)-2.417(3) \u00c5, respectively, which deviated from normal bond lengths found in other Cd compounds. In the BDC ligand, the two carboxylate groups display two different coordination modes: one adopts a bidentate chelating mode to link one Cd(II) ion and the other also adopts a bidentate bridging mode to combine two Cd(II) ions. Nitrogen atoms from DPBT ligands locate in the axis direction of the plane that formed by oxygen and Cd(II) atoms.\n\nThe presence of channels formed by the stacking of 2D layers in an AAA\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5 mode is one interesting structural feature of 2. Infinite one-dimensional channels are created along the a-axis when the parallel layers are accumulating (d). e shows the channels viewed along the c axis. The solvent-accessible volume of these channels, calculated with the PLATON program, is 458.2 \u00c53, or 19.3% of the total unit cell volume whose channels are occupied by many disordered DMA solvent molecules.\n\nCrystal Structure Description of 3 \n\nCompound 3 reveals a 3D structure and crystallizes in the orthorhombic crystal system of the Pcc2 group. As a shows, the asymmetric unit of 3 consists of two crystallographically identical Co(II) centers, two BDC ligands, two DPBT ligands, two free DMF molecules, and five solvent water molecules, of which some of the solvent molecules are squeezed by PLATON. The Co(II) center adopts a six-coordinated octahedral geometry (CoO4N2) by coordinating to four oxygen donors from three BDC anions and two nitrogen atoms from two DPBT molecules. The Co-O and Co-N distances are in the ranges of 1.999(3)-2.200(4) \u00c5 and 2.132(4)-2.169(4) \u00c5, respectively, which are similar to the values found in other Co compounds. \n\nPhotofluorescent Properties\n\nBecause compounds 1 and 2 are constructed from Cd2+ and Zn2+ ions with d10 electron and a rigid fluorescent DPBT ligand, they are highly likely to exhibit potential photoluminescence (PL) properties. Thus, the PL properties of both compounds were examined. The spectra of single-crystalline powder samples of compounds 1-4 and the DPBT ligand were recorded at room temperature. As shown in , upon excitation at 356 nm for 1 and 375 nm for 2, the maximum emission peaks of the compounds are observed at 464 and 513 nm, respectively. Compared with that of free DPBT ligand, the emission intensities of both compounds are much stronger; namely, the formation of MOFs enhances the fluorescence of the DPBT ligand, which is a typical instance of aggregation-induced emission (AIE). The emission peak of compound 1 is slightly blue shifted in comparison to that of the DPBT ligand (\u03bbem = 465 nm), which can be assigned to n-\u03c0* and/or \u03c0-\u03c0* transition. However, compound 2 is red-shifted 48 nm, which may be because of the contribution of ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). The differences in the peak positions of these compounds might be attributed to the differences in coordination environments and the metal centers.\n\nThe sensing performances of 2 for nitro compounds were investigated by PL titration experiments. The addition of nitro compounds into DMF emulsions results in a fluorescence quenching effect (b and ). The order of quenching efficiency is PA > 1,4-DNB > NB > 4-NT > 1,3-DNB > 2,4-DNT. The highest fluorescence quenching percentage is PA, which quenches the emission by as much as 99.7% when the concentration reaches 0.1 mM. However, under the same concentration, other nitro compounds exhibit indistinct changes with a QP of 10.8% for 1,4-DNB and lower values for the other four nitro compounds. These results shows that 2 as a fluorescence sensor material has great potential to selective detect PA. The relationship between the fluorescence intensities and the concentration of PA can be fitted well with a first-order exponential equation, and a K sv of 5.9 \u00d7 104 M-1 is observed for PA (R 2 = 0.999, ). It is obvious that an upward and nonlinear curve appears with an increase in the PA concentration, suggesting that there is possibly simultaneous static and dynamic quenching in the process of fluorescence quenching.As shown in b, the fluorescence emission of the emulsion without PA is 443 nm. As the concentration of PA increased, the maximum emission of the emulsion gradually shifts, which may be due to fluorescence resonance energy transfer. \n\nThe fluorescence responses of 1 to various nitro compounds were also investigated (). Similar to 2,the incremental concentration of PA to 1 led to high and fast fluorescence quenching behavior with a QP of 74.3% at 0.1 mM. The emission of 1 almost completely disappeared when the concentration of PA was as low as 0.2 mM. However, the other five nitro compounds exhibit minor quenching effects on the fluorescence change of 1. Those results show that 1 can be applied to highly selectivity detect PA as an efficient fluorescence sensor.\n\nIn addition, we also investigated the emission decay lifetimes of both compounds. The curves () are best fit by biexponentials in emulsions. The emission decay lifetimes of compounds 1 and 2 are as follows: \u03c4 = 4.93 ns (\u03c72 = 1.113) for emulsion 1 and \u03c41 = 6.27 ns (69.35%) and \u03c42 = 2.83 ns (30.65%, \u03c72 = 0.995) for emulsion 2. The emission lifetime values of both compounds are up to nanoseconds, which indicate that both compounds can be used as fluorescence materials to detect PA and metal ions.\n\nThermogravimetric Analyses and Powder X-ray Diffraction\n\nThe thermal behaviors of compounds 1-4 were investigated by TGA to understand the stability of the coordinated skeletons. As shown in , because of the loss of the solvent water molecules and the collapse of the molecular skeleton, two weight losses are observed at approximately 120 and 460 \u00b0C, respectively, for compound 1. Compound 2 also shows two main steps of weight loss: one is observed from 150 to 250 \u00b0C resulting from the loss of solvent DMA molecules, and the other occurs after 370 \u00b0C, which is due to collapse of the molecular skeleton. There are three steps for compound 3; the former two steps of weight loss are in the ranges of 40-115 \u00b0C and 120-300 \u00b0C, which are attributed to the loss of the solvent water molecules and free DMF molecules. The final step is observed at higher than 350 \u00b0C, which results from the collapse of the molecular skeleton. There is only one weight loss for compound 4 in the range 460-500 \u00b0C, which results from collapse of the molecular skeleton."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['crystal_system', 'space_group', 'porosity', 'peak_spectrum', 'etc', 'decomposition_temperature']"}]}

The crystal size and morphology were assessed by SEM, which showed that FCAT@ZIF-8 and FCAT@ZIF-90 samples were dispersed rhombododecahedral crystals whereas some crystal intergrowth was observed for FCAT@MAF-7 (Figure S7). Gas adsorption isotherms were conducted to assess porosity, yielding Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of 1205.7(21.2), 1059.2(2.0), and 1070.6(2.2) m2 g-1 for FCAT@ZIF-8, FCAT@ZIF-90, and FCAT@MAF-7, respectively (Figures S8-S10). Furthermore, comparison of the pore size distributions of the biocomposites and their corresponding neat ZIFs suggests that enzyme encapsulation does not affect the bulk pore structure of the ZIFs (Figures S8-S10). The spatial distribution of FCAT within the samples was assessed using confocal laser microscopy (CLSM) (b and Figure S12); the images show that the FCAT molecules were more homogeneously distributed throughout FCAT@MAF-7 and FCAT@ZIF-90 crystals than in FCAT@ZIF-8, in which FCAT was predominantly located in the subsurface region. The latter data is in agreement with our previous studies and shows that the hydrophilic and hydrophobic ZIFs give rise to different enzyme spatial distributions. FCAT loading in all samples was determined by tracing its fluorescence signal after dissolution in 0.1 M citric acid-sodium citrate buffer (pH 5) (Table S1). The weight percentage of enzyme encapsulated varied from 0.5 to 3.3 wt % for FCAT-on-MAF-7 to FCAT@ZIF-8, respectively (b and Table S1). It is noteworthy that higher FCAT loading in the biocomposites can be achieved by using a higher dosage of FCAT during synthesis (Table S1).\n\nTo determine the effect of framework chemistry on the performance of the encapsulated enzyme, we measured H2O2 decomposition for each of the FCAT/ZIF composites. For comparison, we also evaluated the activity of free FCAT under the same conditions. In addition, we have found that the handling conditions for the ZIF-based biocomposites can affect the integrity of the ZIF coating. For example, phosphate buffers, such as PBS, give rise to rapid decomposition of ZIF-8 crystals and we anticipate that this will affect enzyme activity studies. Consequently, we avoided exposing our biocomposites to PBS. Ongoing work in our laboratory is focused on establishing protocols for the storage, handling, and activity studies of ZIF-based biocomposites. A noteworthy result, shown in c, Figures S22-S26, and Table S2, is that FCAT@ZIF-8 composites showed no measurable catalytic activity (a,c). Furthermore, FCAT adsorbed onto the surface of ZIF-8 was also inactive (a,c). A similar phenomenon was observed in the case of fluorescence-tagged horseradish peroxidase (FHRP, Figure S39). These data are consistent with studies that show protein adsorption on hydrophobic surfaces can lead to a loss of activity and suggests recent reports of enzyme activity for FCAT@ZIF-8 may need to be re-evaluated. In contrast to the FCAT/ZIF-8 biocomposites, FCAT@MAF-7 showed comparable activity to that of free FCAT: 3.2 \u00d7 10-3 mM s-1 for FCAT@MAF-7 versus 4.4 \u00d7 10-3 mM s-1 for free FCAT (c, Figures S24 and S25). Additionally, FCAT@ZIF-90 showed a substantial reduction in activity compared to the free enzyme (1.4 \u00d7 10-3 mM s-1, c and Figure S26). We believe that the slightly slower reaction rates of FCAT-on-MAF-7 and FCAT-on-ZIF-90 compared to those of FCAT@MAF-7 and FCAT@ZIF-90 may be attributed to hindered substrate diffusion and/or changed enzyme orientation that is engendered by close packing of FCAT on the MOF surface (surface-crowding effect). To provide a more comprehensive comparison of the FCAT/MOF biocomposite with free FCAT, we evaluated the Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters (Figure S28 and Table S2). The K m and k cat values for FCAT@MAF-7 are 0.99 mM and 950 s-1, respectively (Table S2), which are comparable to those of free FCAT and superior to those of FCAT@ZIF-90 (Figure S28 and Table S2). The loss of activity for the FCAT/ZIF-8 biocomposites could be due to a number of factors, such as (1) the presence of the acetate anion inhibiting the FCAT activity, (2) binding of HmIM to the iron-heme active site of FCAT during the synthesis process, (3) denaturation of the enzyme during the encapsulation or surface immobilization process as a result of hydrophobic interactions between FCAT and ZIF-8, and/or (4) hindered diffusion of the substrate (H2O2)/product (H2O) by the hydrophobic framework of ZIF-8 (for FCAT@ZIF-8). Importantly, CAT (i.e., not fluorescein tagged) was found to be inactive for the CAT@ZIF-8 composites (Figure S28), indicating the deactivation of FCAT in/on ZIF-8 is not ascribed to the enzyme surface functionalization.\n\nGiven that the catalytic activity of the encapsulated enzymes is preserved for FCAT@MAF-7 and FCAT@ZIF-90 (c), we sought to examine the capacity of these ZIF coatings to protect the enzymes from inhospitable environments. This \"shielding\" effect has been previously observed for ZIF-90; thus, it serves as an excellent benchmark material for FCAT@MAF-7. To assess the capacity of the ZIF coating to protect the biological cargo from elevated temperatures, we measured the enzymatic activity for FCAT, FCAT@MAF-7, and FCAT@ZIF-90 after incubating the catalysts at 50, 60, and 70 \u00b0C (a and Figure S29), along with a room temperature (RT, 25 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C) control experiment. As anticipated, without protection via encapsulation, the activity of free FCAT decreased dramatically from 3.7 \u00d7 10-3 mM s-1 at RT to 0.9 \u00d7 10-3 mM s-1 after treatment at 70 \u00b0C. Consistent with previous studies, ZIF-90 provides a degree of protection for embedded FCAT: ca. 80 and 65% of its original activity was retained after exposure to 50 and 60 \u00b0C, respectively. Notably, FCAT@MAF-7 offered far superior protection to elevated temperatures than ZIF-90, retaining 79% of its original activity after exposure to a temperature of 70 \u00b0C compared to 24% and 25% for FCAT and FCAT@ZIF-90, respectively. We then exposed the ZIF-based biocomposites to urea, a chaotropic agent that engenders loss of biological function by unfolding proteins. a shows that free FCAT retained only 8% of its original activity after contact with urea; however, FCAT@MAF-7 and FCAT@ZIF-90 maintained 89% and 48% of their original activity, respectively. It is worth noting that analogous experiments employing FCAT-on-MAF-7 and FCAT-on-ZIF-90 led to essentially complete deactivation of the surface-adsorbed protein (Figure S30). Thus, by exposing FCAT@MAF-7 and FCAT@ZIF-90 to urea, we were observing only enzymatic activity from encapsulated enzyme. In the presence of protease (2 mg mL-1 for 4 h at RT) FCAT@MAF-7 retained 85% of its original activity compared to only 14% for free FCAT and 19% for FCAT@ZIF-90 (a and Figure S31). Both MAF-7 and ZIF-90 possess \u00c5-sized pore apertures that would size-exclude the protease and prevent contact with the embedded enzyme. These observations are commensurate with urea treatment and is again presumably due to the deactivation of the surface-adsorbed enzyme, which is more significant in FCAT@ZIF-90 (Figure S31). Finally, both MAF-7 and ZIF-90 protect the embedded FCAT from organic solvents (a). Specifically, FCAT@MAF-7 maintained 96% and 64% of its original activity after exposure to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and tetrahydrofuran (THF), respectively. In comparison, the activity of free FCAT is significantly diminished upon exposure to these solvents (a). These experiments suggest that MAF-7 offers superior protection to enzymes than other reported ZIFs and may provide the stability necessary for the enzymes to retain their performance under commercially relevant conditions. \n\nEncouraged by the excellent stability of FCAT@MAF-7, we sought to investigate recyclability, a critical performance metric for practical applications. We cycled FCAT@MAF-7 ten times without an appreciable reduction in enzymatic activity (b). Furthermore, fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed negligible leaching during repeated usage (Figure S33) and PXRD analysis showed that crystallinity was retained subsequent to the cycling process (Figure S34). Lastly, we explored the generality of MAF-7 as a host for biomacromolecules by performing an analogous set of experiments on fluorescein-tagged urease, FU. After immobilization, FU@MAF-7 retained 82% of the urease activity compared to FU@ZIF-90 (21%) and FU@ZIF-8 (13%) (Figure S43). In addition, compared to ZIF-90 and ZIF-8, MAF-7 provided better protection: FU@MAF-7 maintained 61% of its original activity after heating (70 \u00b0C for 1 h) and 74% after exposure to a proteolytic enzyme (Figure S44)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['surface_area', 'catalytic_activity']"}]}

The TGA of 1-Eu showed that weight loss was 31.3% (calcd 31.5%) between 35 and 309 \u00b0C, possibly attributed to the free solvent molecules and the coordinated water molecules being removed. The frame structure existed stably between 309 and 550 \u00b0C, then the frameworks collapsed (Figures S3c and S4).\n\nSolid-State Fluorescence Properties of 1-Ln \n\nThe solid-state photoluminescence properties have been studied for the H3L ligand and 1-Ln complexes under ambient conditions. The photoluminescence spectra of the H3L ligand revealed the maximum (Figure S7) mission at 404 nm (\u03bbex  = 343 nm), attributed to the electron transition of \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* after absorbing energy (). The luminescence of 1-Ln was restricted to the selection of f-f transition and the luminescence achieved by the \"antenna effect\" of the organic ligands. Complex 1-Tb excited at 334 nm displays narrow peaks at 489 nm (5D4 \u2192 7F6), 544 nm (5D4 \u2192 7F5) (strong), 582 nm (5D4 \u2192 7F4), and 618 nm (5D4 \u2192 7F3), corresponding to the electronic transition of 5D4 \u2192 7FJ (J = 6-3) of Tb3+ ions. Thus, 1-Tb showed a strong green fluorescence emission. Based on electron transitions of 5D0 \u2192 7F1, 5D0 \u2192 7F2, and 5D0 \u2192 7F4, 1-Eu exhibited characteristic peaks of Eu3+ at 592, 616, and 695 nm, respectively (\u03bbex  = 338 nm). The relative intensities of the 5D0 \u2192 7F2 and 5D0 \u2192 7F1 transitions are used to measure the coordination state (a). Considering the feeble symmetry of Eu3+ at 5D0 \u2192 7F1, the intensity of the magnetic dipole transition was weak. The intensity of the 5D0 \u2192 7F2 transition allowed the electric dipole transition to increase, forming a sharp emission spectrum. On the contrary, a less intense wide peak was observed in the 5D0 \u2192 7F4 transition (695 nm) (b). The single exponential decay of 1-Tb and 1-Eu were 473.75 and 365.29 \u03bcs, respectively (Figure S8). Compared with 1-Eu, the relatively lower lifetime of 1-Tb was mainly the result of the different sensitivities of these ions quenched by O-H.\n\nSelective Sensing of Antibiotics\n\n 1-Eu has stable red emission and excellent water stability (Figure S9a); hence, the fluorescence sensing of drugs in water by 1-Eu was studied. Eight common antibiotics\ue5f8SM2 (sulfadimidine), SMZ (sulfamethoxazole), AMX (amoxicillin), SFZ (sulfadiazine), FFC (florfenicol), ERM (erythromycin), MDZ, and TET (Scheme S1)()\ue5f8were selected in this experiment. 3 mg 1-Eu was added into 3 mL aqueous solution of different drugs (1 \u00d7 10-3 mol/L); then, it was ultrasonicated for 10 min to form uniform suspensions and the fluorescence spectra of different drugs were measured. The results show that the fluorescence intensity of 1-Eu is significantly quenched in MDZ and TET, and the quenching efficiencies are up to 99.8 and 99.9%, respectively. For other drugs, the fluorescence intensity of 1-Eu also decreased to different degrees ( and S10).\n\nIn order to detect the sensitivity of 1-Eu to MDZ and TET, the blank water samples were titrated with MDZ and TET, respectively, and the fluorescence intensity of 1-Eu after each titration was recorded. The result indicates that the fluorescence intensity of 1-Eu decreases with the increase in the concentrations of MDZ and TET. The fluorescence of 1-Eu is completely quenched when TET and MDZ are at concentrations of 0.348 and 0.306 mM, respectively (a,b). According to Stern-Volmer (SV) equation (I 0/I = 1 + K sv [M]), it is possible to calculate quantitatively the quenching efficiency (I 0 and I are the fluorescence intensities before and after the addition of MDZ or TET, K sv is the quenching constant (M-1), and [M] is the concentration of MDZ or TET, respectively). The SV equation is used to determine the relationship between the concentration of MDZ or TET and fluorescence intensity. In the low-concentration range from 0 to 0.06 mM, the SV curve of MDZ or TET is virtually linearly connected. But the SV curve gradually deviates from the linear relationship with the increase in the antibiotic concentration (c,d). The nonlinear relationship of the SV curve may be attributed to energy transfer or the self-absorption of antibiotics. According to the fitting results, the K sv values of MDZ and TET are 1.5 \u00d7 104 and 1.45 \u00d7 104 M-1, respectively. Therefore, 1-Eu can be used as a promising fluorescent probe to detect MDZ and TET. According to the formula 3\u03c3/K sv (\u03c3 is the standard deviation), the limit of detection (LOD) of MDZ and TET is 1.46 \u00d7 10-5 and 1.51 \u00d7 10-5 M, respectively, which are almost equivalent to those reported in the literature (Table S3)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['decomposition_temperature', 'peak_spectrum', 'etc']"}]}

The molar extinction coefficient value 4.58 \u00d7 103 L\u22c5mol-1\u22c5cm-1 (261 nm) for the ligand indicates that it is an effective light-harvesting chromophore to sensitize lanthanide luminescence. The singlet state energy level 1\u03c0\u03c0* of nicotinic acid was estimated to be 35714 cm-1 from the absorbance edge (280 nm) of its UV-vis spectrum.The UV-vis absorption spectrum of the aqueous (NH4)3Al(OH)6Mo6O18\u22c57H2O (c = 2 \u00d7 10-5 mol\u22c5L-1) is shown in Figure S3 (SI).

The results of thermogravimetric analysis showed that compounds 1 and 2 mainly experienced a two-step gradual weight loss reaction. The first weight loss of 17.57% (calcd 17.60%) and 17.67% (calcd 17.52%) for compounds 1 and 2 in the range of 40-265 \u00b0C corresponds to the removal of lattice water molecules and coordinated water molecules, respectively. A sharp weight loss of 11.37% (calcd 11.13%) in the range of 385-504 \u00b0C for compound 1 and 11.35% (calcd 11.08%) in the range of 385-532 \u00b0C for compound 2 is ascribed to the decomposition of the compounds and release of organic moieties. From the TGA curves, it is known that the compounds are not stable in air. The low thermal stability is also proved by the XRD measurement for the samples of compound 1 selected as a representive which were treated under different temperatures (Figure S4, SI). It is found that the characteristic X-ray diffraction peaks of compound 1 disappear after treatment at 120 \u00b0C, indicating its amorphous character.\n\nThe intensity of all transitions decreases as the temperature is increased from 77 K to room temperature, with very similar I 77K/I rm intensity ratios of about 2.6 and 2.8 for the 5D0 \u2192 7F1 transitions for \u03bbex = 280 and 311 nm, respectively. No obvious shift of the peak positions indicated that the structure of compound 1 does not change with the increase of temperature. The temperature dependence of the luminescence intensity for all excitation wavelengths is similar, possibly because of the thermal relaxation of the O \u2192 M LMCT state. The Eu-O-Mo bond angle (152.789o) allows effective d1 hopping through f\u03c0-p\u03c0-d\u03c0 orbital mixing, resulting in inefficient energy transfer at room temperature. \n\nThe room-temperature excitation spectrum of compound 2 (black line in a') obtained by monitoring around \u03bb = 545 nm for Tb3+ showed two broad and strong bands at 225 and ca. 268 nm, which are ascribed to the electronic transitions of nicotinate ligands, and some peaks in the range of 300-400 nm correspond to the 7F6 \u2192 5L10, 5D2-3 (at 352, 369, and 378 nm) intraconfigurational forbidden 4f8 \u2192 4f8 transitions of Tb3+ ion also being detected. The absence of an excitation peak of [Al(OH)6Mo6O18]3- indicates that in contrast to the Eu analogue, the sensitization of the Tb3+ ion at room temperature is solely via the organic ligand and does not involve POM-centered LMCT states. This is due to radiationless deactivation involving Tb(III)-Mo(VI) charge transfer states leading to inefficient sensitization for Tb3+ ion, which is consistent with results from Yamase and Boskovic and their co-workers. As shown in b',c', under the excitation at 309 nm wavelength, the emission intensity of compound 2 at room temperature decreased 20 times compared to the 77 K luminescence intensity but only decreased 1.7 times at 268 nm excitation wavelength light. These results indicate more significant temperature-dependent Tb(III) sensitization for excitation through the POM compared with excitation through the nicotinate ligand.\n\nThe experimentally determined luminescence lifetimes (\u03c4obs) are 344 and 662 \u03bcs for compounds 1 and 2, respectively. The pure radiative lifetime (\u03c4R) of Eu(III) 5D0 \u2192 7FJ (J = 0-4) transitions in compound 1 is calculated to be 7080 \u03bcs by using the equation  2    1 /   \u03c4   R   =   A   MD , 0     n   3    (   I   tot   /   I   MD   )    where A MD,0 = 14.65 s-1 is the spontaneous emission probability of the 5D0 \u21927F1 transition of Eu(III), n is the refractive index of the medium, and I tot/I MD is the ratio of the integrated total area of the corrected Eu(III) emission spectrum to the area of the magnetic dipole 5D0 \u2192 7F1 transition. The intrinsic quantum yield of the Eu(III) luminescence step (\u03a6Ln) in compound 1 is evaluated to be 4.86% by using the formula \u03a6Ln = \u03c4obs /\u03c4 R. Thus, the ligand sensitization efficiency (\u03b7sens) is the product of two processes involving intersystem crossing (ISC) from the first excited singlet state of the ligand to the triplet state. The energy transfer (LET) to the lanthanide is calculated as 72.84% for compound 1 by using \u03b7sens = \u03a6tot\u03a6Ln, where the absolute emission quantum yield (\u03a6tot) of ligand-sensitized lanthanide emission is obtained experimentally to be 3.54%, which is moderate as compared to those of the compounds reported in the literature."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['peak_spectrum', 'decomposition_temperature', 'etc']"}]}

However, the complexity and inefficiency of the current fabrication approaches have hindered their further development. Herein, we demonstrate a facile one-pot solvent crystal template strategy to efficiently fabricate ZIF-8/polyurethane (PU) composites. This method eliminated the pre-synthesis and purification of MOFs, thus greatly simplifying the fabrication process. Moreover, the solvent crystal template introduced macropores in the polymer matrix, which generated a hierarchically porous structure to facilitate the molecular diffusion in the composite. The obtained ZIF-8/PU composites exhibited an accelerated dye adsorption rate constant of 1.89 \u00d7 10-3 g mg-1 min-1, which was 2.6 times higher than that of MOF powders. The Langmuir isotherm study further confirmed favorable adsorption of dye molecules with a maximum adsorption capacity of 18.1 mg g-1.\n\nHerein, we propose a facile one-pot solvent crystal template strategy to prepare ZIF-8/polyurethane (PU) composites with a hierarchically macro-/microporous structure. MOF precursors and polymers were dissolved in the solvent, which was then frozen and exchanged with iced water. Macropores in the polymer matrix were formed by the solvent crystal template, while micropores came from MOF particles crystalized during the process. This unique one-pot strategy not only avoided a time-consuming stepwise synthesis for the hierarchical architecture but also guaranteed a uniform MOF distribution within the polymer matrix. The obtained ZIF-8/PU composite showed good mechanical properties and enhanced adsorption performance. Compared with pristine MOF particles, the composite displayed a 2.61 times higher dye adsorption rate constant and a high equilibrium uptake of 6.42 mg g-1. Moreover, the adsorption isotherm study confirmed its behavior in accordance with the Langmuir adsorption model having a maximum adsorption capacity of 18.1 mg g-1.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nThe hierarchically porous ZIF-8/PU composites were fabricated by a one-pot solvent crystal template strategy, as shown in a. In brief, ZIF-8 precursors and PU were dissolved in DMSO with a mass ratio of Zn(NO3)2\u22c56H2O/2-MeIM/PU/DMSO = 0.67:1.33:1:15, which was then frozen at -25 \u00b0C. The solvent crystallized and the polymer was expelled and solidified under this temperature, leading to a bi-continuous network. The solvent crystals were leached out by soaking in iced water, and finally, the composite was obtained after vacuum-drying. It is worth mentioning that this one-pot strategy (i) alleviated the MOF aggregation and sedimentation problem since it started from a uniform mixture of MOF precursors and the polymer, (ii) eliminated the need to prepare and disperse MOF particles separately since the growth of MOFs occurred during the fabrication process, and (iii) efficiently introduced macropores since it applied a solvent crystal template that could be easily removed. The obtained composite monolith was labeled as ZIF-8/PU(2). XRD results confirmed the formation of ZIF-8 in the composite, matching well with the simulated XRD pattern (b). Additionally, the FTIR spectrum of ZIF-8/PU(2) showed peaks at 1565, 1145, and 421 cm-1, attributed to the C\ue5fbN stretching and aromatic C-N stretching from 2-MeIM and the Zn-N stretching, respectively (c). The composite morphology was characterized by SEM, as shown in d. It can be observed that ZIF-8 particles were randomly dispersed in the macroporous polymer matrix. The average sizes of MOF particles and polymer macropores were estimated to be ~34 nm and ~0.64 \u03bcm, respectively (Figure S3). MOF loading was determined by TGA and calculated to be 30.4%, corresponding to a MOF conversion of 89.8% (Figure S4 and Table S1). Besides, the composite exhibited a specific surface area of 187 m2 g-1, as determined by the nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis (Figure S5).\n\nNext, the effect of the initial ZIF-8 precursor amount on ZIF-8/PU composite properties was systematically investigated. ZIF-8/PU(x) represents the composites prepared with x mass portions of the initial MOF precursor (Table S1). In all the cases, PU and DMSO were kept at 1 portion and 15 portions, respectively. As the mass potion of the ZIF-8 precursor increased from 0.5 to 3, the surface of the PU matrix became rougher because more MOF particles were formed (Figure S6). The corresponding MOF loading increased from 10.4 to 37.0% with an average conversion of 85.6% (Figure S4 and Table S1). The mechanical properties of the composites increased first and then decreased, as displayed in . ZIF-8/PU(1) showed the best compression properties among all the samples with a Young's modulus of 1747 \u00b1 150 kPa, a yield stress of 224.3 \u00b1 7.1 kPa, and a yield strain of 11.4 \u00b1 1.3%. Besides, the cyclic compression test was performed and the ZIF-8/PU(1) composite could maintain its mechanical behavior (Figure S7). When the amount of the initial ZIF-8 precursor increased to 2 portions, the composite still retained good mechanical properties, having a Young's modulus of 1147 \u00b1 81 kPa, a yield stress of 94.1 \u00b1 7.0 kPa, and a yield strain of 9.6 \u00b1 0.4%. However, as the mass portion further increased to 3, the mechanical properties of the composite dramatically declined. This was because when a small amount of ZIF-8 was added into the composite, the compressive stress would transfer from the polymer matrix to the uniformly dispersed ZIF-8 particles, thus reinforcing the composite; however, when the amount of ZIF-8 increases to a relatively high level, some aggregation might occur and the stress could not be uniformly distributed throughout the composite, leading to a decrease in mechanical properties. Therefore, in balancing good mechanical properties and high MOF loading, ZIF-8/PU(2) could be considered a promising candidate for adsorption applications.\n\nThe macroporous network in a polymer matrix has been proven to improve the diffusion rate of guest molecules and the accessibility of MOF particles. In this work, the hierarchically porous ZIF-8/PU(2) composite was used to adsorb LY from wastewater. For comparison, the adsorption behaviors of PU and pristine ZIF-8 powder were also evaluated, as shown in . PU itself did not show any adsorption, while the other two materials exhibited similar behavior, that is, showing rapid adsorption initially and then gradually reaching their equilibrium states. However, ZIF-8/PU(2) attained the highest uptake earlier than ZIF-8 powder did (a), indicating a faster kinetics of the composite. The adsorption kinetics were then fitted with both the pseudo-first-order model and pseudo-second-order model, and the latter gave a significantly higher coefficient of determination (R2 \u2265 0.997) (b,c and ). Based on the pseudo-second-order model, the composite showed a kinetic rate constant of 1.89 \u00d7 10-3 g mg-1 min-1, which was 2.61 times higher than 7.23 \u00d7 10-4 g mg-1 min-1 of pristine ZIF-8 powder under the same condition. Furthermore, the time required to attain half of the equilibrium adsorption value (t 1/2) was 83 min for ZIF-8/PU(2), while it was much longer at 211 min for ZIF-8 powder (). Moreover, the composite possessed a dye uptake of 6.42 mg g-1 (based on the MOF mass in the composite), which was competitive with 7.85 mg g-1 of ZIF-8. The slight decrease in the dye uptake might be attributed to the partial blocking of ZIF-8 by the polymer in the composite. In addition, the composite could be recycled and retained 81% of its original uptake after three cycles (Figure S8). Finally, no structural variation could be observed on the composite, indicating its great stability (Figures S9 and S10). Therefore, the hierarchical pore structure lowered the mass transfer resistance and increased the exposure of inner surfaces, thus exhibiting a greatly improved adsorption performance.\n\nThe effect of initial concentration on LY adsorption performance of the ZIF-8/PU composite was then analyzed using the abovementioned adsorption kinetic models, as shown in  and . Similarly, the experimental results were well-fitted with the pseudo-second-order model with R2 \u2265 0.999. The rate constant, k2, decreased from 1.65 \u00d7 10-2 to 1.89 \u00d7 10-3 g mg-1 min-1 when the initial dye concentration increased from 10 to 50 mg L-1 (). This could be due to stronger competition for the adsorption sites at higher initial LY concentrations, leading to the decrease in the adsorption rate accordingly.  displays the LY adsorption isotherm study of the composite, and  lists the linear fitting parameters accordingly. The Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models have been widely applied to illustrate the organic dye adsorption onto porous materials. In this work, the isotherm adsorption data fitted better with the Langmuir model with a coefficient of determination of 0.998 (a), indicating the monolayer coverage of LY molecules on the surface of the adsorbents. Besides, it also gave the maximum LY adsorption capacity of 18.1 mg g-1. The dimensionless factor R L in all the tested concentrations was calculated to be in the range of 0-1, suggesting a favorable adsorption of LY on the composite."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['etc', 'gas_adsorption', 'peak_spectrum', 'surface_area']"}]}

Then, MNS was incorporated into a SNF-PAEK matrix as an inorganic nanofiller to prepare a series of organic-inorganic hybrid membranes (MNS@SNF-PAEK-XX). The mechanical property, methanol resistance, electrochemistry, and other properties of MNS@SNF-PAEK-XX hybrid membranes were characterized in detail. We found that the mechanical strength and methanol resistances of these hybrid membranes were improved by the formation of an ionic cross-linking structure between -NH2 of MNS and -SO3H on the side chain of SNF-PAEK. Particularly, the proton conductivity of these hybrid membranes increased obviously after the addition of MNS. MNS@SNF-PAEK-3% exhibited the proton conductivity of 0.192 S\u22c5cm-1, which was much higher than those of the pristine membrane (0.145 S\u22c5cm-1) and recast Nafion (0.134 S\u22c5cm-1) at 80 \u00b0C. This result indicated that bifunctionalized MNS rearranged the microstructure of hybrid membranes, which could accelerate the transfer of protons. The hybrid membrane (MNS@SNF-PAEK-3%) showed a better direct methanol fuel cell performance with a higher peak power density of 125.7 mW/cm2 at 80 \u00b0C and a higher open-circuit voltage (0.839 V) than the pristine membrane.\n\nFT-IR was used to further confirm the successful synthesis of MNS, and the spectra were displayed in b. Compared to pristine MIL-101, all intermediates and target MNS showed the characteristic peaks at 2934 and 3263 cm-1, ascribing to the absorption peaks for \u03bd(CH) and \u03bd(NH), respectively, which indicated the successful grafting of N-boc-ethylenediamine and the remain of ethylenediamine after sulfonation. In addition, the IR adsorption band at 1207 cm-1 for MIL-101-SO3H-NHBOC and MNS was assigned to the asymmetric vibration mode of -SO3H. Besides, the postsynthetic modification was also proved via XPS analysis (Supporting Information), where the sulfur XPS signal appeared at a binding energy of 168.97 eV corresponding to S6+ of the sulfonic acid group, whereas the nitrogen XPS signal appeared at a binding energy of 402.06 eV corresponding to N 1s of ethylenediamine that was attached to metal-oxygen clusters. Then, we drew a conclusion that MIL-101 was converted into MNS successfully by the postsynthetic modification. Besides, the SEM image in a shows the octahedral structure of MNS, as same as MIL-101, which has been reported by previous work. The result confirmed that MNS still retained its framework structure after modification. The thermodynamic stability of MOFs was measured by TGA (Supporting Information). The result showed that the decomposition temperature at 5% weight loss (T d5%) of MIL-101 and MNS was 200 and 280 \u00b0C, respectively. This indicated that they had good thermal stability to be used in DMFCs.\n\nThermal and Oxidative Stabilities and Mechanical Properties of Membranes\n\nTGA measurements of pristine and hybrid membranes were performed to evaluate whether the membranes were thermally stable within the temperature range for applications in DMFCs. As shown in , all membranes displayed two decomposition stages. The first stage starting from 220 to 330 \u00b0C belonged to the decomposition of the grafted flexible sulfoalkyl groups on the side chain, and the second stage in the range from 400 to 650 \u00b0C was assigned to the degradation of the polymer backbone. According to the data in , all the decomposition temperatures at 5% weight loss (T d5%) of samples were higher than 230 \u00b0C. After the addition of MNS, the T d5% increased from 244.93 to 266.51 \u00b0C. It is because of the cross-linked structure formed by MNS, restraining the decomposition of the polymer matrix. Therefore, the composite membranes have good thermal stabilities to be used for DMFCs.\n\nAs summarized in , all these MNS@SNF-PAEK-XX and SNF-PAEK membranes showed higher strength properties of tensile strength (33.38-36.97 MPa) and Young's modulus (0.90-1.06 GPa) than those of tensile strength and Young's modulus of recast Nafion of 13.7 MPa and 0.24 GPa, respectively. With increasing the amount of MNS addition, Young's modulus increased from 0.90 to 1.06 GPa, whereas the tensile strength increased from 33.38 to 36.97 MPa. However, the elongation at break decreased sharply from 118 to 10% as the content of MNS varied from 1-5%. Besides, the stress-strain curves of MNS@SNF-PAEK-XX membranes are shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information). It is because MNS at an increasing content exists as an ionic cross-linker in the composite membranes. Because the amino groups of ethylenediamine were immobilized onto the metal-oxygen clusters of MIL-101, they could be cross-linked with the polymer matrix of SNF-PAEK by the formation of electrostatic forces between sulfonic groups and amino groups. Furthermore, all inorganic fillers act as a physical cross-linker which blocks the movement of the molecular chain. Hence, the tensile strength of hybrid membranes increases due to the formation of the cross-linked structure, whereas the toughness decreases at a higher density of cross-linking.\n\nIEC, Water Uptake, and Swelling Ratio of Membranes\n\nAs shown in , IEC increased with increasing the content of MNS. There were large amount of sulfonic acid groups on the framework of MNS, so the addition of MNS led to extra more ionic exchange groups into the matrix, thus resulting in a higher IEC.  shows the water uptake and swelling ratio of membranes as a function of temperature. MNS@SNF-PAEK-1%, MNS@SNF-PAEK-2%, and MNS@SNF-PAEK-3% displayed higher water uptake (45.71-47.32%) than the pristine membrane (45.44%) at 30 \u00b0C. This was because extra more hydrophilic groups, such as sulfonic acid groups and amino groups, in the inorganic fillers could absorb more water. However, the water uptake of MNS@SNF-PAEK-4% and MNS@SNF-PAEK-5% (45.03 and 43.08%, respectively) was lower than that of SNF-PAEK because of higher density of the cross-linking structure formed between MNS and the polymer matrix, which restricted the water absorption. Meanwhile, all hybrid membranes exhibited lower water uptake (75.55-62.46%) than pristine membrane (75.66%) at 80 \u00b0C. This could be attributed to the interaction between the polymer matrix and MNS, which suppressed the absorption of water in the membranes. As for dimensional stability, MNS reduced the swelling ratio of the membranes, especially at high temperature (49.65 and 32.10% for SNF-PAEK and MNS@SNF-PAEK-3%, respectively).\n\nProton Conductivity, Methanol Permeability, and Selectivity of Membranes\n\nThe performance of a fuel cell is usually based on the proton conductivity of the PEM materials. The proton conductivities of all membranes were measured at 100% RH and plotted as a function of temperature (). As expected, the proton conductivities increased with increasing the temperature. All the membranes showed a proton conductivity comparable to the recast Nafion. It was interesting to observe that the proton conductivities increased first and then decreased with increasing the amount of MNS addition. The proton conductivities increased from 0.055 to 0.080 S\u22c5cm-1 at 25 \u00b0C and from 0.145 to 0.192 S\u22c5cm-1 at 80 \u00b0C as the content of MNS increased from 0 to 3%. Then, the conductivities decreased from 0.080 to 0.070 S\u22c5cm-1 at 25 \u00b0C and 0.192 to 0.174 S\u22c5cm-1 at 80 \u00b0C when the content of MNS up to 5%. This indicated that too much MNS led the polymer matrix to a high density of cross-linking, which might hinder the motion of the molecular chain. As listed in , MNS@SNF-PAEK-3% exhibited the highest proton conductivity (0.080 S\u22c5cm-1 at 25 \u00b0C and 0.198 S\u22c5cm-1 at 80 \u00b0C) among these hybrid membranes, even higher than that of recast Nafion (0.073 S\u22c5cm-1 at 25 \u00b0C and 0.134 S\u22c5cm-1 at 80 \u00b0C). The results indicated that the hybrid membranes have the potential to be used as the practical PEM for applications in fuel cells.\n\nMethanol permeability of membranes was obtained according to the method mentioned in our previous work, and the data are showed in . It could be found that hybrid membranes displayed a lower methanol permeability of 4.92 \u00d7 10-7 cm2\u22c5s-1 (MNS@SNF-PAEK-4%) compared with the pristine membrane of 6.44 \u00d7 10-7 cm2\u22c5s-1 and recast Nafion (2.18 \u00d7 10-6 cm2\u22c5s-1). In general, proton and methanol utilize the same pathway for transport, thus high conductivity leading to high methanol crossover. Selectivity (\u03c6, S\u22c5s\u22c5cm-3) is another factor to evaluate the methanol resistance property of PEMs, which shows the relationship between proton conductivity and methanol permeability. MNS makes the polymer chain be cross-linked as the hybrid membranes become more compact, and the compact structure improves the methanol resistance of hybrid membranes. For instance, MNS@SNF-PAEK-4% exhibited the highest selectivity of 15.24 \u00d7 104 S\u22c5s\u22c5cm-3, which implied that the hybrid membrane maintained its low methanol permeability even at a high conductivity. However, the extra free MNS destroys the compact structure of the polymer matrix; then, the methanol permeability increases, whereas the selectivity declined when the content of MNS increases up to 5%. However, both the pristine membrane and hybrid membranes performed much better than recast Nafion in methanol resistance (21.87 \u00d7 10-7 cm2\u22c5s-1) and selectivity (3.34 \u00d7 104 S\u22c5s\u22c5cm-3).\n\nSingle Cell Performance\n\nTo further investigate the practical application of the hybrid membranes in DMFC, a single cell measurement was carried out at 25, 40, 60, and 80 \u00b0C. As shown in a-c, the power density of membranes increased obviously with increasing the operating temperature, which is similar to the tendency of proton conductivity. d shows the peak power density of SNF-PAEK, MNS@SNF-PAEK-3%, and recast Nafion at different temperatures. The hybrid membrane (MNS@SNF-PAEK-3%) demonstrated a higher power density than the pristine SNF-PAEK membrane, especially at a low operating temperature. For instance, MNS@SNF-PAEK-3% gave peak power densities of 23.5 mW/cm2 at 25 \u00b0C and 40.2 mW/cm2 at 40 \u00b0C, much higher than those of SNF-PAEK (14.9 mW/cm2 at 25 \u00b0C and 28.6 mW/cm2 at 40 \u00b0C) and recast Nafion (9.1 mW/cm2 at 25 \u00b0C and 10.9 mW/cm2 at 40 \u00b0C). Furthermore, MNS@SNF-PAEK-3% reached high levels of peak power density at high temperatures, 79.5 mW/cm2 at 60 \u00b0C and 125.7 mW/cm2 at 80 \u00b0C. In short, higher power density is attributed to higher proton conductivity of the hybrid membrane. In addition, owing to a superior methanol resistance, MNS@SNF-PAEK-3% showed better open-circuit voltages, 0.839 V in average, compared with those of SNF-PAEK of 0.816 V and recast Nafion of 0.634 V. The maximum peak power densities of different membranes at different temperatures can be found in Table S2 (Supporting Information). Compared with other hybrid sulfonated polymeric PEMs listed in , MNS@SNF-PAEK-3% showed higher proton conductivity, good methanol resistance, and much better single cell performance. All these results indicated that the hybrid membrane based on the SNF-PAEK matrix and the MNS nanofiller has great potential to be used as alternative PEMs for DMFCs.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this study, novel SPAEK with flexible pendent sulfonic acid groups, consisting of naphthalene and fluorine on the main chain, was successfully prepared. Then, bifunctionalized MNS was used as a functional nanofiller to the SNF-PAEK matrix for preparing a series of hybrid membranes. The remarkable enhancement on dimensional stability, mechanical properties, and methanol resistance property of hybrid membranes was attributed to the incorporation of MNS that acted as an ionic physical cross-linking agent. In addition, MNS provided extra dense and sequential sulfonic acid groups and rearranged the polymer microstructure by electrostatic interactions formed by the amino groups, helping hybrid membranes display the highest proton conductivity of 0.198 S\u22c5cm-1 at 80 \u00b0C. Moreover, MNS@SNF-PAEK-3% showed an excellent single cell performance of 125.7 mW/cm2 at 80 \u00b0C, thus proving its great potential for applications in DMFCs."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['proton_conductivity', 'etc', 'peak_spectrum', 'decomposition_temperature', 'youngs_modulus', 'gas_adsorption']"}]}

The AO-ZIF-67/CS surface was superhydrophilic/superoleophilic, as displayed in a-b. The oil contact angle underwater (UWOCA) and water contact angle underoil (UOWCA) of AO-ZIF-67/CS, however, were both up to 150\u00b0, indicating the great underliquid superoleophobicity/superhydrophobicity (c-e). The wettability of ZIF-67/CS was hydrophilic with a water contact angle (WCA) of 50.0\u00b0 and superoleophilic with an oil contact angle (OCA) of almost 0\u00b0, as shown in . After modification with hydrophilic AO, the surface of AO-ZIF-67/CS will become superhydrophilic with WCA approaching 0\u00b0 because oxalate improves the affinity of the surface to water. When the surface was immersed in an aqueous solution, water could penetrate in the microstructure of the surface and replace the air to form a liquid layer due to the superhydrophilicity. This water layer would prevent oil droplets from spreading on its surface and thus demonstrate underwater superoleophobic state. The underoil superhydrophobic state of the surface could be obtained similarly. Since the structure of Cu(OH)2 on copper surface was frequently used for water droplet movement in air, evaporation behavior of a prewetted water layer on Cu(OH)2/CS and AO-ZIF-67/CS was compared as demonstrated in f. The AO-ZIF-67/CS surface exhibits greater capacity in water retention than Cu(OH)2/CS surface due to the smaller microchannels and unique microstructure of AO-ZIF-67/CS surface (). \n\nDroplets Transportation on Wedge-Shaped AO-ZIF-67/CS Surface\n\nA surface well designed for both water and oil droplet self-transportation and applicable in either air or underliquid environments could reduce the restrictions of operating conditions and enhance surface versatility compared with existing surfaces limited to one droplet or media environment. The water and dodecane transportation in air environment on a wedge-shaped AO-ZIF-67/CS surface with wedge angle (\u03b1) of 9.2\u00b0 was demonstrated in  and . When dripped on the surface, the water (or dodecane) droplet could move rapidly from the tip (narrow end) to the tail (wide end) of the surface as displayed in a-b. The evolution of droplet displacement and velocity with time was calculated in c. After dropped on the surface, the water droplet had initially a maximum velocity and then slowed on account of the decreasing unbalanced interfacial tension caused by the wedge structure until it reached the ultimate distance. The motion of dodecane droplet followed a similar pattern as water droplet; the maximum displacement of dodecane droplet (17.9 mm), however, was smaller than that of water droplet (24.5 mm) because of the low surface tension (\u03b3water = 72.8 mN/m and \u03b3dodecane = 25.4 mN/m). The maximum displacement (x max) and average velocity (V average) presented basically a negative correlation with the wedge angle of the wedge-shaped AO-ZIF-67/CS surface as shown in d. The unbalanced interfacial tension between droplet and wedge surface along the moving direction caused by the wedge-shaped structure drove the droplet moving forward to realize self-transportation. The larger wedge angle (\u03b1) would result in a reduced unbalanced interfacial tension and thus decrease the moving distance. If we further lowered the wedge angle (\u03b1) to 4.6\u00b0, however, the maximum velocity (V max, usually in the initial) of the droplet is not optimal because of the droplet bulging (e and ). The capillary force from droplet bulging impeded movement of the droplet front, and this phenomenon is more serious in the underwater environment. In addition, it is difficult to deposit the droplet onto the wedge-shaped AO-ZIF-67/CS surface with a very small wedge angle. Therefore the wedge-shaped AO-ZIF-67/CS surface with a wedge angle of 9.2\u00b0 was chosen for further experiment in applications. In addition, the stability of AO-ZIF-67/CS surface was tested. After 40 times of repeated prewetting and drying, the unchanged ultralow WCA of 0\u00b0 display that the surface has good reusable performance in ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['etc']"}]}

Explorations of the method of preparation of proton conductive MOFs and the proton transfer mechanism have enabled them to attract widespread attention, and tremendous efforts have been made to improve the proton conductivity of MOFs. On the basis of our previous work, we explicitly propose that ligand exchange can upgrade the proton conduction performance of MOFs. Using MOF-azo as the precursor, the proton conductivities of exchange products MOF-bpy and MOF-bpe increase by 3.5- and 2.8-fold, respectively. After the MOFs had been doped into the Nafion matrix to prepare composite membranes, the proton conduction performance of composite membranes filled with subproducts (2.6 \u00d7 10-2 and 1.95 \u00d7 10-2 S cm-1) is significantly better than that of a composite membrane filled with a parent product (1.12 \u00d7 10-2 S cm-1) under ambient conditions (without heating or humidifying). The ligand exchange strategy presented herein demonstrates great promise for the development of high-proton conductivity MOFs and MOF composites with expanded future applications.\n\nThe proton conduction performance of Ni-MOFs and Nafion/Ni-MOF composite membranes is significantly improved by a ligand exchange strategy. Under ambient conditions, the proton conductivities of Nafion/MOF-bpy and Nafion/MOF-bpe reach ultrahigh values of 2.6 \u00d7 10-2 and 1.95 \u00d7 10-2 S cm-1, respectively, which are 2.3- and 1.7-fold higher than that of Nafion/MOF-azo, respectively.\n\nIn this work, MOF-bpy and MOF-bpe were obtained by ligand exchange using MOF-azo as the precursor. An alternating current impedance test shows the proton conductivities of MOF-bpy and MOF-bpe are 1.27 \u00d7 10-3 and 1.01 \u00d7 10-3 S cm-1, respectively, at 100% relative humidity (RH) and 95 \u00b0C, which are 3.5- and 2.8-fold higher than that of the original MOF-azo, respectively. These MOFs are doped into the Nafion matrix to yield composite membranes. The proton conductivities of Nafion/MOF-bpy and Nafion/MOF-bpe are calculated to be 2.6 \u00d7 10-2 and 1.95 \u00d7 10-2 S cm-1, respectively, being 2.3- and 1.7-fold higher than that of Nafion/MOF-azo (1.12 \u00d7 10-2 S cm-1), respectively.\n\nThe humidity dependence of proton conduction is shown in Tables S1-S3. At 58% RH and 90 \u00b0C, the observed proton conductivities of MOF-azo, MOF-bpy, and MOF-bpe are 3.61 \u00d7 10-6, 6.09 \u00d7 10-6, and 5.54 \u00d7 10-6 S cm-1, respectively. With the RH improving to 87%, the conductivity values increase to 3.85 \u00d7 10-5, 5.61 \u00d7 10-5, and 5.83 \u00d7 10-5 S cm-1, respectively. When the humidity reaches 100%, the conductivities increase to 3.15 \u00d7 10-4, 7.29 \u00d7 10-4, and 8.31 \u00d7 10-4 S cm-1, respectively. The proton conductivity increases with relative humidity, clearly demonstrating the water-mediated proton conduction process. In the closed system, a higher humidity can contribute more water, which is adsorbed by MOFs and enters the crystal lattices. The adsorbed water is connected together with the lattice water through hydrogen bonds to form a proton conductive network. More water is adsorbed, and a larger and denser proton conductive network is generated. The proton-conducting paths will be more diverse, thereby increasing the proton conductivity of MOFs.\n\nWater vapor adsorption isotherms are used to study the relationship between the relative humidity and adsorbed water molecules (). The as-synthesized samples are immersed in acetone for 2 days to exchange the solvent molecules inside the frameworks and then dried in vacuum at 60 \u00b0C for 24 h. The solution is then replaced with fresh acetone three times a day while soaking. This activation pretreatment is to remove lattice H2O as much as possible, to make room for the absorption of water molecules from the environment. With the increase in relative pressure (relative humidity), the adsorption capacity of water molecules increases gradually. When P/P 0 is 0.99 (close to 100% RH), the adsorption capacities of MOF-azo, MOF-bpy, and MOF-bpe reach the maximum values of 378.5, 264.5, and 215.4 cm3/g, respectively, which means the higher the relative humidity, the more water molecules are adsorbed by these MOFs. For MOF-azo and MOF-bpy, their water vapor adsorption isotherms show type IV characteristics. When P/P 0 is <0.2, the isotherm is relatively flat. The rapid adsorption begins from a P/P 0 of 0.3 because the capillary condensation of water vapor occurs. After a P/P 0 of 0.7, vapor adsorption occurs only on the MOFs' outer surface whose area is much smaller than the inner surface area, so the isotherms tend to be stable. The notable hysteresis before a P/P 0 of 0.8 may also account for the fact that each [Ni1.5(L)(4,4'-azobpy)(H2O)] unit and each [Ni1.5(L)(4,4'-bpy)(H2O)] unit adsorb more free water molecules than the initial unactivated samples. The adsorbed water molecules can combine with each other to form rich hydrogen bond networks, which can be expanded by other hydrogen bonds formed between lattice water in 1D hydrophilic channels and carboxyl oxygen atoms. The strong affinity maintained by hydrogen bonding interaction makes the release of water molecules extremely slow, thus showing a distinct hysteresis. MOF-bpe exhibits a type I isotherm. In the low-pressure region (P/P 0 = 0-0.3), the adsorption capacity increases sharply, indicating that the cavity is filled as much as possible by adsorbed water vapor. Then, the isotherm shows a platform with a slow rising trend, which stemmed from the condensation of water vapor on the external surface of MOF-bpe, which is deeply inspired by the previous report. There are two  fewer adsorbed water molecules in each [Ni1.5(L)(bpe)(H2O)] unit than in the unactivated sample, which is ascribed to incomplete removal of lattice water molecules during the activation process.\n\nN2 adsorption isotherms (Figure S3) collected at 77 K are used to evaluate their intrinsic porosity. MOF-azo, MOF-bpy, and MOF-bpe have adsorption capacities of 11, 10, and 12 cm3/g, respectively, and their BET surface areas are calculated to be 2.3, 1.6, and 2.3 m2/g, respectively. The lack of adsorption sites in their frameworks and the larger kinetic diameter of N2 molecules may be the reasons for the low nitrogen adsorption capacity. The kinetic diameter of a H2O molecule (2.6 \u00c5) is 1 \u00c5 smaller than that of a N2 molecule (3.6 \u00c5). In this sense, MOFs can adsorb as many H2O molecules as possible instead of N2. As adsorption sites of water molecules, the 1D water chain in the c axis channel can form hydrogen bonds with the adsorbed H2O, which further enhances the water vapor adsorption capacity of MOFs. This explains the difference between nitrogen adsorption capacity and water vapor adsorption capacity.\n\nThe temperature-dependent proton conducting behavior of MOF-azo, MOF-bpy, and MOF-bpe can be observed at every humidity (Figures S4-S6). For example, at 93% RH and 40 \u00b0C, their proton conductivities are found to be 4.18 \u00d7 10-5, 5.07 \u00d7 10-5, and 5.15 \u00d7 10-5 S cm-1, then increase to 5.29 \u00d7 10-5, 6.72 \u00d7 10-5, and 6.83 \u00d7 10-5 S cm-1 at 60 \u00b0C, and then increase to 9.04 \u00d7 10-5, 1.40 \u00d7 10-4, and 1.33 \u00d7 10-4 S cm-1 at 90 \u00b0C, respectively. At 100% RH and 30 \u00b0C, the conductivity values of MOF-azo, MOF-bpy, and MOF-bpe are calculated to be 1.60 \u00d7 10-4, 2.45 \u00d7 10-4, and 3.06 \u00d7 10-4 S cm-1, then increase to 2.50 \u00d7 10-4, 4.22 \u00d7 10-4, and 5.78 \u00d7 10-4 S cm-1 at 70 \u00b0C, and finally reach maximum values of 3.63 \u00d7 10-4, 1.27 \u00d7 10-3, and 1.07 \u00d7 10-3 S cm-1 at 95 \u00b0C, respectively. Obviously, their proton conductivities gradually increase with temperature. This is mainly due to the boost in the internal energy of the electrolyte system caused by the increasing temperature, which accelerates the rate of mobility of proton carriers and facilitates the proton transfer through a path separated by a smaller energy barrier.\n\nThe water uptake capacity of Nafion/MOF composite membranes at room temperature is germane to proton conduction performance under ambient conditions. The water uptake and area swelling were calculated to be 37% and 21% for Nafion/MOF-azo, 36% and 19% for Nafion/MOF-bpy, 33% and 18% for Nafion/MOF-bpe, and 43% and 29% for pure Nafion, respectively. As a result of being immersed in water for a long time, these membranes have undergone a full water absorption process and show high water uptake capacity at room temperature, so it is not difficult to understand their excellent proton conductivity. In addition, the water uptake capacity and area swelling capacity of the pure Nafion membrane are higher than those of composite membranes because the molecular structures between MOFs and Nafion are quite different. Nafion has a large number of hydrophilic sulfonic groups that so easily absorb water molecules that the Nafion membrane with a flexible PTFE carbon chain expands. The relatively rigid MOFs have difficulty absorbing more water through expansion, as Nafion does. When MOFs are added to a Nafion matrix, the overall flexibility of the formed composite membranes is slightly impaired. Therefore, water uptake capacity and area swelling capacity are not as good as those of the pure Nafion membrane."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['proton_conductivity', 'gas_adsorption', 'surface_area']"}]}

The CD data recorded for SURchirMOFs [Zn2(Dcam)2DAP] n  (d-SURchirMOF-4) and [Zn2(Lcam)2DAP] n  (l-SURchirMOF-4) were shown in c.

Moreover, the enantiomeric pairs show dichroic absorption of an equal in magnitude but opposite signal.\n\nCPL is a unique property used to evaluate the chirality of chiral materials. Recently, scientists have reported a ligand-exchange approach to form a chiral zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) powder for CPL. However, such a ligand-exchange approach usually cannot exchange the ligand completely and the powder form of ZIF is also not convenient in the practical CPL application. Therefore, the in-situ epitaxial growth of MOF thin films for CPL is a promising material for CPL application. Herein, we investigate the CPL of the d- and l-SURMOF-4 grown on quartz glasses. Different handedness CPL signals () could be observed and the relative CPL signals were at ~330 nm. The results display that the CPL signals of d- and l-SURchirMOF-4 were opposite. The corresponding g lum factors (Figure S9) were ~3 \u00d7 10-3 and -8 \u00d7 10-3 for d- and l-SURchirMOF-4, respectively.\n\nTo further study the chiral recognition of d- and l-SURchirMOF-4, the adsorption performance of enantiomers can be carried out in this work. A gas phase QCM technology has been developed for investigating the enantioselectivity of homochiral MOF thin films, which can monitor mass changes with nanogram by detecting the change of resonance frequency. The d- and l-SURchirMOF-4 thin films were grown on Au-coated QCM sensors. The thickness of d-SURchirMOF-4 was measured by cross-section SEM and was about 320 nm (Figure S10). A pair of enantiomers d- and l-methyl-lactate was selected as the chiral probe molecules for studying their enantioselectivity.

The adsorption amount of d- and l-methyl-lactate for d-SURchirMOF-4 was ~2.08 (M D) and ~3.54 (M L) \u03bcg/cm2, respectively (a). The different adsorption showed an important enantioselective adsorption for one enantiomer methyl-lactate in SURchirMOF-4.

M-Fe2O3 modification increased the photocurrent density of pristine hematite at 1.23 VRHE from 0.46 to 0.96 mA\u22c5cm-2, which was more than doubled. The combination of M-Fe2O3 and M-TiO2 further increased the photocurrent to 3.08 mA\u22c5cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE, 5.7 times higher than that of pristine hematite. We found that the MOF-induced photoactivity is extremely sensitive to the concentration fluctuations, especially 1,4-BDC. As given in b, the photocurrent density increased with the rise of the Ti(OiPr)4 concentration, reaching maximum at 0.78g/60 mL, whereas further increase in the concentration led to a decrease in the photocurrent. This proves to be an optimal concentration of Ti(OiPr)4 where excessive or insufficient M-TiO2 is not conducive to the charge transport of Fe2O3/M-Fe2O3/M-TiO2 (Figure S12). In addition, it was found that the photoanode was very strongly dependent on 1,4-BDC observed in c. Starting from 3 g/60 mL, the photocurrent density of Fe2O3/M-Fe2O3/M-TiO2 decreases from 3.08 to 1.2 mA\u22c5cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE, and when it comes to 2 g/60 mL, the photocurrent density decreased by 61%. This revealed that 1,4-BDC must reach an excess, in line with the results of the aforementioned morphological characterization (Figures S8-S10). As we can see, d shows the comparison of the PEC performance when the hydrothermal substrate is converted from FeOOH to Fe2O3 by calcination (AHA-Fe2O3/TiO2). It is worth noting that AHA-Fe2O3/TiO2 shows a markedly reduced photocurrent density and increasing onset potential, suggesting the essential role of the substrate FeOOH's ability to interact with 1,4-BDC, in accordance with the SEM characterization results (Figure S13).\n\nAvoidance of Secondary Defects: Tight Interface Connection\n\nThe surface shallow trap activation is not fulfilled, still exhibiting a large number of hole accumulation due to surface defects, as shown in e (obvious transient spikes, red line). A part of surface deep traps stems from the original deep trap that has not been eliminated, and the other part stems from the secondary defects caused by surface corrosion. The self-assembly onto terminal carboxyl overcomes this potential surface secondary trap to the greatest extent because the atoms at the interface between M-Fe2O3 and M-TiO2 are regularly arranged without disorderly arrangement. The tight connection of the M-TiO2 and M-Fe2O3 would function as an electron transport channel, thereby accelerating the charge transfer of hematite. The IMPS plot was thus applied to measure the charge transit time (\u03c4) in the hematite films, followed by the following equation: \u03c4 = (2\u03c0f)-1, where f is the value of minimal frequency in the IMPS plots. As shown in a, the obtained values of f corresponding to Fe2O3, Fe2O3/M-Fe2O3, and Fe2O3/M-Fe2O3/M-TiO2 are 5.123, 4.364, and 6.975 Hz, and thus, \u03c4 values were calculated to be 31.1, 36.5, and 22.8 ms, respectively. The largest \u03c4 for Fe2O3/M-Fe2O3 demonstrated that photogenerated electrons more hardly reach the back contact, which may be caused by reintroduced surface traps in M-Fe2O3. The introduction of M-TiO2 not only constructs a well-interconnected interface but also greatly reduces the transmission resistance, thus accelerating the electron transfer, confirmed by the minimum value of \u03c4 for Fe2O3/M-Fe2O3/M-TiO2.\n\nIn addition, the chopped LSV curve of the optimal Fe2O3/M-Fe2O3/M-TiO2 in e exhibits indiscernible transient current spikes, indicating the minimum amount of hole accumulation, viz., the holes trapped by the surface shallow traps are rapidly involved in water oxidation. These positive shallow traps act as the outstanding OER active site, combined with its porous structure and water permeability characteristics, resulting in superior surface OER kinetics. As shown in the Tafel slope in Figure S17, the Tafel slope of Fe2O3/M-Fe2O3/M-TiO2 is 237 mV\u22c5dec-1, which is significantly lower than those of Fe2O3 (368 mV\u22c5dec-1) and Fe2O3/M-Fe2O3 (334 mV\u22c5dec-1), denoting the dramatically increased OER efficiency of Fe2O3/M-Fe2O3/M-TiO2."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['etc']"}]}

The permanent porosity of NU-500 was first evaluated by N2 sorption; however, almost no N2 uptake was observed at 77 K (Figure S31), likely due to the contraction of the framework after the desolvation by thermal activation. Based on the crystal structure, PLATON calculation revealed that the free volume of NU-500 was 13676 \u00c53 per unit cell (60% void space in the unit cell, compared with the unit cell volume of 22847 \u00c53). As a result, its theoretical pore volume was calculated to be 0.56 cm3/g. Due to the negligible N2 uptake of NU-500, the permanent porosity of NU-500 was attained by CO2 adsorption at 195 K (Figure S32), thanks to the enhanced molecular interactions arising from the quadrupole moment of CO2 and its smaller kinetic diameter compared to N2. The CO2 sorption isotherm showed a type I isotherm, indicating microporosity. The saturated uptake of CO2 at P/P 0 = 0.90 reached 53 cm3/g, and the surface area and pore volume were 140 m2/g and 0.03 cm3/g; the pore volume was much lower than the theoretical pore volume, meaning only a small amount of porosity was accessed. Water is a strong polar molecule, and its sorption isotherm was also collected to confirm the porosity of NU-500 (Figure S33). NU-500 showed a high water uptake of up to 200 cm3/g at P/P 0 = 0.92 and 298 K. Considering the theoretical porosity, neither CO2 nor water was able to completely reverse the structure of the closed phase. NU-600 and NU-1008 (a,c) both showed type IV isotherms, indicative of hierarchically porous structures with both micropores and mesopores, while a type I isotherm was observed for NU-906 (b), confirming its microporous structure. The calculated BET areas were 1190, 1120, and 1390 m2/g for NU-600, NU-906, and NU-1008, respectively. Pore size distributions based on DFT indicated micropores at 10.9 \u00c5 for NU-906 (e), hierarchically porous structures with micropores at 11.8 \u00c5 and mesopores at 20.0 \u00c5 for NU-600 (d), and micropores at 11.8 \u00c5 and mesopores at 29.5 \u00c5 for NU-1008 (f). The total pore volumes were 0.69, 0.45, and 0.92 cm3/g for NU-600, NU-906, and NU-1008, respectively.\n\nAdsorption of n-Hexane\n\nOwing to their high porosities, MOFs have been widely utilized as adsorbents for high gas uptakes. In this work, n-hexane was examined as the probe vapor to investigate the adsorption performance of the Zr-based MOFs with different pore volumes and sizes at 298 K. The structure of n-hexane resembles the linear alkyl chain of sulfur mustard (HD), a chemical warfare agent (CWA). Although n-hexane may have different adsorption behaviors, we utilized it as a simplified mimic of HD for understanding the adsorption of the more complex CWA. Since activated NU-500 had small pores, the saturated uptake of n-hexane was only 5.2 cm3/g at 180 mbar (P/P 0 = 1) (Figure S34); therefore, we excluded NU-500 from the comparison with the other three MOFs. As illustrated in a, the adsorption-desorption isotherms of n-hexane on NU-600, NU-906, and NU-1008 at 298 K exhibited different adsorption behaviors without hysteresis loops, indicating the robust nature of the frameworks. At 180 mbar, the saturated uptakes of n-hexane were 103.5, 79.7, and 167.7 cm3/g for NU-600, NU-906, and NU-1008, respectively. The isotherm of NU-906 showed a type I feature with steep uptake of n-hexane at a relatively low pressure (b), demonstrating strong guest--framework interactions between n-hexane and NU-906, due to van der Waals forces. Notably, NU-906 reached saturation at 2.50 mbar and adsorbed 55.6 cm3/g n-hexane, which was attributed to the presence of rhombic micropores in the NU-906 structure. The amount adsorbed of 79.7 cm3/g at 180 mbar gave a micropore volume of 0.44 cm3/g converted based on the Gurvich rule, which is close to the experimental pore volume (0.45 cm3/g) based on N2 adsorption at 77 K. In contrast, NU-600 and NU-1008 displayed distinct stepwise adsorption behaviors toward n-hexane (b). For NU-600, the isotherm of n-hexane clearly exhibited two steps. The first step up to 0.96 mbar adsorbed 19.9 cm3/g, due to the inclusion of n-hexane into the intrinsic micropores. The second step occurred with continuous increase of the pressure from 0.96 to 7.94 mbar, accompanied by further increase in n-hexane uptake, which was attributed to the continuous filling of n-hexane into the mesopore structure in NU-600. Although both NU-600 and NU-1008 are hierarchically porous structures with micropores and mesopores, NU-1008 has larger mesopores of 29.5 \u00c5 compared to those of NU-600 (20.0 \u00c5). As a result, NU-1008 displayed an interesting adsorption behavior toward n-hexane with three steps. Initially, the first step led to a steep increase in n-hexane uptake in the pressure range of 0.00-1.61 mbar with an uptake of 33.0 cm3/g, accompanied by the observed second step with an uptake of 102.6 cm3/g at 17.76 mbar. As the pressure further increased, rapid uptake of n-hexane occurred in the following narrow pressure range. This phenomenon implies that, after the n-hexane molecules were adsorbed into the hexagonal mesopores during the second step, the accommodated n-hexane molecules led to the hexagonal mesopores in NU-1008 structure narrowing into micropores, giving rise to a sharp filling that is characteristic of a micropore in the third step, resulting in the almost complete occupation of the NU-1008 framework with a final uptake of 140.7 cm3/g at 20.64 mbar.\n\nDynamic Adsorption of 2-Chloroethyl Ethyl Sulfide under Dry and Humid Conditions\n\nDue to the high toxicities of CWAs, MOFs have been designed as efficient adsorbents for high uptake of these toxic compounds. In this study, NU-600, NU-906, and NU-1008 differing in pore structures were evaluated for dynamic adsorption of 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), a sulfur mustard simulant, under both dry (0% RH) and humid (80% RH) conditions (Figure S36). Detailed procedures are provided in the Supporting Information. A CEES concentration of 4000 mg/m3 was used for breakthrough experiments herein. The loadings of CEES were compared among the investigated MOFs varying in pore size/volume and Zr6 node connectivity to confirm which factor mainly affected CEES uptake (). NU-906 with the smallest pore showed the highest uptake (13.3 mol/kg) of CEES under dry conditions among the three MOFs, due to the strong interaction between the analyte and the MOF framework. Considering that NU-906 and NU-1008 have the same 8-connected Zr6 nodes while the pore volume of NU-906 is much smaller than that of NU-1008, these results corroborated that pore size had an apparent effect on the CEES uptake under dry conditions. As demonstrated by the steep uptake of n-hexane at low pressures for NU-906 (), the microporous nature of this MOF may have facilitated the high adsorption under these breakthrough conditions.\n\nWe also analyzed the desorbed amounts of CEES to test the retained percent of the CWA simulant due to strong interactions with the MOFs (). Under dry conditions, the strong interaction between the CEES and the MOF nodes led to low desorption amounts. Only small desorbed percentages of 5.0 and 4.3% were observed for NU-600 and NU-1008, respectively, attributed to strong adsorption in the MOFs. In contrast, NU-906 had the highest percent desorbed of 10.5% while the retained loading was found to be 11.9 mol/kg CEES. A contributing factor of high loading of an analyte in MOFs is strong interactions between the analyte and the MOF framework, which can also lead to lower desorbed amounts due to the higher energy costs of desorption. For NU-906, the desorbed amount of the analyte was the highest, which may be explained by the reason that multilayer adsorption with higher loading of CEES occurs, leading to more guest-guest interactions rather than host-guest interactions. Due to the weaker interactions of CEES-CEES as compared to CEES-MOF, it is easier to desorb more. The desorption amounts were higher under humid conditions due to the competition with water for binding onto the active sites of the MOF, thereby weakening CEES-framework interactions under humid conditions. NU-600 had the highest percent desorbed of 77.3%, while NU-906 and NU-1008 had much lower percentages of analyte desorbed (13.9 and 20.7%, respectively). These results corroborated that decreasing the connectivity of the Zr6 node, thereby adding more aquo and hydroxyl moieties on the node, led to a higher percentage of the CWA simulant desorbed.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, a series of Zr-based MOFs were synthesized using the same tetratopic carboxylate linker H4TCPB-Br2, but resulting in four different topologies through tuning the synthetic solvents and modulators employed. In particular, NU-500 with a novel topology displays the first example of a 5-connected Zr6 node in MOFs. Compared to NU-600 with a she topology constructed by a 6-connected Zr6 node, both shp topology NU-906 and csq topology NU-1008 are constructed by 8-connected Zr6 nodes with different conformations of the flexible tetratopic carboxylate linker. H4TCPB-Br2 serves as a flexible building block capable of rotational deformations that adjust its geometrical characteristics between the inner phenyl ring and the outer phenyl ring allowing it to fit well into particular structures. The adsorption performance of n-hexane, used as a simplified model of sulfur mustard, within these MOFs illustrates the occurrence of distinct adsorption behaviors corresponding to their specific pore structures, demonstrating the relationship between structure and n-hexane uptake. CEES dynamic adsorption revealed that NU-906, possessing the smallest pores, has the highest uptake of 13.3 mmol/kg under dry conditions, confirming that pore size has an apparent effect on the CEES uptake. With exposure to moisture, the competing adsorption between water and the CWA simulant led to reduced loading of the CWA simulant. Our work highlights that polyaromatic carboxylate linkers are excellent platforms for constructing Zr-based MOFs and facilitate the discovery of novel structures, enriching the structural diversity present in these materials."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['surface_area', 'pore_volume', 'gas_adsorption', 'pore_diameter']"}]}

According to the DSC analysis (), the uncoated ECM underwent an endothermic event with onset at 59.7 \u00b0C, which can be attributed to the start of the denaturation of the collagen protein. The biomimetically synthesized ZIF-8 coating (in the ECM-MOF composite) shifted the denaturation temperature to 64.8 \u00b0C, offering a mild benefit in structure stabilization.\n\nMOF composites are commonly characterized with respect to the crystal structure, thermal stability, and porosity, whereas the mechanical properties are rarely accounted for. In this study, the viscoelastic properties of the ECM-MOF composite were investigated by DMA (). A repeated-measures ANOVA with a Greenhouse-Geisser correction determined that the complex modulus (E*) means differed significantly between time points [F(1.917, 13.420) = 70.945, p < 0.001]. Post hoc analysis with a Bonferroni adjustment revealed that E* increased from pre-treatment (baseline) to any time points of the post-treatment: immediate (p < 0.01), 10 d (p < 0.01), 30 d (p < 0.01), and 90 d (p < 0.01). Immediately after the biomimetic growth of the MOF coating, the E* mean increased to 17.1 \u00b1 2.4 MPa (A), representing a twofold increase over the baseline (8.8 \u00b1 1.3 MPa). Another significant increment (p = 0.002) occurred from post-treatment (immediate) to 10 d (E* = 24.2 \u00b1 4.7 MPa). Then, a plateau was maintained during the simulated physiological aging (10-90 d), and the means differences were not significant (p > 0.2). The relatively higher E* means indicate an improvement in the stiffness of the ECM after the MOF formation. Thus, enhanced mechanical strength was imparted to the dentin ECM by the ZIF-8 coating.\n\nThe increment in mechanical strength provided by the ZIF-8 coating is relatively low compared to that of natural collagen cross-linkers or the native mineral phase. Nevertheless, the increment is enough to sustain a crystalline framework that withstands stress, including destructive enzymes. A primary goal of this study was to verify if protective ZIF-8 coatings can improve the biostability of fibrillar collagen, preventing its degradation due to hydrolysis and enzyme action. The results of the collagen degradation assay () suggest that MOF-modified collagen (ECM-MOF) degrades nearly twice less than unmodified collagen (ECM) under physiological conditions. Furthermore, when exposed to collagen-degrading enzymes to accelerate the proteolysis, the ECM-MOF composite degraded significantly less (205.1 \u00b1 37.3 \u03bcg mL-1) than the unprotected ECM (480.2 \u00b1 22.8 \u03bcg mL-1).\n\nSurface roughness, a critical parameter for adhesion in dentin, should be considered in modifications of the dentin matrix with hybrid materials. The roughness of the ECM-MOF composite was estimated from AFM images (). The arithmetic average roughness (R a) was 12.0 \u00b1 3.7 and 78.4 \u00b1 6.7 nm for the ECM and EM-MOF, respectively. The considerably rougher texture that the frameworks impart to the dentin matrix creates extended surface area, beneficial to dentin bonding. Furthermore, the hydrophobic and microporous nature of ZIF-8 could favor the infiltration of apolar resin monomers, commonly used in dentin bonding procedures. \n\nBiomedical applications often require biomaterials to be engineered with crucial biocompatible characteristics, including low toxicity. When integrating the dentin ECM with MOFs, the resulting composite must maintain good compatibility with cells relevant to the tooth tissues. A shows the viability of DPSCs cultured on ECM and ECM-MOF substrates. A Tukey post hoc test (on a one-way ANOVA) revealed no statistically significant differences between the ECM and ECM-MOF groups after 1 d (p = 0.959) and 3 d (p = 0.546). However, after 7 d of culture, the cell viability was higher on the ECM surface than the ECM-MOF (p < 0.001). Overall, the cell proliferation followed a similar trend on both substrates (Supporting Information, Figure S2), but the MOF coating led to a lower proliferation rate compared to the uncoated scaffolds (ECM). Except for a slower proliferation, cytotoxic effects were not substantiated by the results. For instance, the ECM-MOF group's viability reached 434.9% by the end of the experiment (A). In addition, strong evidence of the viability of attached DPSCs is presented in C, where primarily live cells are observed on the composite's surface. The DPSCs on the ECM-MOF samples exhibited elongated shapes similar to the control group (B)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['decomposition_temperature', 'etc']"}]}

The MOF features interlayer \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interaction between the RhB molecules with an overlap of almost 100%. One- and two-photon-excited fluorescence measurements were carried out on micrometer-sized single crystals of varied thickness with continuous-wave and femtosecond pulsed lasers, respectively. The two-photon absorption coefficient was measured relative to the CdS crystal and found to be 7.1 \u00b1 0.7 cm/GW at a wavelength of 1030 nm. Our findings demonstrate a new way of achieving solid-state dye microlasers or microsized light-frequency upconverters.\n\nTo establish the effect of the coordinated RhB dye, the emission spectra of three different forms (powder, solution, and MOF crystal) were examined, as shown in . A large red shift in the emission peak between the solution (\u03bbem = 570 nm) and powder (\u03bbem = 710 nm) was observed that could be attributed to the presence of higher molecular aggregates of RhB in the powder form. A red shift between the emission peaks of RhB in solution and MOF crystal was also observed, attributable to the highly rigid form of coordinated RhB in 1 that prohibited nonradiative decay. Furthermore, the emission peak of 1 appeared at 675 nm, which was blue-shifted by 35 nm compared to RhB in the form of powder. This small blue shift in 1 was due to the dimeric form of RhB, which showed strong \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interaction in the crystal structure.\n\nA commercial microscope setup (Nikon, Eclipse Ti-2) (Scheme S2) was employed to conduct one-photon fluorescence (OPF), TPF, and time-resolved TPF measurements. The details on the different measurements can be found in Table S1. Linear- and nonlinear-optical measurements on the crystals of 1 were carried out using the above-mentioned setup without using the half-wave plate along the beam path. OPF experiments were conducted on single crystals of three different thicknesses (20, 26, and 30 \u03bcm) under a continuous-wave laser excitation at \u03bbex = 403 nm with varying power density.  shows the emission spectrum from a 30-\u03bcm-thick crystal as an example (see Figure S11 for more results on 20- and 26-\u03bcm-thick crystals). The log-log plot of integrated fluorescence versus excitation power density, given as the inset, afforded a value of 1.0 for the slope, implying the involvement of one-photon absorption (OPA) process.\n\nTime-resolved TPF measurements were also performed to determine the excited-state lifetime using the time-correlated single-photon-counting method. Three spots were randomly selected (a) on a single crystal of 1 (thickness ~26 \u03bcm) for the measurements. The decay time (for 0\u00b0 polarization excitation) for three different spots were found to be (32 \u00b1 3) \u00d7 10, (32 \u00b1 3) \u00d7 10, and (33 \u00b1 3) \u00d7 10 ps, which were ~10 times smaller than the radiative decay time of the RhB solution in an acetonitrile solvent. (see the SI for a detailed calculation of the decay time of spots 1-3). The reduction of the TPF lifetime of RhB in the MOF was due to an efficient energy transfer, which was ensured by the presence of the ligand L. Furthermore, the excitation power and polarization dependence of time-resolved TPF were also investigated. The polarization dependence of time-resolved TPF measurements were done by employing an additional half-wave plate in the setup (Scheme S2). b shows the normalized time-resolved TPF signals for various laser excitation powers. Parts c and d of  show the polarization-resolved TPF decay time for a laser excitation density of 63 GW/cm2. The polar plot shown in c reveals an isotropic decay time for crystal 1. These measurements showed that the decay time was independent of both the excitation power and polarization of the laser beam.\n\nThe two-photon action cross section, \u03b7\u03b2, was measured relative to a standard crystal of CdS (thickness ~1 mm). The quantum efficiency (\u03b7) and TPA coefficient (\u03b2) of the CdS crystal are 0.01 and 6.4 cm/GW, respectively. The Rayleigh length of the excitation Gaussian beam was found to be 12 \u03bcm (for 1030 nm). Because the thickness of the CdS crystal was 1 mm, which was far greater than the Rayleigh length of the excitation beam, TPF of CdS was considered to occur within a length of 2z 0. By using , the value of \u03b7\u03b2 for a crystal of 1 (thickness~ 30 \u03bcm) was found to be 7.1 \u00b1 0.72 cm/GW. This value was 1 order greater than that of the CdS crystal. Such a large action cross section was attributed to the presence of large voids within the MOF unit cell (~47%), preventing RhB from aggregation-induced fluorescence quenching, as was the case for tightly arranged organic crystals formed from molecular chromophores. It was also suggested that restriction of the intramolecular rotation of the chromophore molecule in a rigid structure can enhance the TPF efficiency. Because RhB molecules themselves acted as spatially confined ligands, their intramolecular rotations were limited, which facilitated a large value of the two-photon action cross section. Such a 2D-layered MOF crystal with a large \u03b7\u03b2 value should possess great potential for solid-state dye microlasers or microsized light-frequency upconverters.\n\nThe thermal stability of 1 was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA; Figure S9). TGA revealed a loss of DMF solvent molecules up to ~260 \u00b0C and decomposition of the framework could be achieved only beyond ~400 \u00b0C. Further stability studies were performed using variable-temperature powder X-ray diffraction (VT-PXRD; Figure S10a,b). PXRD of the as-synthesized and simulated patterns matched well, suggesting phase purity of the bulk sample. Furthermore, VT-PXRD analysis suggested the sample retained its crystallinity at least up to 200 \u00b0C. The porosity of 1 was further examined by N2 gas sorption measurement. As shown in Figure S16, the N2 gas adsorption measurement at 77 K and 1 atm revealed a type I isotherm with a maximum uptake of 79.9 cm3/g (STP) corresponding to a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of 263 m2/g.\n\nIn conclusion, we have designed and demonstrated a novel type of micrometer-sized MOF with the incorporation of RhB dye molecule as the coordinating organic ligand and investigated the enhancement in TPF efficiency of these MOF crystals. In contrast to the aggregation-induced fluorescence quenching in solid-state organic dyes, the RhB-coordinated network in 1 exhibits a highly efficient TPF with an action cross section of 7.1 \u00b1 0.72 cm/GW. Restriction of the intramolecular rotation of RhB molecules, combined with the presence of a large void in the framework, resulted in such an efficient TPF. Thus, MOF 1 promises to be a suitable candidate as a cost-effective luminescent material in solid-state form for many photonic applications. Our synthesis approach also promises a systematic realization of highly luminescent MOF crystals by the rational choice of dye molecules with the coordinating ability to the MOF framework. Such MOF crystals with large two-photon action cross section values should possess great potential for solid-state dye microlasers or microsized light-frequency upconverters."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['peak_spectrum', 'etc', 'decomposition_temperature', 'gas_adsorption', 'surface_area']"}]}

In this work, we demonstrate that the bi-copper sites on the crystal surface of a metal-organic framework Cu-HITP (HITP = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene) are very suitable for catalyzing the low-energy pathway of *CO coupling with *COH to form *OCCOH. The in situ infrared spectroscopy, theoretic calculations, and controlled experiments show that polydopamine coating of Cu-HITP could provide a carbon dioxide reduction reaction-favored local environment with proton sources and hydrogen-bond donors around the bi-copper active sites to promote *CO hydrogenation and stabilize the key intermediates (*COH and *OCCOH), resulting in a high selectivity of the C2+ reduced products [Faradaic efficiency (C2+) of 75(3)%, Faradaic efficiency (C2H4) of 51(1)%] in the KHCO3 electrolyte. This work provides an insight into the catalytic activity on the surface of metal-organic frameworks and the local environment for electroreduction of CO2 to C2+ products.\n\nThe catalytic CO2RR performances of Cu-HITP were assessed in a gastight H-type electrochemical cell separated by a proton exchange membrane. The working electrode was prepared by coating the microcrystalline powder of the catalyst onto the glassy carbon electrode with a Nafion (perfluorosulfonic acid-PTFE copolymer) binder. Then, the performance of CO2RR was tested in a CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte. The gaseous and liquid products were monitored and analyzed by using online gas chromatography (GC) (Figures S24-S29) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra, respectively (Figure S30). The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of Cu-HITP showed that the current density measured in the CO2-saturated electrolyte is significantly higher than that measured in the Ar-saturated electrolyte (Figure S5), suggesting that the intrinsic activity of the catalyst is for CO2RR rather than for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Notably, Cu-HITP shows a high selectivity for ethylene [FE(C2H4) = 30%] and less hydrogen production [FE(H2) = 17%] at -1.2 V versus RHE (Figure S6). Combined with liquid-phase products, the FE(C2+) products (including ethylene, ethanol, and acetic acid) of Cu-HITP (a) reach 42(2)% with a current density of 5.2 mA cm-2 at -1.2 V versus RHE. We also measured the CO2RR performance of the nanosheet sample (Figure S9) of Cu-HITP. Compared to the rod-like sample, the nanosheet sample shows a much poor performance [FE(C2+) of 14%] of CO2RR to C2+ products. Both the structural analysis (Figure S7) and TEM images (Figures S2 and S8) showed that there are more bi-copper sites on the surface of the rod-like sample, while the nanosheet sample has more CuN4 sites, suggesting that the bi-copper sites () along the c-axis on the surface of the Cu-HITP crystal might be the active sites for CO2RR to give C2+ products. On the one hand, the distance between adjacent Cu sites (d Cu-Cu = 3.4 \u00c5) is very suitable for catalyzing *CO coupling with *COH to form *OCCOH in the low-energy pathway. Additionally, it is possible to improve the FE(C2+) by providing a CO2RR-favored local environment (with proton sources and hydrogen-bond donors) around the bi-copper active sites. \n\nWith amino (-NH-) and phenolic hydroxyl groups, conductive polymer PDA can be used as hydrogen-bond donors and proton sources at the same time (a and S23). Therefore, coating it on the Cu-HITP surface may significantly increase the C2+ products' selectivities. With all this in mind, we assembled PDA in situ on the Cu-HITP surface through the self-polymerization reaction of dopamine and fabricated Cu-HITP@PDA samples with different PDA coating amounts at mass ratios of Cu-HITP/dopamine of 10/1, 10/3, 10/5, and 10/7 (Figure S11) to find out the optimal amount of coating. Also, the HRTEM and SEM images of Cu-HITP@PDA (d and S10-S15) showed that the Cu-HITP crystal was coated by a uniform shell, suggesting the existence of PDA. Besides, compared with the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy line scan mode of Cu-HITP, the shell of Cu-HITP@PDA has an O element, suggesting the shell of PDA on the Cu-HITP core (f). The LSV curves show that Cu-HITP@PDA and Cu-HITP exhibit similar current density (Figure S16). As depicted in a, as the amount of PDA coating increased, the yield of CO and CH4 products decreased, while the selectivity of C2+ products increased; especially, the FE of C2H4 was improved from 30.8 to 51% (Figure S32). Furthermore, with the increase in potential, the FE of the C2+ products increased gradually and reached a maximum value of 75(3)% at -1.2 V versus RHE and then decreased (b). Also, the best performance gives 75(3)% FE(C2+) (C2H4, n-PrOH, EtOH, and CH3COOH), 4(0.39)% FE(CH4), 3(1.5)% FE(HCOOH), 0.62(0.23)% FE(CH3OH), 3(1.1)% FE(CO), and 13(3.1)% FE(H2) at -1.2 V versus RHE (b). The FE(C2+) value of Cu-HITP@PDA is much higher than that of Cu-HITP under the same conditions, indicating that the local chemical environment (local hydrogen bonding and proton sources) formed by the PDA shell around the bi-copper active sites plays a critical role in improving the selectivity of C2+ products. It should be noted that the performance of Cu-HITP@PDA is obviously higher than that of most electrocatalysts and only slightly lower than that of three Cu-based nanomaterials [Re-Cu-I, boron-doped copper, and Cu-polyaniline (PANI)] under neutral conditions in the H-cell (c and Table S2). The definite structure-property relationship established by this well-defined structural model system (Cu-HITP@PDA) can provide more insights on the reaction mechanism for understanding the C-C coupling and optimizing the C-C coupling pathway.\n\nCompared with the H-type cell, CO2 gas can flow continuously through the gas-diffusion layer in a flow cell, thus facilitating the mass transfer of CO2 to the electrocatalyst and leading to an increase in current density. The LSV curves of Cu-HITP@PDA in a three-electrode flow cell with a gas diffusion electrode as the working electrode in a 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous solution were also measured. At -1.2 V versus RHE, the current density increased to 55 mA cm-2 and reached 130 mA cm-2 at -1.5 V versus RHE (Figure S46), and no obvious degradation was observed at 55 mA cm-2 over 10 h of continuous operation (Figure S47). In a 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution, benefitting from diverse functions (influencing Bader charge of catalyst surfaces and tuning the catalytic pathway by nucleophilic reactions with surface intermediates) of OH- ions, the current density could even reach 310 mA cm-2 (-1.2 V vs RHE), which is over the commercially relevant current density of 300 mA cm-2. Importantly, after 10 h of electrolysis at a current density of 310 mA cm-2, no significant decay was observed (Figure S47)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['selectivity', 'etc']"}]}

Single crystal X-ray structure analysis shows that 1 crystallizes in the chiral space group of P21212. The asymmetric unit of 1 consists of three independent Zn ions, two 4-pca ligands, one \u03bc3-ade ligands, and one coordinated water molecule (Figure a). Two 4-pca ligands adopt one kind of coordination mode: two pyrazole nitrogen atoms bridge two Zn(II) ions and one carboxylate oxygen atom connects one Zn(II) ion. The \u03bc3-ade ligand links three independent Zn ions, and two Zn ions (Zn1 and Zn2) are bridged together by one \u03bc3-ade ligand and two 4-pca ligands to form a dinuclear unit with Zn\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Zn distance of 3.3338(15) \u00c5. All independent Zn ions adopt tetrahedral coordination geometry. The dinuclear unit is surrounded by one \u03bc3-ade ligand, one aqua molecule, and three 4-pca ligands, while the simple Zn3 center is bonded by two nitrogen atoms from two ade ligands and two oxygen atoms from two 4-pca ligands. The dinuclear units and the Zn3 centers are further connected to other neighboring units to construct a 3D open framework (Figure b). Here, both the binuclear unit and Zn3 center act as 4-connected nodes, so the final framework of 1 can be topologically represented as a qtz net (Figure c). Since qtz net is intrinsically chiral, the chirality presented in this framework is obvious. The framework of 1 contains right-handed helices along the b-axis, giving rise to the left-handed channel (Figures b,d); the opening size of the window is ~5.2 \u00c5 \u00d7 6.7 \u00c5, which is explored by the Poreblazer V 3.1.2 program. The void volume of 1 is 53.3% of the crystal volume (1972.3 out of the 3700.4 \u00c53 unit cell volume), calculated by PLATON (probe radius = 1.80 \u00c5). \n\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of 1 was carried out under N2 atmosphere (Figure S1 in the ), revealing that compound 1 can be stable up to 320 \u00b0C. A fresh sample of 1 was dipped in methanol, the solution was exchanged ten times in 3 days, and then TGA of the activated sample was also performed. Activated compound 1 has weight loss of about 27% from 30 to 250 \u00b0C, indicating that the guests can be removed from the framework. Variable-temperature powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurement for 1 was performed from room temperature to 240 \u00b0C under an air atmosphere (Figure  and Figure S2, ). The peaks of dehydrated compound 1 shows obvious shifting from low angles to high angles (9.94\u00b0, 11.27\u00b0, and 22.25\u00b0 oriented toward to 10.38\u00b0, 11.98\u00b0, and 23.93\u00b0, respectively), confirming the flexibility and shrinkage of the framework. Moreover, the energy of the structure without guest molecules was minimized by Materials Studio/Forcite. The peak positions of the computational model from 10.19\u00b0 shift slightly toward high angle compared with the peaks of the original sample. This result also proves that the framework has a degree of flexibility (Figure S4, ). Additionally, the PXRD patterns could return back the original one, when the activated 1 was immersed in DMF solvent again (Figure S3 in the ). The results show that the contraction-opening of the framework is reversible.\n\nThe flexible features of the porous framework as well as free amino groups presented in the pores prompted us to investigate the gas sorption properties of 1. The permanent porosity of the desolvated form of 1 was established by N2 sorption experiments at 77 K, which showed type-I adsorption isotherm behavior (Figure S5 in the ). The Langmuir and BET surface areas were 526.8 and 368.7 m2 g-1, respectively.\n\nThe adsorption of the C1 to C3 light hydrocarbons was performed at 273 K and room temperature. The gas sorption isotherms of 1 are shown in Figure . Generally, the adsorption capacity of CH4 is relatively low, due to the weak interaction between methane and framework. The uptake values of other small hydrocarbons follow the trend C2H2 > C2H4 > C2H6 ~ C3H8, which is in line with the increasing of kinetic diameter of the gases. Moreover, large hysteretic behaviors can be observed. Compound 1 can take up 134.0 cm3 g -1 C2H2, and a moderate amount of C2H4 (90.0 cm3 g-1), C2H6 (84.3 cm3 g-1), and C3H8 (80 cm3 g-1) at 273 K and 1 bar and C2H2 (109.9 cm3 g-1), C2H4 (79.3 cm3 g-1), C2H6 (69.3 cm3 g-1), and C3H8 (73.4 cm3 g-1) at 290 K and 1 bar.\n\nSpecially, for the dynamic adsorption of compound 1 at 273 K, the adsorption branch of C2H2 shows a slight slope on the whole. The desorption pathway cannot trace the adsorption curve, resulting in a hysteretic behavior. Different from C2H2, the isotherms of C2H4 and C2H6 show distinct hysteretic loops. The opening pressure from narrow pore to big pore need 610 and 550 mmHg for C2H4 and C2H6, then the C2H4 and C2H6 adsorption abruptly increase, and the door-closing pressure is nearly up to 760 mmHg for C2H4 and C2H6. Moreover, the desorption branches only have slight decrease until 89 and 101 mmHg, generating very large hysteretic loops. These results indicate that such compound could serve as the candidate for ethylene and ethane storage via a kinetics-based trapping process. For C3H8, the first stage reaches the inflection point at a very low pressure of 29 mmHg, and the uptake is close to saturation at 110 mmHg. Obviously, the transformation pressure between narrow pore and large pore of C3H8 becomes lower than that of C2H4 and C2H6."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['topology', 'space_group', 'porosity', 'decomposition_temperature', 'surface_area', 'gas_adsorption']"}]}

X-Ray diffraction analysis revealed a 2-D arrangement of octahedrally co-ordinated metal cations where di-\u03bc-(1,3)-N3-bridged metallic chains are connected through bpa ligands. IR and UV-VIS spectra were consistent with this structural characterisation. Magnetic analysis carried out by means of ESR spectroscopy and susceptibility measurements indicated that the three compounds are antiferromagnetic, J values being -5.7, -14.0 and -80 cm-1 for 1, 2 and 3, respectively.\n\nThe diffuse reflectance spectrum for compound 2 is typical of octahedral high spin cobalt(II) complexes. Thus, the UV-VIS spectrum shows three spin-allowed transitions from 4T1g to 4T2g (\u03bd1 8698 cm-1), 4A2g (\u03bd2 18886 cm-1) and 4T1g(P) (\u03bd3 20585 cm-1), respectively, the \u03bd2 transition appearing as a shoulder of \u03bd3 (\u03bd2/\u03bd1 = 2.17). The values of Dq = 683 cm-1 and B = 668 cm-1 which have been calculated from these transitions are typical for high spin cobalt(II) complexes. The value of B is indicative of a 70% covalency of the Co-N bonds in 2. The spectrum also shows a charge-transfer band above 30000 cm-1.\n\nCompound 3 exhibits four UV-VIS bands which have been assigned to the spin allowed transitions from 3A2g to 3T2g (\u03bd1 9622 cm-1), 3T1g (\u03bd3 15867 cm-1) and 3T1g(P) (\u03bd4 28800 cm-1) and the spin forbidden transition to 1Eg (\u03bd2 15415 cm-1). According to these bands, values of Dq = 962 cm-1, B = 954 cm-1 and C = 4175 cm-1 have been calculated (indicating an 88% covalency of the Ni-N bonds). These values are typical for octahedral nickel(II) compounds. The spectrum also shows a charge-transfer band above 35000 cm-1.\n\nESR spectroscopy and magnetic properties\n\nX-Band powdered ESR spectra recorded for compound 1 exhibit isotropic signals (g ;= 2.000) over the whole range of temperature (4-300 K) studied. This  is consistent with the presence of octahedral MnN6 chromophores in which manganese(II) ions are very slightly distorted. In order to study the thermal variation of the area under the ESR signal (which is directly proportional to the magnetic susceptibility), the \u0394H (linewidth in Gauss) and I (intensity in arbitrary units) of the signals at each temperature were estimated by fitting the spectra by Lorentzian curves (R > 0.999 for T \u2265 50 K, >0.99 for T \u2265 15 K, >0.96 for T \u2265 4 K). The variations of the gain, attenuation and modulation amplitude during measurements were considered for the fitting.\n\nPlotting \u0394Hvs. T () reveals that the linewidth remains practically constant down to 50 K, at which a broadening can be observed. The great increase of the linewidth is indicative of 1-D magnetic coupling taking place at low temperatures. This can also be deduced from the analysis of the thermal variation of the signal area (I\u22c5\u0394H product which is also shown in ). Thus, I\u22c5\u0394H values continuously increase upon cooling to a broad maximum (ca. 65 K) below which the curve rapidly decreases. The 1-D ordering temperature has been estimated to be 36 K, at which a tangent plotted on the increasing region of \u0394H reaches the zero value (). The nature and extension of the 1-D magnetic coupling deduced from ESR spectroscopy will be discussed below after analysing the magnetic susceptibility data.\n\n shows the thermal variation of the magnetic susceptibility, \u03c7m, and the \u03c7mT product for compound 1. As can be seen, \u03c7m values increase for decreasing temperatures (from 11.31 \u00d7 10-3 cm3 mol-1 at RT) reaching a broad maximum at 62 K (18.18 \u00d7 10-3 cm3 mol-1). The curve drops to a minimum at 12 K (15.35 \u00d7 10-3 cm3 mol-1), at which \u03c7m values exponentially increase upon further cooling. The \u03c7mT magnitude continuously decreases with decreasing temperature. On the other hand, \u03c7m-1 has been observed not to follow the Curie-Weiss law over the measured temperature range.\n\nTaking into account that the magnetic interactions through bpa ligands must be very weak, just the coupling through azide-bridged chains should be considered to be responsible for the bulk magnetic behaviour. Therefore, magnetic data can be interpreted in terms of an infinite-spin, linear chain model, , scaled for S = 5/2, where N and k are the Avogadro and Boltzmann constants, respectively, and \u03b2 is the Bohr magneton. According to , the best fit parameters for compound 1 have been determined to be g = 2.003 (in good agreement with the experimental data) and J = -5.7 cm-1. As can be seen in , this theoretical curve quite well reproduces the thermal variation of \u03c7m, with the exception of the region below 12 K. These data indicate the occurrence of antiferromagnetic coupling along the di-\u03bc-(1,3)-N3 chains, which accounts for the bulk magnetic behaviour down to the minimum. The further increase of \u03c7m can be explained by considering the presence of a paramagnetic impurity of the same molar mass as 1 whose contribution (\u03b4) can be evaluated by means of . The best fitting obtained by using  corresponds to \u03b4 = 0.002 and the same values of J and g (-5.7 cm-1 and 2.003, respectively). As can be seen in , the corresponding theoretical curve does reproduce a minimum at 12 K but exhibits noticeable discrepancy with the experimental \u03c7m around it. Therefore, although present in small amount, the contribution of the impurity clearly obscures the antiferromagnetic coupling at very low temperatures.\n\nThe magnetic data recorded for compound 2 are displayed in  as the thermal variation of \u03c7m and \u03c7mT. As can be observed, the curves are qualitatively similar to those for 1. Thus, \u03c7m values increase (from 8.58 \u00d7 10-3 cm3 mol-1 at RT) upon cooling reaching a maximum (ca. 62 K, 14.02 \u00d7 10-3 cm3 mol-1), followed by a drop to 26 K (1.30 \u00d7 10-3 cm3 mol-1) and a further increase. Additionally, the \u03c7mvs. T curve shows another small maximum at 54 K (14.59 \u00d7 10-3 cm3 mol-1) which will be discussed below. The \u03c7mT values, on the other hand, continuously decrease upon cooling. As for 1, \u03c7m-1 does not follow the Curie-Weiss law. The bulk magnetic behaviour of compound 2 should also be expected to be the result of the antiferromagnetic coupling along the azide-bridged chains. Therefore, \u03c7m* in  has been calculated by using \u03c7m in  scaled for S = 3/2. The best fit parameters were J = -14.0 cm-1, g = 2.69 and \u03b4 = 0.015 (the molar mass of the impurity being the same as that of 2). As can be seen in , the theoretical data quite well reproduce both \u03c7m and \u03c7mT experimental values, with the exception of the region close to the minimum in \u03c7m. This discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that S = 1/2 can be expected to be the most populated state at low temperatures. It should also be pointed out that, on the JS(S + 1) criterion (S(S + 1) being the scaling parameter for , the values of J for 1 and 2 are comparable in magnitude."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['magnetic_susceptibility', 'peak_spectrum']"}]}

The DTG of the precursor (1) shows systematic four distinct stages of heat gain at 107.7, 278.5, 328.7 and 448.6 \u00b0C () during the thermal pyrolysis process. The  indicates that thermal degradation of (1) begins slowly with the loss of one THF molecule at 107.7 \u00b0C, consistent with a weight loss of 5.8%. The second and major degradation of the complex takes place in the temperature range of 107.7-278.5 \u00b0C corresponding to a weight loss of 35.5%. This weight loss is attributed to the loss of three THF molecules and two acetate groups. The third phase begins with the loss of two trifluoroacetate groups showing a weight loss of 54.9% of the total mass of the complex (1) at 328.7 \u00b0C. Most of the compound has been degraded before the onset of the final pyrolysis stage. The final step of the weight loss begins at 448 \u00b0C yielding a solid residue. Further heating of the residue to 600 \u00b0C did not bring any change in weight indicating complete  of (1) to furnish a 34.2% of the residual mass, which is a little greater than the expected value of 32% for CdO as indicated in the chemical equation below:\n\nThis small difference in weight% of CdO is attributed to the presence of carbon contamination that is not removed at this temperature. This is also supported by  of the thin films.  \n\n2.3  studies\n\nA representative  pattern of zinc-cadmium oxide solid solution thin films prepared in THF solution is shown in . Similar patterns were observed for films deposited from  and  and are given in the ESI (Fig. S7 and S8). All the diffraction peaks can be indexed to the hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO with lattice constants of a = 3.25 and c = 5.22 \u00c5, and the diffraction pattern matches well with the literature. In the XRD, peaks at 2\u03b8 values of 31.68\u00b0, 34.36\u00b0, 36.1\u00b0, 47.42\u00b0 and 56.2\u00b0 correspond respectively to (100), (002), (101), (102) and (110) lattice reflection planes of a hexagonal wurtzite structure showing that the 17% substitution of small Zn (r = 74 \u00c5) by the large Cd (r = 97 \u00c5) atoms did not bring any change in the original hexagonal structure of ZnO. Furthermore, no impurities such as CdO (intense peak at 2\u03b8 = 44.228\u00b0 is missing) or formation of any other phase were detected.\n\n2.5 Band gap\n\nWe have chosen thin films having particle sizes in the nanorange and possessing high concentrations of cadmium for band gap measurements. The  of thin films deposited at 500 \u00b0C using THF  having a thickness of 350 nm ( KLA Tencore P-6 surface profiler) was recorded on a Lambda 35 Perkin-Elmer   in the wavelength range of 300-850 nm using a similar FTO coated glass substrate as a reference to exclude the substrate contribution in the spectrum. The   of the Zn0.83Cd0.17O thin film shows an absorption edge at 402 nm and the band gap was calculated by plotting the Tauc plot of energy versus (\u03b1h\u03bd)2 to give a value of 2.40 eV () for the band gap. It is reported in the literature that band gap of Zn(1-x)CdxO solid solution thin films highly depends on the value of x (cadmium contents), which shows the band gap of 2.3 and 2.5 eV for 20 and 14% Cd contents respectively. In our case incorporation of 17% Cd gave a band gap of 2.4 eV that is in a good agreement with the reported value.\n\n2.6 Photoelectrochemical properties of Zn(1-x)CdxO thin films\n\nThe effect of nature of , film deposition temperature and electrolyte concentration on photoresponse of the thin film electrodes under illumination (L) and dark (D) conditions was investigated and presented in . It is evident that photocurrent density heavily depends on morphology, deposition temperature and electrolytic concentration. The photoelectrodes deposited from THF solution at 500 \u00b0C produce the maximum photocurrent in 0.5 M NaOH solution. The formation of  shaped structures from THF deposition solution is attributed to the higher heat of  of THF (2501 kJ mol-1) as compared to  (736 kJ mol-1) and  (1370 kJ mol-1).\n\n2.6.2 Minimum responsivity measurements. \n\nThe minimum responsivity of thin films to the light radiation was observed by  at 0.5 V. Minimum responsivity = (Iilluminated - Idark)/Wmax(1)where (Iilluminated - Idark) is the difference between obtained current (with sunlight) and the dark current.  reveals that the minimum responsivity for fabricated Cd doped ZnO is highest for the films obtained from THF solution at 500 \u00b0C using 0.5 M .\n\n for 1: C28H38Cd3F12O16, Mr = 1195.78, triclinic, a = 9.5553(4) \u00c5, b = 9.6390(5) \u00c5, c = 12.4046(6) \u00c5, \u03b1 = 69.4820(10)\u00b0, \u03b2 = 70.6980(10)\u00b0, \u03b3 = 87.2930(10)\u00b0, V = 1006.83(8) \u00c53, space group P, Z = 1, \u03bc = 1.691 mm-1, 13937 reflections measured, 5001 independent reflections (Rint = 0.0181). Final R1 and wR2 values were 0.0266 and 0.0692 for I > 2\u03c3(I) data and 0.0304 and 0.0704 for all data; goodness of fit on F2 was 1.054.\n\n4 Conclusion\n\nIn summary hexagonal nanostructured zinc-cadmium oxide solid solution Zn(1-x)CdxO thin films were deposited on FTO coated glass substrates from a common solution of  and a newly developed polymeric cadmium precursor [Cd3(TFA)4(OAC)2(THF)4]n (1) by the aerosol-assisted chemical vapour deposition () technique and applied for photoelectrochemical  splitting. Various parameters have been studied to optimize the conditions for fabrication of stable, robust and efficient photoelectrode thin films.

Compound 1 has the highest porosity (BET surface area of 1034 m2 g-1) ever reported for a MOF based on an aryl phosphonic acid linker. The indigo blue crystals of 1\u22c53NMP\u22c5H2O are composed of edge-shared eight-membered Co2P2O4 rings, and are thermally very stable up to 500 \u00b0C.\n\nThe BET surface area of 1 was derived from its simulated N2 adsorption isotherm at 77 K obtained by grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations (ESI). Such calculations have been widely used for characterizing the surface area of MOF materials. The calculated BET surface area for 1, 1034 m2 g-1, is 107 m2 g-1 higher than that reported for its Zn analogue, Zn2H4-MTPPA, which was 927 m2 g-1. However, it is significantly higher compared to the isostructural zinc compound Zn2H4-STPPA (565 m2 g-1). The same chain pattern was also observed in structurally rigid naphthalene arylphosphonate linkers with square pyramidal and octahedral metal atoms producing microporous frameworks. The stability of such edge shared Zn2P2O4 chains is significant as robust inorganic building units for future metal organophosphonate compounds, which could hypothetically produce isoreticularly expanding void channels with tetratopic, tritopic and ditopic ligands with expanding tether lengths. As seen in the thermogravimetric analysis graphic (see ESI), the compound is an unusually stable MOF as organic components from MTPPA start decomposing at ca. 525 \u00b0C, and 27% (calculated 29.5%) of total weight loss of MTPPA continues until 700 \u00b0C. The initial ca. 20% (calculated 27%) weight loss corresponds to the solvent molecules (ESI). A recent article about ultra stable ZrH4-STPPA also shows a similar STPPA decomposition pattern but 1 is approximately 100 \u00b0C more stable than the previously reported zirconium compound, which was not porous. The magnetism in MOFs is an active research area. We investigated the magnetic properties of 1via ab initio calculations (ESI). Spin-polarized density functional theory analysis is performed on the structure that is revealed from XRD data and it is observed that the electronic structure tends to converge towards a state where a net spin of 3 per Co atom is established (). While the charge density of this net spin has been observed to concentrate mainly around Co atoms it is not totally localized and extends throughout the structure along the b axis of the crystal which may point to a ferromagnetic interaction between Co atoms as well as the magnetic anisotropy in the crystal.\n\nIn conclusion, we report an extremely stable and rare metal-organic framework (MOF) based on cobalt arylphosphonates. The calculated surface area of 1034 m2 g-1 indicates that 1 has the largest surface area synthesized with a tetrahedral arylphosphonic acid. The extreme stability (up to 500 \u00b0C) at high temperatures is certainly a great advantage for potential industrial applications. Metal organophosphonates already have a myriad of applications, such as the catalysis of butane to maleic anhydride, imaging, bone remodelling, identifying micro calcifications, proton conductivity and osteoporosis treatment etc. Moreover, organophosphonates are thought to be involved in many biochemical pathways. The porous metal arylphosphonate compounds are rare but the recent efforts using the novel arylphosphonate linkers have been gradually contributing to the library of porous metal organophosphonates."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['surface_area', 'decomposition_temperature', 'magnetic_moment']"}]}

The magnetic susceptibility for 1 decreased with decreasing temperature to a near plateau value of 50 \u00d7 10-6 cm3 mol-1 around 90 K and showed an increase below 50 K. The plateau value corresponds to the temperature-independent paramagnetism arising from the second-order Zeeman effect. Similarly, the magnetic susceptibility of 2 continuously decreased with decreasing temperature to a plateau value of 60 \u00d7 10-6 cm3 mol-1 near 110 K and showed an increase below 50 K. The slight increase in magnetic susceptibility at low temperature suggests the presence of paramagnetic impurities. Magnetic simulations were carried out using the Bleaney-Bowers equation involving a correction term for paramagnetic impurities ():\n\nwhere N is Avogadro's number, \u03b2 is the Bohr magneton, k is the Boltzmann constant, J is the exchange integral, T is the absolute temperature, N\u03b1 is the temperature-independent paramagnetism, and \u03c1 is the fraction of paramagnetic impurity.

Such cryomagnetic behavior is typical of a dinuclear Ni(S  =  1)Ni(S  =  1) system exhibiting an intramolecular antiferromagnetic interaction. The increase in magnetic susceptibility at low temperature indicates the presence of a small amount of paramagnetic impurity.

Thermogravimetric analysis demonstrated that the main frame of 1 exhibited good thermostability up to 473 K. The non-isothermal kinetics for the first exothermic process of 1 were studied by Kissinger and Ozawa methods. The magnetic study revealed that 1 possessed antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between CuII ions through the carboxyl-bridge. The low-temperature (1.9 to 300 K) heat capacity of 1 was measured using the heat-capacity option of a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS). In addition, the thermodynamic functions in the experimental temperature range were derived by fitting the heat-capacity data to a series of theoretical and empirical models. The standard entropy and standard enthalpy of 1 were respectively calculated to be 411.37 \u00b1 4.11 J mol-1 K-1 and 60.21 \u00b1 0.60 kJ mol-1.\n\n2.2. Low-temperature heat-capacity measurements\n\nThe heat-capacity measurement was performed using a Quantum Design PPMS in zero magnetic field with logarithmic spacing over the temperature range from 1.9 to 100 K and at 10 K intervals from 100 to 300 K. The accuracy of the heat-capacity measurements on a high-purity copper pellet and \u03b1-Al2O3 cylinder (SRM720) was found to be \u00b12% and \u00b11% in the temperature ranges from 1.9 to 20 K and from 20 to 400 K, respectively. The crystalline sample was measured according to a PPMS heat-capacity measurement technique developed by Shi et al., and the accuracy of this technique was verified to be \u00b13% and \u00b11% in the temperature ranges below 20 K and from 20 to 300 K, respectively, by measuring a powdered benzoic acid sample (SRM 39j) using PPMS. The details of the sample preparation and the heat-capacity experimental procedure can be found in related publications. In general, sample mounting consisted of mixing the sample with copper strips in a copper cup, which was then compressed into a pellet using a stainless steel die. The copper cup was formed from a 0.025 mm thick pure copper foil, with a mass fraction purity of 0.99999, while the pellet had a 2.8 mm diameter and height of 3.5 mm. A typical heat-capacity measurement involved two steps: the heat-capacity measurement of the addenda of the PPMS platform with Apiezon N was first decided as Cp,1, and then the heat capacity of the pellet consisting of the sample, the copper strips, and the copper cup was measured as Cp,2. Thus, the heat capacity for the sample was calculated by subtracting Cp,1 from Cp,2. Using the PPMS technique, the heat capacity of 9.17 mg of a crystalline sample of 1 was measured over the temperature range of 1.9 to 300 K.\n\n3.2 Thermal decomposition\n\nUnder the linear heating rate of 10 K min-1, DSC and TG experiments were carried out to investigate the thermal decomposition behavior of a crystalline sample of 1. The DSC and TG curves of 1 are illustrated in . As shown in , 1 possessed one endothermic peak and two continuous exothermic peaks during the thermal decomposition process. The endothermic process begins at 337 K and ends at 365 K. The first exothermic process is from 473 K to 543 K, with the peak temperature at 503.4 K, while the second exothermic decomposition process begins at 543 K and ends at 693 K.\n\nIn the TG curve (), there are three weight loss stages from 340 K to 693 K, which correspond to the three processes in the DSC curve. The first weight loss stage starts at 340 K and ends at 365 K, with a weight loss of 4.65% involving the loss of solvent water (calcd, 4.80%). From 473 to 693 K, there are two successive weight loss stages, which can be considered as from breaking the TZA- and PNA- ligands. After that, the polymer is completely converted to CuO with a residue weight percentage of 21.10%, which is in good agreement with the calculated value of 21.23%. The remaining CuO was evidenced by X-ray powder diffraction analysis (Fig. S1).\n\n3.4 Magnetic property\n\nMagnetic measurements were performed on crystalline samples of 1 in the temperature range of 1.9-300 K. The temperature-dependent susceptibilities of 1 under a 1000 Oe applied field are shown in .\n\nIt can be observed that the \u03c7MT value at 300 K is 0.34 cm3 K mol-1, corresponding to 1.66\u03bcB of the CuII magnetic moment, which is a littler smaller than the expected magnetically isolated spin only value of 1.73\u03bcB (0.37 cm3 K mol-1, S = 1/2, g = 2.0), indicating that there already exist antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between the two CuII ions at 300 K through the carboxyl groups-bridging. As shown in , the \u03c7MT value gradually decreases as the temperature decreases from 300 K to 70 K. This experimental fact indicates a very strong antiferromagnetic coupling interaction existing in the CuII dimes. Besides, there is a minimum magnetization present at 65 K in the curve when further lowering the temperature, and also an abrupt increase in the magnetic moment at T = 20 K can be seen. This could be attributed to a small amount of paramagnetic impurities present. According to the structure of 1, the antiferromagnetic interactions originate from the carboxyl groups-bridging (J) CuII ions; therefore we fitted the \u03c7MT versus T plot using  to take into account a proportion of the non-coupled CuII ions above 70 K. (3)where J is the exchange parameter and \u03c1 is the percentage of paramagnetic impurities. The fitting gives the parameters J = -159 cm-1, g = 2.15, and \u03c1 = 0.09, further confirming the antiferromagnetic interaction between the CuII ions. The field cooling (FC) and zero field cooling (ZFC) curves measured in 1000 Oe are shown in . It can be observed that the two curves are almost coincide from 300 K to 70 K, while the two curves diverge below 70 K, which is caused by some kind of disordered magnetic state of the impurities. The isothermal field-dependent magnetization measured at 10, 50, 80, and 300 K is shown in the inset of . It is in agreement with the results of the M-T curves, and shows that the coercivity of the sample increases with decreasing the temperature.\n\n3.5 Low-temperature heat capacity\n\nThe heat capacity of the crystalline samples of 1 measured by PPMS are given in  and are plotted vs. temperature in . It can be seen that the heat capacity increases smoothly with the temperature increasing and no thermal anomalies are found in the entire experimental region.\n\nBased on the fitting parameters, the molar thermodynamic functions of 1 were calculated at selected temperatures from 0 to 300 K. The calculated results are listed in . The standard molar entropy and the standard molar enthalpy at T = 298.15 K were calculated to be 411.37 \u00b1 4.11 J mol-1 K-1 and 60.21 \u00b1 0.60 kJ mol-1, respectively.\n\nb\n\nStandard uncertainties u are u(T) = 0.01 K and u(p) = 2 kPa.\n\n4. Conclusion\n\nIn summary, a new 1D CuII coordination polymer constructed from tetrazole-1-acetic acid and p-nitrobenzoic acid was synthesized and structurally characterized. Its main frame possessed good thermostability up to 473 K. The Arrhenius equation for the thermal decomposition process of the polymer can be expressed as lnk = 42.81 - 196.02 \u00d7 103/RT. The magnetic behavior indicates that antiferromagnetic exchange interactions exist between the CuII ions through the carboxyl-bridge. This result was confirmed by the low-temperature heat-capacity of the polymer. This demonstrates that the magnetic property is the main contribution to heat capacity. Moreover, the standard entropy and standard enthalpy of the polymer at T = 298.15 K were respectively calculated to be 411.37 \u00b1 4.11 J mol-1 K-1 and 60.21 \u00b1 0.60 kJ mol-1.

The metal-organic framework consists of 3D + 2D polycatenation of a 3D \"cds\" like net and two 2D \"sql\" layers. The  subunit is a complex chain constructed from V5O15 cycles linked through a single tetrahedron. The vanadate chains are located in the channels of the metal-organic framework, and corner linked to the nickel metal centres giving rise to an unprecedented four nodal self-catenated framework. Moreover, as far as we as concerned, this is the first vanadate in which the V5O15 cycles has been isolated in the solid state. The   molecules are partially encapsulated between the organic ligands and the inorganic framework. The loss of   molecules gives rise to a contraction of the 0.6% of the unit  volume.

The radius value of the , obtained from BET measurements, is 1.93 \u00c5, which is slightly greater than the calculated from the scan method. This results could possibly be attributed to the method employed for surface area measurement. There are difficulties associated with performing BET  surface area measurements of organic-inorganic compounds with large organic surface .\n\nThe thermal behaviour of the title compound was studied by  (ESI, Fig S8) and thermodiffractometry (). The  exhibits two steps of weight loss. The first one, with a value of 3.0%, between room temperature and 80 \u00b0C, corresponds to the loss of   (calcd 2.8%); and the second one (380-450 \u00b0C), with a value of 44.2%, is related to the exothermic loss of the bpy ligands (calcd 46.3%). The thermal behaviour was also studied by time resolved  in an air atmosphere. The thermodiffraction analysis reveals that the crystal structure is stable up to 370 \u00b0C, in good agreement with the . However, the powder patterns show that the crystallinity decreases dramatically by 355 \u00b0C (). At higher temperatures, several inorganic vanadates and vanadium oxides are observed: NiV3O8 + NiV2O6 (370-445 \u00b0C) \u2192 NiV2O6 + V2O5 (445-480 \u00b0C).(). The visual analysis of some reflections, related to the initial compound, shows the existence of significant displacements with temperature (). Qualitatively, two trends are observed during the heating process, the first one between 25 and 100 \u00b0C, and the second one in the temperature range 100-370 \u00b0C.\n\nIn the  (ESI, Fig. S10), two absorption bands of strong intensity corresponding to the allowed transitions: 3A2g(3F) \u2192 3T2g(3F), 3T1g(3F), at 9800, and 16000 cm-1 are observed. At higher frequencies a broad band due to the charge transfer is detected. From the spin transitions corresponding to the d8-high spin Ni(II) cation in octahedral geometry, the Dq and Racah B parameters have been calculated, by using the energy expressions given in the Tanabe-Sugano diagrams. The values are Dq = 980 and B = 875 cm-1. The B-parameter is, approximately, 85% of that of the free Ni(II) cation (1030 cm-1), which indicates an appreciable covalent character in the chemical bonds inside the NiN4O2 octahedron.\n\nMagnetic measurements for the title compound were performed in a powdered sample from room temperature to 5.0 K, at a magnetic field of 0.1 T. The thermal evolution of the molar magnetic susceptibility, \u03c7m, and \u03c7mT vs. T is shown in . The \u03c7mT value at 300 K is (9.34 cm3 K mol-1) near the expected (9.68 cm3 K mol-1) for eight non-interacting Ni(II) (S = 1, g = 2.2) ions. The \u03c7m curve shows a continuous increase of its value between 300 K (0.03559 cm3 mol-1) to 5 K (1.459 cm3 mol-1). Due to the large distance between Ni(II) ions (approx. 8.3 \u00c5 through the vanadate chains and 11.2 \u00c5 through the bpy ligand) significant exchange interactions between the metal centres are not expected. Therefore, the decrease of the \u03c7mT value with decreasing temperature is attributed to the zero-field splitting, typical of an axially distorted d8 high spin isolated Ni(II) system."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['surface_area', 'decomposition_temperature', 'peak_spectrum']"}]}

These catalysts are active in the aerobic oxidation of cycloalkenes under solvent-free conditions, with a conversion for the oxidation of cyclohexene of 71% after one hour of the reaction, and a TOF value of 1438 h-1 for CuSmPDC. On the other hand, the oxidation of cycloheptene and cyclooctene exhibited slightly lower conversions of 52% and 47%, and TOF values of 1053 and 159 h-1 after 1 and 6 hours of the reaction, respectively. The radical mechanism for the oxidation reaction of cyclohexene was assessed by Raman and EPR spectroscopy. The first evidenced the formation of Cu-O2 adducts and the second permitted is to observe the presence of the oxygen centered radical species, which act as initiators of the reaction chain to generate the products. An increase in the temperature of the reaction correlates with the adduct formation, and with the enhancement of the oxidation reaction.\n\nThe effect of the oxygen concentration was tested using pressures from 1 to 5 bar (). These results show a direct dependence of the conversion on the oxygen pressure; the best result was 71% after 1 hour of the reaction using 5 bar of the initial pressure. In addition, an experiment performed with an initial 5 bar pressure was recharged with 5 more bar of oxygen, when the first amount of oxygen was consumed. For this reaction, the conversion reached 90% after one additional hour. The selectivity was also pressure dependent; Fig. S10 shows the selectivity for all experiments. The main product at 1 bar was cyclohexenol (56%) and cyclohexenone (34%), while the main product at 5 bar was cyclohexenone (51%) and cyclohexenol dropped to 44%. These results can be easily explained since cyclohexenol is an intermediate product of oxidation, which with the increase of pressure is transformed into the ketone. Furthermore, when the reaction mixture was recharged with 5 bar after the initial oxygen was consumed, the main product continued to be the ketone (64%), while one extra product was detected, 1,2-cyclohexanediol (11%) (Fig. S10). These results can be explained by assuming that the new amount of oxygen allowed the oxidation reaction to continue with the generation of the diol.\n\nAn example of a heterometallic catalyst is {[Cu0.5La2(HPDC)(PDC)2(SO4)(H2O)2]\u22c5H2O}n, also active in the oxidation of cyclohexene at 120 \u00b0C, under a pressure of 5 bar of oxygen. The conversion after 6 h was 70% with 60% of selectivity to ketone, with a TOF value of 61 h-1. These results are very interesting since it was the first heterometallic 3d-4f MOF used for this kind of reaction. In this work, we have been able to obtain better results with {[CuLn2(PDC)2(SO4)2(H2O)6]\u22c5H2O}n (LnIII: Sm, Gd, Eu) for only 1 h of the reaction, using a substrate/catalyst ratio based on copper(II) as the active species of 3200/1, the TOF values for these three catalysts being ca. 1400 h-1. The main difference between the studied heterometallic frameworks and the previously reported catalyst {[Cu0.5La2(HPDC)(PDC)2(SO4)(H2O)2]\u22c5H2O}n is the first coordination sphere of the copper(II) ion. While in all the herein studied {[CuLn2(PDC)2(SO4)2(H2O)6]\u22c5H2O}n, the first coordination sphere of copper(II) has two coordinated water molecules; in the reported {[Cu0.5La2(HPDC)(PDC)2(SO4)(H2O)2]\u22c5H2O}n, these are lacking. When these water molecules are lost at 120 \u00b0C in the studied catalysts producing two vacant positions, these allow the interaction of oxygen with the active metal centres, and the subsequent initiation of the catalytic cycle. This fact can be used to explain the higher conversion and the excellent TOF values for {[CuLn2(PDC)2(SO4)2(H2O)6]\u22c5H2O}n catalysts.\n\nConclusions\n\nA family of heterometallic inorganic polymers, based on CuII and LnIII, {[CuLn2(PDC)2(SO4)2(H2O)6]\u22c5H2O}n (Ln: SmIII, EuIII, GdIII), has been shown to be active in the oxidation of cyclohexene, using molecular oxygen as the sole oxidant, with similar conversion results for the three catalysts. Due to the existence of labile water molecules in the first coordination sphere of the active copper(II) centres in the studied frameworks, which permits the formation of vacant sites and the corresponding interaction with molecular oxygen, the studied CuLnPDC exhibit an enhanced catalytic activity, compared to the previously reported CuLaPDC. The detection of Cu-O2 adducts by Raman spectroscopy and oxygen-centred radicals by EPR permitted us to infer the mechanism by which the oxidation reaction proceeds. On the other hand, the oxidation of cycloheptene and cyclooctene exhibited slightly lower conversions of 52% and 47%, and TOF values of 1053 and 159 h-1 at 1 and 6 hours of reaction, respectively."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['catalytic_activity']"}]}

Similar to the traditional GIS-cage in zeolite, the distorted GIS cage in BIF-41 contains four 8-rings and six 4-rings. It is noteworthy that the 8-ring perpendicular to the c-axis is divided into two 5-rings by the ad ligand that bridges two Co2+ centers. As a result, the channel along the c-axis is partitioned by the ad ligand into an infinite number of finite segments, as well as the window size decreased from 11 \u00d7 4.5 to 3.4 \u00d7 4.5 \u00c5 (). Such partitioning does not affect the 8-ring in the other direction. So, BIF-41 also shows 1D channels along the (101) direction with a window size of about 5 \u00d7 5 \u00c5. The pore size distribution curves calculated by Poreblazer also show that the pore-limiting diameter is 3.45 \u00c5 and the maximum pore diameter is 5.04 \u00c5 (Fig. S3, ESI). The density (T/V) expressed as the number of tetrahedral vertices per unit volume is 3.23 nm-3, larger than that of ZIF and TIF with the GIS topology in the range of 2.31-2.70 nm-3.\n\n BIF-41 contains structurally disordered solvent molecules in the pores. The solvent accessible volume of BIF-41 is about 35.5% of the total crystal volume as estimated by PLATON program. The thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that BIF-41 can remain stable up to ca. 270 \u00b0C under the N2 atmosphere (Fig. S1, ESI). The sample for gas sorption analysis was activated by immersing the as-synthesized BIF-41 in ethanol for 1 day, then the ethanol-exchanged sample was further degassed at 80 \u00b0C prior to the measurement. The purity of the sample and the crystalline framework structure were proven by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) studies (Fig. S2, ESI).\n\nThe gas adsorption measurements of BIF-41 were performed on a micromeritics ASAP 2010 surface area and a pore size analyzer. The N2 measurement at 77 K shows that N2 is hardly adsorbed at all (). The CO2 adsorption measurements at 273 K and 294 K show typical type I isotherms with high uptake (). The CO2 uptake values were 77.0 cm3 g-1 (3.44 mmol g-1) at 273 K and 63.5 cm3 g-1 (2.83 mmol g-1) at 294 K, which are comparable to some highly porous ZIFs. The isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) for CO2 was calculated by using the adsorption data collected at 273 K and 298 K. At zero coverage, the enthalpy of CO2 adsorption for BIF-41 is 23.9 KJ mol-1 (Fig. S4, ESI). In addition, the H2 adsorption was also measured at 77 K and 87 K under 1 atm, respectively. The H2 uptake values for BIF-41 are 106.4 cm3 g-1 at 77K and 83.4 cm3 g-1 at 87 K (). These results demonstrate that BIF-41 has selective adsorption of CO2 and H2 over N2. The partitioned channels show a pore size effect preference for CO2 and H2 over N2, as CO2 and H2 have smaller kinetic diameters than N2. The unusually high selectivity can be attributed to the small cages provided by the pore space partition, which facilitate the interaction between small molecules and the channel walls."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['pore_diameter', 'porosity', 'decomposition_temperature', 'gas_adsorption']"}]}

Despite the seemingly sufficient void spaces in all the solvent-free MOFs based on the PLATON analysis, only the activated form of Cu-MOF 2 displayed selective gas sorption ability for CO2 over N2 and H2, as shown in . Both N2 and H2 uptake amounts measured at 77 K were much smaller than the CO2 adsorption amount at 196 K. In the case of N2 adsorption, a sudden increase in the sorption amount was observed only above the gas pressure of 0.90 atm. This observation may be attributed to N2 sorption into the interparticle spaces rather than into the micropores of 2. Contrarily, the adsorption isotherm for H2 gas did not show a sudden increase up to 1 atm. The uptake amounts of CO2 for activated 2 at varying measurement temperatures were as follows: 98.5 cm3 g-1 (4.39 mmol g-1) at 196 K; 39.2 cm3 g-1 (1.75 mmol g-1) at 273 K; and 20.0 cm3 g-1 (0.89 mmol g-1) at 298 K. Interestingly, these values are slightly larger compared with the previously reported values for the thermally activated form of [Cu2(Glu)2(\u03bc-bpa)]\u22c5CH3CN in which the occupied solvate molecule is CH3CN instead of water: 70.0 cm3 g-1 (3.12 mmol g-1) at 196 K; 26.4 cm3 g-1 (1.18 mmol g-1) at 273 K; and 12.7 cm3 g-1 (0.57 mmol g-1) at 298 K. The CO2 adsorption selectivity over N2 was quantitatively estimated by the initial slope method using data collected at 273 K, as shown in . The calculated CO2/N2 selectivity value was 20.9. This selectivity value is very similar to the reported value for ZIF-69, Zn(cbIm)(nIm), where cbIm is 5-chlorobenzimidazole and nIm is 2-nitroimidazole. Except for compound 2, the other three MOFs did not give meaningful sorption abilities for the three gases after thermal activation.\n\nAntibacterial activities\n\nThe antibacterial activities of the four Cu-MOFs, 1, 2, 3, and 4, were studied via determination of their minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) values against five strains of bacteria, including E. coli, S. Aureus, K. pneumonia, P. aeruginosa, and MRSA, which can easily be met in daily surrounding environments. While the number of colony forming units (CFUs) in the control increased more than 10-fold during incubation for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C, bactericidal percentages of the four Cu-MOFs reached 99.9% for all the bacterial strains.  \n\nAny synergistic effects between the metal ion and organic ligands did not appear based on the measured MBC values. Although close relationships between the antibacterial activities and different structures of the Cu-MOFs were not found in our results, fortunately, the antibacterial properties of Cu-MOFs 1-4 are comparable with those of Ag NPs and Co-TDM, which are known to display very low MBC values of 10-15 \u03bcg mL-1 within a very short treatment time for the inactivation of E. coli. They were also better than those of the Zn-MOF (MBC, 4300 \u03bcg mL-1 against S. aureus and S. epidermidis), cellulose-HKUST-1, and vancomycin loaded Fe-MOF. The recently reported 1D Cu-based coordination polymer, [Cu3(py)6(\u03bc-CH3COO)4(I3)2]n, also showed a relatively large MBC value of 2500 \u03bcg mL-1 against E. coli. The MBC values of Cu-MOFs were much lower than those of the antibacterial agent penicillin (125.00 and 500.00 \u03bcg mL-1 against E. coli and S. aureus).\n\nRelease of CuII ions from Cu-MOFs\n\nIn order to confirm the fact that the leaching of CuII ions from Cu-MOFs was not significant, MOF degradation tests were conducted in two media: deionized water and 0.9% saline solution used for the antibacterial tests at room temperature. The quantities of CuII ions released from the Cu-MOFs were monitored by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) after 6 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h. As shown in , the concentrations of the released CuII ions from Cu-MOF 2 and 3 increased during the initial 12 h, decreased until 24 h and then increased again. Cu-MOFs 1 and 4 released CuII ions to a maximum concentration of 29 \u03bcg mL-1 after immersion for 48 h; however, the average CuII ion concentration for MOF 4 was as low as 7.6 \u03bcg mL-1 in the test. Additionally, the release of CuII ions from Cu-MOF 2 in deionized water for 24 h was approximately 10-fold lower than that in 0.9% saline solution () and decreased to 3.5 \u03bcg mL-1 until 48 h. Although these degradation trends are similar to those previously reported, the exceptional stability of Cu-MOFs 1-4 in aqueous solution contrasts those of other unstable porous MOFs. Although the amounts of CuII ions released from the four Cu-MOFs for 24 h differ from 11 to 49 \u03bcg mL-1, all the Cu-MOFs displayed the same bactericidal abilities against the five kinds of bacteria. The amount of CuII ions released from the MBC of Cu-MOF 4 of 20 \u03bcg mL-1 was calculated to be 0.22 \u03bcg mL-1, which is too low compared with the MBC value of free CuII ions, which was 12 \u03bcg mL-1. From these results, we infer that CuII ions are not only bactericidal but the robust Cu-MOFs themselves that also actively participate in inactivating bacteria.\n\nWhile the antibacterial mechanisms of metallic materials are complex and diverse, it is well known that Cu ions on metallic surfaces induce damage to bacterial membranes, resulting in cell destruction. In our study, the physical properties of the frameworks, such as the surface area, porosities, and particle size, were thought to be the more important factors that affect bacteria over the chemical properties of the constituents. Because our results indicate that Cu-MOFs cannot easily release CuII ions on their surfaces due to the hydrophobic and robust structure, Cu-based active sites on surfaces primarily make Cu-MOF crystals responsible for the excellent bactericidal property. Additionally, to confirm the fact that CuII ions could not be easily released from Cu-MOFs, the control dishes and antibacterial tested dishes were rinsed with 0.9% saline solution for E. coli, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa. The amount of CuII ions released from Cu-MOF 2 was 0.243 \u03bcg mL-1 for E. coli, 0.036 \u03bcg mL-1 for S. aureus, and 0.079 \u03bcg mL-1 for P. aeruginosa from ICP-MS data of each solution after antibacterial tests (Table S1). These values are also negligible compared to the MBC value of free CuII ions, 12 \u03bcg mL-1."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['gas_adsorption', 'etc']"}]}

The porosity of the activated metal doped STU-1s was evaluated by N2 adsorption at 77 K. As shown in , all Cu2+ and Cd2+ doped STU-1s exhibit type I nitrogen adsorption isotherms as a microporous material. The Langmuir (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, BET) surface areas of Cu0.01-STU-1, Cu0.05-STU-1, Cu0.10-STU-1, Cu0.167-STU-1 and Cd0.6-STU-1 were calculated to be 926(624), 1320(891), 1407(948), 1070(721), 616(414) m2 g-1, respectively, which were obtained by using the data points on the adsorption branch in the P/P0 range of 0.06-0.3. Obviously, the doped metal ions affect the porosity of parent STU-1, and show an enhancement in porosity for Cu0.05-STU-1 and Cu0.10-STU-1 (STU-1, 1255(775) m2 g-1), and a reduction for Cu0.01-STU-1, Cu0.167-STU-1 and Cd0.5-STU-1. The highest adsorption volume of N2 and the BET surface area for Cu0.10-STU-1 are about 50 cm3 g-1 (at P/P0 = 0.3) and about 173 m2 g-1 (enhanced percentage: 22.3%) larger than those of parent STU-1, respectively. The low-pressure CO2 capture ability of 59.4, 79.5, 80.4, 71.0, and 48.1 cm3 g-1 at 1 bar (273 K) for Cu0.01-STU-1, Cu0.05-STU-1, Cu0.10-STU-1, Cu0.167-STU-2, and Cd0.6-STU-1 (), respectively, is in accordance with their order of BET surface areas. The highest value of CO2 uptake (80.4 cm3 g-1) for Cu0.10-STU-1 is obviously higher than that of parent STU-1 (70.2 cm3 g-1), indicating that the CO2 adsorption capacity of STU-1 can be enhanced (14.5%) by doping metal ions.\n\nA sample of MOFs after being treated with boiling water with an unchanged PXRD pattern may not be porous as its pristine sample. The measurement of the nitrogen adsorption isotherm for the treated MOFs to evaluate the porosity is important to further determine the material stability. The nitrogen adsorption isotherms of the samples of Cu2+ and Cd2+ doped STU-1s after being soaked in boiling water for 7 days were measured. As shown in Fig. S15 (ESI), the nitrogen uptake (77 K) of Cu0.01-STU-1, Cu0.05-STU-1, Cu0.10-STU-1, and Cd0.6-STU-1 treated with boiling water is close to those of their respective pristine samples, indicating that the metal-doped STU-1s did not significantly lose their porosity and surface areas. Similar to N2 adsorption, CO2 adsorption capacities were also almost retained (only slightly dropped, Fig. S16, ESI). This property is very important for post-combustion CO2 capture from flue gas in the industrially relevant process, because the water molecules usually exist as constituents in flue gas. Furthermore, we also employed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to explore the morphology and particle size of the pristine and metal doped STU-1 samples treated with boiling water. As shown in  and Fig. S17-S20 (ESI), the morphology and particle size of the treated samples of STU-1s are identical to those of their pristine sample, which suggest that there was no dissolution or degradation of the original phase. The experiments further manifest that the metal doped STU-1s are exceptionally water stable.\n\nTo explore the interaction between water and the pore surface of STU-1 and metal doped STU-1s, their water vapour adsorption isotherms were measured at 298 K. As shown in , the highest measured water vapour uptake was 13.48 wt% at P/P0 = 0.9 for STU-1, while those of metal doped STU-1s are obviously low, ranging from 0.43 wt% to 1.65%. The water sorption isotherms are divided into seven types (Fig. S26, ESI) to classify the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the sorbent according to IUPAC. STU-1 displays a type III water sorption isotherm classified as a hydrophobic or weakly hydrophilic material; while metal doped STU-1 exhibits type VII thus judged as a strongly hydrophobic material. The water adsorption isotherm studies clearly demonstrate that the hydrophobicity of the pore surface of STU-1 was obviously enhanced after doping metal ions. The hydrophobicity prevents water from adsorbing into the pores, consequently the water stability of metal doped STU-1s was strongly enhanced."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['surface_area', 'gas_adsorption']"}]}

Single crystal structure analysis revealed that compound 1 crystallizes in a triclinic system with P space group and consists of two Zn atoms, two molecules of NDC ligand, one molecule of 4,4'-bipyridine and disordered solvent molecules (Table S1). The Zn atoms are five coordinated with respect to four carboxylate-derived oxygen atoms from the NDC ligand and one nitrogen atom of the bipyridine ligand. The Zn-O/N bond distances are in the range of 2.0091-2.0898 \u00c5 (av. 2.0311 \u00c5) (Table S2). The observed distances are typical for this type of coordination motif. Framework 1 is based on a paddle wheel type secondary building unit (SBU) (). This SBU is connected with the NDC ligand to form the charge neutral layer (). The other two nodes of the SBU are connected with the bpy ligand, which pillars the neutral layers. The overall structure can be viewed as bpy ligands pillaring the undulating charge-neutral [Zn2(NDC)2] layers to form a 3D network (). This network interpenetrates to result in the final structure containing a 1D channel () along the a axis. This interpenetration eliminates most of the void space in the structure. This kind of network is reported and several isostructural compounds are known. Complete evacuation of the guests was confirmed by studying the thermogravimetric analysis of 1' (guest-free referred to as 1'). Removal of guest molecules led to a distortion of the unit cell, as indicated by the shifts of the PXRD peaks (Fig. S1). N2 adsorption measurements over 1' show that the total BET surface area is 9 m2 g-1, with a pore volume of 0.03 cm3 g-1 (Fig. S2), which indicates the nonporous nature of the compound.\n\nThe fluorescent properties of 1, 1', and the NDC ligand were also investigated in the solid state at room temperature (). The excitation wavelength of 320 nm was set from the UV-Vis spectral data. The free NDC ligand exhibits emission at 461 nm and the fluorescence of as-made 1 displays a strong emission band at 450 nm.\n\nThe quantum yield for MOFs was calculated to be 0.23 through the relative method. Quinine sulfate (Qf = 0.54) was used as the standard. The emission lifetime for the compound was calculated using the time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique. The average lifetime (\u03c4av) was calculated to be 31.5 ns when the decay plot was fitted triexponentially (Table S4 and Fig. S5). The high luminescence intensity and quantum yield prompted us to consider the potential luminescence sensing properties of 1.\n\nWe have calculated the quenching constant (Kq), [Kq = Ksv/\u03c40, where \u03c40 = life time of MOFs before addition of analytes] (Table S4) and the results are presented in . The quenching constant (Kq) varies from 36.8 \u00d7 1010 M-1 S-1 to 4.9 \u00d7 1010 M-1 S-1 () and these values confirm that the interaction is predominantly collisional in nature.\n\nFor a better understanding of the fluorescence quenching mechanisms, we have carried out density of states (DOS) and band gap energy calculations for 1 (Fig. S9). The experimental band gap energy value for 1 using the Kubelka-Munk plot was found to be 2.81 eV (Fig. S10). Theoretical calculations predict that the LUMO of 1 resides on the bipyridine molecule and its value (2.00 eV) is higher than the LUMO for the analytes used (Fig. S9 and Table S5). So it will follow the same mechanism as in other reported MOFs. The result shows that quenching efficiency is in the order of NT > DNT > TNT > NB > DNB ().

As compounds 1-4 have totally the same structure type, only the results of Yb3(OH)7(1,5-NDS) (4) were discussed here for clarity (for the results of compounds 1-3 see Fig. S5-S7). As shown in , compound 4 is stable up to about 351 \u00b0C and then a weight loss of 5.7% appears from 351 \u00b0C to 469 \u00b0C with an endothermic peak in the DSC curve, corresponding to the decomposition of parts of the coordinated (OH) groups. The subsequent weight loss of 21.1% in total from 469 \u00b0C to 668 \u00b0C with three exothermic peaks corresponds to the loss of organic ligands (calcd. 25.8%), and finally a bit of weight gain appears at about 699 \u00b0C, probably corresponding to a further oxidation process to generate Yb hydroxides, with the total weight loss of 25.0% (calcd. 27.3%). The two different weight loss processes from 469 \u00b0C to 668 \u00b0C may be attributed to the ligands in two different coordination types. All of these analyses are supplemented by the powder XRD pattern of compound 4 at different temperatures (). Obviously, the main structure is kept at 469 \u00b0C with two significant peaks at about 7\u00b0 and 13\u00b0, and a new crystal structure of Yb hydroxides is assumed to be forming from 469 \u00b0C to 699 \u00b0C with four new peaks at about 13\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 42\u00b0, and 53\u00b0.\n\nPhotoluminescence properties\n\nConsidering the excellent photoluminescence properties of RE compounds, the solid-state luminescence properties of compounds 1-4 as well as the free 1,5-NDS ligand were investigated at room temperature. Free 1,5-NDS shows emission with maxima at 337 nm and 387 nm upon excitation at 277 nm in the solid state (Fig. S8). As shown in , strong purple emission bands are concentrated around 342 nm and 396 nm for compounds 1-4 upon excitation at 277 nm. Due to the RE ions luminescence is always presented as sharp emission peaks in the spectra; the emission peak that is similar to that of the free 1,5-NDS ligand in  can probably be attributed to intra-ligand (\u03c0-\u03c0*) emission. Compared with the emission of the free 1,5-NDS, a slight red shift of 5 nm for the high-energy emission and 9 nm for the low-energy emission was observed, which may be assigned to the coordination of the 1,5-NDS ligand with the RE ions. Comparing the four curves in  with each other, it's obvious that the peak around 396 nm for compound 3 is missed, owing to the high absorption of Er(III) ions at around 379 nm. However, the emission of the Er(III) ion is not found in the curve, which is probably because of the quenching of the densely coordinated (OH) groups around the Er(III) ions. Furthermore, as shown in , the intensity of the peak at around 396 nm is similar for compounds 1, 2, and 4, while that of the peak at around 342 nm is significantly different. That is to say, the relative intensity of the two peaks for compounds 1-4 is different. This could be a good example of RE ions tuning MOFs' fluorescence colour.\n\nMagnetic measurements\n\nIn view of the excellent magnetic properties of RE compounds, magnetic susceptibility measurements were carried out in the temperature range of 2-300 K. As shown in , compounds 2-4 behave paramagnetically, which is similar to the corresponding RE ions. It is noted that upon further cooling below about 25 K for compounds 2 and 3, and 10 K for compound 4, the magnetic susceptibility \u03c7mT decreases significantly and reaches 9.43 emu K mol-1, 15.87 emu K mol-1, and 4.68 emu K mol-1 respectively, implying zero-field splitting and the possibility of additional anti-ferromagnetic interaction in this temperature range, which may be attributed to the interaction between RE ions by means of the coordinated \u03bc3-(OH) groups. Furthermore, a Curie-Weiss (C-W) fitting (Fig. S9) was also performed on the \u03c7-1m-T data. The fitting Curie constants (C) and Weiss temperatures (\u03b8) from the C-W fitting are listed in . Apparently, the fitting Weiss temperatures of compounds 2-4 are all negative values (-2.33 K for 2, -1.56 K for 3 and -3.8 K for 4), also suggesting the existence of anti-ferromagnetic interaction in these compounds."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['decomposition_temperature', 'peak_spectrum', 'magnetic_susceptibility']"}]}

The La3+ ion is ten-coordinated by six oxygen atoms from three  ligands, three oxygen atoms from two IN ligands and one  molecule. The La-O bond distances range from 2.498(4) to 2.733(4) \u00c5.

The emission peak 5D0 \u2192 7F1 is a magnetic dipole transition and its intensity should vary with the crystal field strength acting on the Eu(III) ion. The 5D0 \u2192 7F2 transition is an electric dipole transition and the intensity of the 5D0 \u2192 7F2 transition increases as the site symmetry of Eu(III) ions decreases.

At room temperature, the \u03c7MT values of 1 and 2 are 6.66 and 9.46 emu mol-1 K, which are much larger than the expected spin-only values (3.75 and 5.625 emu mol-1 K) for two and three magnetically isolated CoII ions (S = 3/2, g = 2), respectively (in order to investigate the Co2 unit, the calculated molecular weight for the magnetic data of 1 is 632.32). For 1, as the temperature decreases, the value of \u03c7MT slowly decreases down to a minimum value of 5.41 emu mol-1 K at 22 K, which is larger than the expected values (3.75 emu mol-1 K) of two spin-only CoII ions and indicates ferromagnetic coupling between CoII ions. Upon lowering the temperature to 5 K, \u03c7MT abruptly increases to a maximum value (6.08 emu mol-1 K). Below 5 K, the \u03c7MT has a rapid linear drop, to a minimum value of 5.26 emu mol-1 K at 2 K. For 2, when lowering the temperature, the \u03c7MT value slowly decreases and reaches a minimum value of 6.07 emu mol-1 K at 12 K, which is slightly larger than the expected value (5.625 emu mol-1 K) of the spin-only Co3 unit, because of the slow quenching of orbital contribution, which indicates weak ferromagnetic coupling between CoII ions of the Co3 unit. Then, \u03c7MT rises up to a maximum value of 6.73 emu mol-1 K at 2 K, further indicating weak ferromagnetic coupling between CoII ions of Co3 unit. Curie-Weiss fitting [\u03c7M = C/(T - \u03b8)] of the magnetic data over the temperature range 100-300 K for 1 and 2 results in a Curie constant C = 6.89 emu mol-1 K, Weiss constant \u03b8 = -9.39 K, and C = 10.35 emu mol-1 K, \u03b8 = -28.84 K, respectively. Notably, the negative \u03b8 values do not indicate dominant antiferromagnetic coupling between the metal centers because of strong spin-orbit coupling of CoII ions, which itself can lead to a negative \u03b8 value and a decrease of \u03c7MT at high temperature. The strength of the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction caused by spin-orbit coupling of CoII at high temperature was estimated based on . \u03c7T = Aexp(-E1/kT) + Bexp(-E2/kT)(1)\n\nIn , A + B equals the Curie constant, and E1 and E2 represent the activation energies corresponding to the spin-orbit coupling and the ferromagnetic exchange interactions, respectively. The best fit of the experimental data gives A + B = 6.97 emu mol-1 K, E1/k = -16.68 K, E2/k = 27.34 K for 1, and A + B = 10.42 emu mol-1 K, E1/k = -76.80 K, E2/k = 0.14 K for 2 (). The positive values of E2 of 1 and 2 indicate that dominant ferromagnetic interactions between CoII ions of Co2 and Co3 clusters exist in 1 and 2.\n\nThe M vs. H plots (at 2 K) for 1 and 2 are shown in . For 1, M increases quickly at very low field, reaching about 4.12 N\u03b2 at 15 kOe, which indicates ferromagnetic interactions. In the high field region the increase of magnetization is slow, reaching 4.92 N\u03b2 at 50 kOe, which is in agreement with the value of 6.00 N\u03b2 anticipated for two independent CoII ions with the S = 3/2 ground state. For 2, M also increases quickly at very low field, reaching about 4.48 N\u03b2 at 15 kOe, then increasing slowly to 6.21 N\u03b2 per Co3 unit at 50 kOe, which is smaller than the value of 6.6 N\u03b2 anticipated for three independent CoII with S = 3/2 ground state, but larger than those values (usually less than 4.0 N\u03b2) for antiferromagnetic interactions within trimeric CoII units, which further indicated weak ferromagnetic interaction in the Co3 unit and antiferromagnetic interaction between Co3 units. In 1, since the distance between the two CoII linked by L  is considerably longer (8.76 \u00c5) compared with the intradimer Co1\u22efCo1A (3.358 \u00c5) separation, the interdimer exchange interactions can be seen further approximately as the effect of the molecular field. In addition, in 2, since the distance between the two CoII ions linked by the L  is much longer (7.82 \u00c5) than the intratrimer Co1\u22efCo2 (3.559 \u00c5) separation, the intertrimer exchange interactions can also be seen further approximately as the effect of the molecular field. Herein, the long  only provided negligible intercluster antiferromagnetic interactions.\n\nIt is noteworthy that magnetic research for the high spin Co system is complicated and difficult because many factors, especially the strong spin-orbital coupling, can influence the magnetic behavior. For 1, the first decrease of \u03c7MT value (300-22 K) and the small negative \u03b8 value may be mainly due to the strong spin-orbital coupling of the single-ion behavior at high temperature. The abrupt \u03c7MT increase (22-5 K) can be interpreted by ferromagnetic coupling interactions within the dimeric unit, which is strong enough to compensate for the single-ion behavior resulting from the spin-orbital coupling. This can also be confirmed by the slow increase of magnetization at high fields and large magnetization values at the applied field of 5 T at 2 K. The second decrease for the \u03c7MT value (5-2 K) suggests antiferromagnetic interaction among the neighboring Co2 clusters and/or the magnetic saturation.

The solvent-free 1 exhibits strong blue-green emission with an excellent fluorescence quantum yield of 99% and provides a facile and reversible method to sensitively and quantitatively detect trace pesticide of 2,6-dichloro-4-nitroaniline.\n\nPesticides are widely used in agriculture, but their residues can cause serious damages to ecological safety, and result in hazardous impacts on human health and life quality through the food chain. Hence, the rapid and selective detection of pesticides has become one of the most pressing issues concerning human health and environmental protection. For example, 2,6-dichloro-4-nitroaniline (DCN) is a broad-spectrum pesticide belonging to toxicity class IV. It has been extensively employed for the control of many diseases, such as wheat powdery mildew, cotton rotten bell, and fruit tree and vegetable rot. DCN degrades slowly and can persist for a long time under the environmental conditions. Currently, the common methods of DCN detection include ion mobility spectrometry, high performance liquid chromatography or other assays requiring sophisticated instruments that are expensive and complicated. To address this situation, in this contribution, we synthesize a TPE-based ligand exhibiting prominent AIE nature, and fabricate a novel pillared-layered LMOF using it as a pillar linker. The LMOF has a remarkably high fluorescence quantum yield (\u03a6F) of 99%, and performs outstandingly in DCN detection with a low detection limit down to 0.13 ppm.\n\nThe TPE-based ligand (E)-1,2-diphenyl-1,2-bis(4-(pyridin-4-yl)phenyl)ethene (BPyTPE) is synthesized according to the synthetic route outlined in Scheme S1 (ESI). The crude product of BPyTPE is purified by column chromatography to afford a pure target compound with a trans-conformation, which is confirmed by the single-crystal structure (). The treatment of BPyTPE with Zn(NO3)2\u22c56H2O and biphenyl-4,4'-dicarboxylic acid (H2bpdc) in a mixed solvent of N,N-dimethylacetamide and N,N-dimethylformamide yields colorless cube-like crystals of complex 1. Complex 1 belongs to a triclinic crystal system, space group P (Table S1, ESI). Each Zn2+ ion coordinates to four carboxylate oxygen atoms from different bpdc2- anions and one pyridine nitrogen atom of the BPyTPE ligand, which can be regarded as a tetragonal pyramid. The bond lengths of Zn-O/N are in the range of 2.000-2.038 \u00c5, and the bond angles of O-Zn-O and O-Zn-N are approximately 86.380-89.714\u00b0 and 95.406-105.058\u00b0, respectively. Two Zn2+ ions are bridged by four carboxylic groups to form a paddle-wheel secondary building unit (SBU) [Zn2(COO)4]. Each SBU is linked by coshared carboxylate groups of bpdc2- ligands, generating a rhombic 44 two-dimensional (2D) network with a cross-section of 22.52 \u00d7 20.09 \u00c52 (). Two adjacent layers are connected by BPyTPE pillar linkers with an inter-layer distance of about 21.27 \u00c5 to furnish a stable three-dimensional (3D) framework (). A three-fold interpenetration is observed for the overall structure of complex 1 (), and the pore volume of complex 1 is calculated to be 1793.3 \u00c53, corresponding to a void of around 33.2% per unit cell (5403.2 \u00c53 total). The geometrical conformation for BPyTPE in complex 1 is further investigated (Fig. S1, ESI). It is found that BPyTPE in complex 1 adopts a more twisted conformation with larger dihedral angles between aromatic moieties than BPyTPE in single crystals (Table S2, ESI). There are only very weak \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions between the phenyl rings from bpdc2- ions and pyridine rings from BPyTPE ligands, with the distances of 3.540 and 3.707 \u00c5 (Fig. S2, ESI), while no \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions are observed between the TPE units that are mainly responsible for the light emission.\n\nComplex 1 is stable in THF or water as indicated by powder X-ray diffraction pattern (PXRD) results (Fig. S3, ESI). It can undergo solvent exchange with dichloromethane (DCM), followed by drying under vacuum at room temperature to furnish the solvent-free 1 sample. The result of the powder X-ray diffraction patterns confirms that solvent-free 1 retains the original framework without any collapsing (Fig. S3, ESI). Thermogravimetric analysis of complex 1 reveals 22% initial weight loss by heating from room temperature to 145 \u00b0C in a N2 stream, which is attributed to the loss of solvent molecules. A plateau appears between 145 and 405 \u00b0C, followed by a sharp weight loss (~53%) corresponding to the decomposition of the framework. However, there is no obvious weight change until 405 \u00b0C of solvent-free 1, indicating the solvent molecules in complex 1 have been removed completely (Fig. S4, ESI).\n\nBPyTPE shows an absorption maximum at 335 nm in THF solution (Fig. S5, ESI), associated with the \u03c0-\u03c0* transition of the conjugated backbone. Like most TPE derivatives, BPyTPE is almost nonfluorescent in dilute THF solution because of the active intramolecular rotation. But as the aggregate formation takes place upon the addition of a large amount of water into the THF solution of BPyTPE, the emission peak at 502 nm enhances swiftly (), which is ascribed to the restriction of intramolecular rotations and thus the blocking of nonradiative decay of the excited state. These emission behaviours demonstrate the AIE nature of BPyTPE. Solvent-free 1 exhibits strong blue-green emission at 490 nm (), and complex 1 shows an intense emission peak at 498 nm, which is close to the emission of the BPyTPE aggregate. The emission of solvent-free 1 is blue-shifted by 8 nm compared to that of complex 1. This blue-shift phenomenon often appears in the reported LMOFs, which is probably due to the decreased inter-ligand coupling. Both solvent-free 1 and complex 1 have excellent \u03a6F values of 99% and 79%, respectively, determined using a calibrated integrating sphere, thanks to the AIE nature of the BPyTPE ligand. Both values are much higher than that of the BPyTPE solid (\u03a6F = 43%), owing to the greatly reduced intramolecular motion of BPyTPE when coordinated within the rigid framework. Moreover, when the turbulence of highly disordered solvent molecules is removed, the excited state energy loss is depressed to minimal, giving a remarkably high \u03a6F value approaching the unit of solvent-free 1. The BPyTPE solid, complex 1 and solvent-free 1 exhibit fluorescence lifetimes (\u03c4) of 3.11, 2.85 and 2.39 ns, respectively. This tendency of shorter \u03c4 and higher \u03a6F may result from the immediate release of excited energy via fluorescence, which is the same as the findings of another TPE-based MOF, PCN-94.\n\nThe sensing application of solvent-free 1 in a DCM suspension (0.15 mg mL-1, Fig. S6 and Table S3, ESI) is firstly evaluated using titration experiments with different electron rich aromatics, such as toluene, m-xylene, mesitylene and aniline (Fig. S7, ESI). These tested samples can only slightly enhance the emission intensity. However, the emission of solvent-free 1 can be quenched by nitrobenzene, owing to the excited state electron transfer from the donor (LMOFs) to the acceptor (nitrobenzene guests). The quenching efficiency (QE) is estimated using the formula (I0 - I)/I0, where I0 and I are the emission intensities of solvent-free 1 before and after adding guest molecules. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI), the emission starts to decrease upon the addition of 58 ppm nitrobenzene, and is quenched greatly at a concentration of 1800 ppm with a high quenching efficiency of 98%. It is found that the detection sensitivity of nitro aniline is much higher than those of nitrobenzene and 1,2,3,4,5-pentachloro-6-nitrobenzene under the same conditions (Fig. S9 and S14, ESI). When 55 ppm p-nitroaniline is dispersed into the solvent-free 1 suspension, the emission is almost totally quenched (QE = 98%) (Fig. S10, ESI). The detection limit is as low as ~4.9 \u00d7 10-2 ppm, calculated with 3\u03c3/k (\u03c3: standard deviation; k: slope). The higher selectivity of solvent-free 1 towards nitroaniline (Fig. S11, ESI) probably results from hydrogen bonding interactions (N-H\u22efO) between the amino of guests and the oxygen of bpdc2-.\n\nThe high sensitivity and low detection limit of solvent-free 1 towards nitro aniline inspire us to develop an assay for DCN, which has never been achieved using LMOFs previously.  show the spectra of decline in emission intensity and the linear quenching range of solvent-free 1 upon the addition of DCN (Fig. S12, ESI). The strong emission of solvent-free 1 is quenched drastically, which can be observed by the naked eye (). A quantitative detection of DCN ranging from 0.94 to 16.92 ppm is established with a low detection limit of 0.13 ppm. To confirm the limit of detection, the fluorescence titration of DCN at low concentrations from 0.13 ppm to 0.80 ppm is further performed, and a linear proportion of I0/I is obtained (Fig. S13, ESI). Solvent-free 1 can be reused after centrifuging the suspension and washing with DCM several times (), without degradation in the detection performance. According to China National Food Safety Standard - Maximum Residue Limits for Pesticides in Food, the maximum residue limits for DCN are 7 ppm in fruits of nectarine and grapes and 15 ppm in vegetables of carrots. Obviously, solvent-free 1 can perform outstandingly in the detection of the fruit fungicide of DCN and is competent to fulfill the requirements. To gain insight into the mechanism for detecting DCN, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of DCN and BPyTPE in complex 1 are calculated (Fig. S15, ESI). The excited state electron transfer from the higher LUMO of BPyTPE (-1.77 eV) to that of DCN (-2.40 eV) may occur, resulting in severe fluorescence quenching. Therefore, the photoinduced electron-transfer (PET) may be the sensing mechanism. Furthermore, hydrogen bonding interactions between complex 1 and DCN should also contribute to the good sensitivity of the detection.\n\nIn summary, we have synthesized a TPE-based ligand (BPyTPE) with a trans-conformation and prominent AIE properties. Based on BPyTPE, we have developed a novel pillared-layered LMOF (complex 1) with a three-fold interpenetration structure. Solvent-free 1 exhibits an intense blue-green emission at 498 nm with a remarkably high \u03a6F of 99%. The emission of solvent-free 1 can be quenched efficiently and selectively by nitroaniline. Based on solvent-free 1, we establish a reversible method to sensitively and quantitatively detect trace pesticide of DCN, with a linear range of 0.94-16.92 ppm and a low detection limit of 0.13 ppm. To the best of our knowledge, using LMOFs as a fluorescent sensor to efficiently detect DCN is very rare and the present assay method is a promising one capable of practical application.

An additional band observed for DMA-Dy in the near infrared (NIR) region at 750 nm corresponds to the 4F9/2 \u2192 6H9/2 transition. Similar bands were observed previously for formamidinium dysprosium formate but for this compound the intensity of the band near 480 nm was significantly smaller than the intensity of the 660 nm band. For Dy(III) ions in inorganic hosts concentration quenching due to cross relaxation processes is often observed. The decrease of emission intensity occurs due to the depopulation of the 4F9/2 level of Dy(III) via different possible energy transfer processes: (I) 4F9/2 + 6H15/2 \u2192 6F9/2/6H7/2 + 6F5/2, (II) 4F9/2 + 6H15/2 \u2192 6H9/2/6F11/2 + 6F3/2 and (III) 4F9/2 + 6H15/2 \u2192 6F5/2 + 6H7/2/6F9/2. In most inorganic matrices, luminescence from Dy(III) is strongly quenched when the concentration exceeds 3-4 mol%. The anti-anti formate-bridged Dy-Dy distances in the MOFs studied here do not differ very much from one compound to another, i.e., they range from 6.602 \u00c5 for HYD-Dy to 6.8287 \u00c5 for DMA-Dy. The Dy-Dy distances for the syn-anti connections, which are present only in HYD-Dy, vary from 5.975 to 6.627 \u00c5. Due to long distances between Dy(III) ions the energy transfer between ions is limited and it is possible to observe emission even at very high Dy(III) concentration (up to 100%). It is interesting to note that small changes in the Dy-Dy distances lead to significant decreases of the emission intensity in HYD-Dy, that is, replacement of DMA+ cations by HYD+ cations leads to about a three-fold decrease of the emission intensity. This behavior may be caused by cross relaxation and non-radiative energy transfer between excited levels of Dy(III). The luminescence spectra also show significant differences in intensities of the particular Stark components of the 4F9/2 \u2192 6H15/2 transition. The intensity change of the band observed at higher energy can be attributed to re-absorption of the emitted energy by neighboring Dy(III) ions. The intensity decrease of the transition from the 4F9/2 level to the lower Stark components of the ground 6H15/2 level with the increasing concentration of Dy(III) ions was previously observed by Marciniak et al. Since in our case the concentration of Dy(III) ions remains constant, the observed changes in intensity of the discussed Stark components can be attributed to shortening of the Dy-Dy distances caused by changing the organic cation in the MOF structure. For the MOFs studied here the CIE1931 chromaticity coordinates (x, y) were calculated from the emission spectra to define the emission color (). Under 350 nm excitation, the CIE1931 coordinates for HYD-Dy and DMA-Dy phosphors are (x = 0.251, y = 0.358) and (x = 0.243, y = 0.323), respectively. The obtained values show that proposed MOFs have emission close to white color (x = 0.333, y = 0.333). The desired color of emission can be adjusted by co-doping by other rare earth ions.\n\nThe kinetic of luminescence decay of the 4F9/2 state was measured for DMA-Dy and HYD-Dy at room temperature under 355 nm excitation (Fig. S5, ESI). Emission decay curves of DMA-Dy and HYD-Dy show a single exponential character that confirm a single site of Dy(III) ions and the absence of energy transfer between optically active ions. The decay curves have been fitted using the single exponential formula: I(t) = I0exp(-t/\u03c4).(1)The experimental radiative decay time (\u03c4) is 57 \u03bcs for DMA-Dy and 96 \u03bcs for HYD-Dy. The calculated lifetime for HYD-Dy is 435 \u03bcs (see Discussion below). These results allow us to estimate the quantum yield of HYD-Dy to be about 22.1% and suggest that nonradiative paths dominate the depopulation of the 4F9/2 excited level. It is worth noting that the lifetimes measured for fully concentrated DMA-Dy and HYD-Dy are very long compared to lifetimes observed in inorganic compounds. For instance, the lifetime of the 4F9/2 state of Dy(III) is about 5 \u03bcs for 1 mol% concentration of Dy(III) in LiLaP4O12. It is also long compared to most of the Dy(III)-based MOFs and coordination polymers, for which the lifetime is usually smaller than 13 \u03bcs (see Table S8, ESI). However, a very long lifetime of 1130 \u03bcs was reported for the [DyCd(imdc)(SO4)(H2O)3]\u22c50.5H2O compound, where H3imdc = 4,5-imidazoledicarboxylic acid. It is also worth noting that the lifetimes of DMA-Dy and HYD-Dy (57 and 96 \u03bcs, respectively) are significantly longer than the lifetime of related formamidinium dysprosium formate (2.1 \u03bcs, see Table S8, ESI). The longer lifetimes of DMA-Dy and HYD-Dy compared to the formamidinium analogue indicate that non-radiative processes are less efficient in the compounds studied here which is beneficial for their applications as luminophores.\n\nThe differences in the peak wavelengths of absorption are caused by differences in the polarizability of the ligands, leading to differences in the covalence of the rare earth sites. This behaviour is responsible for the sensitivity of \u03a92 to the covalence degree of the chemical bonds between rare earth ions and their ligands. \u03a94 and \u03a96 can provide a lot of information about the long-range effects and the rigidity of system. The dependence of the Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters on the host composition doped with rare earth ions is of special interest because the radiative properties of rare earth ions are described by these parameters. Many studies appeared to reveal the relationships between the local structure and bonding of glasses around the rare earth ions and the spectroscopic properties of these ions due to the wide use of glasses as lasers and amplifiers. And few intensity parameters are available for rare earth complexes in hybrid organic-inorganic composite materials. Judd-Ofelt phenomenological intensity parameters \u03a9\u03bb determined by a least-squares fitting approach for HYD-Dy crystal are as follows: \u03a92 = 25.20 (10-20 cm-1), \u03a94 = 3.93 (10-20 cm2) and \u03a96 = 4.20 (10-20 cm-1). We cannot compare the \u03a9\u03bb values obtained by us for HYD-Dy with data of other metal-organic compounds since, to our best knowledge, such data were not reported for Dy(III)-based MOFs. It is worth noting, however, that the spectroscopic quality factor X = \u03a94/\u03a96 for Dy(III) in HYD-Dy is 0.935 and this value is situated in the range of values characteristic for dysprosium compounds. One can also notice that the \u03a92 parameter of HYD-Dy is very large. The extraordinarily high value of \u03a92 was previously reported also for other organic-inorganic complexes such as [Eu(fod)3(phen)] (19.00 \u00d7 10-20 cm2) and [Eu(fod)3(phen-N-O] (24.50 \u00d7 10-20 cm2). This behavior was explained by the anisotropic features of the metal-ligand bonds and prominent dynamic coupling associated with the ligand ion polarizability.\n\nRaman and IR data together with the calculated total number of IR- and Raman-active modes allowed us to propose the assignment of all observed modes to the respective motions of atoms in crystal lattices. We were also able to assign the modes of hydrazinium cations, for which vibrational studies are very scarce. Optical studies show that emission of Dy(III) ions can be observed at room temperature. The experimental radiative decay times, 57 \u03bcs for DMA-Dy and 96 \u03bcs for HYD-Dy, are very long compared to lifetimes observed in inorganic compounds and most of the Dy-based MOFs and coordination polymers. The quantum yield was estimated to be 22.1% for HYD-Dy. Although we could not estimate the quantum yield for DMA-Dy, the stronger intensity of its emission suggests a higher quantum yield of this compound compared to HYD-Dy. Unfortunately, it is difficult to discuss if the MOFs studied here have better luminescence properties than other Dy-based MOFs and coordination polymers reported in the literature since we could not find the quantum yield values for such compounds in the literature. Nevertheless, our results show that the HYD-Dy and DMA-Dy studied here have relatively strong and close to white emission."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['peak_spectrum', 'etc']"}]}

TGA measurement was carried out on MOFs 1-6. As shown in Fig. S2, the six isomorphous MOFs 1-6 showed a similar weight loss process. There are three mass loss steps: the first weight losses below around 150 \u00b0C are 7.34% (calcd: 7.30%) for Pr-MOF (1), 7.15% (calcd: 7.11%) for Sm-MOF (2), 7.11% (calcd: 7.09%) for Eu-MOF (3), 6.99% (calcd: 7.04%) for Gd-MOF (4), 6.96% (calcd: 6.98%) for Dy-MOF (5), and 6.97% (calcd: 6.95%) for Ho-MOF (6), which corresponds to the loss of one lattice H2O molecule and one lattice DMF molecule; the second weight losses in the range of 150-325 \u00b0C are 17.47% (calcd: 17.49%) for Pr-MOF (1), 17.31% (calcd: 17.33%) for Sm-MOF (2), 17.24% (calcd: 17.28%) for Eu-MOF (3), 17.16% (calcd: 17.14%) for Gd-MOF (4), 16.97% (calcd: 17.00%) for Dy-MOF (5) and 16.90% (calcd: 16.93%) for Ho-MOF (6), which corresponds to the loss of four coordinated H2O and two DMF molecules and then the weight losses can be ascribed to the decomposition of the frameworks.\n\nMagnetic properties\n\nThermal magnetic properties of Pr-MOF (1), Gd-MOF (4), Dy-MOF (5) and Ho-MOF (6) were measured in the range of 2-300 K under 1000 Oe and are shown in . The room temperature \u03c7T values of these MOFs and corresponding expected values are summarized in .\n\nThe \u03c7T value of Pr-MOF (1) at 300 K is 3.22 emu K mol-1, which is comparable with the value (3.20 emu K mol-1) expected for two isolated PrIII ions in the 3H4 ground states. Upon cooling, the \u03c7T values of Pr-MOF (1) decrease continuously and reach a minimum value of 0.23 emu K mol-1 at 2 K. The decrease upon cooling is mainly due to the depopulation of the excited Stark sublevels related to the ligand field, although weak antiferromagnetic interactions between PrIII ions could also make a contribution. The \u03c7T value of Gd-MOF (4) at 300 K is 16.03 emu K mol-1, which is also close to the expected spin-only values of 15.76 emu K mol-1 for two isolated GdIII ions. As the temperature is lowered, the \u03c7T values of Gd-MOF (4) remain almost constant until 6 K and then drop upon further cooling. The 1/\u03c7 vs. T plots of Gd-MOF (4) are linear in the whole temperature range, following the Curie-Weiss law with C = 16.04 emu K mol-1 and \u03b8 = -0.12 K. These features suggest that Gd-MOF (4) exhibits antiferromagnetic interactions between the neighboring GdIII ions.\n\nwith A = ex + 5e3x + 14e6x + 30e10x + 55e15x + 91e21x + 140e28x\n\n B = 1 + 3ex + 5e3x + 7e6x + 9e10x + 11e15x + 13e21x + 15e28x\n\nThe best-fit parameter in the whole temperature range led to J = -0.032 cm-1 and g = 2.01. The negative J value confirms the occurrence of weak antiferromagnetic couplings in Gd-MOF (4).\n\nFor Dy-MOF (5) and Ho-MOF (6), the \u03c7T values at 300 K are 28.35 and 28.15 emu K mol-1, respectively, which are comparable with the expected values (). The \u03c7T values of these two Ln-MOFs gradually decrease as the temperature decreases, reaching 22.75 emu K mol-1 and 16.65 emu K mol-1, respectively, at 2 K. These magnetic behaviors may be ascribed to antiferromagnetic interactions between spin carriers and/or the thermal depopulation of the excited Stark sublevels.\n\nThe field dependence of the magnetization data of Pr-MOF (1), Gd-MOF (4), Dy-MOF (5), and Ho-MOF (6) was also investigated in the range of 0-50 kOe at 2 K (). The magnetization of Pr-MOF (1) increases linearly as the field is increased and the value is 0.94 N\u03b2 at 50 kOe, which is much lower than the expected value (6.4 N\u03b2 for two PrIII ions). The magnetization of Gd-MOF (4) (13.74 N\u03b2 per two Gd ions) at 50 kOe is much lower than the saturation value, which is consistent with the antiferromagnetic nature in Gd-MOF (4). The magnetization calculated with the Brillouin function (S = 7/2) is above the experimental values of Gd-MOF (4) (, black solid line), which is consistent with the result obtained from the \u03c7T-T curves. In addition, the magnetization of Dy-MOF (5) and Ho-MOF (6) first increases rapidly and then increases smoothly. They reach 10.53 and 12.05 N\u03b2 at 50 kOe for Dy-MOF (5) and Ho-MOF (6), respectively, which are lower than the expected value of 20 N\u03b2 for two uncoupled DyIII ions or HoIII ions. These behaviors of the magnetization of Dy-MOF (5) and Ho-MOF (6) may be caused by anisotropy and crystal-field effects, which is similar to those observed in previous DyIII and HoIII MOFs.\n\nLuminescence properties\n\nThe solid luminescence properties of the H3L ligand and Eu-MOF (3) were investigated at room temperature and are shown in Fig. S6. The free H3L ligand exhibits an emission maximum at 467 nm (\u03bbex = 373 nm), which is probably attributable to the \u03c0-\u03c0* or n-\u03c0* transitions. Upon excitation at 336 nm, Eu-MOF (3) displays characteristic emission bands at 590, 616, 650 and 695 nm, which are ascribed to the 5D0 \u2192 7FJ (J = 1, 2, 3, 4) transitions of EuIII ions. The strongest emission is centered at 616 nm and corresponds to the 5D0 \u2192 7F2 transition. Moreover, Eu-MOF (3) displays the exponential decay with a reasonable long lifetime (0.38 ms) obtained by the decay lifetime curves (Fig. S7). Considering the nitro O atoms and uncoordinated carboxylate O atoms exposed in the structures, and the excellent luminescence of Eu-MOF (3), its potential luminescence sensing towards small molecules was carefully evaluated. We investigated the luminescence properties of Eu-MOF (3) in different small molecules, including DMF, DMA, MeOH, EtOH, acetone, CH3CN, CH2Cl2, toluene, nitrobenzene (NB) and ethylenediamine (EN) (Fig. S8). The luminescence intensities are largely dependent on the small molecules, especially for EN, which shows an intense quenching effect. Meanwhile, the aqueous solvent shows the strongest emission. As a result, we choose the aqueous solvent as the dispersion medium to detect amine molecules.\n\nIn order to investigate the sensitivity of luminescence quenching effects, the luminescence spectra were recorded by gradually increasing various concentrations of EN, EA, IPA, DiPA, and TEA, respectively (). All the five alkylamines lead to luminescence quenching and the luminescence intensities are decreased gradually with increasing the concentration of the alkylamines. When the concentration of the alkylamines (EN, EA, IPA, DiPA, and TEA) is increased to 1 mM, the quenching efficiency can reach 96.3/95.8/94.7/93.6/93.3%, respectively ( and S9). The order of quenching efficiency is EN > EA > IPA > DiPA > TEA. It is noted that the quenching efficiency is defined as (I0 - I)/I0 \u00d7 100% (where I0 is the original luminescence intensity of Eu-MOF (3), while I is the luminescence intensity of Eu-MOF (3) after the addition of the analyte). To quantitatively explain the results, the quenching efficiency can be calculated by the Stern-Volmer equation: (I0/I) = KSV[A] + 1, in which KSV is the quenching constant [M-1] and [A] is the molar concentration of the alkylamines. The Stern-Volmer plots show an almost linear relationship for all the five alkylamines at low concentrations (), with the KSV values listed in , which are relatively high compared to those of the reported MOF-based sensors for sensing alkylamines (Table S8). The KSV value (5.8 \u00d7 104 M-1) of EN is slightly higher than those of the other four alkylamines. According to 3\u03b4/k () (\u03b4: standard error; k: slope), the detection limits are obtained ()."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['decomposition_temperature', 'magnetic_susceptibility', 'etc', 'magnetic_moment', 'peak_spectrum']"}]}

The electronic structure and bandgap were further investigated by DFT calculations. Photoelectrochemical studies indicated that NTU-9 is photoactive under visible light illumination (\u03bb > 400 nm) and acts as a p-type semiconductor. The results demonstrated that Ti(IV)-based MOFs could be promising visible-light photocatalysts for energy conversion and environmental remediation.\n\nThe diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 750s UV-Vis spectrometer. As shown in , the spectrum of NTU-9 shows a broad range of absorption in the visible region from 400 nm to 750 nm with an absorption peak centered at around 520 nm. The calculated bandgap of NTU-9 from the absorption onset is about 1.72 eV. The absorption of NTU-9 was dramatically red-shifted when compared with TiO2 (3.2 eV for anatase and 3.0 for rutile), and the reported Ti(IV)-based MOF MIL-125 (3.6 eV) and its isostructure MIL-125-NH2 (2.6 eV).\n\nTo understand the electronic structure of NTU-9, the density of states (DOS) and the electronic band structure of NTU-9 were calculated using the density functional theory (DFT) in the CASTEP program. As depicted in Fig. S4-S6 (ESI), the valence band (VB) of NTU-9 between the energy level (-4.0 eV) and the Fermi level (0.0 eV) is mainly contributed from the O 2p states mixed with a small amount of C 2p states. The conduction bands (CB) above Fermi energy are mostly made up of Ti 3d states, with minor contributions from the C 2p and O 2p states. The DOS results indicate the existence of charge transfer from the organic ligand to Ti(IV) atoms in NTU-9. The dominations of VB and CB by O and Ti atoms in NTU-9 are similar to that of TiO2, whose VB is mainly formed by the overlapping of O 2p orbitals and CB is mainly constituted of the 3d states of Ti. The small contributions of p atomic orbitals of carbon to the CB in NTU-9 may alter and further reduce the band gap by changing the degree of conjugation or functional group modification in the ligands. This \u2018designable' character of MOFs could lead to the synthesis of more Ti(IV)-based MOF semiconductors with visible light activity. The CB minimum (1.74 eV) and VB maximum (0 eV) are located at the same k-point in the Brillouin zone (Fig. S4, ESI). The band structure illustrates that the interband transitions of NTU-9 are direct, which may exhibit a higher photonic efficiency compared with indirect band gap semiconductors such as TiO2. The calculated energy band gap for NTU-9 is 1.74 eV, which matches the experimental data very well.\n\nThe photoelectrochemical properties of NTU-9 were studied in a three-electrode set-up.  shows the photocurrent profile of the NTU-9/FTO electrode recorded under zero-bias (two-electrode, short-circuit) conditions, indicating that the NTU-9 is active under visible light (\u03bb > 400 nm) illumination. The repeatable cathodic (negative) photocurrent of ~60 nA cm-2 suggests that NTU-9 is a p-type semiconductor. As shown in the inset of , the NTU-9/FTO cells also showed highly repeatable photovoltage (illuminated open-circuit potential) responses of ~7 mV during the on-off cycles of illumination throughout the measurement. To further reveal the conductivity and flat-band potential of NTU-9, the Mott-Schottky measurement was performed in 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. As shown in , the negative slope indicates p-type behaviour of NTU-9, consistent with our previous analysis. Besides the p-type behavior, the Mott-Schottky measurement gives the flat-band potential of NTU-9 at around 0.76 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The carrier concentration of NTU-9 can be estimated from the slope of the Mott-Schottky plot using Na = (2/eo\u03b5\u03b5o)[d(1/C2)/dV]-1, where eo is the electron charge, \u03b5 is the NTU-9 dielectric constant, \u03b5o is the vacuum permittivity, and Na is the acceptor density.

It was found that the degradation rates of MB are 66.3% for 1, 61.6% for 2, 60.0% for 3 and 30.2% for blank experiment after 90 min. 1-3 remain stable after photocatalytic reaction. 1-3 are good photocatalysts for the degradation of the organic dye MB.\n\nSome CPs show good photocatalytic activities for the degradation of the organic dye MB. For example, the Ding and Hou group reported six CPs which manifest good photocatalytic activities for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) (1: 74%, 2: 41%, 3: 37%, 4: 76%, 5: 46%, 6: 75% after 160 min under UV light and in the presence of H2O2. The Zhao and Zhang group recently synthesized five CPs. Three CPs (1-3) show relatively good photocatalytic activities for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) under UV light and in the presence of H2O2. The degradation efficiency of MB is up to 97.3% after 2 hours for 1, 77.4% for 2, and 66.8% for 3.\n\nPXRD and thermal stability\n\nThe measured and simulated PXRDs confirm the purity of 1, 2 and 3 (Fig. S7, S8 and S9, ESI). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of 1, 2 and 3 was performed on crystalline samples heated from 30 to 800 \u00b0C under a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S10, ESI). The lattice and coordinated water molecules of 1 were completely lost at 148 \u00b0C (calcd: 9.05%, found: 9.25%), and the remaining substance was stable up to 210 \u00b0C. The residue of 1 at 800 \u00b0C should be CoO (calcd: 23.17%, found: 23.13%). The lattice and coordination water molecules of 2 and 3 were completely lost at 147 and 143 \u00b0C, respectively (calcd: 9.98, found: 10.02% for 2; calcd: 17.66, found: 17.38% for 3). The networks of 2 and 3 were stable up to 253 and 244 \u00b0C, respectively. The residues of 2 and 3 at 800 \u00b0C should be CoO (calcd: 23.72%, found: 23.13% for 2; calcd: 26.70%, found: 27.62% for 3)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['magnetic_susceptibility', 'etc', 'decomposition_temperature']"}]}

The magnetic susceptibility above 15 K obeys the Curie-Weiss law with a Weiss constant, \u03b8=-3.1 K, and a Curie constant, C=0.432 cm3 mol- K. The C value corresponds to g=2.15, S=1/2 for a Cu2+ ion. The negative Weiss constant indicates antiferromagnetic interaction between copper ions. \u03c7M increases as the temperature is lowered, reaching a sharp maximum at ca. 8.8 K, suggesting antiferromagnetic ordering. The Neel temperature, TN, of l was determined from the plot of d(\u03c7MT)/dTvs.T at 5.0 K, shown in the inset of . The in-phase component of the ac susceptibility (\u03c7') is frequency independent and also shows a maximum around 8-9 K, while the out-of-phase component (\u03c7\") is zero, in accordance with antiferromagnetic ordering (Fig. S1, ESI).\n\nThe field dependence of the magnetization for 1 at different temperatures is shown in . The magnetization below TN increases very slowly with increasing field in the beginning due to antiferromagnetic ordering, it then increases more rapidly as it undergoes a transition from an antiferromagnet to a spin-flop state at a rather high transition field of around 50-70 kOe, depending on the temperature.

The optimally designed CdS-based MOF exhibits an exceptional H2-evolution rate of 26.1 mmol g-1 h-1 which is almost the highest rate among the reported co-catalyst-free MOF systems.\n\nThe experimental XRD pattern of the DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD) MOF is shown in , which matches very well with the simulated one that is obtained on the basis of single crystal structure analysis, indicating a good phase purity of the constructed MOF. Furthermore, the DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD) MOF possesses good thermal and chemical stabilities (Fig. S1 and S2). The electronic structure simulations of the DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD) MOF were completed using density functional theory with the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional, and the computational details are shown in the ESI. As illustrated in , the predicted band gap of the MOF is about 3.32 eV, which coincides basically with its actual absorption edge position(~388 nm for ~3.2 eV) obtained from the UV-vis absorption spectrum (). The level-off tail in the absorption spectra is believed to be due to the structural defects in the MOF. Furthermore, the projected density of states (PDOS) () shows that the valence band maximum (VBM) of the DLNU-M-CdS (H2TD) MOF is mainly composed of S 3p and N 2p orbitals while its conduction band minimum (CBM) is mainly constituted by C 2p and Cd 5s orbitals. Upon intrinsic photo-excitation of the MOF, the photoinduced electrons would transfer from the S 3p/N 2p to Cd 5s orbitals, simultaneously leaving the photoinduced holes in the S 3p/N 2p orbitals. Thus, the photo-oxidation and photo-reduction active-sites of the MOF are located on the S/N and Cd atoms, respectively. According to the crystal structure of the DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD) MOF and the interaction between the MOF and hole-scavenger TEOA, the photoinduced charge-carrier migration channels from the N 2p to the Cd 5s orbital in the MOF should play a key role in the improvement of photocatalytic activity for proton reduction.\n\nThe photocatalytic proton-reduction test of the DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD) MOF was conducted under UV-visible light irradiation with TEOA as the sacrificial hole-scavenger but without any additional co-catalyst or photo-sensitizer. Control experiments indicated that no H2 evolution occurred in the absence of either photocatalysts or light irradiation. As observed in , the DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD) MOF exhibits a remarkable photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution. Furthermore, the H2-evolution amounts strongly depend on the content of the hole-scavenger TEOA, suggesting that the electron-donating process from the TEOA to the MOF serves as the leading factor for the photocatalytic proton reduction. In our case, the optimal photocatalytic activity of the DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD) MOF appeared in the photocatalytic system containing 15 vol% TEOA. When a higher content of TEOA was used for the photocatalytic reaction, the adsorption-desorption and diffusion behaviors of TEOA on the MOF surface may be limited due to the high viscosity of TEOA, thereby resulting in a decreased photocatalytic activity. What's more, the initial pH value for the TEOA water solution also influences the photocatalytic H2-evolution of the DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD) MOF (). A low pH value of the photocatalytic solution would impede the formation of double-hydrogen bonds between TEOA and the ligand of the MOF due to the protonation of the N atom in the ligand. In this case, the electron-donating process from the TEOA to the MOF was greatly weakened, which therefore led to a fast recombination of charge-carriers and a low activity of the MOF for photocatalytic H2 evolution. Moreover, a high pH value of the photocatalytic solution is also not beneficial for the H2 evolution, due to the fact that a small amount of H+ ions is supplied to the photo-reduction active-sites (Cd atoms) of the MOF. As concluded from the above results, the optimal photocatalytic solution for the DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD) MOF is 15 vol% TEOA in water with the initial pH at 9. Upon UV-visible light irradiation, the MOF exhibits a good time-dependent photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 26.1 mmol g-1 h-1 (). Notably, this H2-evolution rate is almost the highest one among the values reported for other co-catalyst-free photocatalytic systems over the MOF photocatalysts (). Moreover, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of the DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD) MOF reaches ~1.38% at 365 nm by using only 1 mg of the photocatalyst. This AQE is comparable to the corresponding values obtained from the co-catalyst-assisted MOF photocatalysts. Interestingly, when we used the other sacrificial hole-scavengers with different bonding abilities to the H2TD ligand during the photocatalysis, the photocatalytic activity of the DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD) MOF for H2 evolution was changed obviously according to the electron-donating process from the scavenger to the MOF (Fig. S3 and Table S2). These results confirm the efficiency of the electron-donating strategy proposed in our work.\n\nTo further generalize the electron-donating strategy in the design of co-catalyst-free MOF photocatalysts, another novel isomeric CdS-based MOF of DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD)(H2O) was constructed through a similar hydrothermal process by using CdCl2\u22c55/2H2O as the metal node precursor (Fig. S4-S6). According to the single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, the DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD)(H2O) MOF belongs to the monoclinic space group P21/n (Fig. S7). As expected, this MOF also displays the co-catalyst-free photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution in the presence of the hole-scavenger TEOA upon UV-visible light irradiation (, S8 and S9). However, after optimizing the photocatalytic solution parameters, the H2-evolution rate of DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD)(H2O) was only 6.9 mmol g-1 h-1, which is about 3.8 times lower than that of DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD). The different photocatalytic activity of these two CdS-based MOFs can be attributed to their discrepant crystal and electronic structures. As evidenced by the crystal structures ( and S10) and the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) results, the content of metal Cd nodes in DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD)(H2O) (~12.3 wt%) is lower than that in the DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD) (~22.9 wt%). Meanwhile, the Cd coordination node in DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD)(H2O) is only bonded with one N atom from the H2TD ligand. Similarly, DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD)(H2O) is also a UV-light-active semiconductor with the band gap larger than that of DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD), as concluded by both the theoretical calculation and experimental results (). Importantly, the two isomeric MOFs possess the same orbital constitutions for their CB and VB, implying that the electron-donating strategy is also suitable for the DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD)(H2O) MOF toward the co-catalyst-free photocatalytic proton reduction. However, although electron donation from the hole-scavenger TEOA to the DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD)(H2O) MOF across the formed hydrogen bond O-H\u22efN can effectively hinder the charge-carrier recombination, photoinduced electron transfer from the N to Cd atoms in the MOF is unsatisfactory due to only one electron-migration channel (Cd-N) in this MOF. Please note that there are two migration channels (N-Cd-N) in the DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD) MOF. Based on the above results and analyses, we deduce that the Cd nodes in the two MOFs are main photo-reduction active-sites for H2 evolution. Thus, the lower photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution over the DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD)(H2O) as compared to the DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD) can be ascribed to the following two reasons: (i) the low content of Cd nodes for providing photo-reduction active-sites; (ii) poor electron transfer from N to Cd atoms limits the generation of the available electrons for executing the proton reduction.\n\nTo confirm the above assumption, a series of photoinduced carrier-dynamics tests were performed on the two MOFs.  shows the measurement results of the incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) and the transient photocurrent responses (TPR). It can be seen that the IPCE curves of the two samples match well with their respective intrinsic absorption curves, indicating that the defect-induced visible-light absorptions of these samples do not contribute to the separation of charge-carriers for executing the H2 evolution. Furthermore, the maximum IPCE of DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD) is about 6.7% at 300 nm. This value is ~3.0 times larger than the corresponding IPCE of DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD)(H2O) (~2.2%). Meanwhile, the transient photocurrent of the DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD) (~1.12 mA) is ~3.5 higher than that of DLNU-M-CdS(H2TD)(H2O) (~0.32 mA) during several on-off cycles of irradiation by UV-visible light. Thus, we believe that the Cd nodes in the MOF act as the main supports for releasing the photoinduced electrons. And, the corresponding bonding mode between the Cd nodes and their adjacent N atoms affects the separation process of the photoinduced charge-carriers in the MOF. Please note that the above IPCE and TPR values of the two MOFs should be much smaller than their real values, because the insulating organic binder is introduced to fix the MOFs onto the electrodes during the tests."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['etc']"}]}

The asymmetric unit found in compounds 1-3 contains one Ln(hfac)3, three Cu(hfac)2 moieties and two NITPhPyrim radical ligands, but there are two CH2Cl2 solvent molecules for complex 1 ( and Fig. S1 and S4 in the ESI). Each LnIII ion is surrounded by eight oxygen atoms coming from three hfac ligands and two radical ligands. As is known, the eight-coordinate geometries may be mostly taken as D4d-square antiprism (SAPR), D2d-dodecahedral (DD), or C2v-bicapped trigonal prism (TPRS). Continuous shape measurements have been performed with SHAPE to evaluate the actual shape of the coordination spheres of the Ln centers for complexes 1-3 (). The results indicate that all of them are located in distorted dodecahedral environments (D2d) and the changes in the coordination environments from 1 to 3 are small. In the three complexes, the average Ln-O (nitroxide) bond distances are 2.366, 2.324 and 2.297 \u00c5 for complexes 1-3 respectively, which become shorter with an increase of the atom number of lanthanide due to lanthanide contraction. The CuII ions are located in elongated octahedral coordination environments. The equatorial plane is formed by four oxygen atoms of hfac with the average Cu-O(hfac) bonds of 1.962, 1.952 and 1.942 \u00c5 for 1-3, respectively. The apical positions are occupied by one nitrogen atom from the pyrimidine ring of one radical ligand and one oxygen atom from the other radical ligand for Cu1 and Cu2 with the average Cu-O (nitroxide) bonds of 2.506 \u00c5 for 1, 2.504 \u00c5 for 2 and 2.510 \u00c5 for 3 and Cu-N (pyrimidine) bonds of 2.301, 2.317 and 2.296 \u00c5 for 1-3, respectively, while two nitrogen atoms of two pyrimidine rings from two radicals are located in axial positions for Cu3 with the average Cu-N (pyrimidine) bonds of 2.378, 2.385 and 2.378 \u00c5 for 1-3, respectively. It is obvious to see that the axial bond lengths are significantly longer than the basal distances owing to the Jahn-Teller elongation effect. As shown in , S2 and S5, two NITPhPyrim radicals as bridged ligands link two Cu(hfac)2 units through the oxygen atoms of nitroxide groups and pyrimidine nitrogen atoms to form a [Cu2(NITPhPyrim)2] dimer ring. Each cyclic dimer binds to two Ln(hfac)3 units through its two NO groups to result in a one-dimensional chain. Finally these 1-D chains are connected to Cu(hfac)2 units through the pyrimidine nitrogen atoms of the radical ligands to lead to one two-dimensional layer, in which the NITPhPyrim radical ligand acts as a tetradentate to bridge metal ions in \u03bc4-\u03b71 : \u03b71 : \u03b71 : \u03b71 mode. Within the two-dimensional network, the distance of Cu2\u22efCu3 is 6.440 \u00c5 for complex 1, 6.234 \u00c5 for complex 2 and 6.205 \u00c5 for complex 3. The Cu\u22efLn distance is 8.686 \u00c5 for complex 1 (Cu1\u22efTb1), 8.627 \u00c5 for complex 2 (Cu2\u22efHo1#1, #1:x, -1/2 - y, -1/2 + z) and 8.634 \u00c5 for complex 3 (Cu2\u22efYb1#2, #2:x, 3/2 - y, -1/2 + z). The 2-D heterospin layers stack parallel to one another with the shortest interlayer Cu\u22efLn separation of 9.875 \u00c5 for complex 1 (Cu1\u22efTb1#3, #3:2 - x, -1/2 + y, 1/2 - z), 10.189 \u00c5 for complex 2 (Cu1\u22efHo1#4, #4:1 - x, 1/2 + y, -1/2 - z), and 10.119 \u00c5 for complex 3 (Cu1\u22efYb1#5, #5:-x, 1/2 + y, 1/2 - z) (, S4 and S6).\n\nMagnetic properties\n\nVariable-temperature dc magnetic susceptibility data for compounds 1-3 were investigated in the temperature range 1.8-300 K and under an applied field of 1000 Oe (). At room temperature, the \u03c7MT values of complexes 1-3 are 14.72, 17.26 and 5.26 cm3 K mol-1, respectively, which are somewhat above the expected values (1: 13.70; 2: 16.02; 3: 4.52 cm3 K mol-1) for one isolated LnIII (TbIII: 7F6, S = 3, L = 3, g = 3/2, C = 11.82 cm3 K mol-1; HoIII: 5I8, S = 2, L = 6, g = 5/4, C = 14.07 cm3 K mol-1; YbIII: 2F7/2, S = 1/2, L = 3, g = 8/7, C = 2.57 cm3 K mol-1) ion, two radicals (S = 1/2, C = 0.375 cm3 K mol-1) and three CuII (S = 1/2, C = 0.375 cm3 K mol-1) ions assuming that g = 2.0. Upon cooling, for 1, the \u03c7MT value remains almost constant until 90 K, and then increases more and more sharply to reach a value of 19.52 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K, indicating that ferromagnetic interactions dominate in this compound. For 2, the \u03c7MT value remains almost constant as the temperature is reduced to 50 K and then decreases rapidly to reach 9.60 cm3 K mol-1 at 1.8 K. For 3, as the temperature is lowered, the \u03c7MT value gradually decreases to 3.87 cm3 K mol-1 at 35 K and then drops down sharply to 1.63 cm3 K mol-1 at 1.8 K. According to the crystal structure, the oxygen atoms of NO groups of NITPhPyrim radical ligands are directly coordinated to CuII ions in the apical positions, in which the magnetic orbitals of the CuII ion (dx2-y2) and the nitroxide group (\u03c0*) are orthogonal to each other, and this will result in ferromagnetic interaction. The magnetic coupling between the LnIII ion and the directly coordinated nitroxide group also suggests the presence of ferromagnetic coupling for the LnIII with 4f7-4f10 electronic configurations. The magnetic coupling between two CuII ions through the pyrimidine ring should be weak because two CuII ions are connected via axial-axial positions and the out-of-plane exchange pathway is involved. The magnetic exchange coupling between the CuII ion and the nitroxide group through phenyl and pyrimidine rings should be weak, which is expected to be ferromagnetic according to the spin-polarization mechanism (Chart S1). In addition, there exists an important antiferromagnetic coupling between two NO groups through LnIII ions. Thus ferromagnetic interactions are expected to dominate these complexes. The magnetic behaviors of the Ho and Yb complexes do not exhibit an increase of their \u03c7MT values as the T are lowered, indicating that the ferromagnetic Ln-radical contributions are weaker for these two ions and their effect on \u03c7MT is just overwhelmed by the stronger contributions of the crystal field effect as compared to Tb. The M versus H curve at 2.0 K for complexes 1-3 shows that the magnetization smoothly increases with the applied field to the values of 10.59, 11.16 and 4.92N\u03b2 at 7 T, respectively (Fig. S7), which are much lower than the expected saturation values, indicating the presence of significant magnetic anisotropy and/or low-lying excited states in the three complexes.\n\nTo further investigate the dynamics of magnetization, the alternating current (ac) susceptibilities have been measured for compounds 1-3. For 1, both in-phase (\u03c7') and out-of-phase (\u03c7'') susceptibilities show a strong frequency dependence under zero direct current (dc) field (), demonstrating the existence of magnetic relaxation behavior. Unfortunately, these data do not show the maximum of \u03c7'' in the temperature region technically available, which can be attributed mainly to quantum tunneling of the magnetization (QTM). To shut down the tunneling pathway, an external magnetic field can be applied to split the degenerate levels and prompt the slow relaxation of the magnetization. Thus the ac susceptibilities of the Tb complex are measured in a 3 kOe external field. As a result, both in-phase and out-of-phase frequency-dependent signals are more visible and good peak shapes are observed. Notably, there are two relaxation phases, corresponding to the low-temperature signal region and the high-temperature signal region (). To further understand the nature of the two types of dynamics, two sets of magnetization relaxation parameters in the form of ln(\u03c4) versus 1/T plots were analyzed by the Arrhenius law, \u03c4 = \u03c40exp(\u0394/kBT), and the activation energies (\u0394) for the magnetization reversal were estimated as \u0394(1)/kB = 22.63 K with \u03c40(1) = 9.35 \u00d7 10-8 s for the high-temperature peak series and \u0394(2)/kB = 11.89 K with \u03c40(2) = 1.14 \u00d7 10-7 s for the low-temperature peaks (). These obtained \u03c40 values are consistent with the expected characteristic relaxation time of 10-6-10-11 s for SMMs. Both thermally activated relaxation processes are attributed to the Orbach process because the two \u03c40 values and the two activation energies are similar."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['crystal_system', 'space_group', 'magnetic_susceptibility', 'etc']"}]}

Previous studies have shown that such a short distance might lead to important magnetic interactions. The magnitude of the magnetic coupling can be related to the separation between two NO groups, the N-O\u22efN angle (\u03b1) and the dihedral angle (\u03b2) between the plane (N-O\u22efO-N) and the plane (O-N-C-N-O) of the nitronyl nitroxide radicals (Chart S1). The \u03b1 and \u03b2 are 108.69\u00b0 and 73.82\u00b0 for 1.\n\nTemperature-dependent magnetic susceptibilities for compound 1 have been measured under 1 kOe in the temperature range of 2-300 K. The resulting \u03c7MT vs. T plot is depicted in .\n\nFor complex 1, the measured \u03c7MT value at room temperature is 8.35 cm3 K mol-1, being very close to the theoretical value of 8.26 cm3 K mol-1 for one uncoupled GdIII ion (GdIII: 8S7/2, S = 7/2, L = 0, g = 2, C = 7.88 cm3 K mol-1) and one organic radical (S = 1/2). On cooling the sample, the \u03c7MT value increases continuously to reach a maximum of 9.35 cm3 K mol-1 at 4 K, and then rapidly decreases to 9.32 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K. This observation suggests that the ferromagnetic interaction dominates in the present magnetic system. Based on the above structural analyses, three kinds of magnetic exchanges should be considered. One is the magnetic coupling between the Gd(III) ion and the NO group through phenyl and imidazole rings, which is expected to be very weak due to a small spin density on the N atom of imidazole. Another magnetic exchange arises from the neighboring uncoordinated NO\u22efON interaction due to the short distance (3.513 \u00c5). However, the other two important geometric parameters related to such a magnetic coupling, \u03b1 and \u03b2 (\u03b1: 108.69\u00b0; \u03b2: 73.82\u00b0), significantly deviate from 90\u00b0, which suggest that the overlapping of \u03c0*-orbitals is not fully effective. Consequently, a very weak exchange interaction is envisaged. The last magnetic exchange is the magnetic coupling between the Gd and NO groups through a hydrogen bonding bridge, which should be the main pathway to transmit magnetic coupling in the present magnetic system. Accordingly, the magnetic behavior of 1 could be analyzed as a two-spin magnetic system consisting of Gd and nitroxide groups. The theoretical expression is deduced from the spin Hamiltonian H = -JSRadSGd as . Other weak magnetic couplings are introduced by using the mean-field, zJ'. (1)\u03c7M = \u03c7RadGd/[1 - (zJ'\u03c7radGd/Ng2\u03b22)]\n\nThe optimized magnetic parameters are J = 1.76 cm-1, g = 2.02, zJ' = -0.022 cm-1. These results indicate that the magnetic interaction between the Gd and NO groups via a hydrogen bond is ferromagnetic. The observed appreciable magnetic exchange might be ascribed to the considerably short OH\u22efON distance of 2.766(3) \u00c5.\n\nThe field dependent isothermal magnetization measurement for complex 1 was determined at 2.0 K (). As the field is increased, the experimental magnetization increases up to 8.12N\u03b2 at 7 T for 1, which is in good agreement with the expected saturation value of 8.0N\u03b2. Moreover, the experimental M value is above the magnetization calculated using the Brillouin function for one non-coupled S = 7/2 and one S = 1/2 spin center at low fields, clearly supporting the N-O\u22efGd ferromagnetic exchange interaction."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['crystal_system', 'space_group', 'magnetic_susceptibility', 'etc', 'magnetic_moment']"}]}

The crystal structure of 1 (see ESI) is shown in . Two types of Cd2+ centers and two 4-aminophenyl-1H-tetrazolate  (Fig. S1, ESI) lead to a 3-D network with 1-D channels. The coordination geometry around Cd1, which is on a crystallographic inversion center, is octahedral with four N atoms of the tetrazole groups from four different  occupying the corners of a square and two O atoms from two \u03bc3-OH- groups at the apical positions (Table S2, ESI). Cd2 is in a distorted octahedral environment and is coordinated to two  of tetrazole groups from two different , one  from the  of a , one oxygen atom from , and two oxygen atoms from two different \u03bc3-OH- groups. The \u03bc3-OH- groups link Cd1 and Cd2 to form a 1-D chain, {[Cd3(OH)2]4+}n, running along the a-axis (). The two  in the asymmetric unit of 1 are in two different coordination modes. One is a tridentate  and uses the two  (N2, N3) of its tetrazolate group to bridge two adjacent Cd atoms (Cd1, Cd2) in the 1-D chain and the  (N5) of the  to link atom Cd2 in the adjacent chain to form a 2-D sheet structure ( and Fig. S2, ESI). The other as a bidentate  uses the two  (N7, N8) of its tetrazolate group to bridge another two adjacent Cd atoms (Cd1, Cd2) in the 1-D chain and acts as the ridge part of the 2-D sheet motif (). The ridges are interdigitated with those of neighboring 2-D sheets by hydrogen bonds to form a 3-D network with 1D channels. The hydrogen atoms of the  (N10) in the bidentate  act as  towards the  (N1, N4) of the tetrazole residue, while the  (N10) of the  also acts as a  to form a hydrogen bond with a \u03bc3-OH- group ( and Table S3, ESI). As shown in , the two neighboring bidentate , which are almost parallel to each other, also contribute to the formation of the interdigitated 3D structure via the \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction between  and tetrazole groups (Fig. S5 and Table S4, ESI). The 1-D channels are along the a-axis with a cross section of 5.4 \u00d7 5.4 \u00c52 (the channel size is measured after considering van der Waals radii for constituting atoms) (). The cavity volume is 208.5 \u00c53 per unit cell, which is ca. 20.2% of the total crystal volume (calculated by PLATON).\n\n () of 1 (Fig. S3, ESI) reveals a weight loss of 4.7% in the region 80-250 \u00b0C. This weight loss corresponds to 0.75 DMF molecules per formula unit (calc. 5.0%) and is consistent with the elemental analysis.  of the framework is observed above 300 \u00b0C. The -free framework, 1a, was obtained by heating a crystal of 1 at 200 \u00b0C for about 20 min. The crystal structure of 1a is similar to that of 1, except that the DMF and  molecules in the  channels are removed from the framework (see ESI). The integrity of the microporous framework was also confirmed by measuring the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of 1a, which shows sharp diffraction peaks similar to those of 1 even without  molecules (). The temperature-dependent PXRD patterns suggest the stability of the framework up to 300 \u00b0C (Fig. S4, ESI), which is consistent with the TGA result.\n\nThe host framework, 1a, was subjected to gas sorptions using CO2, H2 and N2. It was observed that 1a adsorbs CO2 and H2, but not N2 (). A steep rise was observed at relatively low pressure in the adsorption branch of CO2, this early uptake indicating the presence of permanent micropores in 1a. Calculations based on the T-method from H2 isotherm gave a pore opening of ca. 5.5 \u00c5, consistent with the single-crystal structure analysis. The pore volume for 1a (0.056 mL g-1) measured from H2 isotherm indicates that less than a half of the available pore volume (0.120 mL g-1, calculated using PLATON) was filled at 77 K. The BET surface areas estimated from the CO2 and H2  isotherms are 210 and 90 m2 g-1, respectively (see ESI). The difference in the surface areas indicates that the effect of the framework polarity is significant. The framework host, which contains Cd2+ ions, ligated water molecules, the polar residues and the \u03c0-electrons of the , gives rise to an electric field that induces a dipole in CO2. Besides such dipole-induced dipole interactions, the quadrupole moment of CO2 (3.3-3.4 \u00d7 10-26 e.s.u.) would interact with the electric field gradient, providing a further contribution to the potential energy of . In addition, there may be some donor-acceptor affinity between the CO2 molecules and the Lewis acidic Cd2+ ions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['porosity', 'decomposition_temperature', 'surface_area']"}]}
