And the 0.25 (CH3)2NH of guest comes from the hydrolysis of DMF under high pressure and temperature . TZI3\\u2212 ligand coordinates with six mental sites by the coordination mode which can be described as \\u03bc\\n6-\\u03b71: \\u03b70: \\u03b70: \\u03b71: \\u03b71: \\u03b71: \\u03b71: \\u03b71 (\\na). Its conformation is mode-b by the dihedral is 90.0\\u00b0 between the m-benzenedicarboxylate and tetrazolyl ring (). Two kinds of zinc centers (Zn1 and Zn2) are found in the framework. The Zn1 atom is five-coordinated by three oxygen atoms which consist of two carboxylate oxygen atoms from two TZI3\\u2212 and one bridging oxygen atom from a \\u03bc\\n3-OH ligand in the equatorial plane, and two nitrogen atoms from two TZI3\\u2212 ligands distribution in the axial position, which forms triangle biconical ZnN2O3 coordination geometry. While the Zn2 atom is six coordinate by four oxygen atoms from two \\u03bc\\n3-OH ligands, two coordinated water molecules and two nitrogen atoms from two different TZI3\\u2212 ligands, forming an octahedral geometry. The Zn\\u2013O bond distances are from 1.962(4) to 2.128(6)\\u00c5, and the Zn\\u2013N bond distances are 2.110(5) and 2.362(5)\\u00c5 ().

A better insight into the nature of JUC-165 can be achieved by the application of a topological approach, that is, reducing multidimensional structures to simple node-and-linker nets (the Topos4.0 program is a powerful tool for the analysis, comparison, and design of network structures) . As shown in , the trimetallic [Zn3(\\u03bc\\n3-OH)] SBU can simply be regarded as a 5-connected node since the terminal H2O molecules do not contribute to the network topology. Likewise, each TZI3\\u2212 ligand coordinated to five [Zn3(\\u03bc\\n3-OH)] clusters can act as a 5-connected node. On the basis of the simplification principle, the resulting structure of JUC-165 is a rare binodal five-connected net, and its Schl\\u00e4fli symbol is 4664 (d)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['crystal_system', 'space_group', 'topology']"}]}

With the increasing of the overlap of the oxygen orbitals and the 4f orbitals (the nephelauxetic effect), the energy level structure of the lanthanide ion contracts and leads to a shift of hypersensitive bands towards longer wavelengths (the red shift).

The asymmetric coordination unit comprises one Zn(II), one and a half independent 2-eiba ligands, and a half-occupied hydroxide ions. As shown in a, each Zn(II) is coordinated by four O atoms from two 2-eiba ligands and one hydroxide ion, and one N atom from another 2-eiba ligand. The coordination geometry of the Zn center (\\u03c4=0.48) can be portrayed as a distorted polyhedron between trigonal bipyramid and square pyramid, where the \\u03c4 values of the ideal trigonal bipyramid and square pyramid are defined as 1 and 0, respectively .

As for the 2-eiba ligands, they show the bridging and terminal linking role to connect the binuclear Zn(II) SBU, respectively. In this way, a grid-like layered coordination net (14.25\\u00d714.25\\u00c52), being extended through 2-eiba ligands, is formed (b). This 2D pattern is considerably undulated and of further importance, decorated with the unidentate 2-eiba pendants as side arms at single side. Interestingly, these long prominent arms, with a length of ca.7.824\\u00c5 between the pyridyl N atom and carboxylate C atom, penetrate into the grids of two adjacent layers to build a 3D polythreading supramolecular architecture with finite components . In fact, each lateral 2-eiba arm goes through two parallel grids and forms a OH\\u22efN hydrogen bond with the third one (O\\u22efN=2.759\\u00c5, H\\u22efN=1.91\\u00c5, \\u2220OH\\u22efN=172\\u00b0) (c). Thus, if these H-bonding interactions are also taken into account, [Zn2(COO)(OH)] SBUs behave as 6-connected nodes and 2-eiba ligands act as bridges.

The ligand molecule features the conformation II and the Ag-L binding is consistent with type-A coordination mode (). Extension of the repeating structural unit along the crystallographic a axis results in the observation of an infinite 1-D polymeric chain (b), which is distinct with the 2- or 3-D networks as discussed above for 1\\u20133. Interestingly, chains propagate along the crystallographic a axis to form a helical structure and both the P- and M-helix were observed. This is consistent with the fact that the complex crystallizes as a racemic mixture. The pitch of helix is approximately 7.87\\u00c5, corresponding to the adjacent Ag\\u22efAg separation in the chain. Compared to 3, although similar anions were used, the lower dimensionality of 4 should be attributed to the coordination of solvent molecules (CH3CN) with silver(I), which prevents other ligands from accessing the silver(I) spheres and limits further dimensional expansion."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['crystal_system', 'space_group']"}]}

The obviously larger electron density of NiRu-HTP near E f than that of Ni-HTP implies a higher electrical conductivity, which is confirmed by the conductivity measurements in Figure S9. In addition, the fully symmetric electron state densities of Ni-HTP indicate that the Ni atoms are of low spin with no single electron. In NiRu-HTP, the electron state densities near E f are asymmetric and spin-polarized, which is attributed to the plentiful single electrons on Ru atoms, contributing to the gas adsorption and activation. Generally, the d-orbital energy level center (E d) is considered as a good descriptor to evaluate the adsorbate-metal interaction and electrocatalytic activity.

The bonding states locate far below the E f and are generally fully filled, while the electron filling of antibonding states is decided by the position of d-orbitals relative to E f and contributes to the bonding strength. Obviously, NiRu-HTP manifests a significantly higher E d and larger hybridization degree with the 2p orbitals of O2 than Ni-HTP, which implies its higher bonding strength with O2. Specifically, at the Ni-N4 site, the d xz  and d yz  orbitals of Ni are overlapped with \u03c0 orbitals of O2 to generate the (d xz /d yz -\u03c0)* orbitals, as shown in c. For the Ru-N4 site, the       d     z   2        and d xz  orbitals of the Ru site are coupled with the \u03c3 and \u03c0 orbitals of O2 to constitute the respective (      d     z   2       -\u03c3)* and (d xz -\u03c0)* orbitals, as plotted in d.

Consequently, the reaction temperature can be used as a structure direct factor in the synthesis of ZIF-8.

The reason why the size decreased as the temperature increased is the relationship between nucleation and temperature.

The resulting functionalized MOF showed structural retention and affinity towards heavy-metal ions such as Cd2+ in aqueous media. In situ growth of CdS NPs inside the MOF pores was realized at elevated temperatures under mild reaction conditions.

The adamantane cage, having an internal pore diameter of 16.1 \u00c5, is formed by the tetrahedral cages acting as the vertices. To balance the charge, the coordination of the SBU is completed with five exchangeable formate ligands that are well-directed toward the spacious adamantane cage. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of the as-synthesized MOF-808 (a) exhibited two peaks at 8.6 and 9.9\u00b0, typical of MOF-808. Importantly, the observed pattern demonstrated unshifted peaks when compared with the simulated pattern obtained from its single-crystal structure analysis. The as-synthesized MOF-808 was also characterized employing FT-IR spectroscopy (Figure S1) and 1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure S2). The morphology of MOF-808 was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), wherein octahedral particles of size around 200-250 nm were observed (d). The lattice fringe spacing calculated was 1.64 nm, which is typical for MOF-808, and the result is consistent with the pore size obtained from the non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) methods based on N2 adsorption data at 77 K (d inset). N2 adsorption study (at 77 K) was performed to validate the permanent porosity of MOF-808 (b). The BET surface area was 2418 m2 g-1, which is in good agreement with the previous reports of Zr4+-based MOF-808. The high internal surface area, large cavity size, excellent stability in aqueous solutions, and, most importantly, the presence of appropriately oriented and exchangeable formate ions on the Zr6 cluster makes Zr4+-based MOF-808 an ideal platform for postsynthetic modification with l-cys. The robustness of the structure of MOF-808 after functionalizing with l-cys was confirmed by PXRD studies (a), where similar peak positions were observed when compared with the pristine MOF-808. 1H NMR studies of alkaline digested MOF-808 exhibited two characteristic peaks at chemical shift values of 8.28 and 8.20 ppm corresponding to the protons of benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate (BTC) and formate ligands. The peak integration ratio of these two peaks confirmed the presence of six BTC and five formate units in the framework. However, for MOF-808-cys, this resulting ratio indicated the presence of six BTC units and one formate unit, thereby confirming the successful exchange of four formate ligands by l-cys (Figure S4). The FT-IR spectra for MOF-808-cys showed two new peaks at 2310 and 1190 cm-1 corresponding to the S-H and C-N symmetric stretching, respectively, further confirming the presence of the l-cys molecule in the MOF-808 framework (Figure S3). TEM images of MOF-808-cys (e,f) reveal an octahedral morphology, thereby confirming no significant change in morphology upon covalent grafting of l-cys. The presence of S and N in the elemental mapping of MOF-808-cys (g and S5) also illustrates the incorporation of l-cys into the framework."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['surface_area']"}]}

This peak at 410 nm was attributed to the charge transfer from the valence band (VB) primarily having the 3p character of the S atom to the empty CB, which majorly has the 5s character of the Cd2+ center. Interestingly, CdS is one of the most prominent visible-light-responsive semiconductor photocatalysts for solar-fuel generation due to its efficient visible-light absorption and excellent carrier transport capacity. Herein, the band gap of CdS1@MOF-808 was calculated to be 2.60 eV from the Tauc plot (Figure S19), thereby suggesting a narrow band gap that is suitable for visible-light-driven photocatalysis as opposed to the wide band gap of around 4.02 eV observed for MOF-808-cys (Figure S18). The flat band potential and, consequently, the relative alignment of the VB and CB were evaluated from the Mott-Schottky plots (b,c). The observed flat band potential of the sample is -0.51 V. The suitable band alignment and narrow band gap of CdS1@MOF-808 enthused us to study its photocatalytic activity for the visible-light-driven hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by water reduction. Herein, the photocatalytic activity of an aqueous dispersion of CdS1@MOF-808 was evaluated under visible-light (\u03bb > 400 nm) irradiation by employing triethylamine (TEA) as the sacrificial agent, and the time course for H2 evolution was monitored by gas chromatography (d). After a period of 12 h, 1.01 mmol g-1 H2 evolved. To enhance the photocatalytic activity of the nanocomposites even further, the wt % of CdS formed was enhanced to 1.84 and 3.56% by increasing the concentration of the Cd2+ aqueous solution to 50 and 150 ppm, and the samples were named CdS2@MOF-808 and CdS4@MOF-808, respectively. The robustness of the structure of these two samples was verified by PXRD analysis (Figure S16). In line with the morphological analysis of CdS1@MOF-808, CdS NPs of 1-2 nm diameter were found confined inside the MOF pores and not on the exterior surface of the MOF for both CdS2@MOF-808 and CdS4@MOF-808 (d, S20, and S21). However, further drastically increasing the concentration of the aqueous solution of Cd2+ to 0.1 M led to the formation of larger CdS NPs (size ~ 20 nm) on the MOF surface (Figure S22), and therefore, the CdS loading inside the pore was not amplified beyond what was obtained for CdS4@MOF-808. Both CdS2@MOF-808 and CdS4@MOF-808 showed similar absorption spectra and flat band potential (Figures S23 and S24) as that observed for CdS1@MOF-808, and hence, the photocatalytic activities of these two samples were tested subsequently. The amount of H2 evolved after 12 h of reaction shot up from 2.42 to 125.79 mmol g-1 for CdS2@MOF-808 and CdS4@MOF-808, respectively (d,f). Recyclability of CdS1@MOF-808, CdS2@MOF-808, and CdS4@MOF-808 as photocatalysts was tested under similar reaction conditions by degassing the samples after every 4 h cycle. The photocatalytic performances of all samples were consistent even after 4 cycles (e and S25) and hence were rendered extremely stable. Notably, CdS4@MOF-808 demonstrated an extremely high photocatalytic activity with a rate of 10.41 mmol g-1 h-1. Raman spectroscopy is an extremely effective tool to study small changes corresponding to the local environment of the molecule, chemical bond, and so forth. The Raman peak observed at 303 cm-1 for the pristine CdS NPs corresponds to the first-order longitudinal optical phonon (A1-LO) scattering from the CdS NPs (Figure S26). Interestingly, in case of CdS4@MOF-808, this peak shifted to a higher energy value at 401 cm-1. This could possibly be attributed to the freezing of several degrees of rotational and vibrational freedom owing to the confinement inside the MOF nanopores. After 12 h of photocatalytic reaction, the Raman spectrum of CdS4@MOF-808 showed no changes for the peak corresponding to CdS and for the MOF peaks, thereby suggesting no change in its chemical composition and interaction of the elements. The surface charge of CdS4@MOF-808 was analyzed by \u03b6-potential measurements before and after photocatalysis (Figure S27). CdS4@MOF-808 shows an intense peak at a \u03b6-potential value 0 mV, indicating the fact that the net surface charge on the MOF is neutral. A similar phenomenon is observed for the sample after 12 h of photocatalytic reaction, thereby signifying no change in the surface charge of the MOF. The photocatalytic activity of CdS4@MOF-808 was analyzed in basic (TEA), acidic (l-ascorbic acid), and neutral (methanol) media (Figure S28). Since the H2 evolution activity observed in basic media was the highest, further HER studies were carried out in basic media using TEA as the sacrificial agent. In order to confirm the photocatalytic HER by CdS4@MOF-808, several control studies were carried out under varying reaction conditions (Figure S29). No H2 evolution was observed from a visible-light irradiated mixture of H2O and TEA, thereby ruling out the possibility of any H2 generation from the solvent or sacrificial agent. Negligible H2 was evolved using bare MOF-808-cys or even MOF-808-cys-Cd, where Cd2+ ions are simply coordinated to the l-cys moiety under visible-light irradiation using TEA as the sacrificial agent. This, in turn, highlights the importance of formation of CdS NPs inside the MOF for efficient photosensitizing, which is crucial for photocatalysts. Finally, the lack of H2 generation by CdS4@MOF-808 in the dark with otherwise similar reaction conditions confirms the photocatalytic nature of the HER. The apparent quantum efficiency after irradiation at 400 nm was calculated to be 3.28% for CdS4@MOF-808 (see Supporting Information for detailed calculation). HER tests using CdS4@MOF-808 were also performed for a time course of 36 h to demonstrate consistent performance and long-term stability of the photocatalyst (Figure S30). Intactness of the pristine MOF structure was confirmed by PXRD analysis, and the morphological stability of CdS4@MOF-808 was confirmed by TEM analysis, wherein no agglomeration or leaching of CdS NPs were observed (Figures S31 and S32). The H2 evolution activity of CdS4@MOF-808 without an external photosensitizer or cocatalyst was more or less equal to or greater than several recently reported NP-MOF composite photocatalysts (Table S2)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['peak_spectrum', 'etc']"}]}

In this context, it was observed that photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the CdS moiety to the empty LUMO of the Zr4+ cluster of MOF-808-cys could open up a catalytic path for manifesting in excellent photocatalytic activity of the system. Confinement of CdS NPs in close proximity to the catalytic center, that is, the Zr4+ cluster, helps dock and separate electron-hole pairs by opening up a shorter electron transfer route, resulting in stabilization of the excited-state electron and rendering it more available for catalytic reactions. To study this phenomenon in detail, a comparative study was carried out between two photocatalytic systems, CdS4@MOF-808 and CdS/MOF-808-cys, having different locations of CdS NPs in the MOF-808 (Figure S33). Unlike CdS4@MOF-808, in case of CdS/MOF-808-cys, the presynthesized CdS NPs of 1-2 nm were stabilized on the surface of MOF-808-cys. From ICP-OES analysis, the amount of CdS present in CdS/MOF-808-cys was found to be 3.82 wt %, which is almost equal to that observed for CdS4@MOF-808. TEM images of CdS/MOF-808-cys showed the presence of CdS NPs on the external surface of the MOF (e). The photocatalytic activity observed for CdS/MOF-808-cys (0.15 mmol g-1 h-1) (f) was almost 60 times lower compared to that observed for CdS4@MOF-808. Recyclability tests demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity of CdS/MOF-808-cys gradually decreases with each cycle (Figure S25). Although the crystalline MOF structure remains intact post-photocatalytic reaction (Figure S34), considerably large agglomerations of CdS NPs on the MOF surface were observed for CdS/MOF-808-cys (Figures S38-S40). However, CdS NPs in CdS4@MOF-808 continued to maintain a uniform dispersion inside the MOF pores, as validated from TEM and FESEM images (Figures S35-S37). This further accentuates the fact that in an unconfined state, CdS NPs tend to agglomerate and undergo photobleaching, thereby reducing the overall photocatalytic activity of the system. To gain an insight into the factors responsible for such differential activity of the two samples, photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies were carried out. The photocurrent response (a) of the as-prepared samples was examined in a three-electrode photoelectrochemical cell with multiple 30 s on-off cycles under visible-light irradiation. CdS4@MOF-808 exhibited a much higher current density as compared to CdS/MOF-808-cys, suggesting a large separation rate of the photoinduced electron-hole pairs, and consequentially, higher efficiency of charge transfer from CdS to the MOF in the former was conjectured. The EIS-Nyquist plot of CdS4@MOF-808 (b) demonstrated a smaller circular radius than that of CdS/MOF-808-cys, therefore indicating a lower charge-transfer resistance of the former sample. Moreover, the photocurrent response and EIS analysis of MOF-808-cys individually revealed negligible charge transfer, thereby emphasizing the importance of CdS in this system for any PET process to occur, and most importantly, the enhanced charge-transfer efficiency of CdS4@MOF-808 compared to CdS/MOF-808-cys solely arises from the confinement of the CdS NPs inside the MOF pores. Furthermore, photophysical studies were employed to investigate the efficiency of charge carrier trapping and transfer in the photocatalysts. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of both CdS4@MOF-808 and CdS/MOF-808-cys (c) showed a peak at 504 nm corresponding to the radiative recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes. However, significant quenching of PL intensity was observed for CdS4@MOF-808 as compared to that of CdS/MOF-808-cys, indicating that the former showed enhanced separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The lifetime of the charge carriers was studied via luminescence decay measurements (d and Table S3), wherein CdS4@MOF-808 demonstrated a shortened lifetime value of 2.02 ns as compared to CdS/MOF-808-cys, which has a lifetime of 4.03 ns. To further understand the charge-transfer kinetics of the photogenerated electrons and origin of higher current density in CdS4@MOF-808 than CdS/MOF-808-cys observed in EIS studies, femtosecond TA experiments were performed. The TA spectra of CdS/MOF-808-cys in the visible region for different times are shown in Figure S41a. At initial time, the spectra of the sample showed a negative TA band (B1) with a peak ~480 nm and a broad negative band (B2) spanning over 520-700 nm. The TA spectra of the sample also revealed a positive absorption band (A1) below 440 nm. Following the literature report, B1, B2, and A1 bands are assigned to the exciton bleach due to the state filling of the 1S(e) level at the CB of CdS, stimulated emission, and the excitonic absorption due to the presence of multiple excitons, respectively. Significant quenching of all three bands in the presence of methyl viologen clearly indicates that an electron rather than a hole mainly contributes to these spectral bands (Figure S41b). Since the excitonic bleach band B1 represents the population of the electron in the 1S(e) state, its dynamics corresponds to the depopulation of the electron at the CB. Hence, to understand the fate of electrons, the dynamics of the B1 band has been analyzed. The fitting of B1 band decay kinetics results in the decay time constants of 0.83 ps (33%), 21 ps (53%), and 3.12 ns (14%) for CdS/MOF-808-cys. The two fast decay time constants are due to the trapping of the electron in the shallow and deep trap state, respectively. The longest lifetime (3.12 ns) is due to the recombination of the CB edge electron with the trapped hole. A similar TA spectral feature has been observed for CdS4@MOF-808 (e) except that the B1 band is centered at ~460 nm than 480 nm in CdS/MOF-808-cys. Such difference in the spectral position is due to the agglomeration of CdS NPs in CdS/MOF-808-cys. The kinetics of the B1 band for CdS4@MOF-808 has been compared with CdS/MOF-808-cys, and the result is shown in f. Similar analysis of the B1 band for CdS4@MOF-808 results in the decay time constants of 0.22 ps (44%), 13.2 ps (31%), and 384 ps (25%). Hence, the lifetime of excitonic electrons in the CB of CdS NPs reduces significantly due to its incorporation inside the MOF cavity as compared to the CdS NPs residing on the external surface of the MOF. This result is also in accordance with the significant quenching of PL and shorter PL lifetime in CdS4@MOF-808 than CdS/MOF-808-cys."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['peak_spectrum', 'etc']"}]}

This may be attributed to the better ORR and OER catalytic activity from Pt/C and IrO2, respectively. Nevertheless, with the increment of cycles, the VG of Pt/C + IrO2 grows to 0.98 V after 200 cycles due to the poor stability of Pt/C or IrO2 while the VG of the battery assembled by Ni2Co2-CNR only reaches to 0.93 V at 500 cycles (the inset of g).

Water vapor adsorption isotherms were measured at 298 K for 1, 2, and 3 (A). All materials show type IV isotherms featuring a step in the uptake at approximately 0.28 P/P o (equivalent to RH = 28%), which is attributed to the onset of pore filling. Before this step, the water adsorbed is likely due to cluster adsorption around the open metal sites. For 1, the onset of pore filling is concurrent with pore collapse and structural rearrangement, as evidenced by the much lower total uptake of 0.389 gH2O gMOF -1, a powder X-ray diffraction pattern consistent with largely amorphous material (Figure S1), and a greatly reduced apparent surface area (Figure S2). In contrast, 2 and 3 exhibit large and steep uptake steps as their pores are filled with water. These materials remain crystalline after water sorption and retain their high BET surface areas of 1912 m2 g-1 and 1762 m2 g-1, respectively (Figures S3-S6). At 94% RH, the total water uptakes for 2 and 3 are 0.968 g g-1 and 0.766 g g-1, respectively (A). The lack of hysteresis between adsorption and desorption indicates continuous reversible pore filling rather than irreversible capillary condensation. The uptake of water between 10% and 30% RH is referred to as the deliverable capacity because uptake in this region is due to a process with a high enough driving force to be useful in AWG and AHP applications, while allowing low-temperature regeneration.

Notably, the water-2 working pair has the highest COP for any fluid-adsorbent combination across a wide range of desorption temperatures.

The asymmetric unit of 2 contains one and a half crystallographically unique Cu atoms, one hpdc3- anion, three coordinated ammonia molecules occupying four different lattice sites, a half of coordinated water molecule, and two independent half-occupied lattice water molecules. The Cu1 atom shows similar coordination environment and linkage to those in 1, but exhibits a distorted square-pyramidal geometry (\u03c4=0.28), accompanied by a slight change in the N-Cu-O chelate bite angles (78.32\u00b0 and 81.84\u00b0), and the dihedral angle between adjacent pyrimidine rings (72.87\u00b0) ( ). The Cu2 atom is located in a nearly perfect square-pyramidal geometry (\u03c4=0.09), coordinated by four ammonia molecules in equatorial positions and one water molecule with longer bond directed toward the axial position (Fig. S1). The bridge modes of 1D polymer chain in 2 are identical to that in 1 but the nearest Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu distance slightly extends to 6.06\u00c5.

This characteristic is especially remarkable in compound 1, and seems to be responsible for the slight disagreement in the elemental analysis results. In fact, when solids are stored is a desiccator over silica, the TGA showed that, at least, two water molecules are not present anymore. For compounds 2, 3, and 4, the loss of mass involved a well defined two-steps process ( ).

Previously, the reaction was conducted without catalyst under the same conditions. No appreciable aniline conversion was detected in this case. However, by using the coordination polymer, it could be observed that the compound 1 was very active ( ), practically promoting the complete conversion of aniline (91.9%). Regarding the reaction selectivity, compound 1 preferentially catalyzed the formation of azobenzene (45.9% of selectivity), with some concomitant formation of nitrosobenzene, nitrobenzene and azoxybenzene as secondary products. The phenylhydroxylamine production was not detected. This result indicates that phenylhydroxylamine oxidizes to nitrosobenzene and further to nitrobenzene. In the course of the reaction, however, intermediate phenylhydroxylamine can react with aniline or nitrosobenzene to form azobenzene or azoxybenzene and the unconverted aniline can also react with nitrosobenzene by condensation to form azobenzene, which can also be oxidized to form azoxybenzene ( ) . In order to further examine the catalytic properties, we have investigated the conversion for the oxidation of aniline and the products selectivity, using only Cu(NO3)2 as catalyst under the same reaction conditions. The result showed that the Cu(NO3)2 led to a much lower aniline conversion (about 12%) relative to the compound 1. The Cu(NO3)2 catalyst displayed curious behavior in terms of selectivity, leading to the preferentially formation of N-phenylformamide (a product from the formylation of aniline) probably due to the acidity of the reaction medium, and only traces of nitrobenzene .
