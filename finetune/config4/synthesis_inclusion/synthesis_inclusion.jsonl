Indeed, the pore apertures of MOFs determine the size of the guest molecules, which embodies those functional features as a carrier. In general, the construction of porous structural topologies immensely depends on the organic ligands and the coordination geometry of central metal ions . One successful strategy for making large porous MOFs and avoiding appearance of interpenetration is to construct a framework by the \u201cshort axis \u2013 long axis\u201d mode . The design solution can maintain a short axis with the long organic links inclined to that axis. The short axis by metal\u2013oxygen bonds is the distance between the long organic links of ligand skeleton along that axis joining the secondary building units (SBUs), and effectively eliminates the possibility of framework interpenetration. Conceptually, the main efforts are centered around the choice of suitable organic multicarboxylate ligands . Among various multicarboxylate ligands, asymmetrical carboxylate ligands have been reported rarely in the fabrication of MOFs . Those can be utilized to form large porous MOFs because of their asymmetrical nature in favor of the short axis \u2013 long axis arrangement, in which the organic carbon backbone acts as the longer linkage with the asymmetrical carboxyls leaning against the backbone as the short rods . Meanwhile, the twisted conformations of asymmetrical carboxyl ligands benefit the generation of polynuclear metal clusters for addressing that strategy .</ce:para> "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[]"}]}
