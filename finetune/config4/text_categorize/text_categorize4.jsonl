And the 0.25 (CH3)2NH of guest comes from the hydrolysis of DMF under high pressure and temperature . TZI3\u2212 ligand coordinates with six mental sites by the coordination mode which can be described as \u03bc\n6-\u03b71: \u03b70: \u03b70: \u03b71: \u03b71: \u03b71: \u03b71: \u03b71 (\na). Its conformation is mode-b by the dihedral is 90.0\u00b0 between the m-benzenedicarboxylate and tetrazolyl ring (). Two kinds of zinc centers (Zn1 and Zn2) are found in the framework. The Zn1 atom is five-coordinated by three oxygen atoms which consist of two carboxylate oxygen atoms from two TZI3\u2212 and one bridging oxygen atom from a \u03bc\n3-OH ligand in the equatorial plane, and two nitrogen atoms from two TZI3\u2212 ligands distribution in the axial position, which forms triangle biconical ZnN2O3 coordination geometry. While the Zn2 atom is six coordinate by four oxygen atoms from two \u03bc\n3-OH ligands, two coordinated water molecules and two nitrogen atoms from two different TZI3\u2212 ligands, forming an octahedral geometry. The Zn\u2013O bond distances are from 1.962(4) to 2.128(6)\u00c5, and the Zn\u2013N bond distances are 2.110(5) and 2.362(5)\u00c5 (). For the interactions between metal sites and ligands described above, triangle [Zn3(\u03bc\n3-OH)] SBU are formed by \u03bc\n3-OH connecting three metal centers (b), these isosceles triangles connected by TZI3\u2212 spacers to form 1D strip-shaped chains further. Adjacent chains linked by m-benzenedicarboxylate groups to form 3D frameworks with 1D rectangular channels (6.5\u00d73.0\u00c52) with taking van der Waals radii into consideration run along the c axis (c). A better insight into the nature of JUC-165 can be achieved by the application of a topological approach, that is, reducing multidimensional structures to simple node-and-linker nets (the Topos4.0 program is a powerful tool for the analysis, comparison, and design of network structures) . As shown in , the trimetallic [Zn3(\u03bc\n3-OH)] SBU can simply be regarded as a 5-connected node since the terminal H2O molecules do not contribute to the network topology. Likewise, each TZI3\u2212 ligand coordinated to five [Zn3(\u03bc\n3-OH)] clusters can act as a 5-connected node. On the basis of the simplification principle, the resulting structure of JUC-165 is a rare binodal five-connected net, and its Schl\u00e4fli symbol is 4664 (d)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['property']"}]}

In this structure, there are five kinds of Cd2+ sites. Among them, Cd1, Cd2, Cd3, Cd5 are all six-coordinated octahedral geometry. For Cd1, it is coordinated by three oxygen atoms from two terminal coordinated waters and one bridging oxygen \u03bc\n3-OH ligand, and three nitrogen atoms from three TZI3\u2212 ligands. The Cd2 atom is coordinated by three oxygen atoms from one \u03bc\n3-OH ligands, two carboxylate oxygen atoms from two TZI3\u2212 ligands and three nitrogen atoms from three different TZI3\u2212 ligands. Cd3 atom is coordinated by five oxygen atoms from one TZI3\u2212 ligand, three terminal coordinated waters and one \u03bc\n3-OH ligand, and one nitrogen atom from one TZI3\u2212 ligand. For Cd5, it is six-coordinated by four oxygen atoms of three TZI3\u2212, one terminal coordinated water oxygen atom, and one nitrogen atom from TZI3\u2212 ligand.

Sample activation is also easier because no high-boiling point solvent is employed. Sorption behaviors of the porous MAFs can be explained by their pore size and surface properties. Due to the complete coordination of nitrogen donors and alkyl-lined pore surface, the imidazolate frameworks MAF-4 and MAF-5 are rare hydrophobic adsorbents with high pore volumes, which can easily adsorb large amount of organic solvent but do not adsorb water even at very high humidity. As the pore size is similar to small aromatic derivatives such as benzene and toluene, MAF-5 is suitable for removal of trace aromatic molecules from water. On the other hand, the large pore MAF-4 exhibits lower adsorption affinity for organic solvents, and significant adsorption arise from capillary condensation. While MAF-7 is isostructural with MAF-4, incorporation of uncoordinated nitrogen donor on the pore surface increases the sorption affinity and lowers the onset pressure of capillary condensation.

Synthetic challenges in this field include controlling the size and size distribution of the nanoparticles and modifying structure . Large nanosized cadmium chalcogenido clusters have not only the definite structures, but also the extremely low limit of the size distribution and high stability. Therefore, a \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach to the synthesis of well defined large cadmium chalcogenido clusters has been recognized as a key to developing the semiconductor quantum dots technologically . These clusters generally fall into three series: supertetrahedral clusters (Tn), pentasupertetrahedral clusters (Pn), and capped tetrahedral clusters (Cn) . The most exploited large size clusters CdQ (Q\u00a0=\u00a0S and Se) are the Cn clusters having 17 , 32 , and 54  cadmium atoms in the clusters (). Besides the potential applications as quantum dots, they could serve as model systems and provide synthetic and structural insights into the formation and properties of nanomaterials.

Before gas adsorption tests, activation to remove the guest molecules from the pores by heating under vacuum is a required pretreatment and the as-synthesized crystal samples were heated at an optimized temperature of 140\u00b0C for 20h. To verify whether the framework of 1 can be sustained after the removal of the solvent molecules, PXRD patterns were measured (). The framework of 1 still has crystallinity after removing the solvent molecules, but the PXRD pattern of the activated sample is different from the as-synthesized one which may be attributed to the framework dynamics of 1. The crystalline solid of 1 can be re-generated by immersing the activated sample in 10mL DMF for 12h as indicated by the PXRD measurements () . The results show that the host framework of complex 1 is flexible enough to change its structure depending on the nature of the guest molecules, and the framework transformations are reversible.

It is noteworthy that no N2 were adsorbed in spite of the channel size larger than the kinetic diameter of N2 (3.64\u00c5), thus, the selective sorption behaviors of CO2 over N2 are attributed to the significant quadrupole moment of CO2 (\u22121.4\u00d710\u221239\nCm2), which induces specific interactions with the host framework .

Elemental analysis data reveals an empirical formula of Ag(L)NO3, suggesting a 1:1 metal-to-ligand ratio in 1. 1 is poorly soluble in common solvents, and slightly soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The 1HH NMR spectrum of 1 in DMSO-d\n6 reveals only signals identical to those of the free ligand, indicating the decomposition of the complex in DMSO. In the IR spectrum of 1 a strong band at around 1405cm\u22121 appeared due to the coordinated NO3\n\u2212 ions. X-ray structural analysis confirmed the formation of a coordination network involving effective Ag\u2013S binding in the solid state (\n). 1 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Cmc21 and in the asymmetric unit there contains only one half of ligand L, one silver ion and nitrate anion, and the second half of L was generated by symmetry (operation code: \u2212x, y, z). The Flack parameter of crystal 1 having a acentric space group was refined to be \u22120.01(2), indicating 1 crystallizes as an enantiopure form, although achiral ligand was used. It was noticed that as seen in a the ligand molecules in 1 adopt the conformation I and type-A binding mode with two silver(I) centers related by a C\n2 symmetric axis (). Relevant bond parameters around metal centers are summarized in \n. The silver(I) center is tetracoordinate with two sulfur atoms from symmetry-related ligands and two oxygen atoms of the bridging nitrate ions, being in a slightly distorted tetrahedral environment. The Ag-S bond distances are almost identical (2.5185(6) and 2.5186(6)\u00c5, respectively), falling in the range of Ag\u2013S bond lengths reported in the literature , yet the Ag\u2013O bonds are slightly different in length (2.357(3) and 2.533(3)\u00c5). Propagation of the repeat structure unit along the silver(II) centers results in the formation of an infinite 2-D coordination network which is composed of 20-membered macrocycles containing two ligand units, two silver(I) centers and two bridging nitrato-O atoms (b\u00a0and\u00a0c). In each macrocycle, the Ag\u22efAg nonbonding distance between two silver(I) centers bonded to the same ligand is approximately 10.7\u00c5, while the O-bridged Ag\u22efAg nonbonding distance is approximately 4.6\u00c5. The two phenyl rings of ligands in the macrocycle are arranged in an edge-to-face fashion and thus effective C\u2013H\u22ef\u03c0 interaction is observed between the rings. The C\u2013H\u22ef \u03c0 (centroid) distance as illustrated in c is as short as ca. 2.85\u00c5 (c). It is worth mentioning that previously a silver(I) perchlorate complex based on a similar thioether ligand, 1,3-bis(phenylthiomethyl)benzene has been reported, where a structurally related grid-like network was observed . However, the structure of the repeating macrocyclic motif in this network is essentially distinct with that of 1. In the structure reported previously , the silver centers are bridged by two oxygen atoms of the perchlorate anion, and the Ag\u2013O bond distances are relatively longer (2.556(10) and 2.719(4)\u00c5, respectively), indicating weaker bonding interactions. In addition, the phenyl rings in the macrocycle are arranged in a face-to-face mode by \u03c0\u22ef\u03c0 stacking interaction (the distance between two aromatic planes is ca. 3.5\u00c5), in sharp contrast to the C\u2013H\u22ef\u03c0 interactions found in 1 (c)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['property']"}]}

Currently, several extreme interests on MOFs were focused on designing new topological architectures, and pioneers have disclosed many kinds of topological structure, such as NbO, PtS, CdSO4 net, diamond net, rutile net, boracite net, sodalite net, etc.  Carefully checking the structure characters of MOFs, most of them were constructed from the single type of node, and the MOFs assembled from the double type of nodes are relatively less developed, such as the (3, 4) and (3, 6)-connected MOFs . To achieve this goal, the key factor is the choice of suitable organic ligands and metal centers; that is, to achieve the (3, 4)-connected net, one of the best ways is to choose metal centers with a low coordination number such as Zn, Cu, Co as 4-connected nodes and trigonal organic ligands as 3-connected nodes .

These compounds display interesting and versatile coordination features from 3D to 3D parallel entangled frameworks. Topological analysis reveals that 1\u20133 are 3D (4,4)-connected bbf topology net with the (64\u00b782)(66) topology. The adjustable channels size of individual 3D framework is realized by using different lengths of co-ligands from byp to bib with keeping similar architectures of compounds 1\u20133. In compound 3, the assignment of characteristic absorption bands of UV\u2013vis spectra at 580nm correlated with the d-d transitions of Co2+ ions in field of tetrahedral coordination is confirmed by the result of the single-crystal X-ray structure analysis. The solid-state photoluminescent properties of 1 and 2 were investigated, and the emission bands were assigned to the intra-ligand charge transfer (ILCT), and the different emission wavelength due to the effect of co-ligands.

Porous MOFs with high surface areas and tunable structures have recently attracted considerable interest not only for their fascinating architectures and intriguing topologies, but also for their potential applications in sensing, heterogeneous catalysis, gas storage and separation . Flue gases consist of nitrogen (typically more than two-thirds), carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen, and minor components such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur oxides. Economical and efficient CO2 capture and storage (CCS) has been attracting tremendous attention due to the culprit for causing the greenhouse effect . Several technologies have been considered for CO2 capture and separation from nitrogen-rich streams, including absorption, adsorption and membranes separations . In particular, for separation of CO2/N2, because of the relatively similar kinetic diameters of the molecules (3.3 and 3.64\u00c5, respectively), it would require materials operating on a size-selective mechanism to possess very small pores, which may limit the diffusion of gases throughout the material. Therefore, to find a suitable pore size material is a necessary condition for CO2/N2 separation.

The Zn(II) ions show different coordination geometries. The Zn1 (Zn1#5) ion is five coordinated with a distorted pentahedron coordination geometry, which is fulfilled by four oxygen atoms (O1, O2, O4 and O5) originating from three independent 1,4-H2bdc ligands and one nitrogen atom (N1) of the L ligand with the coordination angles varying from 99.9(9)\u00b0 to 121.9(6)\u00b0. The ZnN bond length is 2.004(3) \u00c5, and the lengths of ZnO bonds are 1.975(3) \u00c5, 1.955(3) \u00c5 and 1.930(3) \u00c5, respectively, four oxygen atoms and one nitrogen atom are located on the five vertices of pentahedron, and the Zn1(Zn1#5) is located in the center of pentahedron (\na).

The dihedral angle between one pyridine ring and one anthracene ring in the same L is 63.9\u00b0. The trimers are joined through the scaffolds of 1,4-H2bdc ligands, leading to the formation of a 44\n-sqc\n coordination layer and two trimers in a diagonal position are linked by 1,4-H2bdc (\nd). The L ligand adopts bidentate bridging coordination, linking the 2D layers to form a 3D framework (\ne). Meanwhile, from the topological point of view, Zn2 can be described as 8-connected nodes, and the ligands are regarded as linear linkers.

The coordination complexes with the rational selection and design of conjugated organic spacers with metal centers can be efficient for obtaining new luminescent materials . To investigate the luminescence properties of complexes 1\u20133, the solid-state fluorescent properties of 1\u20133 as well as the ligand L have been studied at room temperature under the same experimental condition and their emission spectra are given in Supplementary 2 . When excited with 390\u00a0nm light, the free L ligand exhibited an emission peak at 470\u00a0nm, which originated from ligand internal change transfer. Upon excitation with 390\u00a0nm light, complexes 1\u20133 all display intense photoluminescence, with emission maxima at 474, 440 and 440\u00a0nm, respectively. Compared with the free L Ligand, the introduction of Zn(II) and Cd(II) to ligand L led to a weak blue-shift for complexes 2 and 3.

In addition, the high-dimensional structures of complexes 2 and 3 lead to significant enhancement of fluorescence intensity compared to that of the free ligand. The enhancement of fluorescence intensity of complexes 1\u20133 can be attributed to the following aspects: firstly, anthracene is a kind of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with strong fluorescence emission; secondly, the ligand coordination to the metal center and increase plane conjugated system of ligands, which the intraligand \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* transition occurs more easily; on the other hand, the ligand rigidity enhancement and thus reduces the loss of energy through a radiationless pathway , however, fluorescence enhancement of complexes 1\u20133."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['property']"}]}

The X-ray powder diffraction (PXRD) of the complexes 1\u20133 demonstrate that they have high phase purity. In addition, we studied thermal stabilities and fluorescent properties of complexes 1\u20133. We believe that this study reveals the effectiveness of general solvothermal processing methods which are influenced by the nature of the solvent and reaction temperature. Because of the multi ring structure of the ligand molecule, the solubility of the ligand is reduced and the difficulty coefficient is enhanced. Complexes 1\u20133 has a novel structure and strong fluorescence properties, which indicated that those complexes can be used as a potential functional materials, for example used in LED lamps.

There is currently a renewed interest in that field because of the nanotechnologies emergence. Actually, the design of nanoporous open frameworks is a factor of this revival  because these compounds are anticipated to exhibit good efficiency as far as size selective separation, catalysis and gas storage are concerned . These potential applications require materials that do not decompose or collapse upon the removal of the guest molecules. Such materials can be obtained by using aromatic poly-carboxylate ligands. Several lanthanide-based coordination polymers involving benzene-poly-carboxylate ligand have already been described , but potentially porous materials are still rather uncommon . In order to increase the intermetallic distances in these materials, we have undertaken the study of naphthalene-poly-carboxylate-based coordination polymers . The two new lanthanide-containing coordination polymers reported below are part of this study.

In this work, the luminescent properties of compounds 1 and 2 as well as the free ligands (H3bpt, H4bptc and Hdatrz) were investigated in the solid state at room temperature. The free H3bpt, H4bptc and Hdatrz ligands display intense emission peaks at 388\u00a0nm (\u03bbex\u00a0=\u00a0345\u00a0nm), 402\u00a0nm (\u03bbex\u00a0=\u00a0345\u00a0nm), 435\u00a0nm (\u03bbex\u00a0=\u00a0340\u00a0nm), respectively, which can be assigned to the \u03c0*-n or \u03c0*-\u03c0 transitions (b). Under the excitation light of 340\u00a0nm, compounds 1 and 2 show broad emission bands centered at 442\u00a0nm and 445\u00a0nm, respectively (a). Notably, the luminescent emission peaks of compounds 1 and 2 are similar to that of free Hdatrz ligand with red-shifts of 7\u00a0nm and 10\u00a0nm, respectively. The absence of the carboxylate-based ligands (H3bpt and H4bptc) emission bands further indicates that the luminescence of compounds 1 and 2 can be attributed to Hdatrz intraligand charge transfer ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['property']"}]}

The metal centers are first linked by the SO4\n\n2\u2212 anions to form the one-dimensional arrays of fused 12-membered rings containing three cadmium, three sulfur and six oxygen atoms (see \n).

The 4,4\u2032-bipy ligands act as \u2018posts\u2019 that connect the cadmium centers to form the one-dimensional [Cd2(4,4\u2032-bipy)2(H2O)3]\nn\n\n\n4+ chains. The coordination of both Cd atoms can best be described as slightly distorted octahedral with four O atoms situated in the square plane and two N atoms occupying the axial positions. \n depicts the coordination environments of the two Cd atoms. Rather than being parallel, these chains run across each other from two different directions. Thus, the compound forms three-dimensional interwoven networks as shown in \n. The most common coordination modes of the SO4\n\n2\u2212 ion are monodentate, bidentate and \u03bc2-bridging, while \u03bc3-bridging is much less frequent . The combination of both \u03bc2- and \u03bc3-bridging in the same structure is hitherto unreported. The fact that 1 crystallizes in a noncentrosymmetric space group can perhaps be attributed to this unusual combination of the two different bridging modes for the SO4\n\n2\u2212 anion. We have noticed that the use of simple, weaker coordinating anions such as NO3\n\n\u2212 and ClO4\n\n\u2212 results in centrosymmetric more often than noncentrosymmetric crystal packing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['property', 'synthesis condition']"}]}

Some compounds based on polynuclear CoII\n\nn\n (n\n=2\u20138) clusters and multicarboxylate have been reported . Dietzel et al. reported a MOF compound with 1D pores containing some Co(II) chains as infinite-rod SBUS and 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate as the linker .

Accordingly, it possesses TT, TG, GG and GG\u2032 conformations (T\n=\ntrans, G=\ngauche) owing to the free twist of the propyl group (\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013).

To be specific, the C1 cluster was obtained from the mixed solvent of acetonitrile/H2O (3:1 in volume) at 85\u00a0\u00b0C, while pure acetonitrile and 110\u00a0\u00b0C were suitable for the growth of C2 crystals. The optimized conditions of crystallization of these compounds are described in experimental section. The anion structures of all the six compounds were accurately characterized by X-ray single crystal diffraction. Because there are too many heavy atoms in the large clusters (the largest volume of the cell is about 130 thousands) and the serious disorder of the organic moieties, the cations are not completely solved. The [Ru(Phen/bpy)3]2+ cations or Ru2+ (fragment) are found in all the structures of the compounds. The cations have been further characterized by spectra (460\u00a0nm MLCT band of [Ru(Phen/Bpy)3]2+ cation) and electrospray mass spectrum analysis (m/z: 321.25, ).  shows the TEM images of the aggregated nanoclusters.

Furthermore, parallel and incline interpenetration is exhibited in 2 and 3, respectively, which shows that the small counterion is liable to the entanglement. Finally, different porosity of 4 and 5 reveals that the large counterion is beneficial to porous coordination polymers.

This ligand is similar to pca and ppca in that there exists a terminal and a chelating nitrogen coordination site that can be used for coordinating to metal centers. However, while in the case of pca and ppca the coordination sites are in a linear arrangement with respect to each other, in the case of pytac, the chelating nitrogen is no longer exactly opposite the terminal nitrogen, but rather is oriented approximately perpendicular to it.

Longer length of co-ligand (bib) in compound 2 and 3 than that of co-ligand (bpy) in compound 1 resulted in that compound 2 and 3 exhibit larger channels of individual 3D frameworks in size (18.1567\u00c5\u00d724.0957\u00c5) than those (15.0977\u00c5\u00d722.2255\u00c5) of compound 1. Correspondingly, compound 2 and 3 with larger channels size accommodate more H2O molecules than compound 1.

As far as the construction of cluster polymers is concerned, on the one hand, the inorganic salts being prone to form the clusters, such as oxides, halides or sulfides are usually used as the inorganic precursors to form inorganic subunits (SUs) . On the other hand, the literature show that three types of bridges can extend the inorganic SUs into poly-nuclear or high-dimensional (D) cluster polymers: (i) inorganic bridge. With various organic ammines as guest species or organic templating agents, the SUs interact with each other through covalent M\u2013O (X or S) bonds (or through sharing the corner, edge or/and face) between the SUs, producing new polymeric clusters. This is the basic constructing conception of zeolite and zeolite-like materials . (ii) Organic bridge, the most common method. Up to now, lots of bridging organic ligands with N/O/S donors have been chosen to extend the SUs into the 1-D, 2-D, 3-D cluster polymers via covalent interactions or a combination of covalent and non-covalent interactions . (iii) Metal complex bridge. This strategy has been extensively adopted when preparing high-D poly-acids . Some recent reports show that it is being extended to the construction of metal\u2013halo cluster polymers ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['else']"}]}

The cationic [Fe(bntrz)3]2+ complex displays a polymeric chain, similar to that reported for the FeII triazole-based systems exhibiting magnetic bistability around or above room temperature. The present study clearly evidences the starring roles of the ligand substitution and counterion changes to prevail over the implicit crystallogenesis issue in the FeII/trz systems, with the association of bntrz ligand and [Pt(CN)4)]2- anion leading for the first time to robust single crystals of high quality and relatively considerable size (up to 0.45 \u00d7 0.04 \u00d7 0.04 mm) that withstand the LS/HS first-order spin transition upon repeated SCO cycles. Distinctively from other 1D FeII/trz systems for which the origin of the strong cooperativity remains strictly indefinite because of the lack of structural information, the characteristics of complex 1 led us to single crystal X-ray data collections of high-quality, allowing highly refined structural characterizations of both high and low spin states, and the thermal evolution of the lattice parameters. The polymeric chain structure of 1, crystallographically determined at 296 and 120 K, is built from two different FeII centers for which the average values of the Fe-N distances are in agreement with the complete HS/LS spin transition revealed by the magnetic data. The crystal structures of the LS and HS states definitely confirm the perfect linearity of the chains of such polymeric triazole-based SCO compounds, even in the HS state conversely to what was suggested from the first investigations based on EXAFS and WAXS studies. The thermal variation of the lattice parameters shows anisotropic changes at the transition temperature, and proves that the most pronounced structural changes occur along the 1D covalent chain. The intermolecular interchain contacts occur through hydrogen bonding via the [Pt(CN)4]2- anions leading to an overall 3D arrangement. Although displaying cooperativity, the absence of a wide hysteresis loop in the SCO of 1 reveals that the strong short-range \"FeII-(Rtrz)3-FeII\" interactions along the chain are not sufficient to drive the existence of long lifetime metastable states at the origin of thermal hysteresis; it also confirms that the overall long-range interactions, with an emphasis on the direct contacts between the chains, should play a crucial role to promote significant elastic strains that stabilizes the spin state changes. The exceptional resilience of the present crystals upon repeated switching cycles is most likely due to the accommodation of the molecular volume and the anisotropic expansion/contraction of the unit cell upon SCO transition, which allows the existence of a mismatch free HS/LS interface resulting from the capability of the \"FeII-(Rtrz)\" chains to glide from each other and accommodate the structural modifications despite the sharp transition. This observation is similar to that of the spin-crossover single crystals [{Fe(NCSe) (py)2}2(m-bpypz)] (with py = pyridine and bpypz = 3,5-bis(2-pyri-dyl)pyrazolate) recently reported by K. Boukhedadden et al. In this context, we are currently investigating by optical microscopy the response of a single crystal of 1 upon thermal SCO transition in order to visualize the nucleation, the growth, and the propagation of HS and LS domains accompanying the first-order transition. The observation of the orientation and the dynamics of the HS/LS interface should allow for a better understanding of the role of the anisotropic changes of the lattice parameters on the exceptional resilience of this material. On the other hand, we are also currently exploring other systems exhibiting similar chain, but with different crystal packing to enhance/control the interchain interactions and produce hysteretic features. In fine, the aim is to establish thorough and systematic magneto-structural correlations that are essential to understand the physicochemical origin of the strong cooperativity in such striking materials, and also to rationalize the tuning of the SCO properties."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['else]"}]}

The first is the presence of an underlying \u0394M s = 2 transition that is predicted from the observation of its high-field partner (note the very broad absorption centered at 4250 G) (Figure ). The second phenomenon is that, in conjunction with the \u0394M s = 2 transition, off-axis extrema will occur in the EPR spectrum and lead to increased EPR absorption at field values other than those at which the principal g-values occur.

The Hg2 and Hg4 atoms are coordinated by two terminal (Br3 and Br4 for Hg2, Br6 and Br7 for Hg4) and one bridged (Br5 for Hg2, Br8 for Hg4) bromine atoms in a trigonal environment. The Hg2-Br5 and Hg4-Br8 bond distances of ca. 3.0 \u00c5 are comparable with those of Hg-Brbridged in the literature. It should be noted that the occupancies of Hg3 and Hg5 atoms must be set to 0.5 to get rational structure model and thermal displacement parameters. The Hg3 atom is four-coordinated in a distorted tetrahedral environment with two bridged bromine atoms (Br5 and Br5A(-1 + x, y, z)) and two nitrogen atoms (N1/C9 and N2/C10) from the 2,2\u2018-bipy ligand, with bond lengths of 2.3938(8), 2.5039(8), 2.256(5) and 2.375(4) \u00c5 for Hg3-Br5, Hg3-Br5A, Hg3-N1, and Hg3-N2, respectively. The Hg5 atom is five-coordinated by three bromine atoms and two nitrogen atoms (N3/C11 and N4/C12) from the 2,2\u2018-bipy ligand, with bond lengths of 3.1125(9), 2.4156(8), 2.7157(8), 2.252(5) and 2.574(6) \u00c5 for Hg5-Br6A, Hg5-Br8, Hg5-Br8A, Hg5-N3, and Hg5-N4, respectively. Although the two-, three-, four-, and five-coordination geometry of mercury have been reported in separate cases, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time these four kinds of coordination geometry have been found coexisting in one mercury compound."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['else]"}]}

The gradual slope of the optical absorption edges for 1-10 is indicative of the existence of indirect transitions. The band gaps of compounds are related to the ratio of the covalent/ionic bonding and the dimensionality or complexity of the structures. From Table , two trends of band gaps for the present compounds are observed: (a) the band gaps of the compounds decrease according to the order of Zn > Cd > Hg or Cl > Br > I, which originate from the higher ratio of the covalent/ionic bonding, as in the case found in the  literature; (b) the band gaps of the compounds decrease with increasing dimensionality or complexity of the structures, as pointed out by Kanatzidis57 and Papavassiliou. The structure of 3 is more complex than that of 4, which results in the band gap of 3 being smaller than that of 4, whereas the lower ratio of covalent/ionic bonding of 3 makes the band gap of 3 larger than that of 4, so the larger band gap of 3 than 4 from the UV-vis measurement implies that the band gap is dominated by the ratio of covalent/ionic bonding."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['else]"}]}

These data and the absence of any detectable differences between the FC and ZFC data traces indicate that there is no long-range ordering down to 2 K. The room-temperature data for all three materials are nearly degenerate, and the values are consistent with isolated high spin Mn(III), S = 2 ions with g = 2.11. The differences in the temperature dependences of the three materials suggests that the local environment of the Mn ions changes with temperature, and spatial anisotropy may generate anisotropic g-values at temperatures nominally above 50 K. The down turn of the \u03c7T traces below 20 K suggests the presence of different, non-negligible zero-field splittings that are common in Mn(III) systems. The Mn ions in the three materials appear to be noninteracting down to 2 K, as the magnetization versus magnetic field plots can be reasonably fit by a S = 2 Brillouin function (see the Supporting Information). This fitting procedure yields reasonable results for the g-values. However, high-frequency ESR studies of single crystals are needed to resolve the anisotropic g-values and the differences in their zero-field splittings below nominally 50 K. Nevertheless, the macroscopic magnetic behavior of the samples of all three materials, consisting of randomly oriented microcrystals, is consistent with expectations on the basis of inspection of the crystal structures.

As for 2-modified electrode, discernible ORR current is observed at above -0.25 V and the current quickly increases with the potential sweeping to more negative direction, with a final current density approaching to 2.5 mA cm-2 at -1.0 V. It should be mentioned that there is an almost constantly a huge potential gap of ca. 300 mV required for the bare electrode to reach the same current density as that on 2-modified electrode, although ORR on both electrodes are far from reaching a diffusion-controlled process with the appearance of current plateaus. Obviously, the positive shift of the potentials further suggests the efficient electrocatalytic activity of 2. We have also investigated the number of electrons transferred (n) per O2 molecule on 2 during the ORR process based on the disk and ring currents recorded on 2-modified RRDE (b). As illustrated in c, an average value of 3.46 in a wide range of potentials from -0.25 to -1.0 V is determined, and the corresponding HO2 - yield is only at 20-30%, demonstrating a highly desired four-electron-dominant ORR pathway on 2-modified RRDE, which is very close to the theoretical value for ideal one-step direct reduction of O2 with high selectivity for H2O production.

This qualitative comparison suggests that all of these materials selectively adsorb olefins over paraffins. Further, the high densities of coordinatively unsaturated metal centers in these materials afford olefin saturation capacities in excess of 7 mmol/g.

Using the single-component isotherm fits and the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship, differential enthalpies of ethylene, ethane, propylene, and propane were determined as a function of loading (). For ethylene and propylene, initial adsorption enthalpies below ~1 mmol/g correspond to interactions between the gas and the metal site. The subsequent decrease in differential enthalpy for these species corresponds to saturation of the metal sites, and the enthalpies beyond this point result from subsequent binding sites. For ethane and propane, the initial adsorption at low loading also corresponds to interactions with the metal sites. However, increases in enthalpy are observed upon metal site saturation, due to more pronounced adsorbate-adsorbate interactions as the pore begins to fill with gas molecules. This analysis reveals Fe2(m-dobdc) to have the largest ethylene and propylene adsorption enthalpy relative to the other metal variants. At a loading of 1 mmol/g, where the differential enthalpies primarily arise from the interaction between the adsorbate and the metal site, Fe2(m-dobdc) shows an ethylene adsorption of about -52 \u00b1 0.1 kJ/mol and a propylene adsorption of -65 \u00b1 0.5 kJ/mol."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['else]"}]}

For compound 2, J 1 is twice the absolute value of J 2, and the refined g factor is in agreement with common values found in the literature for nickel(II).  Concerning the zero-field splitting, the refined value of D is nearly zero. In fact, the presence of a paramagnetic impurity effect strongly affects the significance of this parameter, which is actually efficient in the low-temperature region. This problem is obvious for compound 1, for which the refinement of D was unsuccessful within a range of physical significance (i.e., -15 K < D < +15 K). Thus, the fit of the experimental susceptibility for this compound was carried out for fixed D values. It appears that the values of the interactions vary only within a few kelvin for the different values of D. Taking into account the result obtained for the other compound, the best parameters refined for D = 0 K are given in Table . As the main result, the ferromagnetic interaction J 1 is quite unchanged compared to that of compound 1, but the antiferromagnetic interaction (J 2) is much stronger, as could be deduced from the high-temperature maximum of \u03c7M. Finally, the g factor is refined to a high value. It may also be linked to the paramagnetic contribution.

Figure S8 shows the effects of band-to-band transitions on the SPV responses of semiconductors. The detected signal is equivalent to the change in the surface potential barrier under illumination (\u03b4V s). The value is calculated by the equation \u03b4V s = V s' - V s o, in which V s o and V s' are the surface potential barriers before and after illumination, respectively. The magnitude of the surface potential barrier depends on the number of the net surface charges. By analogy with other metal oxide semiconductors (e.g., ZnO), the uranyl coordination polymer may be regarded as an extended semiconductor with its valence band consisting of the occupied O orbitals, whereas its conduction band consists of the empty metal (UVI) orbitals. The SPS of compound 1 is shown in a. Some overlap of signals was fixed after treatment using the Origin7.0 program. By careful differentiation, compound 1 shows three positive SPV responses in the range 300-550 nm. The response band at \u03bbmax = 322 nm can be attributed to the \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* transition of ligand, whereas the response at \u03bbmax = 358 nm is assigned to the LMCT transition (from ligand to metal charge transfer transition). Furthermore, the encouraging response band at ~418 nm should be the characteristic of uranyl charge transfer in accordance with the UV-vis spectrum. Compounds 2 and 3 also exhibit similar photovoltage properties (Figure S9). Comparing the SPV responses of compounds 1-3, it can be seen that the position of the highest peak about these three compounds is roughly the same, although their intensities are obviously different. This intensity difference is mainly due to the differences in coordination modes of the H6TTHA ligand, resulting in the different separation efficiencies of the photoinduced carriers. The results of the SPS indicate that not only semiconductors possess photovoltage characteristic but also that some other materials, such as coordination polymers, also can exhibit the photovoltage properties."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['else]"}]}

A saturated iodine loading of about 45.2% was reached within 10 h to generate the I2 loaded MOF 1 (I2\u22821).

Further, the iodine uptake of 1 was investigated in solution by soaking 1\" (50 mg) in the 0.03 M ethanol (3 mL) solution of I2. The apparent uptake of I2 was confirmed by the fading of the dark brown color of the I2 solution to pale red with a concomitant increase in the intensity of color for the powdered sample of 1 (Figure S16a, Supporting Information). Notably, the I2 uptake of 1 was found to be reversible both in solution and in the solid-state.

Similarly, the I2 desorption in solution can be observed when the sample of I2\u22821 is immersed in neat ethanol. Monitoring the I2 release profile by UV-visible spectroscopy indicates that the onset of I2 release takes place as soon as I2\u22821 comes into contact with ethanol.

From this point of view, the compound looks like an assembly of trimers with relatively larger magnetic interaction (J a) connected through weak interaction (J b). The attempt to model the magnetic susceptibility is done with a simple ABA  linear trinuclear model with mean-field approximation based on the following equations:                         In the above equations, g dimer and g monomer are the g-factors of the copper ions on the dimer unit and on the monomer unit, respectively. The best fit parameters are J a = 2.36 cm-1, z J b = -0.68 cm-1, g dimer = 2.11, and g monomer = 2.13. The intratrimer ferromagnetic coupling observed in 1 is in agreement with the trimeric conformation: bridged oxygen atoms are involved in the exchange pathway. The relative orientation of the metal-centered magnetic orbitals within the chain is depicted in Scheme a. The magnetic orbital at each copper atom is defined by the short equatorial bonds. There it can be seen that the out-of-plane exchange pathway is involved in the Cu-O-Cu-O-Cu fragment. Therefore, ferromagnetic couplings would be predicted, as observed, and z J b can be attributed to the dominant intertrimer interaction. As each trimer is surrounded by two trimers within a chain, z = 2 and J b = -0.34 cm-1. The intertrimer antiferromagnetic interaction is weaker than the exchange interaction for [Cu(CA)] n , which has a planar ribbon structure (-12.3 cm-1), and comparable to that for \u03b2-{[Cu(CA)(H2O)2](dmpyz)} n , in which the magnetic orbital lies perpendicular to the chloranilate plane, suggesting that the magnetic orbital dx  2  -  y   2  is parallel to the plane of Cu-terpy, as predicted from the structure.

(i) The reaction kinetic rates of Cu2+ and Zn2+ ions in the complexation of porphyrin are faster than those of Ni2+ and Co2+ ions, and (ii) the metal ion exchange in porphyrin proceeds faster than the complexation of metal ions into free porphyrin. The first result is ascribed to the affinity of Cu2+ and Zn2+ ions for nitrogenous linkers being higher than that of Ni2+ and Co2+ ions. Second, we suggested that the labile Cd2+ ion in porphyrin provides the driving force for cation exchange, while in the course of complexation, the necessity of dissociating two N-H bonds makes the reaction proceed slower than exchange.

CO2 with a large quadrupole moment interact strongly with the host framework and maybe a good polarizability value, also allows CH4 to interact with the framework, which makes it possible to enter into the pore. The empty pore of the host framework with large \u03c0-electron clouds of the naphthalene ring from the NDC ligand, polar functional groups of two ligands, and Cd(II) generates a suitable electronic environment, which favors interaction of CO2 and CH4 with the framework. CO2 interacts more strongly than CH4 with the framework due to the existence of a quadrupole moment for the former but not for CH4, and consequently adsorption amounts are much more in case of CO2 than CH4 at different temperatures. The favorable interactions have facilitated this compound to be highly selective for CO2 over other gases. Adsorption amounts of other gases (H2, O2, N2 and Ar) are negligible, which is desirable for separation of CO2 from gas mixture.

Experimentally, the breathing behavior is only observed at a certain CO2 pressure. No phase transitions have taken place with CH4. The occurrence of a breathing behavior depends on the strength of the host-guest interactions. For a molecule such as CO2 exhibiting strong interactions with the pore walls, the free energy barrier toward the np may already be overcome at 1 bar, as demonstrated by the experiment. As our simulations were performed without guest molecules, we cannot correlate exactly the pore angle and lattice parameters for the np and lp shapes with the experimental values given in Table .

The polyoxoanion     P   2     W   18     O   62   6 -     is a classical Dawson-type structure, which may be described as two [\u03b1-PW9O34]3- units, generated from the well-known [\u03b1-PW12O40]3- by removal of a set of three corner-sharing WO6 octahedra and fused into a cluster of virtual D 3h symmetry. In the polyoxoanion, the two central P atoms are tetrahedronly coordinated by four bridging oxygen atoms, forming two {PO4} clusters. The corresponding PO bond distances vary from 1.516(13) to 1.568(14). The polyoxoanion contains only two structurally distinct types of W atoms: six polar W atoms on vertical mirror planes grouped in two sets of three and twelve equatorial W atoms that do not lie on mirror planes grouped in two sets of six. According to the different manner of oxygen coordination, four kinds of O atoms exist in the polyoxoanion: 18 terminal O atoms only bonded to one W atom, 36 bridging O atoms shared by two W atoms, 6 bridging O atoms combined with one central P atom and two W atoms, and 2 bridging O atoms coordinated to one central P atom and three W atoms. The corresponding WO bond distances vary from 1.660(14) to 1.733(15), 1.860(13) to 1.978(14), 2.290(11) to 2.466(12), and 2.359(14) to 2.406(13)\u00c5, respectively.

There are four crystallographically independent CuI atoms, which have three different coordination geometries. Cu1 displays a linear {CuN2} coordination geometry, and Cu2 and Cu3 are four-coordinated, defined by two nitrogen atoms from 4,4'-bipyridine and two terminal oxygen from the P2W18 cluster, while Cu4 residing in a T-shaped geometry, is coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from 4,4'-bipyridine and a terminal oxygen from the P2W18 cluster. The CuI O bond lengths are in the range of 2.268(17)-2.746(17)\u00c5, and the CuI N bond lengths are in the range of 1.858(19)-1.931(19)\u00c5 ( ).

The connection of alternating the equatorial terminal O atoms of P2W18 clusters and the Cu2 and Cu3 atoms of [CuI 7(Bpy)6(BpyEt)2] chains forms a unique 2D layer ( ), and two adjacent 2D layers are linked by Cu4 atoms of [CuI 7(Bpy)6(BpyEt)2] chains via CuO (the polar terminal O atoms) bonds, resulting in a 3D network ( a). For perspicuous representation, the P2W18 clusters are represented by quadrangle and bpy ligands are represented by sticks (b). The 3D network can be simplified as a ladder like motif (b). The bond-valence calculations  indicate that all the O atoms in 1 are in the -2 oxidation state, and that all W atoms are in the +6 oxidation state and all Cu atoms are in the +1 oxidation state, which has further been confirmed by the absence of signal in the EPR spectrum of compound 1."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['else]"}]}

(a) Eight oxygen atoms from four deprotonated carboxyl groups of btec ligand are all used as coordinating atoms. Four oxygen atoms from two neighboring carboxyl groups coordinate to three zinc atoms. Among which, two oxygen atom adopt 1,6-bidentate chelating mode connecting to one Zn atom and the other two link with two Zn atoms with monodentate mode; the remaining four oxygen atoms of the btec ligand coordinate to other three zinc atoms with the same mode (abtec, ) .

The Zn(1) center shows a distorted square pyramidal geometry and is coordinated by one nitrogen atom of a piperazine ligand and four oxygen atoms, two from two bbtec ligand, and other two from one abtec ligand.

In this regard, the insulin-like effect of the well-defined and characterized synthetic binary V(V) compounds 1-3 was investigated with respect to the induction of pre-adipocyte cell differentiation. Of primary importance, to this end, was the atoxicity of the candidate V(V) compounds toward the 3T3-L1 (pre)adipocyte in the concentration range 1-100\u03bcM. The results, clearly demonstrate the adipogenic potential of vanadium compounds. Initially, the simple KVO3 salt was employed to evaluate toxicity in a concentration-dependent fashion. The results suggest that V(V) alone (in the form of VO3 -) reduces cell viability. Experimentation with the ligands alone and the complexed vanadoforms, bearing variably structured aminoalcoholic moieties, ensued to probe the influence of the organic substrate on the bioactivity of the complex binary species. The cytotoxic profile of each ligand alone (L1H-L3H) in the concentration range (1-100\u03bc\u039c) clearly shows dependence on the nature and number of alcohol arms in the molecule(s). To this end, ligands L1H and L2H are atoxic in the 1-100\u03bc\u039c range, with L3H being clearly toxic in the same range. Interestingly, the binary complex V(V)-[L3H-1] does not appear to be toxic in the same concentration range (vide infra). Examination of the three vanadoforms in in vitro cultures took place in a concentration dependent fashion (1-100\u03bc\u039c) over a period of 24 h. The results suggest that the cytotoxic effects of V(V) ion are significantly reduced through complexation. In fact, all three V(V) compounds appear to be atoxic in the concentration range of 1-100\u03bc\u039c for 24 h and the concentration range 1-50\u03bc\u039c for 48h. Thus, it follows that the nature of substrates L1H-L3H bound to V(V) is crucial to the biological role that it exerts and pre-adipocyte survival. Based on the aforementioned cytotoxicity profile of the title compounds in pre-adipocytes over a period of 48h, work on mature adipocytes post-differentiation (with insulin) ensued over a period of 48h. Treatment with the title compounds showed that cytotoxicity starts settling in at 50\u03bc\u039c for 2 and 3.

As listed in   (see S\u2161 for additional information), the corresponding catalytic and enantioselective activities varied significantly with different aldehydes.

As is expected, a chirality induction effect was observed in the reaction between various aromatic aldehydes and cyclohexanone employed in DMSO. Thus, NH2-Co-PYIs represent the first examples of POM-based heterogeneous asymmetric catalysts for this important reaction, providing a convenient route to aldol reaction. To investigate the influence of the solvent, we employed the reactions in CH3OH/H2O media (1:1 ratio).

The concentration of methylene blue was 12ppm. Apparently, the 1ZnMOF exhibits no apparently photocatalytic activity toward methylene blue. The degradation rate of the TiO2 prepared in our lab was only 17%. When the TiO2/1ZnMOF mass ratio of TiO2@1ZnMOF was 1:6, the degradation rate was 14%, which was lower than that of TiO2 alone because of the lower content of TiO2. While the content of TiO2 in the loaded catalysts was 25%, the degradation rate reached 43%. Remarkably, we achieved a degradation rate of 64% when the TiO2/1ZnMOF mass ratio was 2:3. Compared with the P25, whose degradation rate was 31%, the loaded and compound catalysts exhibit better photocatalytic efficiency. Based on a related paper , the mechanism for catalytic degradation of methylene blue is proposed as follows: methylene blue molecules adsorb on the surface of TiO2 and contact the TiO2 nanoparticles directly, which induces surface lattice distortion in a region of several atom layers because of lattice matching in order to provide a key intermediate state during photocatalyzing; then, the distorted lattice atoms absorb photons and tend to recover, which induces a kind of surface lattice driving force by light, and the absorption of photons can increase the lattice energy of TiO2 causing the distorted lattice atoms to recover. This surface latticed driving force can cut the molecule bond and result in the degradation of methylene blue; the distorted lattice is recovered along with the degradation of methylene blue molecules. Thus, in the photocatalytic process, TiO2 can be visualized as a lattice engine based on the variation distortion \u2026recovery\u2026distortion\u2026recovery...of the lattice , which leads to the degradation of organic molecules. In our work, the 1ZnMOF is soaked in the solution of tetrabutyl titanate solved in anhydrous ethanol, a thin layer of tetrabutyl titanate was formed on the surface of the 1ZnMOF microspheres. After the deionized water was dropped onto the soaked 1ZnMOF, the microspheres were loaded with and even coating of TiO2 nanoparticles. The loaded catalysts exhibited improved photocatalytic efficiency compared to P25 and the TiO2 prepared in our lab. One possible mechanism of TiO2@1ZnMOF enhancing the catalytic degradation of methylene blue is TiO2 coating 1ZnMOF to disperse small TiO2 particles and increase its surface area, which is conducive to the photocatalytic reaction (TiO2@1ZnMOF in Fig. S14) compared with pure TiO2 particles that can easily form block product. In contrast, MOFs usually provide a rigid scaffold and possess chromophoric sensitizers serving as a \"lantern,\" which results in the transformation of a large number of photons per unit volume from MOFs to TiO2, thus increasing the quantity of absorbed photons and enhancing the photocatalytic effect."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['else]"}]}

In addition, there is no evidence for disorder of the hydrogen atom in the room temperature data, where this effect would be likely to be greatest. Full anisotropic refinement of the hydrogen atoms was possible with the low temperature neutron data, giving O-H bond lengths of 1.075(15) and 1.057(12)\u00c5 at 30 and 100K, respectively.

In each ligand molecule (N,N'-bis(4-pyridyl)idene-1R,2R-diaminocyclohexane), the inner imino N-atoms are oriented in different directions, with the nearly gauche N-C-C-N torsion angles equal to 59.71\u00b0 and 63.99\u00b0, which makes them inert to metal ion coordination. As a result, only the peripheral pyridyls coordinate to the silver ions. Every silver ion has a distorted tetrahedral coordination environment, being bound to four nitrogen donors from the four adjacent molecules of L1 , with Ag-N bond distances in the range 2.247(3)-2.423(4)\u00c5, and bond angles around the neighboring atoms ranging from 89.0(1)\u00b0 to 143.4(1)\u00b0. The Ag(I) centers are extended by L1  ligands along two directions (b), resulting in a (4,4)-connected two-dimensional layer with a corrugated surface, in which four L1  ligands bridge four adjacent Ag atoms to form a 60-membered metallocycle with two opposite Ag\u22efAg distances of 17.758 and 13.256\u00c5 (c). Significantly, these two-dimensional layers stack in a parallel fashion, producing a one-dimensional channel when viewed down the crystallographic b axis (d and e). These channels are filled by the uncoordinated CF3SO3 - anions and guest H2O molecules. The shortest Ag\u22efAg distance between adjacent layers is 9.182\u00c5.

An ORTEP drawing of the asymmetry unit of 1 with the atom-labeling scheme is shown in  , which includes only seven molybdenum and two copper atoms. The well-known [\u03b2-Mo8O26]4- cluster consists of eight distorted corner- and/or edge-sharing MoO6 octahedra  with Mo-O distances in the range 1.690(3)-2.446(2)\u00c5 and bond angles in the range 69.30(8)-174.34(11)\u00b0.

Molybdenum oxo-groups of [Mo6O22]8- anion possess two coordination modes, MoO5 square pyramidal geometry and MoO6 octahedron. The [Mo6O22]8- anion acts as a multidentate ligand linked with Cu ions. The lacunary sites of [Mo6O22]8- anion are occupied by four [Cu(phen)] complexes to form a Cu-complex fragments-substituted POMs. The Cu1 atom locates in the {CuO3N2} square pyramid corner-sharing with a MoO6 octahedron and a MoO5 square pyramid (Cu-O=1.970(2)\u00c5), bonds to two terminal oxo-groups of two MoO6 octahedra belonging to the [\u03b2-Mo8O26]4- cluster (Cu-O=2.394(3) \u00c5) and dilacunary \u03b2-octamolybdate anion [Mo6O22]8- (Cu-O=1.959(2) \u00c5), respectively, and contacts with two nitrogen donors of one phen ligand (Cu-N=1.995(3)-2.017(3)\u00c5).

During the photocatalytic process of MOCs, UV-Vis light induces organic ligands to produce X-metal (X = N, O, S) charge transfer by promoting an electron from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The HOMO strongly demands one electron to return to its stable state. Therefore, one electron was captured from water molecules, which were oxygenated into the \u22c5OH active species, to complete the photocatalytic process [15-17]. RhB is the most common organic dyes in waste water [18, 19], therefore it was selected as model pollutant to investigate its degradation in the presence of the complex in this work. The photocatalytic behaviors of the complex in RhB solution are shown in Fig. 5. The absorbance peaks of RhB solution decreased obviously along with the reaction time at the presence of the complex. The degradation ratios of RhB are 23.38 % for 10 min, 47.71 % for 20 min, 58.80 % for 30 min, 88.47 % for 40 min and 92.72 % for 50 min of UV irradiation (Fig. 6).

The luminescence intensity was significantly quenched on the addition of the Fe3+ ion in solution compared to the blank sample, while other metal ions only slightly affect the luminescence intensity. The quenching effect may be largely ascribed to the interactions between the Fe3+ ion and the N- uncoordinated group of complex 1. This would allow electrons to transfer from 1 to Fe3+, resulting in a less effective intramolecular energy transfer from the ligands to the Cd(II). A similar mechanism has been proposed for other systems [35, 36]. The selectivity of the system was further studied using different ion mixtures in DMF solution. The luminescence of 1 was slightly weakened by mixed ions in the absence of Fe3+ (Fig. 4b); however, the luminescence was immediately and completely quenched by the addition of Fe3+ to the mixture. Hence, complex 1 has high selectivity for Fe3+ over other metal ions. The PXRD pattern of complex 1 after sensing Fe3+ was in good agreement with the as-synthesized sample, demonstrating that the basic framework remains unchanged after sensing (Fig. S6). Moreover, ICP experiments were performed to monitor the release of Cd2+ ions from complex 1 after the Fe3+ ion sensing experiment and the concentration of Cd2+ ions was found to be 0.17 \u03bcg ml-1, which is close to that of the blank sample (0.16 \u03bcg ml-1).

For 30 \u00b0C or below, the maximum is probably out of the measurement range of the rheometer, with a slight increase of viscosity starting just below 10000 s-1.

Shear thickening and thinning reflect the friction between chain segments and are therefore influenced by the quality of the solvent, which may change with temperature. In the system represented in , the shear thickening and thinning start at a lower shear rate at a higher temperature. A higher mobility of the polymer coils at a higher temperature would explain this behavior with less shearing being enough to disentangle coils under flow. Shear thickening is an indication of the presence of a transient network, caused by the stretching of potential intersegment bridges or by the formation of additional bridges. In our system, bridges are built by the strong interaction between specific groups in the polymer chains and ZIF-8. The kind of interaction is discussed later, based on spectroscopic data. In , the shear thickening is more pronounced at higher temperatures, with differentiated shear thickening for systems above 40 \u00b0C.

In summary, metal-clusters were able to form electrostatic interactions (>5 \u00c5) with FA molecules, while the NH2 portions of ligands were capable of forming hydrogen bonding (>2.6 \u00c5) with them. On the other hand, as the loading of FA on the U6 was found to be less favorable (-19.3 kJ mol-1), further loading of FA on the metal-clusters resulted in lattice distortion (+93.4 kJ mol-1). The pseudo-second-order model showed the best fit for the sorption processes of FA (R 2 = >0.99) for all of the selected adsorbents. The Temkin and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm models indicated that adsorption of FA on the selected adsorbents was accompanied by both physisorption and chemisorption. This synergetic mechanism was also verified with the help of DFT calculations. Finally, regeneration of the spent sorbent was found to be easy, confirming their potential for practical application in removal of FA in water. The results of our study support the significantly high potential of U6N MOF and COPs for the removal of FA in aqueous phase."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['else]"}]}

We measured the electroluminescence spectrum (EL) of our device under the applications of different forward injection currents, as shown in a. Our fabricated flexible vertical phototransistor device possesses a continuous and broad electroluminescence spectrum identical to the observed photoluminescence spectrum covering the whole visible regime under different injection currents from 0.7 to 3 mA. The CRI and the CCT of emitted light are 85 and 5620 K for the CIE color coordinates (0.33, 0.34), respectively. For further clarification of broad-spectrum light emission from our fabricated device, we compared our EL spectrum with the commercial white LED (b) and the solar emission spectrum of AM0 (Figure S14). Surprisingly, our device can provide emission matching the solar-spectrum white light very well, which is very rare in conventional LEDs. The principle of the electroluminescence of our fabricated phototransistor can be explained by the energy-band diagram, as shown in Figure S15. By applying a suitable electrical bias, the barrier potential of asymmetric Schottky junctions is inversed as compared to the mode of photodetection operation. The Schottky barrier at the GrT/MOF interface can become higher than the Schottky barrier at the MOF/GrB interface at a suitable electrical bias. Under this circumstance, the electrons transferred from GrT, and the holes transferred from GrB into the MOF layer, which creates the radiative recombination between electrons and holes from the multiple energy states of MOFs and generates the white light emission. The estimated EQE in the electroluminescence from the light-emissive vertical phototransistor is ~1%. The fill factor for our graphene sandwich GrT/MOF/GrB/PVDF multifunctional white light-emissive vertical phototransistor is much higher compared to the fill factor of a previously reported WLED fabricated by using a GrT/MOF/ZnO/Ag heterostructure. Multiple aspects behind the observation of high fill factor include (a) the short channel length of a graphene sandwich vertical phototransistor reduces the channel resistance compared to the long channel length of MOF/ZnO heterojunctions, (b) asymmetric Schottky junctions at GrT/MOF and MOF/GrB interfaces due to the utilization of piezoelectric PVDF provide less resistance compared to junctions at Ag/ZnO and MOF/Gr interfaces of a GrT/MOF/ZnO/Ag heterostructure, and (c) direct charge transformations between interligand, intermetal, and metal to a ligand by an external applied electric field inside the MOF complex compared to the indirect charge transformations of MOF/ZnO heterostructure. We demonstrated the device's flexibility in electroluminescence under the application of bending strain (ca. <20%), as shown in c. This investigation reveals that the emitted light intensity is higher under the application of downward bending strain as compared to upward bending strain, which is in stark contrast with the investigation of photocurrent under the application of mechanical bending strain. The underlying mechanism can also be interpreted by the Dirac point modulation of graphene through the piezoelectric field created by the PVDF film under bending. Additionally, we investigated applied voltage-dependent light emission under mechanical bending conditions, as shown in d. At a lower injection current, we observed the green emission band dominates in the EL spectrum. Spectacularly, with the enhancement of applied potential, a blue emission peak centered at ~430 nm appears in the EL spectrum. At the application of a higher injected current, the blue emission band dominates over the green emission band in the EL spectrum. The mobile photographs of emitted light at different injected currents are provided in the inset of d, and the corresponding CIE diagram of emitted light at different injection currents is shown in e. These fascinating features can be explained by the band alignment between MOF and graphene through the Dirac point modulation by applied potential, strain, and the charge-transfer mechanism inside the MOF complex, as shown in f. As mentioned earlier, an MOF can cover a wide range of light emissions because of several charge transitions inside the MOF complex. As shown in the PL spectrum of Figure S6, the band gap of the intermetallic charge transformation is much lower than the band gap of interligand charge transformation. Because of the lower band gap effect, at a lower injection current intermetallic and metal-ligand charge transformations dominate in the electroluminescence, which provides the green and yellow emission bands, respectively. However, at a higher injection current, interligand charge transformation is dominant over the metal-ligand charge transformation, which provides the blue emission peak over the yellow emission in the EL spectrum. The different exciton lifetime associated with the different charge-transformation mechanisms provides multiple emission bands in the EL spectrum. For further confirmation of the existence of multiple light emission bands in the EL spectrum, we measured the exciton lifetime from the time-resolved PL study, as shown in Figure S16. This investigation reveals different exciton lifetimes for multiple charge-transfer mechanisms in the MOF complex. All these investigations reveal that the color of the emitted light from our fabricated vertical phototransistor can be tuned by the modulation of the Dirac point of graphene and the charge transfer mechanism inside the MOF complex. Previously, Dirac point modulated light emission has been reported by sandwiching quantum dots between the graphene on a solid substrate of SiO2/Si. In this work, for the first time, we demonstrated the Dirac point-controlled color-tunable light emission by sandwiching MOFs between the graphene on a flexible substrate of PVDF/PDMS.

The fluorescence of FITC-modified HA (FITC-HA) was significantly quenched when PCN-224 nanoparticles were added, probably due to the energy transfer from FITC to the porphyrin framework (c and S5). The normalized fluorescence intensities of FITC-HA at 520 nm were plotted against the ratio of the nanoparticle to the polymer.

These characteristic components have a strong impact on the bulk properties of these MOFPs. a-c shows the temperature-dependent dielectric responses (the dielectric constant \u03b5r and dielectric loss tan \u03b4) of the three MOFPs. For MA-MOF, the dielectric constant monotonically decreases as the temperature (T) is decreased. A noticeable but small dielectric anomaly near 150 K (inset of a) is obtained and possibly related to the commensurate-incommensurate phase transition as reported recently in the analogous [CH3NH3][Co(HCOO)3] single crystal. In the case of DMA-MOF, a steplike dielectric anomaly occurs around 270 K, associated with a strong dielectric relaxation process over the temperature range between 150 and 270 K as reflected by the frequency dispersion of the dielectric constant. The broad dielectric peak indicates an order-disorder phase transition, which is consistent with previous results. The inset plot displays the logarithm of the applied frequency as a function of inverse temperature corresponding to the peak in tan \u03b4 spectra.

In the high-temperature range, the peak of the dielectric losses becomes frequency-independent, which is phenomenologically similar to the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition with the softening of the phonon modes. c shows the temperature-dependent dielectric properties of GUA-MOF. Its dielectric constant remains almost invariant over a broad temperature range with no evident frequency dispersion. However, it displays the surprising feature that the dielectric constant increases with decreasing temperature, and this trend remains unchanged even at 10 K.

To achieve this, we first focused on the CO2/N2 selectivity of pristine MOFs to identify a host material for IL incorporation. a shows that the ML-predicted selectivities of pristine MOFs strongly agree with the GCMC-simulated ones at 1 bar and 298 K, suggesting that ML models are useful to accurately assess the gas separation performances of pristine MOFs that exist in our database. We compared the ML-predicted selectivities of Cu-BTC and ZIF-8, two hosts that were previously used to make [BMIM][BF4]/MOF composites, with the GCMC-based selectivities, and the good agreement confirmed the validity of ML models to accurately estimate the CO2/N2 selectivity of any type of MOF. To further show the consistency between ML predictions and the results of simulations and experimental measurements, we identified the top three MOFs (refcodes: QOVDEL, REQBAS, and FUSMEM) exhibiting the highest CO2/N2 selectivity in the test set. Table S4 shows CO2 and N2 uptakes and the corresponding CO2/N2 selectivities of these MOFs obtained from simulations and ML models. These MOFs exhibit high CO2/N2 selectivity in the range of 38-50, and they are good candidates for making [BMIM][BF4]-incorporated composites. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of these MOFs are commercially available. Hence, we specifically aimed to focus on a commercially available MOF (i) to avoid potential reproducibility problems in synthesizing these materials and (ii) to prove the transferability of our ML models and the validity of our methodology by studying a MOF that was not present in our original data set yet commercially available at a certain quality through reliable vendors. Thus, we chose a zirconium-based MOF, UiO-66, as the host material for the following practical and theoretical reasons: UiO-66 is robust and offers high chemical stability and moisture resistance. To confirm the latter, we calculated Henry's coefficient for water, K H2O = 2.3 \u00d7 10-6 mol/kg/Pa for UiO-66, which was lower than the corresponding value of a well-known moisture stable ZIF-8, K H2O = 5.0 \u00d7 10-6 mol/kg/Pa. Therefore, UiO-66 is expected to preserve its stability during wet flue gas separation under real operating conditions. a shows that the ML-predicted CO2/N2 selectivity of pristine UiO-66 strongly agrees with the simulated ones. Theoretical reasons for selecting UiO-66 as the host material of the composite were obtained from the detailed feature importance analysis of ML models given in . Pore volume and porosity are the two important features that determine the gas adsorption properties of the IL/MOF composites. b shows that a good CO2/N2 selectivity in the range of 8-15 can be achieved if the [BMIM][BF4]/UiO-66 composite with an IL loading of 10.4 wt % is generated, leading to a porosity of 0.35 and a pore volume of 0.51 cm3/g. The PLD of this new composite was calculated as 3.66 \u00c5, so that both CO2 (3.3 \u00c5) and N2 (3.64 \u00c5) molecules can adsorb into the pores of the composite. It is important to note that the new composite has a large enough PLD for the entrance of both gas molecules, independent of their corresponding solubilities in the IL, so that molecular simulations can compute the adsorption of gas molecules, which are modeled as hard spheres."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['else]"}]}

In this regime, the compressive elastic modulus (E) can be extracted from the slope of the linear fits. Then, a plateau regime occurs for 15 < \u03b5 < 40%. The transition between the two regimes is characterized by the yield point, which indicates the limit between the elastic deformation and the beginning of plastic behavior. b shows the plot of the compressive elastic modulus (E) as a function of TFA equivalent added to the samples.

After the plateau regime (\u03b5 > 40%), strain hardening (or densification) is observed as the stress rises steeply. In this regime, the strengthening of the gel samples by plastic deformation occurs as a consequence of the colloidal gel networks rearrangement.

According to the M-H loops plotted in Figures S2 and S3 in this work, the Ni film shows the first SRT from in-plane to out-of-plane magnetization at about 9.5 ML and maintains that out-of-plane magnetization with the Ni thickness increasing to about ~20 ML. These results agree well with previous work that demonstrates a similar transition thickness. Upon capping Ni surfaces (8 and 9 ML) with F4-TCNQ (3 \u00c5), a remarkable enhancement of the in-plane coercive field along the easy axis was obtained with L-MOKE (a,b). In the P-MOKE measurement, the coercive magnetic hysteresis loops become appreciable after F4-TCNQ capping on Ni at 8 and 9 ML (d,e). The highly coercive hysteresis loops in both L- and P-MOKE after molecular adsorption on Ni films (8 and 9 ML) show that the ferromagnetic order is significantly enhanced relative to the original anisotropy. When F4-TCNQ was capped on 20 ML Ni, the in-plane coercive field showed remanence of almost 100%. This result is due to the limitation of the magnetic field supply that did not magnetically saturate the sample; no variation of hysteresis loops in L-MOKE (c) was observed. The out-of-plane coercivity was slightly increased after contact with F4-TCNQ, as shown in f. As a result, the enhancement of ferromagnetic ordering in the region near the first SRT is attributed to the surface modification of the magnetic texture by F4-TCNQ. As the Kerr intensity is proportional to magnetization, the MOKE results indicate that F4-TCNQ capping enhances the Kerr intensity, magnifies the magnetization, and thus alters the magnetic textures."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['else]"}]}

Combined with these results, it can be found that the conversions are reduced when the para-position hydrogen of benzylamine substitutes for larger groups such as -CH3, -OCH3, and -Cl, which is attributed to the steric hindrance of a larger substituent affecting the entry of amine molecules through the channels of HNU-64 instead of electronic effect of substituent groups. In addition, the catalytic performances of HNU-64-CH3  and HNU-64-Cl for photocatalytic oxidation were also studied.

In n-type semiconductors, the CB minimum position is thought to be approximately equivalent to the flat band position. The CB edges of HNU-64, HNU-64-CH3 , and HNU-64-Cl are approximated to be -0.87, -0.91, and -1.10 V versus Ag/AgCl, respectively (Figure S10a).

The addition of electron scavenger AgNO3 or hole scavenger KI into the mixture also leads to markedly decreased conversions, which demonstrates the importance of photogenerated electrons and holes in the photocatalysis. In addition, a slight decrease of benzylamine conversion is observed with tert-butanol (t-BuOH) as the hydroxyl radical (\u22c5OH) scavenger, suggesting that \u22c5OH contributes little to the formation of imines.

Then Cu+ reacts with H2O2 to produce \u22c5OH and Cu2+ through a Fenton-like reaction. Hence, the GSH consumption level was investigated first. As shown in SI Figure S5, the GSH level obviously decreased in the GSH+3D Cu@COF-TATB group, while negligible changed in GSH+3D COF-TATB group, which indicated that the Cu2+ reacted with GSH to exert CDT. Then the catalytic properties and doping efficiency of Cu2+ were further assessed. In order to study the catalytic performance of 3D COF-TATB and 3D Cu@COF-TATB, the methylene blue (MB) degradation experiments were carried out. The Cu catalytic site in 3D Cu@COF-TATB has the ability to catalyze the conversion of H2O2 to \u22c5OH through the Fenton-like reaction. As shown in D,E, the blue MB was degraded to colorless and the absorption intensity of MB at 664 nm significantly decreased with the addition of 3D Cu@COF-TATB and H2O2. The result verified that 3D Cu@COF-TATB could be used as a potential nanozyme for CDT via Fenton-like reaction. Interestingly, we found that this 3D COF-TATB also had a certain catalytic performance of H2O2 to \u22c5OH, which is the main reason that the 3D COF-TATB was chosen in this work. The absorption intensity of MB in 3D COF-TATB with H2O2 reduced by nearly 4 times compared to that without H2O2 (E), which indicated the catalytic property of 3D COF-TATB to generate ROS without laser irradiation. Subsequently, the ability of 3D Cu@COF-TATB to generate 1O2 was studied utilizing 9,10-anthracenediyl-bis(methylene)dimalonic acid (ABMD) and 2,7-dichlorofluorescein (DCFH). As shown in F,G, only laser irradiated produced almost no singlet oxygen and other ROS, which indicated that no influence was caused by the laser irradiation. As shown in F, the absorbance intensity of ABMD treated with 3D Cu@COF-TATB obviously decreased after laser irradiation, which suggested that 3D Cu@COF-TATB had good ability to produce 1O2 under 635 nm light irradiation. And the experimental results by DCFH probe were consistent with the above results (G), which also verify the ROS production capacity of 3D Cu@COF-TATB. In a word, 3D Cu@COF-TATB could produce a variety of highly toxic ROS to fight against cancer. Studies have shown that paramagnetic metal ions can inhibit the photosensitization of porphyrin, thus affecting the effect of PDT. Therefore, we further investigated the optimal Cu2+ binding efficiency of 3D COF-TATB via DCFH probe. The total amount of produced ROS was adjusted by changing the ratio of 3D COF-TATB and Cu2+. As can be seen in the H,I, with the increase of Cu2+, the generation of ROS first rose and then fell. When the mass ratio of Cu2+ to 3D COF-TATB was 1:2, the ROS produced by 3D Cu@COF-TATB was the most significant, which was about 10 times more than that of 3D COF-TATB alone. However, as the ratio of Cu2+ to 3D COF-TATB exceeded 1:2, the 3D Cu@COF-TATB, the total production of ROS by 3D Cu@COF-TATB gradually decreased because the coordination of Cu2+ limited the ability of porphyrins to generate 1O2. Under optimal condition (Cu2+: 3D COF-TATB = 1:2), the coordination efficiency of Cu2+ in 3D COF-TATB was about 0.039 mg mg-1 measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) (Figure S6)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['else]"}]}

Deep traps are accompanied by extremely fast capture rates and extremely slow release rates, which severely suppress the hole transport process. Herein, we proposed a unique method to progressively convert deep traps on the hematite surface for fast hole transfer via in situ one-step metal organic framework modification. This stepwise deep-trap passivation is achieved by hematite corrosion first on the surface and subsequent construction of a porous titanium layer. The gentle trap finishing helps prevent surface losses caused by excessively intense trap passivation. The hematite corrosion can initially passivate 80% of the surface deep traps, while the subsequent porous titanium layer can completely passivate the deep traps. In addition, the accurate optimization of the porous titanium layer can reconstruct the benign shallow traps on the surface, acting as superior oxygen evolution reaction active sites. This sophisticated surface-trap adjustment is accompanied by the rapid reduction of deep traps and the gradual increase of shallow traps, obtaining a superior surface state that is conducive to charge transport and interface catalysis.

In this research, the focus is on synthesizing an antiferromagnetically coupled, geometrically frustrated, trinuclear CuII core and it is envisaged that such trinuclear cores could be connected into a larger hexanuclear cluster. An attempt has also been made to synthesize heterometallic clusters based higher dimensional network. However, it is not very straightforward to obtain the desired topology because it is difficult to have control over the self-assembly process. Judicious ligand design is very important and blocking ligands are widely used to create small clusters, whereas multidentate bridging ligands such as azido, halogeno, hydroxido, and oxido groups can be used to join such clusters. Chakraborty et al. have already shown that appropriate polytopic ligands such as phenyl-2-pyridyl ketoxime (ppk) and di-2-pyridyl ketone (dpk) with well-defined and appropriately separated coordination compartments can achieve formation of the desired polynuclear clusters. The versatile binding sites of these two ligands () facilitate bridging of a number metal centres, resulting in the formation of polynuclear clusters. Reports in the literature show that CuII-oximato chemistry is prone to produce characteristic topologies, including triangular systems containing one central \u03bc3-hydroxo or alkoxo donor. The same established ppk ligand has been used to generate a new trinuclear core and has further exploited the binding ability of anions (which are typically present on the axial site of the penta-coordinated CuII ion) to obtain a nitrate-ion-bridged hexanuclear compound [Cu6(\u03bc3-OH)2(ppk)6(H2O)2(NO3)4] (1). Furthermore, spontaneous self-assembly of a dpk ligand with two different 3d transition metal ions, MnII and CuII, in the presence of an azido ligand produced a novel 3D framework based on a MnII2CuII4 core. Metal-assisted nucleophilic attack on the keto group of dpk is known to generate new ligands () in situ in aqueous/alcoholic solution and it has previously been shown by Chakraborty et al. that such in situ generation of new functionalities can indeed produce the growth of a heterometallic cluster with interesting topology. In this research, a single crystal of [{MnCu2(dpkO2H)2(dpkO2)N3}\u22c5(NO3)\u22c5H2O]n (2) was successfully synthesized, with a 3D framework where the hexanuclear heterometallic MnII2CuII4 clusters are connected through azido ligands, and the assembly of such MnII2CuII4 clusters to achieve a 3D framework is reported for the first time. The magnetic behavior of 1 and 2 has also been studied, and both of them exhibit dominant antiferromagnetic behavior. The antisymmetric exchange interaction (ASE) in the antiferromagnetically coupled trinuclear core of 1 is studied in detail, and demonstrates very strong antiferromagnetic interaction (J = -655 cm-1).

The choice of the H2TD ligand is based on the following considerations: (i) the high polarizability and the conjugate structure enable the electron-rich H2TD molecule to show good photoelectronic properties; (ii) the N atom distribution in H2TD provides more chances to connect with the hydroxyl-rich TEOA molecule through the intermolecular hydrogen bond. From the viewpoint of regular hard acid theory in coordination chemistry, the thiolate in H2TD provides a soft-base linkage, which should be easy to combine with a soft-acid linkage for constructing a stable coordination compound. Among soft-acid-type metal ions, Cd2+ ions are preferentially used to connect with the H2TD ligand, since the formed CdS-based MOFs would be capable of initiating the photocatalytic proton reduction by virtue of the suitable reduction potential of the Cd 5s orbital in the CdS crystal (). By combining first-principles calculations with time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the electron-donating process from TEOA to H2TD occurs during the photocatalytic reaction, which induces fast directional electron transfer in the path of TEOA \u2192 H2TD \u2192 Cd \u2192 H+ to greatly hinder the recombination of photoinduced charge-carriers in the MOF.

A similar multiple relaxation pathway upon the application of a static dc field has been observed in a few monomeric Dy complexes. Further investigations including theoretical calculations and magnetic dilution will be essential to elucidate the mechanism operating in the present compound due to the complexity of the relaxation mechanism of lanthanide ions.

The data, collected at an equilibrium pressure around 0.65 bar, reveal an approximate 3:1 ratio for occupancies in site I and II, respectively, and a total occupancy of 0.62 CO2 per zinc(II). The room temperature data collection reveals a slight elongation of the M-O(CO2) distance and also a rearrangement of the secondary adsorption site that makes the intermolecular distances entirely too short for the two sites to be simultaneously occupied. Therefore, we consider that the overall weaker interaction at the open metal will not allow stabilization of the secondary adsorption site, and this directly correlates to less efficient packing of CO2 molecules on the framework surface relative to the other analogs, except for Cu2+.
