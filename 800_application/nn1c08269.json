The saporin agents (150 \u03bcg/kg) were administered to animals every 4 days, and \u03b1RANKL (2 mg/kg) was administrated on the second day after NP administration. The therapeutic effects were evaluated by the relative changes in tumor volume, body weight, and survival of mice. Besides, bone loss and tumor growth of mice were directly monitored by the in vivo X-ray bioimaging system every 10 days. As shown in B and E, the tumor volume in the saporin groups and \u03b1RANKL groups was increased rapidly during the treatments, indicating free drugs had slight antitumor effects in vivo, while HA-ZIF-8@Sap and ALN-HA-ZIF-8@Sap treated mice exhibited obvious tumor growth mitigation. The inhibition rate of tumor growth was up to 91.47% at day 26 in the ALN-HA-ZIF-8@Sap plus \u03b1RANKL treatment group (C). Furthermore, the combination treatment of ALN-HA-ZIF-8@Sap and \u03b1-RANKL significantly prolonged the lifetime of mice with 100% of the mice surviving at day 50, while only 66.7 and 33.3% of the mice in the ALN-HA-ZIF-8@Sap and HA-ZIF-8@Sap treatment groups survived to day 50, respectively (D). In addition, the mice in all groups maintained their healthy body weight during the treatments (F), indicating that the therapeutic dose of protein drugs, antibodies, and ZIF-8 NPs have no obvious systemic toxicity to the mice. Small-animal X-ray imaging can more clearly observe the damage extent of the animal leg bone. As revealed in , along with the tumor growth, the fibula and tibia of all tumor-bearing mice were damaged to some extent, while the mice from ALN-HA-ZIF-8@Sap plus \u03b1RANKL treatment groups not only exhibited significant tumor growth inhibition but also possessed relative integrity of leg bones even at 48 days after tumor incubation.
