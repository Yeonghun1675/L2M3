Meanwhile, the water flux\nof UiO-66-PSBMA/PSf hybrid membrane is also much higher than that\nof PSBMA/PSf membrane. These results indicate the existence of synergetic\neffects between UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub> and PSBMA, and both of them\nplay a nonnegligible role in improving the hybrid membrane\u2019s\nflux.</p><p>The cross-sectional and corresponding magnified\ncross-sectional\nimages of these membranes are displayed in C\u2013F and <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.7b05504/suppl_file/am7b05504_si_001.pdf\">S7</ext-link>, respectively.

The superhydrophilicity of\nUiO-66-PSBMA can be observed by the contact angle dropmeter (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.7b05504/suppl_file/am7b05504_si_001.pdf\">Figure S5</ext-link>). Therefore, the incorporation of UiO-66-PSBMA\nconstructs more porous structures compared to those with the incorporation\nof raw UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub> due to the superhydrophilicity and excellent\ndispersibility of UiO-66-PSBMA. The results of the rejection to BSA\nof the membranes are consistent with these observed structures. In A, the rejections\nof all the hybrid membranes exhibit different degrees of reduction\nin comparison with pristine PSf membrane. The decrease in rejection\nof UiO-66-PSBMA/PSf membrane can be attributed to the more porous\nstructure. It is should be noted that the rejection of UiO-66-PSBMA/PSf\nmembrane is better retained, compared to that of UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub>/PSf membrane. As is well-known, the compatibility of fillers in\npolymer matrices plays an important role in the selectivity of separation\nmembranes. Due to the strong aggregation tendency of raw UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub> that comes from the hydrophobic nature and/or strong interparticle\ninteractions of MOF nanoparticles, the compatibility between UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub> and PSf is not good enough, resulting in the formation of\nnonselective voids. Ultimately, the rejection of UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub>/PSf membrane declines. After being grafted with hydrophilic PSBMA,\nthe surface of MOF transfers to superhydrophilicity, and the interactions\nare reduced. A better\ndispersion of MOF in casting solution can thus be obtained. As a result,\nthe water flux of UiO-66-PSBMA/PSf hybrid membrane is much higher\nthan that of UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub>/PSf membrane.</p><p>Moreover,\nmembrane surface morphology and hydrophilicity also play\nan important role in determining the flux of membranes.
