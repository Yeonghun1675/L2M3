UiO-66-NH2 was converted to UiO-66-NCS (NCS = isothiocyanate) by the addition of thiophosgene. Amine-terminated poly(propylene oxide) polymer (Jeffamine T3000) was then introduced, and the NCS handles on the MOF form a thiourea linkage (). Upon the addition of a benzene diisothiocyanate the MOF particles were cross-linked into an MOF-polymer hybrid material (). To demonstrate the utility of this PSP process, these materials were spray coated onto Nyco (nylon and cotton blended textile) fibers. The covalently linked spray coating showed excellent adhesion to the Nyco fibers, whereas a noncovalent control spray coating (unfunctionalized UiO-66) exhibits clear phase separation between the MOF and polymer component. The durability of these spray coated fibers was analyzed using a laundry simulation test, and the covalently linked fibers indicated better retention of the MOF versus the noncovalent control. Both the nylon and PTU MOF hybrid materials were also tested for their catalytic activity against organophosphorous chemical warfare agents (CWAs), as Zr4+-based MOFs have shown promise for the catalytic degradation of CWAs. Tethering these MOF particles to commonly used textile fibers is crucial for creating protective garments for warfighters and first responders. In both the MOF-nylon and MOF-PTU hybrid materials, covalently linked hybrid materials perform better than noncovalent hybrids. In addition, after physically agitating the materials using a laundry simulation, the covalent MOF-PTU material retained all catalytic activity against the CWA simulant whereas the noncovalent hybrids showed a decrease in activity.

Drawing inspiration from this study, other biomolecules were attached to the surface of nanoparticles through coordinative PSM. As it pertains to MOFs, Mirkin and co-workers have played a pioneering role in attaching biomolecules to MOF particles. In one report, phospholipids (), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (DOPA), were tethered to the surface of three Zr4+-based MOFs (UiO-66, UiO-67, and BUT-30). PXRD of the MOFs after coordinative PSM showed that crystallinity was maintained suggesting that the coordination occurred at the surface and the phosphate did not displace structural MOF carboxylate linkers. Gas sorption measurements showed that porosity was maintained in all of these materials after functionalization, providing evidence that coordinative PSM only occurs at the surface of these MOFs. Moreover, a dye labeled DOPA molecule was also used to identify whether the coordinative bond occurs at the surface or throughout the MOF. Using UV-vis absorption spectroscopy it was verified that the coordination of the phosphate groups occurs only at the surface SBUs of the MOF. The DOPA coordinated MOF particles were shown to form stable colloids in organic solvents. To analyze the hydrophilic and hydrophobic MOF bulk properties, an experiment was conducted where unfunctionalized MOFs and lipid-functionalized MOFs were introduced to a CHCl3/H2O solvent mixture. After rigorously agitating the MOF CHCl3/H2O solution, lipid surface coated particles were pulled into the organic phase, while unfunctionalized MOF particles resided in the aqueous layer due to their inherently hydrophilic nature.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 24, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig6\" position=\"float\">\n<label>6</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Illustrative\nschematic for the synthesis of phospholipid MOFs.\nA phospholipid coordinative molecule is first linked at the MOF SBU.\nSubsequently, the favorable interactions at the MOF result in the\nformation of colloidally stable MOFs as a function of the hydrophobic\nlipid assembly.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr6\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"oc0c00690_0006.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 6  Illustrative schematic for the synthesis of phospholipid MOFs.
