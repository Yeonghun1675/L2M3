As shown in Figure S10, the characteristic chemical shifts of poly(PEGMA500) could be clearly observed at 0.86-1.01 and 1.83 ppm, attributing to protons a and b, indicating the successful proceeding of ATRP. The monomer conversion could be calculated according to the integration of two vinyl protons of the residual monomer (5.71 and 6.13 ppm) and the methyl signal of poly(PEGMA500) (3.32 ppm). The catalytic profile of the DhHP-6@ZIF-8-mediated ATRP reaction is summarized in . Whereas no ATRP occurred using me-ZIF-8 as a catalyst, DhHP-6 and DhHP-6@ZIF-8 could achieve ATRP of PEGMA500 with high monomer conversion (65.6-86.5%). Remarkably, the DhHP-6@ZIF-8-catalyzed ATRP reaction could produce higher monomer conversion and product M n values than those for free DhHP-6 under the same ratio of monomer to initiator. However, HRP@ZIF-8 obtained through biomimetic mineralization could not execute the ATRP reaction at a [monomer]/[initiator] of 62:1, with only 29.4% monomer conversion and no products obtained (entry 10 in ). For instance, poly(PEGMA500) could be obtained with a monomer conversion of 76.1% and M n of 45900 g/mol using DhHP-6@ZIF-8 as a catalyst with [monomer]/[initiator] of 62:1. The enhanced ATRP catalytic ability of DhHP-6@ZIF-8 was probably induced by the better dispersion of DhHP-6@ZIF-8 in the catalytic system, which has effectively solved the issue of DhHP-6 aggregation during the reaction. Except for this, other two reasons could account for the improved ATRP catalytic ability: (1) hydrophilic HMeIM around enzyme molecules might facilitate the access of water-soluble monomers to the active site of enzyme and (2) only peptide was involved in the formation of porous crystals during biomimetic mineralization, and iron porphyrin was mainly located on the surface of ZIF-8, which would cause a high concentration of active sites on the ZIF-8 surface and thereby produce enhanced ATRP catalytic activity. Meanwhile, the synthesized polymer possessed uniform molecular weight distribution with low polydispersity index (PDI) values (1.10-1.27). Except for PEGMA500, DhHP-6@ZIF-8 could catalyze the ATRP reaction of PEGA and NiPAAm, but no catalytic activity could be observed for monomer PDMAEMA (Table S2). To further elucidate whether the reaction was triggered from the ATRP initiator, we synthesized a macroinitiator PEO-Br (M n = 3100 g/mol, PDI = 1.06; Figure S11) and then employed it in the ATRP reaction. As shown in Figure S12, the shift of molecular weight after chain extension could be clearly observed in GPC curves, yielding a block copolymer with M n and PDI values of 13100 g/mol and 1.07, respectively. Thus, poly(PEGMA500) synthesis catalyzed by DhHP-6@ZIF-8 was performed in an ATRP manner, in which the lower oxidation state of DhHP-6 was in equilibrium with its higher oxidation state in the

As\nshown in a,\nthe PXRD pattern of DhHP-6@ZIF-8 exhibited peaks matching well with\nthose of simulated ZIF-8 and me-ZIF-8, suggesting that ZIF-8 frameworks\nwere formed in the biomimetic mineralization and the structural integrity\nof ZIF-8 could be retained in the presence of DhHP-6. In the FT-IR\nspectra of DhHP-6@ZIF-8, characteristic peaks of DhHP-6 at 1640\u20131660\nand 1510\u20131560 cm<sup>\u20131</sup> could be clearly observed,\nattributing to amide I (mainly from C\u2013O stretching mode) and\nII (mainly from a combination of N\u2013H bending and C\u2013N\nstretching modes) bands, respectively (b). Moreover, no new peaks and significant\npeak shifts were observed, implying that the encapsulation of DhHP-6\nin ZIF-8 during biomimetic mineralization was executed in a self-assembly\nmanner with no formation of covalent bonding.

Clearly, the fluorescence intensity of FITC displayed an increasing\ntendency from the top to middle and then decreased from the middle\nto bottom, which provided direct evidence for the loading of DhHP-6\nin ZIF-8 during the crystal growth of porous nanomaterials. On the\nbasis of the absorbance at 387 nm, DhHP-6 loading in ZIF-8 was calculated\nto be ca. 23.4 wt % with a loading efficiency of almost 100%, much\nhigher than that for its encapsulation in other inorganic materials.\n</p><p>Furthermore, nitrogen\nsorption isotherms were measured at 77 K to assess the porosity of\nDhHP-6@ZIF-8 (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.7b09218/suppl_file/am7b09218_si_001.pdf\">Figures S5 and S6</ext-link>).

The phenomenon was consistent\nwith the previous research on the encapsulation of BSA in ZIF-8, which was attributed to the formation of ZIF-8\naround the biomolecules and has been considered as a typical characteristic\nof biomimetic mineralization. The Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller\nmethod was then employed to measure the surface area of samples, suggesting\nthat there were no obvious differences between the surface areas of\nme-ZIF-8 and DhHP-6@ZIF-8 (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.7b09218/suppl_file/am7b09218_si_001.pdf\">Figure S7 and Table S1</ext-link>). The phenomenon was probably caused by the coordination\nof the histidine imidazole group in DhHP-6 with Zn<sup>2+</sup> during\nthe formation of ZIF-8, thereby achieving the assembly of enzyme mimic\nin the ZIF-8 backbone. The strategy of biomimetic mineralization did\nnot involve the physical adsorption or encapsulation of enzyme mimic\nDhHP-6 into large pores of MOFs, thus no obvious structural changes\ncould be observed between me-ZIF-8 and DhHP-6@ZIF-8. The assumption\ncould also be confirmed by the fact that there was no peroxidase activity\ndetected for DhHP-6@ZIF-8, as shown in <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.7b09218/suppl_file/am7b09218_si_001.pdf\">Figure S14</ext-link>.

The monomer conversion\ncould be calculated according to the integration of two vinyl protons\nof the residual monomer (5.71 and 6.13 ppm) and the methyl signal\nof poly\u00ad(PEGMA<sub>500</sub>) (3.32 ppm). The catalytic profile of\nthe DhHP-6@ZIF-8-mediated ATRP reaction is summarized in . Whereas no ATRP\noccurred using me-ZIF-8 as a catalyst, DhHP-6 and DhHP-6@ZIF-8 could\nachieve ATRP of PEGMA<sub>500</sub> with high monomer conversion (65.6\u201386.5%).\nRemarkably, the DhHP-6@ZIF-8-catalyzed ATRP reaction could produce\nhigher monomer conversion and product <italic>M</italic>\n<sub>n</sub> values than those for free DhHP-6 under the same ratio of monomer\nto initiator. However, HRP@ZIF-8 obtained through biomimetic mineralization\ncould not execute the ATRP reaction at a [monomer]/[initiator] of\n62:1, with only 29.4% monomer conversion and no products obtained\n(entry 10 in ). For instance, poly\u00ad(PEGMA<sub>500</sub>) could be obtained with\na monomer conversion of 76.1% and <italic>M</italic>\n<sub>n</sub> of\n45\u2009900 g/mol using DhHP-6@ZIF-8 as a catalyst with [monomer]/[initiator]\nof 62:1. The enhanced ATRP catalytic ability of DhHP-6@ZIF-8 was probably\ninduced by the better dispersion of DhHP-6@ZIF-8 in the catalytic\nsystem, which has effectively solved the issue of DhHP-6 aggregation\nduring the reaction. Except for this, other two reasons could account\nfor the improved ATRP catalytic ability: (1) hydrophilic HMeIM around\nenzyme molecules might facilitate the access of water-soluble monomers\nto the active site of enzyme and (2) only peptide was involved in\nthe formation of porous crystals during biomimetic mineralization,\nand iron porphyrin was mainly located on the surface of ZIF-8, which\nwould cause a high concentration of active sites on the ZIF-8 surface\nand thereby produce enhanced ATRP catalytic activity. Meanwhile, the\nsynthesized polymer possessed uniform molecular weight distribution\nwith low polydispersity index (PDI) values (1.10\u20131.27). Except\nfor PEGMA<sub>500</sub>, DhHP-6@ZIF-8 could catalyze the ATRP reaction\nof PEGA and NiPAAm, but no catalytic activity could be observed for\nmonomer PDMAEMA (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.7b09218/suppl_file/am7b09218_si_001.pdf\">Table S2</ext-link>).

In addition, the morphology of DhHP-6@ZIF-8 could be transformed to flower shape when the molar ratio of HMeIM and Zn(OAc)2 was decreased to 4:1 during biomimetic mineralization (Figure S4).\n\nTo ascertain that DhHP-6 was indeed encapsulated by a ZIF-8 crystalline shell, DhHP-6@ZIF-8 obtained through biomimetic mineralization was characterized by FT-IR and PXRD. As shown in a, the PXRD pattern of DhHP-6@ZIF-8 exhibited peaks matching well with those of simulated ZIF-8 and me-ZIF-8, suggesting that ZIF-8 frameworks were formed in the biomimetic mineralization and the structural integrity of ZIF-8 could be retained in the presence of DhHP-6. In the FT-IR spectra of DhHP-6@ZIF-8, characteristic peaks of DhHP-6 at 1640-1660 and 1510-1560 cm-1 could be clearly observed, attributing to amide I (mainly from C-O stretching mode) and II (mainly from a combination of N-H bending and C-N stretching modes) bands, respectively (b). Moreover, no new peaks and significant peak shifts were observed, implying that the encapsulation of DhHP-6 in ZIF-8 during biomimetic mineralization was executed in a self-assembly manner with no formation of covalent bonding. Composite FITC-DhHP-6@ZIF-8 was then detected by CLSM in a layer-by-layer scanning manner to trace the status of particles at different depths along the z-axis position (). Clearly, the fluorescence intensity of FITC displayed an increasing tendency from the top to middle and then decreased from the middle to bottom, which provided direct evidence for the loading of DhHP-6 in ZIF-8 during the crystal growth of porous nanomaterials. On the basis of the absorbance at 387 nm, DhHP-6 loading in ZIF-8 was calculated to be ca. 23.4 wt % with a loading efficiency of almost 100%, much higher than that for its encapsulation in other inorganic materials. \n\nFurthermore, nitrogen sorption isotherms were measured at 77 K to assess the porosity of DhHP-6@ZIF-8 (Figures S5 and S6). The isotherm of DhHP-6@ZIF-8 exhibited a type I isotherm with a narrow hysteresis loop at P/P 0 = 0.05-0.10. Meanwhile, the pore width values of DhHP-6@ZIF-8 were determined to be 10.1 and 11.6 \u00c5, which were similar to me-ZIF-8 (9.7 and 10.6 \u00c5), revealing that the DhHP-6 loading through biomimetic mineralization did not influence the pore volume or width. The phenomenon was consistent with the previous research on the encapsulation of BSA in ZIF-8, which was attributed to the formation of ZIF-8 around the biomolecules and has been considered as a typical characteristic of biomimetic mineralization. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method was then employed to measure the surface area of samples, suggesting that there were no obvious differences between the surface areas of me-ZIF-8 and DhHP-6@ZIF-8 (Figure S7 and Table S1). The phenomenon was probably caused by the coordination of the histidine imidazole group in DhHP-6 with Zn2+ during the formation of ZIF-8, thereby achieving the assembly of enzyme mimic in the ZIF-8 backbone. The strategy of biomimetic mineralization did not involve the physical adsorption or encapsulation of enzyme mimic DhHP-6 into large pores of MOFs, thus no obvious structural changes could be observed between me-ZIF-8 and DhHP-6@ZIF-8. The assumption could also be confirmed by the fact that there was no peroxidase activity detected for DhHP-6@ZIF-8, as shown in Figure S14. Notably, TGA curves also demonstrated the presence of DhHP-6 in the composite (Figure S8), in which the first weight loss (about 21.0 wt %) of the DhHP-6@ZIF-8 composite in air happened in the range of 100-150 \u00b0C could be attributed to the decomposition of enzyme mimic molecules. The ratio was consistent with the DhHP-6 loading determined through the absorbance at 387 nm (23.4 wt %), as mentioned above.\n\nProduct poly(PEGMA500) was characterized by 1H NMR. As shown in Figure S10, the characteristic chemical shifts of poly(PEGMA500) could be clearly observed at 0.86-1.01 and 1.83 ppm, attributing to protons a and b, indicating the successful proceeding of ATRP. The monomer conversion could be calculated according to the integration of two vinyl protons of the residual monomer (5.71 and 6.13 ppm) and the methyl signal of poly(PEGMA500) (3.32 ppm). The catalytic profile of the DhHP-6@ZIF-8-mediated ATRP reaction is summarized in . Whereas no ATRP occurred using me-ZIF-8 as a catalyst, DhHP-6 and DhHP-6@ZIF-8 could achieve ATRP of PEGMA500 with high monomer conversion (65.6-86.5%). Remarkably, the DhHP-6@ZIF-8-catalyzed ATRP reaction could produce higher monomer conversion and product M n values than those for free DhHP-6 under the same ratio of monomer to initiator. However, HRP@ZIF-8 obtained through biomimetic mineralization could not execute the ATRP reaction at a [monomer]/[initiator] of 62:1, with only 29.4% monomer conversion and no products obtained (entry 10 in ). For instance, poly(PEGMA500) could be obtained with a monomer conversion of 76.1% and M n of 45900 g/mol using DhHP-6@ZIF-8 as a catalyst with [monomer]/[initiator] of 62:1. The enhanced ATRP catalytic ability of DhHP-6@ZIF-8 was probably induced by the better dispersion of DhHP-6@ZIF-8 in the catalytic system, which has effectively solved the issue of DhHP-6 aggregation during the reaction. Except for this, other two reasons could account for the improved ATRP catalytic ability: (1) hydrophilic HMeIM around enzyme molecules might facilitate the access of water-soluble monomers to the active site of enzyme and (2) only peptide was involved in the formation of porous crystals during biomimetic mineralization, and iron porphyrin was mainly located on the surface of ZIF-8, which would cause a high concentration of active sites on the ZIF-8 surface and thereby produce enhanced ATRP catalytic activity. Meanwhile, the synthesized polymer possessed uniform molecular weight distribution with low polydispersity index (PDI) values (1.10-1.27). Except for PEGMA500, DhHP-6@ZIF-8 could catalyze the ATRP reaction of PEGA and NiPAAm, but no catalytic activity could be observed for monomer PDMAEMA (Table S2). To further elucidate whether the reaction was triggered from the ATRP initiator, we synthesized a macroinitiator PEO-Br (M n = 3100 g/mol, PDI = 1.06; Figure S11) and then employed it in the ATRP reaction. As shown in Figure S12, the shift of molecular weight after chain extension could be clearly observed in GPC curves, yielding a block copolymer with M n and PDI values of 13100 g/mol and 1.07, respectively. Thus, poly(PEGMA500) synthesis catalyzed by DhHP-6@ZIF-8 was performed in an ATRP manner, in which the lower oxidation state of DhHP-6 was in equilibrium with its higher oxidation state in the presence of Asc during polymerization.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "DhHP-6@ZIF-8", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "chemical formula weight": [{"value": "45,900", "unit": "g/mol", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["chemical_formula_weight"]}, {"idx": "25, 29", "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<p>To get a deeper insight into\nthe reaction kinetics for the DhHP-6@ZIF-8-mediated ATRP reaction,\nmonomer conversion of PEGMA<sub>500</sub> as a function of reaction\ntime and the evolution of molecular weight were determined by <sup>1</sup>H NMR and GPC ().
