The improved WU for hybrid membranes PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(0.5) (22.8%) and PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) (23.7%) may be credited to the amended hydrophilic nature (existence of the Cr-MOF framework and allied functional groups).

The NafionCr-MOF membrane also exhibits comparative WU (21.6%) and SR (10.1%) values, which reveal the good dimensional stability of hybrid membranes in spite of the Cr-MOF hydrophilic nature. Moreover, ion-exchange capacity (IEC), which represents the concentration of functional groups in the membrane matrix, plays a crucial role in ionic conductivity.

We have architected a hybrid membrane by uniform dispersion of MIL-101(Cr) (Cr-MOF) in a partially fluorinated polymer grafted with sulfonic acid groups (PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0)). The single cell VRFB performance of the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane was studied in comparison with the Cr-MOF incorporated Nafion membrane (NafionCr-MOF(1.0)) and showed an excellent result with 97.5% Coulombic efficiency (CE) at 150 mA/cm2 without any significant deterioration in the charge-discharge process for 1500 cycles (over 650 h). Meanwhile, the CE value of the NafionCr-MOF membrane (94.5%) deteriorated after 800 cycles (about 360 h) under similar conditions. The high VRFB performance of the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane has been attributed to the synergized properties and good interactions between Cr-MOF and partially fluorinated polymer matrix responsible for the creation of hydrophilic proton-conducting channels to achieve high selectivity. Furthermore, the cost-effective polymer and thus membranes may open new windows for practical applications in other energy devices such as fuel cells, electrolysis, and water treatment.\n\nIn Figure S9A-D, the SEM image confirms the octahedral shape of Cr-MOF, whereas elemental mapping and EDX spectra reveal the presence of the Cr3+ metal center and successful synthesis of Cr-MOF. Figure S9A depicts the SEM image of crystals in a cluster of MIL-101(Cr), whereas Figure S9B shows the magnified image of a single crystal (not in the cluster) in which chromium (Cr) metal has been mapped. Figures S9E,F and S7A-E also support the absence of Cr3+ in the pristine PHP@AMPS membrane. Furthermore, elemental mapping and EDX spectra (top and bottom) of the NafionCr-MOF membrane show the successful interaction of Cr-MOF with the Nafion matrix, with uniform distribution without any agglomeration (Figure S9G-I (top) and J-L (bottom)). Figure S9M,N (top) and P-R (bottom) also reveals similar information in the case of the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF membrane because of the good dispensability and uniform dispersion of Cr-MOF with the PHP@AMPS matrix. The EDX spectra (Figure S9O) reveal the elemental compositions, which are close to the Cr-MOF precursor, implying its successful incorporation in the PHP@AMPS matrix. The amount of Cr in the membrane matrix was analyzed by SEM/EDX and ICP-MS, which reveal 0.11 wt % and 1.72 ppm, respectively.\n\n Figure S10 exhibits AFM height images of pristine PHP@AMPS, PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0), and NafionCr-MOF membranes. The pristine PHP@AMPS membrane shows a smooth surface (Figure S10A,B), whereas 3D images of PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) and NafionCr-MOF membranes show a rough surface due to the regular distribution of Cr-MOF in the polymer matrix (Figure S10D,F). The phase-aggregated morphology of PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) and NafionCr-MOF membranes is further supported by AFM phase images. This is a result of the separation of hydrophobic (light regions) and hydrophilic (dark regions) domains, as well as the excellent compatibility between Cr-MOF and the polymer matrix (Figure S10C,E). The surface roughness value for the pristine PHP@AMPS (R q: 0.499 nm) membrane increases to R q: 1.057 nm for PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0), whereas NafionCr-MOF shows a comparatively low surface roughness value (R q: 0.899 nm).\n\nOxidative and chemical stabilities of membrane are crucial in determining the lifespan of VRFB activities in highly acidic (H2SO4) and oxidative (VO2+) environments. Formation of oxidative species is expected during redox reaction of VO2+, responsible for membrane degradation. Oxidative and chemical stabilities for different membrane samples were analyzed by percentage weight/conductivity loss after treatment with Fenton's reagent (3% H2O2 containing 3 ppm FeSO4) (80 \u00b0C for 10 h) and 1.5 M VO2+ solution in 3.0 M H2SO4 (3 months at 30 \u00b0C) (Table S1). Hybrid membranes (PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(0.5), PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0), and NafionCr-MOF) show <2.0% weight/conductivity losses under an oxidative environment, which may be due to the lack of accessibility of active sites for attack of oxidative species due to the strong interaction between Cr-MOF and the polymer matrix. Moreover, the fact that membrane stabilities improved following the addition of Cr-MOF into the polymer matrix demonstrates that Cr-MOF functions as an efficient modifier to prevent membrane deterioration, hence boosting its suitability for VRFB application. Figure S11 illustrates that the tensile strength of the PHP@AMPS membrane (20 MPa) increases after the inclusion of Cr-MOF, and PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(0.5) (25 MPa), PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) (27.5 MPa), and NafionCr-MOF (26 MPa) membranes with about 300 \u03bcm thickness show good tensile strength. Tensile strength measurements were repeated to check the variability of the data represented by the error bars in the graph of Figure S11. The three-step weight loss process of Cr-MOF, pristine, and hybrid membranes illustrates their thermal stability (Figure S12). For Cr-MOF, in the first step (50-250 \u00b0C), weight loss indicates the evaporation of absorbed/bound water, and in the second step (250-400 \u00b0C), weight loss confirms the dereliction of functional groups. The weight loss at >400 \u00b0C reveals the decomposition of the polymer skeleton. The prepared Cr-MOF was thermally stable up to 350 \u00b0C. Pristine PHP@AMPS and all hybrid membranes exhibit thermal stability up to 400 \u00b0C followed by degradation of functional groups and the polymer matrix. The fluorinated polymer matrix was considered as thermally robust, and incorporation of Cr-MOF also did not alter the thermal degradation because of the stable nature of the filler and inter/intramolecular hydrogen bonding.\n\nWater uptake (WU), swelling ratio (SR), and ion-exchange capacity (IEC) are necessary characteristics for validating the CEM for VRFB applications ().

A similar trend has been also observed for membrane conductivity. Conductivity values for pristine PHP@AMPS, PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(0.5), PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0), and NafionCr-MOF membranes were estimated at 30 \u00b0C from Nyquist plots (Figure S13A-D) and are summarized in .\n\nThe conductivity of the pristine PHP@AMPS membrane increases with the incorporation of Cr-MOF, and PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) shows 15.05 \u00d7 10-2 S cm-1 \u03ba m  at 25 \u00b0C, which is significantly high in comparison to NafionCr-MOF (12.21 \u00d7 10-2 S cm-1). The significantly high conductivity of the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane is attributable to the formation of ion-conducting nanochannels and is an indicator of coordinatively unsaturated metal sites in Cr-MOF, which exhibits a Lewis acid behavior.

To check the variability of the data, experiments were repeated three times for determining standard deviation represented by the error bars in the graphs (A-C). The PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane shows a relatively high CE in comparison with Nafion117Cr-MOF and PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(0.5), which also reveals the dominance of VO2+ permeability and electrolyte cross-mixing (Figure S18A-C). The VE is dependent on the inner cell resistance and decreases gradually with increasing current density as a result of overpotential (Ohmic resistance). The PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane depicts ~90% VE because of the lower IR drop in comparison to Nafion117Cr-MOF and PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(0.5) membranes (Figure S18D-F). EE values may be a key indicator of the performance of energy storage systems. The EE indicates energy loss during charge-discharge testing, and its behavior with current density is depicted in Figure S18G-I. The EE values for all three membranes similarly vary with current density. At 150 mA/cm2, the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane demonstrates a relatively high EE (~87.3%), indicating its imminent and effective candidacy for VRFB applications. The PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane shows synergized conductivity and VO2+ permeability and therefore elevated EE in comparison with other studied membranes. Single cell VRFB with the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane at 150 mA/cm2 exhibits relatively higher CE (97.0%), EE (87.3%), and VE (90.0%) than NafionCr-MOF (D-F). These results demonstrate advancement in VRFB performance with a battery of enhanced characteristics, including stability, selectivity, conductivity, and capacity retention.\n\nAt low and high current density (100 and 0.125 mA/cm2), the pristine PHP@AMPS membrane shows incompetent performance for VRFB application (Figure S19A,B and video). This observation rules out the suitability of the membrane for high-performance VRFB. A long-time durability test was performed with different membrane samples in single cell VRFB, as represented in A. Figure S20A,C and B show the long-term cycling test of the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane in single cell VRFB at 100-150 mA/cm2 for 500 cycles. The cell shows a regular charge-discharge behavior without any electrolyte rebalance. Synthesized PHP@AMPSCr-MOF (1.0) shows extremely low VO2+ permeability (CE > 98%) CEM has a very steady nature with no voltage drop for 1000 h. Supporting videos for the validation of the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane long-term cycling test are also included in the Supporting Information. The capacity loss during VRFB operation is closely related with VO2+ crossover during the cyclic charge-discharge process. The corresponding capacity retention remained at ~97.8% up to 1500 cycles for PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) (C), which is significantly higher than that of NafionCr-MOF and PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(0.5) membranes. Therefore, the reported hybrid membrane with optimized inclusion of Cr-MOF in the partially fluorinated polymer shows potential for VRFB applications in view of its ultrarobust and high performance. The PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane also exhibits unaltered capacity retention up to 1500 cycles (studied in this case) at 100-150 mA/cm2 current density (Figure S20B).\n\n D-F and Figure S18 reveal the lifetime test of the single VRFB cell assembled with different membranes at 100-150 mA/cm2 current density. In the case of PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(0.5) and NafionCr-MOF membranes, cycle tests are terminated after 800-865 cycles when discharge capacity decays significantly. In contrast, the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane demonstrates continuous efficiencies up to 1500 cycles. The VRFB cell with the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane demonstrates 97% initial CE at 150 mA/cm2 and is stable even after 1500 cycles, but for the NafionCr-MOF membrane, the initial CE decreases from 94.5 to 92.5% even after 800 cycles. Similarly, the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane nearly maintains EE (87.3%) and VE (90.0%), respectively, at 150 mA/cm2 up to 1500 cycles, whereas for the NafionCr-MOF membrane, EE (80.7 to 77.5%) and VE (85.5 to 84.7%) values decline moderately even after 800 cycles. After 1500 cycles, the integrity of the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane is well-maintained and intact, as confirmed by PXRD and the optical image (D and Figure S3A,B). These data demonstrate the longevity of the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane.\n\nConclusions\n\nCr-MOF (MIL-101 Cr) and sulfonated PVDF-co-HFP (PHP@AMPS) are successfully synthesized to architect the hybrid membranes of ~300 \u03bcm thickness by the solution casting method. The hybrid membrane incorporating 1.0 wt % Cr-MOF (PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0)) exhibits superior dimensions; oxidative, mechanical, and chemical stabilities; conductivity; strong ion selectivity; and low vanadium ion permeability. Favorable properties arise because of the dispersion strengthening effect of the Cr-MOF, as follows: (1) obstructed and elongated ion transmission path; (2) partially fluorinated polymer matrix; and (3) appropriate interactions and arrangement of functional groups.

Capacity retention percentage remains at ~97.2% after 1500 cycles, in good divergence with the NafionCr-MOF membrane with ~91.5% capacity retention in just 800 cycles (about 360 h).
