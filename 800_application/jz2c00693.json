However, a subsequent \"post-water\" BET surface area measurement confirmed that the sample had completely degraded by the end of the 260 min. Jasuja and Walton similarly reported that DMOF-1 exhibited decreasing water vapor loadings (increasing sample pressure) as it degraded. \n\n  presents the CO2 adsorption isotherms at 25 \u00b0C for DMOF-1 samples after exposure to 5.91 kPa H2O (80% RH) at 40 \u00b0C and 9.88 kPa H2O (80% RH) at 50 \u00b0C for 24 h. At 40 \u00b0C and 5.91 kPa H2O, DMOF-1 adsorbed 4.22 mmol of water vapor/g. At 50 \u00b0C and 9.88 kPa H2O, DMOF-1 adsorbed 0.67 mmol of water vapor/g, which is below the 1 mmol/g needed to initiate degradation. The drastic decrease in CO2 adsorption capacity after water vapor exposure at 40 \u00b0C strongly suggests that the DMOF-1 sample underwent structural collapse. On the other hand, the nearly identical CO2 adsorption isotherms for 50 \u00b0C suggest that DMOF-1 retained its structural integrity.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "DMOF-1", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "", "unit": "", "type": "", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "DMOF-1", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "", "unit": "", "type": "", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["decomposition_temperature"]}, {"idx": 17, "type": "table", "classification": ["Property"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Comparison of BET\nSurface Areas Retained\nfor DMOF-1 Samples Held at Approximately 6 mmol/g at Two Different\nTime Points at 15, 25, and 35 \u00b0C</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"4\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">time above 1\u00a0mmol/g</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">temperature\n(\u00b0C)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">loading (mmol/g)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">BET surface\narea retained (%)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry morerows=\"2\">24\u00a0h</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>15</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>5.70</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>54.4</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>25</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>5.70</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>40.3</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>35</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>6.58</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>23.2</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry morerows=\"2\">48\u00a0h</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>15</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>5.71</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>54.5</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>25</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>5.91</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>41.3</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>35</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>5.82</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>18.4</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "Table 1.
