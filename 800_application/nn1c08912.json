Due to the crystal structure with nanoporous columns lined with fixed (partial) charges, these framework materials were investigated as adsorbents for selective CO2 capture. Analysis of variable temperature CO2 isotherms revealed a dual-site Langmuir adsorption mode for these carbon nitride frameworks. While both frameworks exhibited similar energetics of CO2 adsorption, H+/CaPHI showed nearly twice as much CO2 uptake at low pressures compared to H+/KPHI. Further, in situ ATR-FTIR revealed that the interaction of CO2 with these frameworks, despite the large observed isosteric heats of adsorption, is best described as enhanced physisorption (and not chemisorption). Performance of these adsorbents for a carbon capture process was estimated with predictions from IAST and with a simplified TSA model for comparison against top-performing MOF, UTSA-16, as well as other benchmark materials such as NaX and Mg2(dobdc). Proton-exchanged KPHI and CaPHI showed exceptional IAST CO2/N2 selectivity of 366 and 303 at 4% CO2 concentration compared to 124 for UTSA-16.

While K<sup>+</sup> ions interact\npredominantly with a single layer of the sheet-like PHI, the much\nmore polarizing Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions interact with as many as three\nPHI sheets, acting as bridging moieties. This heightened interaction\nof the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sites with Lewis base sites on neighboring\nPHI sheets is present during structure assembly.

This disrupting in the planar\ncrystal structure of CaPHI compared to KPHI might be the cause of\nthe loss of crystallinity upon exchange of K<sup>+</sup> with Ca<sup>2+</sup> previously observed by Savateev et al.; once the sheets\nstack in a planar fashion, they likely cannot easily flex to accommodate\nCa<sup>2+</sup>. However, despite the\napparent disruption in planarity of the PHI sheets, the CaPHI structure\nexhibits a similar stacking motif to the previously studied KPHI,\nwhere heptazine units align along the <italic toggle=\"yes\">c</italic>-axis to form\nan ordered pore channel filled with the templating cation, Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This feature of the PHI family is in stark contrast to\nmost allotropes of carbon nitride, such as the popular graphitic carbon\nnitride (g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>). The fully condensed g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> differs from PHI materials in that there are\nno bridging amines between heptazine monomers, resulting in an AB\nstacking motif and an absence of ordered pore channels.</p><p>The optoelectronic properties of these two\ndifferent carbon nitride\nallotropes varied significantly as a result of the altered crystalline\nstructure and morphology. The band structure (d) of CaPHI, KPHI, and H<sup>+</sup>-exchanged\ncounterparts was quantified with diffuse reflectance UV\u2013vis\nspectroscopy (DRUV\u2013vis) (a) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS)\n(c). In contrast\nto KPHI and H<sup>+</sup>/KPHI, which show relatively sharp absorption\nonsets near 450 nm, CaPHI and H<sup>+</sup>/CaPHI exhibit at least\ntwo different electronic transitions. Further insight was extracted\nfrom DRUV\u2013vis data by employing analysis proposed by V. Kumar\net al. to quantify the band gaps in these PHI materials (b). The measured optical band gaps for KPHI and H<sup>+</sup>/KPHI were 2.72 and 2.93 eV, respectively. CaPHI and H<sup>+</sup>/CaPHI, alternatively, showed comparatively larger band gaps of 2.82\nand 3.07 eV. In each case, ion exchange of the frameworks led to \u223c0.2\neV increase in the observable band gaps. This primary transition was\nassociated with the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0* transition in the conjugate\nheptazine moiety as previously observed by Sahoo, Ku\u0308hne et\nal. Additionally the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-derived\nmaterials showed evidence of additional electronic transitions of\n2.21 eV for CaPHI and 2.43 eV for H<sup>+</sup>/CaPHI that are likely\nassociated with additional n-\u03c0* transitions involving the lone\npair of pyridinic N atoms, accessible due to the corrugation of the\nPHI sheets. Similar states residing within\nthe bandgap were observed to a lesser extent for KPHI by Savateev\net al. associated with slight disorder and flexibility in the planar\narrangement that allowed for out-of-plane conformations. While DRUV\u2013vis data here shows a slight\nindication of these intraband states for KPHI (e.g., small absorption\nonset near 600 nm), these transitions were not as prevalent as in\nCaPHI or H<sup>+</sup>/CaPHI and seem to be totally absent in H<sup>+</sup>/KPHI. With UPS, the valence band positions of these PHI materials\nwere also estimated (c). KPHI and H<sup>+</sup>/KPHI showed an onset of photoelectron\nemission at 2.79 and 3.12 eV, and CaPHI and H<sup>+</sup>/CaPHI exhibited\nvalence positions around 4.84 and 4.64 eV, respectively. Further confirmation\nof n-\u03c0* transitions in CaPHI and H<sup>+</sup>/CaPHI is evident\nin the UPS data, with gradual onsets occurring at energies around\n3.4 eV. Combined with the extracted optical band gaps, the information\non the valence band positions allowed an estimation of the band structure\nof the PHI class of materials (d). This relative comparison of the optoelectronic\nstructure between the various allotropes of PHI frameworks demonstrates\nthat despite similar polymeric backbone, the corrugated and compressed\ncrystalline structure associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-templating shifted\nthe bands of CaPHI and H<sup>+</sup>/CaPHI toward more oxidizing positions\nthan the more planar KPHI structure.</p><p>Textural properties of the various\nsynthesized carbon nitride framework\nmaterials were quantified with N<sub>2</sub> porosimetry. All of KPHI,\nCaPHI, and their proton-exchanged analogues exhibited a convolution\nof Type I and Type IV isotherm shapes with H4 hysteresis (a), indicating a\nhierarchical pore structure composed of both micro- and mesopores.\nAfter proper point selection, BET analysis (<ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.1c08912/suppl_file/nn1c08912_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">SI Figure S5</ext-link>) revealed that, despite similar average primary crystallite\nsizes, the surface area of CaPHI (43.5 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup>) was more than three times smaller than the surface area of KPHI\n(152 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup>). These differences therefore\nlikely stem from differences in the secondary particle size, as larger\nparticles would be associated with a smaller external N<sub>2</sub>-accessible surface area. As visible in the extracted pore size distributions\nin b,c, these\ncation-complexed frameworks exhibited near negligible microporosity\n(&lt;0.01 cc g<sup>\u20131</sup>), and most of the surface area\nwas composed of mesopores larger than 4 nm, likely due to stacking\nfaults between the primary nanocrystals that comprised the micron-sized\nparticles. However, upon removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> via washing with acid, the interior pore channels of these frameworks\nwere accessible for N<sub>2</sub> adsorption, and the BET surface\narea increased to 264 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> and 334\nm<sup>2</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> for H<sup>+</sup>/CaPHI and H<sup>+</sup>/KPHI, respectively. Pore size distributions (b) revealed that a considerable\namount of microporosity was generated in both PHI allotropes after\nacid washing. As evident in c, H<sup>+</sup>/CaPHI exhibited almost twice as much\nultramicroporosity as H<sup>+</sup>/KPHI, with nearly 0.04 cc g<sup>\u20131</sup> of pores with width less than 0.7 nm. This increase\nin volume of these narrow pores has been shown to be critical for\nenhanced low-pressure CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and was likely associated\nwith the altered crystalline structure of H<sup>+</sup>/CaPHI as compared\nto H<sup>+</sup>/KPHI. On the other hand, H<sup>+</sup>/KPHI exhibited\nmore than 0.12 cc/g of micropores (&lt;2 nm), with most having a width\nof 1 nm. In addition to this increase in micropore volume and BET\nsurface area, proton exchange was also associated with a large increase\nin volume of larger mesopores (&gt;4 nm) for both allotropes, with\nthe\ntotal measured porosity of H<sup>+</sup>/CaPHI exceeding 0.5 cc g<sup>\u20131</sup>. Overall, while the cation-complexed frameworks exhibited\nmoderate external surface areas stemming from the secondary particle\nagglomerations, acid-washed counterparts H<sup>+</sup>/CaPHI and H<sup>+</sup>/KPHI showed that the cation exchange for much smaller protons\nallowed N<sub>2</sub> to access at least a portion of the inner porosity\nof the ordered pore channels formed by the stacked PHI sheets.</p><p>While the adsorption saturation\ncapacities between the two carbon\nnitride frameworks were very different, the energetics of adsorption\nwere more comparable, which is indicative of similar modes of adsorption\nlikely due to the analogous composition and surface chemistry of the\ntwo PHI materials.

Indicators of cation-complexed imides (e.g., IR peak near 1000 cm-1 and 13C chemical shift at 168 ppm) were much stronger for KPHI than for CaPHI. XPS quantification showed cation:N ratios of 0.64 for KPHI but only 0.02 for CaPHI. This discrepancy is much too large to be explained by charge-balance alone, so a large proportion of the imide-complexed Ca2+ cations were likely displaced by protons during water washing. Additionally, as XPS is a surface sensitive technique, the cation concentration in the top few nanometers of the PHI particles could have been much smaller than the bulk. To more closely investigate the cation content of the bulk PHI frameworks, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was employed, and the results are summarized in SI Table S2. These studies suggested that KPHI exhibited around 17 wt % K+, implying a charge-balanced structural formula close to (C12N17)3K6H3. On the other hand, CaPHI exhibited only 6.4 wt % Ca2+, suggesting a formula of (C12N17)3Ca2H5. This difference in extent of proton exchange could have been caused by changes in the pH of the washing solution upon salt removal or slight changes in the pK a of the resulting polymeric backbones. Further investigation of the acid-base characteristics of these PHI materials was achieved via potentiometric titration experiments, and discussion can be found in the SI.\n\nThese differences in crystal structure, despite chemical similarity of the backbone, are likely related to the difference in ionic radius (152 pm for K+ vs 114 pm for Ca2+), more than doubled charge to radius ratio, valence, and resulting Lewis acidity of the framework-complexed cations. While K+ ions interact predominantly with a single layer of the sheet-like PHI, the much more polarizing Ca2+ ions interact with as many as three PHI sheets, acting as bridging moieties. This heightened interaction of the Ca2+ sites with Lewis base sites on neighboring PHI sheets is present during structure assembly. To accommodate this difference in the templating cation, the crystal structure flexes in the ab plane and expands slightly along the c-axis as evident by the shift of the 002 peak in b from ~28.3\u00b0 to ~27.9\u00b0, corresponding to d-spacings of 3.14 and 3.19 \u00c5 in H+/KPHI to H+/CaPHI, respectively. Scherrer analysis on this 002 reflection of the synthesized H+/CaPHI and H+/KPHI indicated comparable average crystallite sizes of 8.7 and 11.4 nm, respectively, along the c-axis (SI Table S3). This disrupting in the planar crystal structure of CaPHI compared to KPHI might be the cause of the loss of crystallinity upon exchange of K+ with Ca2+ previously observed by Savateev et al.; once the sheets stack in a planar fashion, they likely cannot easily flex to accommodate Ca2+. However, despite the apparent disruption in planarity of the PHI sheets, the CaPHI structure exhibits a similar stacking motif to the previously studied KPHI, where heptazine units align along the c-axis to form an ordered pore channel filled with the templating cation, Ca2+. This feature of the PHI family is in stark contrast to most allotropes of carbon nitride, such as the popular graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4). The fully condensed g-C3N4 differs from PHI materials in that there are no bridging amines between heptazine monomers, resulting in an AB stacking motif and an absence of ordered pore channels.\n\nThe optoelectronic properties of these two different carbon nitride allotropes varied significantly as a result of the altered crystalline structure and morphology. The band structure (d) of CaPHI, KPHI, and H+-exchanged counterparts was quantified with diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectroscopy (DRUV-vis) (a) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (c). In contrast to KPHI and H+/KPHI, which show relatively sharp absorption onsets near 450 nm, CaPHI and H+/CaPHI exhibit at least two different electronic transitions. Further insight was extracted from DRUV-vis data by employing analysis proposed by V. Kumar et al. to quantify the band gaps in these PHI materials (b). The measured optical band gaps for KPHI and H+/KPHI were 2.72 and 2.93 eV, respectively. CaPHI and H+/CaPHI, alternatively, showed comparatively larger band gaps of 2.82 and 3.07 eV. In each case, ion exchange of the frameworks led to ~0.2 eV increase in the observable band gaps. This primary transition was associated with the \u03c0-\u03c0* transition in the conjugate heptazine moiety as previously observed by Sahoo, Ku\u0308hne et al. Additionally the Ca2+-derived materials showed evidence of additional electronic transitions of 2.21 eV for CaPHI and 2.43 eV for H+/CaPHI that are likely associated with additional n-\u03c0* transitions involving the lone pair of pyridinic N atoms, accessible due to the corrugation of the PHI sheets. Similar states residing within the bandgap were observed to a lesser extent for KPHI by Savateev et al. associated with slight disorder and flexibility in the planar arrangement that allowed for out-of-plane conformations. While DRUV-vis data here shows a slight indication of these intraband states for KPHI (e.g., small absorption onset near 600 nm), these transitions were not as prevalent as in CaPHI or H+/CaPHI and seem to be totally absent in H+/KPHI. With UPS, the valence band positions of these PHI materials were also estimated (c). KPHI and H+/KPHI showed an onset of photoelectron emission at 2.79 and 3.12 eV, and CaPHI and H+/CaPHI exhibited valence positions around 4.84 and 4.64 eV, respectively. Further confirmation of n-\u03c0* transitions in CaPHI and H+/CaPHI is evident in the UPS data, with gradual onsets occurring at energies around 3.4 eV. Combined with the extracted optical band gaps, the information on the valence band positions allowed an estimation of the band structure of the PHI class of materials (d). This relative comparison of the optoelectronic structure between the various allotropes of PHI frameworks demonstrates that despite similar polymeric backbone, the corrugated and compressed crystalline structure associated with Ca2+-templating shifted the bands of CaPHI and H+/CaPHI toward more oxidizing positions than the more planar KPHI structure.\n\nTextural properties of the various synthesized carbon nitride framework materials were quantified with N2 porosimetry. All of KPHI, CaPHI, and their proton-exchanged analogues exhibited a convolution of Type I and Type IV isotherm shapes with H4 hysteresis (a), indicating a hierarchical pore structure composed of both micro- and mesopores. After proper point selection, BET analysis (SI Figure S5) revealed that, despite similar average primary crystallite sizes, the surface area of CaPHI (43.5 m2 g-1) was more than three times smaller than the surface area of KPHI (152 m2 g-1). These differences therefore likely stem from differences in the secondary particle size, as larger particles would be associated with a smaller external N2-accessible surface area. As visible in the extracted pore size distributions in b,c, these cation-complexed frameworks exhibited near negligible microporosity (<0.01 cc g-1), and most of the surface area was composed of mesopores larger than 4 nm, likely due to stacking faults between the primary nanocrystals that comprised the micron-sized particles. However, upon removal of Ca2+ or K+ via washing with acid, the interior pore channels of these frameworks were accessible for N2 adsorption, and the BET surface area increased to 264 m2 g-1 and 334 m2 g-1 for H+/CaPHI and H+/KPHI, respectively. Pore size distributions (b) revealed that a considerable amount of microporosity was generated in both PHI allotropes after acid washing. As evident in c, H+/CaPHI exhibited almost twice as much ultramicroporosity as H+/KPHI, with nearly 0.04 cc g-1 of pores with width less than 0.7 nm. This increase in volume of these narrow pores has been shown to be critical for enhanced low-pressure CO2 uptake and was likely associated with the altered crystalline structure of H+/CaPHI as compared to H+/KPHI. On the other hand, H+/KPHI exhibited more than 0.12 cc/g of micropores (<2 nm), with most having a width of 1 nm. In addition to this increase in micropore volume and BET surface area, proton exchange was also associated with a large increase in volume of larger mesopores (>4 nm) for both allotropes, with the total measured porosity of H+/CaPHI exceeding 0.5 cc g-1. Overall, while the cation-complexed frameworks exhibited moderate external surface areas stemming from the secondary particle agglomerations, acid-washed counterparts H+/CaPHI and H+/KPHI showed that the cation exchange for much smaller protons allowed N2 to access at least a portion of the inner porosity of the ordered pore channels formed by the stacked PHI sheets.\n\nWhile the adsorption saturation capacities between the two carbon nitride frameworks were very different, the energetics of adsorption were more comparable, which is indicative of similar modes of adsorption likely due to the analogous composition and surface chemistry of the two PHI materials. For \u0394H ads,i  in both H+/CaPHI and H+/KPHI, the primary site exhibited an enhancement of nearly 15 kJ mol-1 as compared to the secondary site, which helps to explain the order of magnitude difference in the pressure-response between these two sites. Despite this similarity between the materials, H+/CaPHI did however exhibit about 5 kJ mol-1 increase in affinity for CO2 compared to H+/KPHI. For H+/CaPHI and H+/KPHI, the extracted \u0394H ads,A  in the primary sites were -42.2 kJ mol-1 and -38.3 kJ mol-1; in the weaker site, the \u0394H ads,B were -28.6 and -23.7 kJ mol-1, respectively. The magnitudes for \u0394H ads,A, while smaller than those typically encountered for chemisorptive mechanisms (>80 kJ mol-1), were much larger than commonly measured for conventional physisorption which operates by pore filling alone (~25 kJ mol-1). Extracted \u0394H ads,B  values, on the other hand, fall in this range expected for traditional physisorption mechanisms.\n\nIn contrast to the large differences in \u0394H ads,i observed between the two adsorption sites, the \u0394S ads,i were of comparable magnitude, differing only by about 5 J mol-1 K-1 between the primary and secondary sites. For H+/CaPHI, the \u0394S ads,A and \u0394S ads,B were -70.2 and -65.1 J mol-1 K-1, and for H+/KPHI, the \u0394S ads,A and \u0394S ads,B were -65.9 and -50 J mol-1 K-1, respectively. These similar values of entropic losses likely indicate that the pore columns in the PHI architecture confine CO2 and restrict the translational and rotational motion to similar extents at both adsorption sites, despite the difference in enthalpic interactions. The slightly larger \u0394S ads,i  could be indicative of a more restrictive environment in the H+/CaPHI material, but further work on the exact physical mechanisms contributing to the entropic losses on gas adsorption in covalent frameworks are needed for a more comprehensive understanding. Overall, H+/CaPHI exhibited both larger capacity and affinity for CO2 than H+/KPHI in both adsorption sites despite their similar polymeric structure, which demonstrates the critical importance of the altered crystal structure and pore configuration for endowing CO2 adsorptive capacity.", "data": ["This model's maximum context length is 4097 tokens.
