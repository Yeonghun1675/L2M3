Synthesis of MOFs with various physical/chemical properties is relatively easier than that of zeolites, and the MOF/polymer interface can be controlled by varying the affinity of organic linkers to the polymer matrix. Also, the surface of MOFs can be modified by functionalization for favorable interaction with the polymer. MOFs, in general, offer greater pore volumes and weigh less than zeolites. Thus, for a given mass loading, a MMM with MOF will affect the membrane behavior significantly greater than MMM with a zeolite. MMMs with MOFs that have been reported include Cu-BPY-HFS (Cu-4,40-bipyridine hexafluorosilicate) in Matrimid; HKUST-1 in poly(sulfone); MOF-5 in Matrimid; Cu-TPA (terephthalic acid) in poly(vinyl acetate); ZIF-90 in 6FDA-DAM (6FDA: 2,2-bis (3,4-carboxyphenyl) hexafluoropropane dianhydride and DAM: diaminomesitylene); ZIF-7 in polybenzimidazole (PBI); Cu<sub>3</sub>(BTC)<sub>2</sub>, ZIF-8, and MIL-53 (Al) in Matrimid; ZIF-8 in Matrimid; HKUST-1 in polyimide hollow fiber mixed matrix membrane; HKUST-1 in Matrimid; and HKUST-1, MIL-53, MIL-47, and ZIF-8 in PDMS. In particular, the ZIF-7/PBI nanocomposite showed remarkably higher ideal H<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> permselectivity, as compared to pure PBI membranes and pure polycrystalline ZIF-7 membranes. The enhanced selectivity was attributed to the strong interfacial interactions between ZIF-7 and the polymer, which reduced nonselective pathways for gas transport. Thus mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) with MOFs provide potential alternatives as enhanced gas separation membranes.
