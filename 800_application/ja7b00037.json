We speculate that the basic nature of arginine would facilitate deprotonation of phenolic/alkyl hydroxyl groups of PgC3OH and the carboxylic groups would act as ligands and compete with the phenolic/alkyl hydroxyl groups of PgC3OH for coordination. In this way, the yield and quality of crystalline products are improved. The synthesis utilizes a solvothermal reaction, which produces crystalline materials of high quality and yield in a short time period.
