A Ni\nMOF (Ni-BTC), a Fe MOF (Fe-BTC) and a mixed metal MOF (Fe/Ni-BTC)\nwere synthesized through the solvothermal synthesis method (denoted\nas STS Ni-BTC, STS Fe-BTC and STS Fe/Ni-BTC, respectively) and investigated\non the glassy carbon (GC) electrode. As we expected, the mixed metal\nFe/Ni-MOF shows higher OER catalytic activity, which combines the\nlow onset overpotential of Ni-MOF of about 170 mV with the large current\ndensity of Fe-MOF (). However, the current density of the electrode is still\nfar lower than the need of real application, i.e., 10 mA cm<sup>\u20132</sup>, because of the low conductivity of the electrode. The introduction\nof binder is inevitable during the preparation of electrode and the\ncontact between MOF particles and glassy carbon surface is too weak\nto support the long time electrolysis reaction. Therefore, we report\na general procedure to prepare highly active and stable binder-free\nMOFs thin films with desired metal or metal pairs by fast electrochemical\ndeposition. Through a 30-s electrochemical method without using any\nbinders, different MOF thin films were successfully deposited on nickel\nfoam (NF), including Fe MOF (Fe-BTC), Ni MOF (Ni-BTC) and mixed metal\nMOF thin films with different Fe/Ni ratios (Fe/Ni-BTC). Notably the\nFe/Ni-BTC film deposited on NF with the Fe/Ni ratio of 1/12 (Fe/Ni-BTC@NF)\nshows great electrocatalytic performances in alkaline solution with\na low overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>\u20132</sup>, a small\nTafel slope of 47 mV dec<sup>\u20131</sup>, and high Faradaic efficiency\nof 95%. Further, this Fe/Ni-BTC@NF also exhibits high turnover frequency\nof 468 h<sup>\u20131</sup> at overpotential of 300 mV.</p><title>Characterization of Morphology and Structure</title><p>The electrochemically\ndeposited Fe/Ni-BTC MOF forms a brown thin coverage across the NF\nsurface (c).\nAs shown in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the Fe/Ni-BTC@NF\n(d), the MOF\nfilm is uniformly distributed on the surface of the NF skeleton. Small\nparticles roughly 100 nm in diameter are observed in the as-deposited\nfilms (e),\nwhich can enhance the accessibility of the active sites for OER. Energy\ndispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping confirms a homogeneous\ndistribution of Ni and Fe as well as C and O in Fe/Ni-BTC@NF (a\u2013e). Cross-sectional\nSEM analysis of the Fe/Ni-BTC film reveals an average thickness of\n5 \u03bcm (f). The thin layer of MOF nanocrystals was closely bonded to the\nhighly conductive NF substrate, which can ensure the efficient charge\ntransportation to the film from the NF substrate.</p><title>Electrocatalysis Performance\nfor OER</title><p>Next, the electrocatalytic OER activity of blank\nNF, Fe-BTC@NF, Ni-BTC@NF and Fe/Ni-BTC@NF were investigated in 0.1\nM KOH aqueous solution in a standard three-electrode system. The OER\nactivity was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) with 95% <italic>iR</italic> compensation at a slow scan rate of 2 mV s<sup>\u20131</sup> to avoid the overlap of OER onset currents and the oxidation peak\n(Ni<sup>3+</sup> /Ni<sup>2+</sup>) around 1.4 V, which is assigned\nto the formation of Ni<sup>3+</sup> producing active sites to catalyze\noxygen (a).\nThe overpotential required to reach a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>\u20132</sup> (\u03b7) is chosen because it represents the current\ndensity of a realistic device with 12.3% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. MOF samples with different Fe/Ni ratio of 1/3,\n1/1, and 1/12 were prepared and investigated by PXRD and LSV (). Among these samples, the smallest\n\u03b7 value of 270 mV was obtained by Fe/Ni-BTC@NF with Fe/Ni ratio\nof 1/12. This value is much smaller than those of many Fe/Ni mixed\ncatalysts and rivals against most noble metal OER catalysts. The OER kinetics of catalysts were also estimated by Tafel plots\n(b). The slope\nof Fe/Ni-BTC@NF that reaches 47 mV per dec<sup>\u20131</sup> is\nvery close to those of the benchmark catalysts, IrO<sub>2</sub>, RuO<sub>2</sub>\n and well-studied mixed Fe/Ni catalysts. The OER mechanism of Fe/Ni mixed catalysts has been extensively\nstudied, and a conclusion was drawn that Ni is the active oxygen evolution\ncenter and the incorporation of extra Fe improves the conductivity\nof the material. Louie et al. elaborated that\nNi<sup>2+</sup>/Ni<sup>3+</sup> oxidation peak shifts to higher potential\nwith incorporating of Fe, which is consistent with our result. Corrigan investigated OER activities of Ni\u00ad(OH)<sub>2</sub> with different additive metals in a ratio of 1:9 and found\nthat the addition of Fe produced the best performance. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) ()\nof Fe/Ni-BTC@NF were also evaluated. As a class of porous material,\nMOF leads to a homogeneous distribution of potential active centers\nthrough the whole material and a high accessibility due to the open\nchannels. We therefore expect a high electrochemical surface area\n(ECSA) in Fe/Ni-BTC@NF. The ECSA of these materials were estimated\nfrom the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (<italic>C</italic>\n<sub>dl</sub>) of the catalysts. The <italic>C</italic>\n<sub>dl</sub> of Fe/Ni-BTC@NF and blank NF are 8.052 and 0.770 mF cm<sup>\u20132</sup>, respectively (). The higher <italic>C</italic>\n<sub>dl</sub> of Fe/Ni-BTC@NF induced by the porosity of\nMOFs reveals an improved ECSA, which is favorable for the electrocatalysis.</p><p>To understand the underlying catalytic\nmechanism of Fe/Ni-BTC@NF, control experiments were thoroughly investigated,\nincluding Ni-BTC, Fe-BTC, and Fe/Ni without BTC that were electrochemically\ndeposited on NF under the identical conditions. The overpotential\nrequired for 10 mA cm<sup>\u20132</sup> (\u03b7), the current density\nat 1.7 V vs RHE (<italic>j</italic>\n<sub>max</sub>) and the Tafel slope\nare taken as three parameters with regard to both activity and kinetics\n(c). Among\nthe above-mentioned four catalysts, the Fe/Ni-BTC shows the lowest\n\u03b7 of 270 mV, the highest <italic>j</italic>\n<sub>max</sub> of\n131 mA cm<sup>\u20132</sup>, and a very small Tafel slope of 47\nmV dec<sup>\u20131</sup>. The superior performance of Fe/Ni-BTC\nover Fe-BTC and Ni-BTC can be contributed to the synergy effect of\nFe and Ni. The electrochemically deposited\nFe/Ni film without BTC is probably composed of Fe/Ni amorphous oxides\nand/or hydroxides, showing a much poorer performance than that of\nFe/Ni-BTC. We supposed that the porous structure in Fe/Ni-BTC film\ngenerated from BTC is favorable for the OER catalysis, and this result\nexcludes the influence of the small amount of amorphous metal hydroxides\nor metal oxides that may exist in the Fe/Ni-BTC film. Compared with\ntwo similar catalysts that we reported previously, i.e., bulk Ni\u2013Fe\noxides and porous Ni\u2013Fe oxides, the Fe/Ni-BTC@NF clearly outperforms the porous Ni\u2013Fe oxide\ncatalyst owing to not only the intrinsic porosity of MOF film but\nalso the periodic arrangement and the homogeneous distribution of\nmetal centers in the MOF film. Moreover, the NF affords a highly conductive\nmacroporous scaffold with high surface area. As exemplified in this\ncomparison, the highly porous MOF film and the NF substrate provide\na large accessible surface and copious exposed active centers, and\noffer open channels for electrolyte ion insertion/extraction and O<sub>2</sub> diffusion and dissipation. Moreover, the heterogeneity caused\nby introducing both Ni and Fe paddle-wheel building blocks in a predetermined\ntopologically ordered MOF framework can potentially produce materials,\nlike this Fe/Ni-BTC MOF film, with emergent properties that are better\nthan the sum of the individual molecular counterparts.</p><p>Controlled\npotential electrolysis (CPE) at 1.53 V (\u03b7 = 300 mV) was conducted\nin 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution under continuous stirring (a). During the test,\na substantial amount of bubbles of O<sub>2</sub> gas were observed\n(see ), which led to the current\nfluctuation in the OER process. The amount of evolved O<sub>2</sub> was measured by gas chromatography and a Faradaic efficiency of\n95% was obtained during CPE. The activity of the catalyst was also\nevaluated through turnover frequency (TOF).

The heterogeneity and porosity of this system prove to show synergy effect and give low onset overpotential at 170 mV. These MOFs are further fabricated into thin films over nickel foam by controlled electrochemical deposition to improve the surface conductivity and the overall stability. The Fe/Ni metal-organic framework film exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity with low overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm-2, small Tafel slope, high Faradaic efficiency, high turnover frequency, and great stability.\n\nHerein, we select the M-BTC MOF (M for metal ions, BTC for 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid) as the platform to systematically investigate the catalytic performance by varying the metal ions and the metal contents. A Ni MOF (Ni-BTC), a Fe MOF (Fe-BTC) and a mixed metal MOF (Fe/Ni-BTC) were synthesized through the solvothermal synthesis method (denoted as STS Ni-BTC, STS Fe-BTC and STS Fe/Ni-BTC, respectively) and investigated on the glassy carbon (GC) electrode. As we expected, the mixed metal Fe/Ni-MOF shows higher OER catalytic activity, which combines the low onset overpotential of Ni-MOF of about 170 mV with the large current density of Fe-MOF (). However, the current density of the electrode is still far lower than the need of real application, i.e., 10 mA cm-2, because of the low conductivity of the electrode. The introduction of binder is inevitable during the preparation of electrode and the contact between MOF particles and glassy carbon surface is too weak to support the long time electrolysis reaction. Therefore, we report a general procedure to prepare highly active and stable binder-free MOFs thin films with desired metal or metal pairs by fast electrochemical deposition. Through a 30-s electrochemical method without using any binders, different MOF thin films were successfully deposited on nickel foam (NF), including Fe MOF (Fe-BTC), Ni MOF (Ni-BTC) and mixed metal MOF thin films with different Fe/Ni ratios (Fe/Ni-BTC). Notably the Fe/Ni-BTC film deposited on NF with the Fe/Ni ratio of 1/12 (Fe/Ni-BTC@NF) shows great electrocatalytic performances in alkaline solution with a low overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm-2, a small Tafel slope of 47 mV dec-1, and high Faradaic efficiency of 95%. Further, this Fe/Ni-BTC@NF also exhibits high turnover frequency of 468 h-1 at overpotential of 300 mV.\n\nCharacterization of Morphology and Structure\n\nThe electrochemically deposited Fe/Ni-BTC MOF forms a brown thin coverage across the NF surface (c). As shown in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the Fe/Ni-BTC@NF (d), the MOF film is uniformly distributed on the surface of the NF skeleton. Small particles roughly 100 nm in diameter are observed in the as-deposited films (e), which can enhance the accessibility of the active sites for OER. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping confirms a homogeneous distribution of Ni and Fe as well as C and O in Fe/Ni-BTC@NF (a-e). Cross-sectional SEM analysis of the Fe/Ni-BTC film reveals an average thickness of 5 \u03bcm (f). The thin layer of MOF nanocrystals was closely bonded to the highly conductive NF substrate, which can ensure the efficient charge transportation to the film from the NF substrate.\n\nElectrocatalysis Performance for OER\n\nNext, the electrocatalytic OER activity of blank NF, Fe-BTC@NF, Ni-BTC@NF and Fe/Ni-BTC@NF were investigated in 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution in a standard three-electrode system. The OER activity was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) with 95% iR compensation at a slow scan rate of 2 mV s-1 to avoid the overlap of OER onset currents and the oxidation peak (Ni3+ /Ni2+) around 1.4 V, which is assigned to the formation of Ni3+ producing active sites to catalyze oxygen (a). The overpotential required to reach a current density of 10 mA cm-2 (\u03b7) is chosen because it represents the current density of a realistic device with 12.3% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. MOF samples with different Fe/Ni ratio of 1/3, 1/1, and 1/12 were prepared and investigated by PXRD and LSV (). Among these samples, the smallest \u03b7 value of 270 mV was obtained by Fe/Ni-BTC@NF with Fe/Ni ratio of 1/12. This value is much smaller than those of many Fe/Ni mixed catalysts and rivals against most noble metal OER catalysts. The OER kinetics of catalysts were also estimated by Tafel plots (b). The slope of Fe/Ni-BTC@NF that reaches 47 mV per dec-1 is very close to those of the benchmark catalysts, IrO2, RuO2  and well-studied mixed Fe/Ni catalysts. The OER mechanism of Fe/Ni mixed catalysts has been extensively studied, and a conclusion was drawn that Ni is the active oxygen evolution center and the incorporation of extra Fe improves the conductivity of the material. Louie et al. elaborated that Ni2+/Ni3+ oxidation peak shifts to higher potential with incorporating of Fe, which is consistent with our result. Corrigan investigated OER activities of Ni(OH)2 with different additive metals in a ratio of 1:9 and found that the addition of Fe produced the best performance. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) () of Fe/Ni-BTC@NF were also evaluated. As a class of porous material, MOF leads to a homogeneous distribution of potential active centers through the whole material and a high accessibility due to the open channels. We therefore expect a high electrochemical surface area (ECSA) in Fe/Ni-BTC@NF. The ECSA of these materials were estimated from the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (C dl) of the catalysts. The C dl of Fe/Ni-BTC@NF and blank NF are 8.052 and 0.770 mF cm-2, respectively (). The higher C dl of Fe/Ni-BTC@NF induced by the porosity of MOFs reveals an improved ECSA, which is favorable for the electrocatalysis.\n\nTo understand the underlying catalytic mechanism of Fe/Ni-BTC@NF, control experiments were thoroughly investigated, including Ni-BTC, Fe-BTC, and Fe/Ni without BTC that were electrochemically deposited on NF under the identical conditions. The overpotential required for 10 mA cm-2 (\u03b7), the current density at 1.7 V vs RHE (j max) and the Tafel slope are taken as three parameters with regard to both activity and kinetics (c). Among the above-mentioned four catalysts, the Fe/Ni-BTC shows the lowest \u03b7 of 270 mV, the highest j max of 131 mA cm-2, and a very small Tafel slope of 47 mV dec-1. The superior performance of Fe/Ni-BTC over Fe-BTC and Ni-BTC can be contributed to the synergy effect of Fe and Ni. The electrochemically deposited Fe/Ni film without BTC is probably composed of Fe/Ni amorphous oxides and/or hydroxides, showing a much poorer performance than that of Fe/Ni-BTC. We supposed that the porous structure in Fe/Ni-BTC film generated from BTC is favorable for the OER catalysis, and this result excludes the influence of the small amount of amorphous metal hydroxides or metal oxides that may exist in the Fe/Ni-BTC film. Compared with two similar catalysts that we reported previously, i.e., bulk Ni-Fe oxides and porous Ni-Fe oxides, the Fe/Ni-BTC@NF clearly outperforms the porous Ni-Fe oxide catalyst owing to not only the intrinsic porosity of MOF film but also the periodic arrangement and the homogeneous distribution of metal centers in the MOF film. Moreover, the NF affords a highly conductive macroporous scaffold with high surface area. As exemplified in this comparison, the highly porous MOF film and the NF substrate provide a large accessible surface and copious exposed active centers, and offer open channels for electrolyte ion insertion/extraction and O2 diffusion and dissipation. Moreover, the heterogeneity caused by introducing both Ni and Fe paddle-wheel building blocks in a predetermined topologically ordered MOF framework can potentially produce materials, like this Fe/Ni-BTC MOF film, with emergent properties that are better than the sum of the individual molecular counterparts.\n\nControlled potential electrolysis (CPE) at 1.53 V (\u03b7 = 300 mV) was conducted in 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution under continuous stirring (a). During the test, a substantial amount of bubbles of O2 gas were observed (see ), which led to the current fluctuation in the OER process. The amount of evolved O2 was measured by gas chromatography and a Faradaic efficiency of 95% was obtained during CPE. The activity of the catalyst was also evaluated through turnover frequency (TOF). At a 300 mV overpotential, the TOF of Fe/Ni-BTC@NF was calculated to be 468 h-1 (0.13 s-1) based on the ICP analysis of Ni content assuming that all the Ni atoms of Fe/Ni-BTC were involved in the catalysis. If Fe atoms were also involved in catalysis, the TOF would be 432 h-1. This value of TOF is comparable to the benchmark value obtained by Trotochaud et al. After 15 h CPE, the samples were re-examined by SEM, XPS, FT-IR, and PXRD (b-g). The catalyst did not detach from NF skeleton and the morphology and the structure of Fe/Ni-BTC were almost maintained. The valence states of Ni and Fe also kept unchanged. The CV curves of Fe/Ni-BTC@NF before electrolysis and after electrolysis are basically identical ().\n\nThe lower overpotential of the electrode could enhance the energy harvesting efficiency. Thus, we compared the overpotentials required to deliver a j of 10 mA cm-2 and conditions (electrolytes and substrates) of a variety of OER films (, ). The value of 270 mV is significantly lower than all the previously reported NiFe binary composites based electrodes with the only exception of one NiFe/NF example (240 mV), and lower than nonprecious metal catalysts, the benchmark noble metal catalysts, i.e., Ru/C and Ir/C, and the MOF-based OER catalysts. In general, Fe/Ni-BTC@NF outperforms most catalysts, including catalysts supported on both flat substrates and NF, and ranks among the best OER catalytic materials reported up to date (see the detailed comparison in ).\n\nConclusions\n\nIn conclusion, a series of Fe/Ni MOFs (Ni-BTC, Fe-BTC, Fe/Ni-BTC) were solvothermally synthesized and their OER catalytic performances were investigated on the glassy carbon electrode.
