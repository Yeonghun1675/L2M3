A detailed study of the structure of xylene inclusion compounds suggests that the two most significant factors affect the preferred sorption of p- and m-xylene over o-xylene. First, o-xylene in the structure is stabilized by a less amount of C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 and CH3\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions compared to the other two isomers. The second decisive factor is the undesirable distortion of a sufficiently rigid framework to accommodate guest molecules, which reaches its maximum for the structure with o-xylene.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 32, "type": "text", "classification": ["synthesis condition"], "content": "<title>Experimental\nSection</title><title>Synthesis of [Li<sub>2</sub>Zn<sub>2</sub>(py)<sub>2</sub>(piv)<sub>6</sub>]</title><p>The heterometallic complex was obtained according\nto a previously published technique.\n</p><title>Synthesis of [Li<sub>2</sub>Zn<sub>2</sub>(bpy)\u00ad(ndc)<sub>3</sub>]\u00b71.5DMF\n(NIIC-30\u00ad(Ph)\u00b7DMF)</title><p>[Li<sub>2</sub>Zn<sub>2</sub>(py)<sub>2</sub>(piv)<sub>6</sub>] (20 mg, 0.0235 mmol) was\ndissolved in 0.5 mL of DMF.
