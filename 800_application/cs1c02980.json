Cu 4   II  -MFU-4l  has a TOF(CH4) of 0.07 \u00b1 0.01/0.13 \u00b1 0.01 s-1 calculated from three repeated measurements (Figure S4c) and FE(CH4) of 92%/88% as well as a partial current density of 9.8/18.3 mA cm-2 at -1.2/-1.3 V (vs RHE), which represent a high efficiency and selectivity (Table S1). The energy efficiency for yielding CH4 at a potential of -1.2 V (vs RHE) is 81.0% (Figure S6), indicative of a high energy usage. The reduced product given by MFU-4l  was only CO with a TOF of 0.012 s-1 and an FE of 17.0% at -1.2 V (vs RHE). It should be noted that, thanks to the coordination saturation of the octahedral zinc ion in the interior of the metal cluster (a), Zn should not be able to act as the active site for CO2RR in the structure of Cu 4   II  -MFU-4l , despite the electrochemical performance given by the pyramidal Zn in MFU-4l  for yielding CO (Figure S7). In other words, the Cu ions should be the active sites for CO2RR instead of the Zn ions. For comparison, [Cu3(btc)2] (HKUST-1, H3BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid) and Cu2O@Cu-BTC show the FE(CH4) of 45 and 63.2%, respectively. As far as we know, the performance of Cu 4   II  -MFU-4l  is the best one among all MOFs for yielding CH4 in CO2RR (Table S1) under neutral conditions. As for other inorganic materials, Barilea and Pan reported a Cu-Nafion electrocatalyst with an FE(CH4) of 88%/68%, but the current density is only 0.3/0.7 mA cm-2 at -0.89/-0.38 V (vs RHE). Actually, only an FN-CTF-400 compound exhibits a higher FE (FECH4  = 99.3%) than Cu 4   II  -MFU-4l  but with a current density of only 0.2 mA cm-2 at -0.8 V (vs RHE). The performance of Cu 4   II  -MFU-4l  is comparable to that of the best catalyst SA-Zn/MNC with an FE(CH4) of 85% with a current density of 31.8 mA cm-2 at -1.21 V (vs RHE). Due to the involvement of proton and H2O, H2 is usually an ineluctable product. Actually, H2 and CO evolution reaction also occurred in our tests, but the composition of the gas product can be simply tuned by controlling the potential. CO can be regarded as the main product at the low potential. Besides, the 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum reveals that no liquid-phase product existed during CO2RR (Figure S8). In order to identify the source of the obtained CH4, we replaced CO2 with 13CO2 and repeated the electrochemical test (Figure S9a). According to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry spectra, 13CH4 and 13CO were observed instead of CH4 and CO, confirming that the carbon in CH4 was originated from CO2. No other hydrocarbons (e.g., 13C2H4 and 13C2H6) or formic acid were observed; thus, no further separation for the product is required in the CO2RR catalyzed by Cu 4   II  -MFU-4l .", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 10, "type": "text", "classification": ["property"], "content": "<p>Besides the electrocatalytic activity and selectivity,\ndurability\nis also a crucial parameter for electrocatalysts.

In this work, we introduce a Cu-based metal-organic framework as a catalyst for the efficient and selective reduction of CO2 to CH4 in neutral aqueous electrolytes. Detailed examination of [Cu 4 ZnCl4(btdd)3] (Cu  4  -MFU-4l , H2btdd = bis(1H-1,2,3-triazolo-[4,5-b],[4',5'-i])dibenzo-[1,4]-dioxin) revealed the highest activity for yielding methane with a Faradaic efficiency of 92%/88% and a partial current density of 9.8/18.3 mA cm-2 at a potential of -1.2/-1.3 V (vs RHE). In situ X-ray absorption and infrared spectroscopy spectra, as well as density functional theory calculations, revealed that the in situ generated trigonal pyramidal Cu(I)N3 acts as the electrochemical active site and that the strong coordination ability of the Cu(I)N3 site and the synergistic effect of adjacent aromatic hydrogen atoms, via hydrogen-bonding interactions, play an important role in stabilizing the key intermediates of carbon dioxide reduction and inhibiting the hydrogen evolution reaction, thus showing a high performance of electroreduction of CO2 to CH4.\n\nIn order to evaluate the CO2RR activity of Cu 4   II  -MFU-4l , we examined FE and turnover frequency (TOF) in a CO2-saturated 0.5 M NaHCO3 solution under different potentials (b and S5). The partial current density plots of all products are shown in Figure S4b. Cu 4   II  -MFU-4l  has a TOF(CH4) of 0.07 \u00b1 0.01/0.13 \u00b1 0.01 s-1 calculated from three repeated measurements (Figure S4c) and FE(CH4) of 92%/88% as well as a partial current density of 9.8/18.3 mA cm-2 at -1.2/-1.3 V (vs RHE), which represent a high efficiency and selectivity (Table S1). The energy efficiency for yielding CH4 at a potential of -1.2 V (vs RHE) is 81.0% (Figure S6), indicative of a high energy usage. The reduced product given by MFU-4l  was only CO with a TOF of 0.012 s-1 and an FE of 17.0% at -1.2 V (vs RHE). It should be noted that, thanks to the coordination saturation of the octahedral zinc ion in the interior of the metal cluster (a), Zn should not be able to act as the active site for CO2RR in the structure of Cu 4   II  -MFU-4l , despite the electrochemical performance given by the pyramidal Zn in MFU-4l  for yielding CO (Figure S7). In other words, the Cu ions should be the active sites for CO2RR instead of the Zn ions. For comparison, [Cu3(btc)2] (HKUST-1, H3BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid) and Cu2O@Cu-BTC show the FE(CH4) of 45 and 63.2%, respectively. As far as we know, the performance of Cu 4   II  -MFU-4l  is the best one among all MOFs for yielding CH4 in CO2RR (Table S1) under neutral conditions. As for other inorganic materials, Barilea and Pan reported a Cu-Nafion electrocatalyst with an FE(CH4) of 88%/68%, but the current density is only 0.3/0.7 mA cm-2 at -0.89/-0.38 V (vs RHE). Actually, only an FN-CTF-400 compound exhibits a higher FE (FECH4  = 99.3%) than Cu 4   II  -MFU-4l  but with a current density of only 0.2 mA cm-2 at -0.8 V (vs RHE). The performance of Cu 4   II  -MFU-4l  is comparable to that of the best catalyst SA-Zn/MNC with an FE(CH4) of 85% with a current density of 31.8 mA cm-2 at -1.21 V (vs RHE). Due to the involvement of proton and H2O, H2 is usually an ineluctable product. Actually, H2 and CO evolution reaction also occurred in our tests, but the composition of the gas product can be simply tuned by controlling the potential. CO can be regarded as the main product at the low potential. Besides, the 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum reveals that no liquid-phase product existed during CO2RR (Figure S8). In order to identify the source of the obtained CH4, we replaced CO2 with 13CO2 and repeated the electrochemical test (Figure S9a). According to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry spectra, 13CH4 and 13CO were observed instead of CH4 and CO, confirming that the carbon in CH4 was originated from CO2. No other hydrocarbons (e.g., 13C2H4 and 13C2H6) or formic acid were observed; thus, no further separation for the product is required in the CO2RR catalyzed by Cu 4   II  -MFU-4l .\n\nBesides the electrocatalytic activity and selectivity, durability is also a crucial parameter for electrocatalysts. The durability test of Cu 4   II  -MFU-4l  was carried out by the continuous electroreduction of CO2 at -1.2 V (Figure S9b). Almost no current attenuation or FE decrease was observed after a 24 h evaluation. Furthermore, PXRD, SEM, and TEM patterns/images of Cu 4   II  -MFU-4l  showed negligible changes after CO2RR tests for 24 h (Figures S1, S10, and S11). Additionally, as the general methods for electrocatalyst characterization, in situ Cu K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), Fourier transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) results ( and S12), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra (Figure S10a,c) revealed no generation of Cu clusters or Cu-Cu bonds. Therefore, the electrochemical activity of Cu 4   II  -MFU-4l  should be attributed to the MOF rather than Cu clusters.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "Cu-based metal\u2013organic framework", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "[Cu4ZnCl4(btdd)3]"}}, {"etc": [{"property name": "Faradaic efficiency", "value": "92%/88%", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "partial current density", "value": "9.8/18.3", "unit": "mA cm^-2", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "TOF(CH4)", "value": "0.07 \u00b1 0.01/0.13 \u00b1 0.01", "unit": "s^-1", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "FE(CH4)", "value": "92%/88%", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "energy efficiency", "value": "81.0%", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "TOF(CO)", "value": "0.012", "unit": "s^-1", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "FE(CO)", "value": "17.0%", "unit": "", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["etc"]}, {"idx": 5, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Structures of (a) local coordination environments and metal transformation\nprocess and (b) Cu<sub arrange=\"stack\">\n<bold>4</bold>\n</sub>\n<sup arrange=\"stack\">\n<bold>II</bold>\n</sup>\n<bold>-MFU-4<italic toggle=\"yes\">l</italic>\n</bold> (3D channel surface highlighted in yellow).</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cs1c02980_0002.eps\" xlink:type=\"simple\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Structures of (a) local coordination environments and metal transformation process and (b) Cu 4   II  -MFU-4l  (3D channel surface highlighted in yellow).
