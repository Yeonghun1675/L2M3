The peak structure features a maximum at 3220 cm-1 and a number of shoulders, most pronounced at 3070 and 3540 cm-1, and a broad shoulder at ca. 3400 cm-1. Such broadness rules out chainlike crystalline water structures, which could be seen in, e.g., some minerals. The IR spectrum of 1 is also different from the one for bulk crystalline 3D ice, which contains a relatively sharp single peak at 3250 cm-1. The shoulder at 3070 cm-1, being absent in normal water or ice, apparently refers to the strong hydrogen-bond interactions involving H3O+ cations (e.g., H2O-H+\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5OH2 or H2O-H+\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O3SCF3 -), which must be rather numerous in 1. Indeed, any hydrogen bonding between a water molecule and some nucleophile (N) HO-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5N weakens and elongates the O-H covalent bond. Stronger hydrogen-bonding interactions exist to an even higher extent, shifting the corresponding IR peak to the lower wavenumber range.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 21, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig5\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>5</label>\n<caption>\n<p>FT-IR spectra of sample <bold>1</bold> recorded at different temperatures (black lines).

Typical impedance plots of <bold>2</bold> [see\nthe  (SI), Figure\nS1] feature a part of a semicircle at higher frequencies and a tail\nat low frequencies at room temperature, which deals with the mobile\nions being blocked by the electrode\u2013electrolyte interfaces.\nThe higher-frequency minimum/intercept along the <italic toggle=\"yes\">x</italic> axis of the impedance plots was used to calculate the bulk resistance\nof the samples. The temperature dependencies of the proton-conductivity\nvalues (log \u03c3 vs <italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic>\n<sup>\u20131</sup>) for\nboth heating and cooling regimes for <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> are shown in Figure . The shape of the conductivity curve of <bold>1</bold> in\nthe constant molar water atmosphere is almost flat with minor curvature\nand a maximum near 60 \u00b0C. The highest conductivity reaches 0.08\nS cm<sup>\u20131</sup> at 3.5 mol % water and 0.05 S cm<sup>\u20131</sup> at 0.6 mol % water in the atmosphere. The measured proton conductivity\nof <bold>1</bold> is as high as that of fully hydrated Nafion and, to our best knowledge, exceeds any other\nsolid proton electrolyte at such conditions. There is some discrepancy\nbetween the heating and cooling regimes of the measurements, related\nto the floating water content in the sample during the experiments.\nThe decrease of sample hydration by heating should affect the proton-conducting\nnetwork and decrease the proton conductivity. This is apparently negated\nby an increase of the proton-transfer kinetics at elevated temperatures;\ntherefore, the obtained flat temperature dependencies of the conductivities\nare reasonable. We should also note here that the temperature- and/or\nmoisture-dependent deviations of the water content of <bold>1</bold> do not change the conductivity values that much because the remaining\nacid and water guest molecules could maintain a proton-conducting\nnetwork for the facile proton transfer. The conductivity data measured\nat constant 50% RH are close to a linear function, increasing with\ntemperature (Figure ).</p><p>The proton conductivity and its moisture-dependent\nbehavior of sample <bold>2</bold> are quite different from those for\nsample <bold>1</bold>. The measured room temperature conductivity\nvalue for <bold>2</bold> at 3.5 mo % water is 1.8 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20135</sup>, and it increases up to 3 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20135</sup> S cm<sup>\u20131</sup> at 50 \u00b0C. Further heating leads to a conductivity\ndecrease to 8 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20136</sup> S cm<sup>\u20131</sup> at 66 \u00b0C. Significantly poorer values, compared to <bold>1</bold>, could be explained by the lower acid content, lower p<italic toggle=\"yes\">K</italic>\n<sub>a</sub> values, and, more importantly, lower water content.\nApparently, the limited total guest content in <bold>2</bold> (ca.\n12 TsOH and 23 H<sub>2</sub>O per MIL-101 nanocage) is not enough\nto support efficient proton transfer through the extended hydrogen-bonding\nnetwork. Moreover, the removal of a few more guest water molecules,\nwhich takes place at elevated temperature or lower humidity, should\nbreak down that network and severely hamper the proton mobility. As\na result, the observed curvature of the temperature dependence of\nthe proton conductivity of <bold>2</bold> (Figure ) is more pronounced, compared to <bold>1</bold>. Also, the\nmeasurements at 0.6 mol % water, revealed a dramatic, about 2.5\u20133\norders of magnitude, decrease of the proton conductivity values below\n10<sup>\u20137</sup> S cm<sup>\u20131</sup> at temperatures over\n100 \u00b0C. The poor proton conductivity of sample <bold>2</bold> is discouraging; however, materials with such a strong response\nto the hydration content may find interesting applications, e.g.,\nas a humidity sensor.</p><p>Compound <bold>1</bold> with TfOH displays much more attractive proton conductivity properties,\nso we decided to carry out the in-depth investigation of the proton\nmobility mechanism by <sup>1</sup>H NMR broad-line spectroscopy at\nlower temperatures between 180 and 290 K. The wide-line NMR spectra\nof <bold>1</bold>, resulting from magnetic proton\u2013proton and\nproton\u2013Cr<sup>3+</sup> interactions, consist of two different\nlines (Figure ). The intense narrow symmetric\nline at the spectrum center belongs to water and acidic protons for\nwhich all magnetic interactions are effectively suppressed because\nof fast (in the NMR time scale) proton migration including guest molecule\ndiffusion and an intermolecular proton exchange. A feeble wide asymmetric\nline was assigned to immobile proton pairs of terephthalate ions with\na H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H distance of ca. 2.5 \u00c5, located between\ntwo Cr<sup>3+</sup> ions with a mean H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cr<sup>3+</sup> separation of ca. 4.1 \u00c5 (see the , Scheme S1). From integral intensities of these lines, the number\nof mobile protons can be assessed as 48 \u00b1 5 per formula unit,\nmatching the chemical composition of <bold>1</bold>. The width of the narrow line decreases with the temperature\n(Figure ). In the \u201cfast-motion\u201d\nregion, the temperature dependence of the NMR line width \u03b4\u03c9\ncan be extrapolated by the equation \u03b4\u03c9 = \u03b4\u03c9<sub>0</sub> + <italic toggle=\"yes\">A</italic> exp(<italic toggle=\"yes\">E</italic>\n<sub>a</sub>/<italic toggle=\"yes\">kT</italic>), where \u03b4\u03c9<sub>0</sub> is a high-temperature\nlimit of \u03b4\u03c9 and <italic toggle=\"yes\">E</italic>\n<sub>a</sub> is the\nactivation energy of the proton mobility.

The observed \u03b4\u03c9(<italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic>) dependence is slightly shifted to higher temperatures;\nhowever, the calculated activation energy <italic toggle=\"yes\">E</italic>\n<sub>a</sub> = 0.27 eV is quite comparable.

On the other hand,\nthe similar dependencies of the NMR line widths upon temperature for\nboth <bold>1</bold> and acid-free MIL-101 imply considerable contribution\nof water diffusion to the complicated proton-transfer process. On\nthe basis of these observations, the following model of the proton-conducting\nmechanism inside the MIL-101 nanopores could be proposed that combines\nboth proton-transfer modes. The acid protons are believed to be captured\nwithin some spatially isolated water droplets where short-range proton\ntransfer may follow the relay mechanism. Long-range proton migration\nover all porous structures can become possible if short-range proton\nexchange is accompanied by a continuous rearrangement of the water\ndroplets in the nanopores due to water molecular diffusion.

We suppose that the proton-migration activation energy\nfor a mechanism of this kind might be basically the activation energy\nof water self-diffusion rather than the energy barrier for intradroplet\nGrotthuss-type proton translocation.</p><p>A further study of the structure\nof the proton-conducting network in <bold>1</bold> was carried out\nby FT-IR measurements in the temperature range of 5\u2013300 K (Figure ). First, we should mention that the IR peaks of <bold>1</bold> below 2000 cm<sup>\u20131</sup>, which mainly correspond\nto the chromium(III) oxoterephthalate framework, do not show any changes\nin the whole temperature range. On the contrary, the peaks of O\u2013H\nstretching vibrations undergo some temperature dependency. A typical\nroom temperature IR spectrum of a water-containing compound, such\nas <bold>1</bold>, shows broad and featureless peaks in the range\n3000\u20133700 cm<sup>\u20131</sup>. The very broad maximum of\nthe IR spectrum of <bold>1</bold> (3310 cm<sup>\u20131</sup>) at\n300 K is shifted to the lower wavenumber region by ca. 100 cm<sup>\u20131</sup>, compared to the liquid water. A similar shift is observed for supercooled water, where\nit is believed to be attributed to some preordering of the water molecules\nin a tetrahedral fashion, much like in a crystalline ice. This conclusion matches the PXRD data of <bold>1</bold>, viz., a\nbroad background peak (Figure ), indicating\nsome short-range ordering of the MIL-included species. The temperature\ndecrease below 200 K results in the appearance of a fine structure\nof distinct water molecules, depending on their local geometry as\nwell as the size, dimension, and chemical environment of the crystalline\nwater clusters. At 5 K, the FT-IR spectra of <bold>1</bold> revealed\na complicated peak pattern, centered at ca. 3300 cm<sup>\u20131</sup>. The peak structure features a maximum at 3220 cm<sup>\u20131</sup> and a number of shoulders, most pronounced at 3070 and 3540 cm<sup>\u20131</sup>, and a broad shoulder at ca. 3400 cm<sup>\u20131</sup>. Such broadness rules out chainlike crystalline water structures,\nwhich could be seen in, e.g., some minerals. The IR spectrum of <bold>1</bold> is also different from the one\nfor bulk crystalline 3D ice, which contains a relatively sharp single\npeak at 3250 cm<sup>\u20131</sup>. The shoulder\nat 3070 cm<sup>\u20131</sup>, being absent in normal water or ice,\napparently refers to the strong hydrogen-bond interactions involving\nH<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> cations (e.g., H<sub>2</sub>O\u2013H<sup>+</sup>\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7OH<sub>2</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>O\u2013H<sup>+</sup>\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O<sub>3</sub>SCF<sub>3</sub>\n<sup>\u2013</sup>), which must be rather numerous in <bold>1</bold>.

Stronger hydrogen-bonding interactions\nexist to an even higher extent, shifting the corresponding IR peak\nto the lower wavenumber range.</p>", "clean_text": "Strong toluenesulfonic and triflic acids were incorporated into a MIL-101 chromium(III) terephthalate coordination framework, producing hybrid proton-conducting solid electrolytes. These acid@MIL hybrid materials possess stable crystalline structures that do not deteriorate during multiple measurements or prolonged heating. Particularly, the triflic-containing compound demonstrates the highest 0.08 S cm-1 proton conductivity at 15% relative humidity and a temperature of 60 \u00b0C, exceeding any of today's commercial materials for proton-exchange membranes. The structure of the proton-conducting media, as well as the long-range proton-transfer mechanics, was unveiled, in a certain respect, by Fourier transform infrared and 1H NMR spectroscopy investigations. The acidic media presumably constitutes large separated droplets, coexisting in the MIL nanocages. One component of proton transfer appears to be related to the facile relay (Grotthuss) mechanism through extensive hydrogen-bonding interactions within such droplets. The second component occurs during continuous reorganization of the droplets, thus ensuring long-range proton transfer along the porous structure of the material.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nThe TfOH@MIL-101 (1) and TsOH@MIL-101 (2) proton-conducting hybrid compounds were prepared by soaking a MIL-101 crystalline powder in 4.12 M aqueous solutions of TfOH and 2.2 M toluenesulfonic acids, respectively. The PXRD patterns of 1 and 2 (Figure ) coincide with the one of starting MIL-101, proving the stability of the coordination host framework. A noticeable very broad maximum of the background of 1 could be attributed to the high amount of quasi-liquid (glassy) component in the MIL-101 pores. Elemental analysis and TGA further confirm the formation of hybrid host-guest materials with reasonable chemical composition. According to the data, the S/Cr ratio in 1 is 2.22, which is consistent with 6.7TfOH molecules per MIL-101 formula unit [Cr3O(bdc)3(H2O)3]+ or 76TfOH molecules per MIL nanocage. TGA data for 1 indicate the release of loosely bound water molecules (10% sample weight loss) in the 35-130 \u00b0C range, followed by a loss of acid at higher temperatures (the boiling point of CF3SO3H is 162 \u00b0C). According to the TGA/mass spectroscopy data, water is continuously releasing in the whole temperature range up to 250 \u00b0C. The integral water composition of sample 1 corresponds to ca. 18 water molecules per {Cr3O(bdc)3} unit. Therefore, the resulting formula of 1 could be written as [Cr3O(H2O)3(bdc)3]\u22c56.7TfOH\u22c515H2O.\n\nThe ac impedance measurements of 1 and 2 were carried out by a two-probe method using platinum-pressed electrodes in the temperature range from 25 to 65 \u00b0C in air at different humidity conditions: constant 0.6 mol % water (ca. 15% RH at room temperature), constant 3.5 mol % water (100% RH at room temperature), and at constant 50% RH, maintained during the experiments. Typical impedance plots of 2 [see the  (SI), Figure S1] feature a part of a semicircle at higher frequencies and a tail at low frequencies at room temperature, which deals with the mobile ions being blocked by the electrode-electrolyte interfaces. The higher-frequency minimum/intercept along the x axis of the impedance plots was used to calculate the bulk resistance of the samples. The temperature dependencies of the proton-conductivity values (log \u03c3 vs T -1) for both heating and cooling regimes for 1 and 2 are shown in Figure . The shape of the conductivity curve of 1 in the constant molar water atmosphere is almost flat with minor curvature and a maximum near 60 \u00b0C. The highest conductivity reaches 0.08 S cm-1 at 3.5 mol % water and 0.05 S cm-1 at 0.6 mol % water in the atmosphere. The measured proton conductivity of 1 is as high as that of fully hydrated Nafion and, to our best knowledge, exceeds any other solid proton electrolyte at such conditions. There is some discrepancy between the heating and cooling regimes of the measurements, related to the floating water content in the sample during the experiments. The decrease of sample hydration by heating should affect the proton-conducting network and decrease the proton conductivity. This is apparently negated by an increase of the proton-transfer kinetics at elevated temperatures; therefore, the obtained flat temperature dependencies of the conductivities are reasonable. We should also note here that the temperature- and/or moisture-dependent deviations of the water content of 1 do not change the conductivity values that much because the remaining acid and water guest molecules could maintain a proton-conducting network for the facile proton transfer. The conductivity data measured at constant 50% RH are close to a linear function, increasing with temperature (Figure ).\n\nThe proton conductivity and its moisture-dependent behavior of sample 2 are quite different from those for sample 1. The measured room temperature conductivity value for 2 at 3.5 mo % water is 1.8 \u00d7 10-5, and it increases up to 3 \u00d7 10-5 S cm-1 at 50 \u00b0C. Further heating leads to a conductivity decrease to 8 \u00d7 10-6 S cm-1 at 66 \u00b0C. Significantly poorer values, compared to 1, could be explained by the lower acid content, lower pK a values, and, more importantly, lower water content. Apparently, the limited total guest content in 2 (ca. 12 TsOH and 23 H2O per MIL-101 nanocage) is not enough to support efficient proton transfer through the extended hydrogen-bonding network. Moreover, the removal of a few more guest water molecules, which takes place at elevated temperature or lower humidity, should break down that network and severely hamper the proton mobility. As a result, the observed curvature of the temperature dependence of the proton conductivity of 2 (Figure ) is more pronounced, compared to 1. Also, the measurements at 0.6 mol % water, revealed a dramatic, about 2.5-3 orders of magnitude, decrease of the proton conductivity values below 10-7 S cm-1 at temperatures over 100 \u00b0C. The poor proton conductivity of sample 2 is discouraging; however, materials with such a strong response to the hydration content may find interesting applications, e.g., as a humidity sensor.\n\nCompound 1 with TfOH displays much more attractive proton conductivity properties, so we decided to carry out the in-depth investigation of the proton mobility mechanism by 1H NMR broad-line spectroscopy at lower temperatures between 180 and 290 K. The wide-line NMR spectra of 1, resulting from magnetic proton-proton and proton-Cr3+ interactions, consist of two different lines (Figure ). The intense narrow symmetric line at the spectrum center belongs to water and acidic protons for which all magnetic interactions are effectively suppressed because of fast (in the NMR time scale) proton migration including guest molecule diffusion and an intermolecular proton exchange. A feeble wide asymmetric line was assigned to immobile proton pairs of terephthalate ions with a H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5H distance of ca. 2.5 \u00c5, located between two Cr3+ ions with a mean H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cr3+ separation of ca. 4.1 \u00c5 (see the , Scheme S1). From integral intensities of these lines, the number of mobile protons can be assessed as 48 \u00b1 5 per formula unit, matching the chemical composition of 1. The width of the narrow line decreases with the temperature (Figure ). In the \"fast-motion\" region, the temperature dependence of the NMR line width \u03b4\u03c9 can be extrapolated by the equation \u03b4\u03c9 = \u03b4\u03c90 + A exp(E a/kT), where \u03b4\u03c90 is a high-temperature limit of \u03b4\u03c9 and E a is the activation energy of the proton mobility. The obtained experimental data correspond to E a = 0.25 eV and coincide with the values, estimated from the proton-conductivity measurements of 1 at ambient humidity. For reference, similar NMR measurements were conducted for an acid-free MIL-101 compound (Figure ). The observed \u03b4\u03c9(T) dependence is slightly shifted to higher temperatures; however, the calculated activation energy E a = 0.27 eV is quite comparable. As was mentioned already, such E a values are close to those of the relay mechanism, which involves proton transfer between adjacent guest species (H2O, H3O+, and TfO-) and their simultaneous conformational rotations. On the other hand, the similar dependencies of the NMR line widths upon temperature for both 1 and acid-free MIL-101 imply considerable contribution of water diffusion to the complicated proton-transfer process. On the basis of these observations, the following model of the proton-conducting mechanism inside the MIL-101 nanopores could be proposed that combines both proton-transfer modes. The acid protons are believed to be captured within some spatially isolated water droplets where short-range proton transfer may follow the relay mechanism. Long-range proton migration over all porous structures can become possible if short-range proton exchange is accompanied by a continuous rearrangement of the water droplets in the nanopores due to water molecular diffusion. A similar mechanism was recently considered for proton migration in oxygen-protonated ensembles in the channels of H[Lu(H2O)6{Re4Te4(CN)12}]\u22c5nH2O (E a = 0.17 eV). We suppose that the proton-migration activation energy for a mechanism of this kind might be basically the activation energy of water self-diffusion rather than the energy barrier for intradroplet Grotthuss-type proton translocation.\n\nA further study of the structure of the proton-conducting network in 1 was carried out by FT-IR measurements in the temperature range of 5-300 K (Figure ). First, we should mention that the IR peaks of 1 below 2000 cm-1, which mainly correspond to the chromium(III) oxoterephthalate framework, do not show any changes in the whole temperature range. On the contrary, the peaks of O-H stretching vibrations undergo some temperature dependency. A typical room temperature IR spectrum of a water-containing compound, such as 1, shows broad and featureless peaks in the range 3000-3700 cm-1. The very broad maximum of the IR spectrum of 1 (3310 cm-1) at 300 K is shifted to the lower wavenumber region by ca. 100 cm-1, compared to the liquid water. A similar shift is observed for supercooled water, where it is believed to be attributed to some preordering of the water molecules in a tetrahedral fashion, much like in a crystalline ice. This conclusion matches the PXRD data of 1, viz., a broad background peak (Figure ), indicating some short-range ordering of the MIL-included species. The temperature decrease below 200 K results in the appearance of a fine structure of distinct water molecules, depending on their local geometry as well as the size, dimension, and chemical environment of the crystalline water clusters. At 5 K, the FT-IR spectra of 1 revealed a complicated peak pattern, centered at ca. 3300 cm-1. The peak structure features a maximum at 3220 cm-1 and a number of shoulders, most pronounced at 3070 and 3540 cm-1, and a broad shoulder at ca. 3400 cm-1. Such broadness rules out chainlike crystalline water structures, which could be seen in, e.g., some minerals. The IR spectrum of 1 is also different from the one for bulk crystalline 3D ice, which contains a relatively sharp single peak at 3250 cm-1. The shoulder at 3070 cm-1, being absent in normal water or ice, apparently refers to the strong hydrogen-bond interactions involving H3O+ cations (e.g., H2O-H+\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5OH2 or H2O-H+\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O3SCF3 -), which must be rather numerous in 1. Indeed, any hydrogen bonding between a water molecule and some nucleophile (N) HO-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5N weakens and elongates the O-H covalent bond. Stronger hydrogen-bonding interactions exist to an even higher extent, shifting the corresponding IR peak to the lower wavenumber range.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "MIL-101", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "proton conductivity", "value": "0.08", "unit": "S cm^-1", "condition": "15% relative humidity, 60 \u00b0C"}, {"property name": "proton conductivity", "value": "0.05", "unit": "S cm^-1", "condition": "0.6 mol % water"}, {"property name": "proton conductivity", "value": "1.8 \u00d7 10^-5", "unit": "S cm^-1", "condition": "3.5 mol % water, room temperature"}, {"property name": "proton conductivity", "value": "3 \u00d7 10^-5", "unit": "S cm^-1", "condition": "50 \u00b0C"}, {"property name": "proton conductivity", "value": "8 \u00d7 10^-6", "unit": "S cm^-1", "condition": "66 \u00b0C"}, {"property name": "proton conductivity", "value": "<10^-7", "unit": "S cm^-1", "condition": "temperatures over 100 \u00b0C"}, {"property name": "activation energy", "value": "0.25", "unit": "eV", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "activation energy", "value": "0.27", "unit": "eV", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["etc"]}, {"idx": 23, "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary,\nwe demonstrate here that the inclusion of a strong acid, such as TfOH,\nin the MIL-101 nanopores leads to a solid material with a proton-conductivity\nvalue at ambient conditions of 0.08 S cm<sup>\u20131</sup>, similar\nto that of fully hydrated Nafion.
