In contrast, Fe2O3/N-C shows a small particle size of around 200 nm (a), a high BET surface area (267.6 m2/g) (Table S1), and a mesoporous structure (average pore diameter 7.08 nm) (Figure S2a).

In the Fe2O3/N-C system, BPA removal within 120 min increased from 86.4% at an applied potential of -0.14 V to 100% at -0.34 V (Figure S10b) due to increased Fe(II) regeneration. However, further lowering the potential to -0.54 V decreased the BPA removal to 49.1%, likely due to the suppressed H2O2 production (Figure S11a) by competitive reactions such as H2 evolution and one-electron and/or four-electron ORR. Notably, at cathode potential of -0.34 V, the heterogeneous EF system showed a current density of only 1.0 mA/cm2, much lower than those in previous heterogeneous EF systems ().\n\nFe Leaching and Catalyst Stability\n\nThe used Fe2O3/N-C electrode (b) showed similar morphology and structure as the pristine one (a). According to the EDS analysis and Fe content assay, the Fe content in the catalyst decreased only slightly after the reaction (c,d, S12). Consistently, Fe leaching from the catalysts was very slow, and the Fe ion concentration in the solution reached only 0.52 mg/L after 120 min of reaction (a). The Fe leaching ratio (relative to the Fe content in the catalyst) was only 0.42%, less than those in other heterogeneous EF systems (0.75-5.37% of total metal ion leaching) (). Such low leaching of Fe may be associated with the well-confined nanoparticles in the carbon matrix and a high content of surface -OH groups that bind strongly with the dissolved Fe2+.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": [{"type": "", "probe": "", "value": "267.6", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["surface_area"]}, {"idx": 31, "type": "table", "classification": ["Property"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Summary of Recent Studies on the Heterogeneous\nEF Catalysts</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"6\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col6\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">catalysts/cathodes</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">pollutant</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">current density (mA/cm<sup>2</sup>)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">degradation rate constant\n(h<sup>\u20131</sup>)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">leached ratio\nof metallic ion</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">refs</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/N\u2013C</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>BPA</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.0</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.44</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.42% Fe (after 2 h)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>this study</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>CoFe-LDH/CF</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>AO7</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>4.2</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>5.46</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref9\" specific-use=\"ref-style=base-text\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>FeCuC aerogel</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>methylene blue</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>5.0</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>6.90<xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"t1fn1\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref13\" specific-use=\"ref-style=base-text\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>Fe<sup>II</sup>Fe<sup>III</sup>LDH/CF</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>sulfamethoxazole</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>7.5</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>7.52<xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"t1fn1\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>5.37% Fe (after 8 h)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref10\" specific-use=\"ref-style=base-text\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>FeCuC</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>dimethyl phthalate</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>15.0</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.54<xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"t1fn1\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.75% Cu 0.08%\nFe (after 1 h)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref49\" specific-use=\"ref-style=base-text\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n<table-wrap-foot>\n<fn id=\"t1fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>Degradation rate constant was calculated\naccording to the data in the reference.</p>\n</fn>\n</table-wrap-foot>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "Table 1.
