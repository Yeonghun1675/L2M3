Permanent porosity of activated Cu-CPAH was identified by means of N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K (0-1 atm) with reversible type-I isotherm characteristics. Langmuir and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas were 1430 and 880 m2 g-1, respectively.

Non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) using N2 at 77 K reveals that a narrow pore size distribution (6-9 \u00c5) was evident in Cu-CPAH (a).\n\nBy virtue of the unique cage structure and various functional groups in the framework, we first investigated the selective C2H2 adsorption performance of Cu-CPAH in comparison to those of CO2 and CH4 at 273 and 298 K (0-1 atm), respectively. Results display that the respective uptake capacity of Cu-CPAH with respect to C2H2 and CO2 is 171.7 and 139.5 at 1 atm and 273 K (c), while it turned into 131.8 and 88.1 at 1 atm and 298 K (d).

The uptake regarding CH4 is only 48.9 and 28.7 cm3 g-1 at 273 and 298 K, respectively. To evaluate the affinity of Cu-CPAH for C2H2, CO2, and CH4, isosteric heats (Q st) of Cu-CPAH were calculated using the virial method, which was well-established on the basis of their adsorption isotherms at 273 and 298 K (b). The low coverage Q st value of C2H2, CO2, and CH4 adsorption in Cu-CPAH is 35.4, 31.5, and 20.2 kJ mol-1, respectively. The adsorption enthalpy for C2H2 is greater than those for CO2 and CH4, confirming the stronger van der Waals host-guest interactions.\n\nBreakthrough Separation\n\nTo evaluate the feasibility of Cu-CPAH as a solid adsorbent for selective C2H2 storage and purification under real-world situations, dynamic breakthrough experiments were measured, in which an equal proportion of CO2/C2H2 or CH4/CO2/C2H2 was passed through a adsorption bed of the activated sample with a mixed flow rate of 0.5 mL/min at 298 K. For the two-component experiments, CO2 was detected at about 25.4 min after gas mixture was injected through the column, whereas no C2H2 was detected until a breakthrough time of 98.2 min (a). The dynamic C2H2 adsorption capacity based on breakthrough time is 131 cm3 g-1, which is close to the single-component gas adsorption capacity measured at 298 K. In contrast, the CO2 adsorption capacity is only 33 cm3 g-1. The differences between adsorbed amounts of two gases further demonstrate that stronger interactions took place between C2H2 and the MOF skeleton. On the basis of the adsorbed quantity, the separation factor of equimolar C2H2/CO2 was determined as 3.96, which agrees with the IAST-predicted results. The encouraging dynamic C2H2 adsorption capacity and large breakthrough time gap (73 min) between CO2 and C2H2 demonstrate satisfactory C2H2/CO2 separation performance in the MOFs.
