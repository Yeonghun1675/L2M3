However,\nthe lack of suitable cathodes with high-capacity, long-cycling, and\nhigh-rate capability limits their practical application. Herein, we\npresent a highly crystalline one-dimensional \u03c0\u2013d conjugated\nconductive metal\u2013organic framework by coordinating ultrasmall\n1,2,4,5-benzenetetramine (BTA) linkers with copper ions (Cu-BTA-H),\nas a cathode for ZIBs.

Meanwhile, the abundant porosity,\nsmall band gap, high crystallinity, and stable coordination structure\nof Cu-BTA-H endow it with fast ion/electron transport and effectively\nhinder the dissolution of organic ligands during cycling, respectively.\nConsequently, Cu-BTA-H possesses a high reversible capacity of 330\nmAh g<sup>\u20131</sup> at 200 mA g<sup>\u20131</sup> and excellent\nrate performance and long-cycle stability, with a high capacity of\n106.1 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup> at 2.0 A g<sup>\u20131</sup> after\n500 cycles and a high Coulombic efficiency of \u223c100%. The proposed\nconductive MOFs with dual redox-active sites provide an efficient\napproach for constructing fast, stable, and high-capacity energy storage\ndevices.</p><p>Regarding this, we herein report a Cu-based c-MOF that is composed\nof ultrasmall 1,2,4,5-benzenetetramine (BTA) ligands and coordinated\ncopper ions as the cathode for aqueous ZIBs. The adoption of the small\nmolecule BTA effectively maximizes the portion of redox-active species\n(i.e., \u2212C\ue5fbN\u2212) and minimizes the inactive contents\n(i.e., the benzene group) in the c-MOFs. Meanwhile, the secondary\nredox of the transition-metal ions (Cu<sup>2+</sup>/Cu<sup>+</sup>) synergistically contributes to an additional capacity for Zn storage.\nThus, a high reversible capacity of 330 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup> at\n200 mA g<sup>\u20131</sup> has been achieved for Cu-BTA. In addition,\nthe unique porous structure, high electronic conductivity, and stable\ncoordination structure of Cu-BTA with high crystallinity collaboratively\ncontribute to both a high-rate capability and excellent cycling stability,\nshowing a high capacity of 106.1 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup> at 2.0\nA g<sup>\u20131</sup> after 500 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency\nof \u223c100%. The design of c-MOF-based cathodes with dual 0active\nsites can thus effectively enhance the energy density and durability\nof ZIBs.</p><p>The crystal structure of the materials was first\ninvestigated by\nan X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. As shown in c, all of the XRD patterns\nare well consistent with previously reported BTA-based c-MOFs with\nthree prominent peaks at 2\u03b8 = 20.6, 23.9, and 29.3\u00b0, confirming the successful formation of Ni-BTA-H and Cu-BTA-H/L.\nAnd the higher diffraction intensities for Ni-BTA-H and Cu-BTA-H indicate\ntheir improved crystallinity, compared with Cu-BTA-L, which is helpful\nfor achieving the improved electronic conductivity and structural\nstability for BTA-based c-MOFs. Correspondingly, Cu-BTA-H shows an\naggregated structure with a particle size of 50\u2013100 nm benefiting\nfrom the long-range and ordered growth, while Cu-BTA-L generally shows\na smaller globular or sheet-like structure with a size of 20\u201340\nnm. Meanwhile, Ni-BTA-H possesses a rod-like structure with a diameter\nof \u223c10 nm, but with a length of over 100 nm (d\u2013f and <ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.2c11974/suppl_file/nn2c11974_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S1</ext-link>). The rod-like structure for Ni-BTA-H\nmay be induced by the stronger \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 intermolecular\ninteraction owing to the different numbers of d-orbital electrons\nfor Cu (d<sup>9</sup>) and Ni (d<sup>8</sup>), leading to the more\nordered \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking than in Cu-BTA in the long\nrange. In addition, the corresponding N<sub>2</sub> adsorption\u2013desorption results indicate the existence of mesopores\naround 7.0 and 9.0 nm, possibly formed by the stacking of nanoparticles\nor -rods in the material, as well as specific surface areas of 25.2\nand 71.2 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> for Cu-BTA-H and Ni-BTA-H,\nrespectively (<ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.2c11974/suppl_file/nn2c11974_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S2</ext-link>). These nanosized\nparticles and mesopores would facilitate the ion diffusion inside\nthe materials.</p><p>Before the electrochemical performance\ntest, the hydrophobicity\nof the Cu-BTA-H electrode was first characterized. As shown in <ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.2c11974/suppl_file/nn2c11974_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S7</ext-link>, the Cu-BTA-H electrode shows a water\ncontact angle of 121\u00b0, indicating its good hydrophobicity, potentially\nfavorable for hindering the dissolution of ligands into aqueous electrolytes\nand enhancing its cycling performance. Subsequently, the cyclic voltammograms\n(CV) in the range of 0.3\u20131.6 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s<sup>\u20131</sup> of Cu-BTA-H and its analogues were studied. Interestingly,\nthe CV loops of Cu-BTA-H show two cathodic peaks centered at \u223c0.81\nand \u223c0.66 V (a), in which that at \u223c0.81 V may be related to the\nreduction of Cu<sup>2+</sup> to Cu<sup>+</sup> and the other at \u223c0.66\nV should correspond to the transformation of \u2212C\ue5fbN to\n\u2212C\u2013N bonds upon Zn<sup>2+</sup> insertion. Meanwhile, the two anodic peaks in the broad\nrange of \u223c0.93 and \u223c1.00 V correspond to the oxidation\nof \u2212C\u2013N to \u2212C\ue5fbN and Cu<sup>+</sup> to\nCu<sup>2+</sup>. In the CV loop of Ni-BTA-H, however, there is only\none cathodic peak centered at \u223c0.73 V and one anodic peak at\n\u223c0.96 V, corresponding to the reduction and oxidation between\n\u2212C\ue5fbN and \u2212C\u2013N species upon the intercalation/extraction\nof Zn<sup>2+</sup> (b). The different reduction voltage for \u2212C\ue5fbN\nin Ni-BTA and Cu-BTA analogues may be related to the coordinated metal\nions. Similarly, there are two pairs of voltage platforms located\nat \u223c0.80/1.06 and \u223c0.65/0.9 V of Cu-BTA-H/L, and one\npair of discharge plateaus at \u223c0.73/0.95 V for Ni-BTA-H in\nthe discharging/charging process (c and <ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.2c11974/suppl_file/nn2c11974_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S8a</ext-link>), which further confirm the dual-mechanism Zn<sup>2+</sup> storage\nfeature for Cu-BTA-H/L and the single Zn<sup>2+</sup> storage mechanism\nfor Ni-BTA-H.</p><p>Benefiting from the dual-mechanism Zn<sup>2+</sup> storage capability,\nboth Cu-BTA-H and Cu-BTA-L show higher reversible capacities than\nNi-BTA-H at different current densities.

Of note, the low capacity\nof Ni-BTA-H is attributed to its intrinsic single-type Zn<sup>2+</sup> storage mechanism, while the poorer rate performance and lowest\nreversible capacity after long cycling of Cu-BTA-L should be induced\nby the low electronic conductivity and the dissolution of BTA linkers\ninto the electrolytes during repeated discharging/charging processes,\nbecause of its low crystallinity. Correspondingly, Cu-BTA-H and Ni-BTA-H\nwith high crystallinity show higher capacity retentions of 68.5% and\n84.5%, respectively, than that of Cu-BTA-L (only 51.2%) after 500\ncycles at 2.0 A g<sup>\u20131</sup> (e). Of note, the redox of Cu-ions and BTA\nligands occurring simultaneously inevitably leads to a poorer stability\nthan that of  only via the single redox of BTA ligands, but a largely\nenhanced crystallinity, even a single-crystal feature of c-MOFs, as well the adoption of modified separators would effectively solve this problem to achieve\nlong-cycling and dual-active c-MOFs based cathodes.</p><p>Furthermore,\nthe kinetics of the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion/electron transport\nin the Cu-BTA-H/L and Ni-BTA-H cathodes were also tested via electrochemical\nimpedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic intermittent titration\ntechnique (GITT) analyses, which indicated the faster ion/electron\ntransport ability for both Cu-BTA-H and Ni-BTA-H, compared with Cu-BTA-L.\nSpecifically, all of the materials\u2019 Nyquist plots are composed\nof three parts: two semicircle parts in the high- and medium-frequency\nregions followed by an inclined line in the low-frequency region,\ncorresponding to the interfacial impedance between the cathodes and\nthe collector, charge-transfer impedance, and ion-diffusion impedance\nin the cathodes, respectively. The smaller diameters of the semicircles\nfor Cu-BTA-H and Ni-BTA-H in the medium-frequency region indicate\nthe lower charge-transfer resistance than that of Cu-BTA-L (<ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.2c11974/suppl_file/nn2c11974_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S9</ext-link>), which is induced by the intrinsic\nhigh electronic conductivity of the Cu/Ni-BTA-H framework due to the\nhigh crystallinity. Interestingly, the larger particle\nsize for Cu-BTA-H does not hinder the ion diffusion properties, and\nboth Cu-BTA-H and Ni-BTA-H show larger slopes for the inclined line\nin the low-frequency region than that of Cu-BTA-L, indicating their\nfaster Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion diffusion rate.

Obviously,\nthe sites with more negative MESP are attractive for the uptake of\ncarriers. Thus, the nitrogen atoms in both Cu-BTA\nand Ni-BTA with a negative MESP are highly active for Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion uptake. Then, the theoretical capacities of Cu-BTA/Ni-BTA were\nfurther assessed by calculating the sequential binding energy (\u0394<italic toggle=\"yes\">E</italic>) before and after the intercalation of different amounts\nof Zn ions (d), and the most stable structures with the acceptance of different\nnumbers of Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions are shown in e and <ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.2c11974/suppl_file/nn2c11974_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figures S15 and 16</ext-link>.

Consequently, Cu-BTA-H possesses a high reversible capacity of 330 mAh g-1 at 200 mA g-1 and excellent rate performance and long-cycle stability, with a high capacity of 106.1 mAh g-1 at 2.0 A g-1 after 500 cycles and a high Coulombic efficiency of ~100%. The proposed conductive MOFs with dual redox-active sites provide an efficient approach for constructing fast, stable, and high-capacity energy storage devices.\n\nRegarding this, we herein report a Cu-based c-MOF that is composed of ultrasmall 1,2,4,5-benzenetetramine (BTA) ligands and coordinated copper ions as the cathode for aqueous ZIBs. The adoption of the small molecule BTA effectively maximizes the portion of redox-active species (i.e., -C\ue5fbN-) and minimizes the inactive contents (i.e., the benzene group) in the c-MOFs. Meanwhile, the secondary redox of the transition-metal ions (Cu2+/Cu+) synergistically contributes to an additional capacity for Zn storage. Thus, a high reversible capacity of 330 mAh g-1 at 200 mA g-1 has been achieved for Cu-BTA. In addition, the unique porous structure, high electronic conductivity, and stable coordination structure of Cu-BTA with high crystallinity collaboratively contribute to both a high-rate capability and excellent cycling stability, showing a high capacity of 106.1 mAh g-1 at 2.0 A g-1 after 500 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of ~100%. The design of c-MOF-based cathodes with dual 0active sites can thus effectively enhance the energy density and durability of ZIBs.\n\nThe crystal structure of the materials was first investigated by an X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. As shown in c, all of the XRD patterns are well consistent with previously reported BTA-based c-MOFs with three prominent peaks at 2\u03b8 = 20.6, 23.9, and 29.3\u00b0, confirming the successful formation of Ni-BTA-H and Cu-BTA-H/L. And the higher diffraction intensities for Ni-BTA-H and Cu-BTA-H indicate their improved crystallinity, compared with Cu-BTA-L, which is helpful for achieving the improved electronic conductivity and structural stability for BTA-based c-MOFs. Correspondingly, Cu-BTA-H shows an aggregated structure with a particle size of 50-100 nm benefiting from the long-range and ordered growth, while Cu-BTA-L generally shows a smaller globular or sheet-like structure with a size of 20-40 nm. Meanwhile, Ni-BTA-H possesses a rod-like structure with a diameter of ~10 nm, but with a length of over 100 nm (d-f and Figure S1). The rod-like structure for Ni-BTA-H may be induced by the stronger \u03c0-\u03c0 intermolecular interaction owing to the different numbers of d-orbital electrons for Cu (d9) and Ni (d8), leading to the more ordered \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking than in Cu-BTA in the long range. In addition, the corresponding N2 adsorption-desorption results indicate the existence of mesopores around 7.0 and 9.0 nm, possibly formed by the stacking of nanoparticles or -rods in the material, as well as specific surface areas of 25.2 and 71.2 m2 g-1 for Cu-BTA-H and Ni-BTA-H, respectively (Figure S2). These nanosized particles and mesopores would facilitate the ion diffusion inside the materials.\n\nBefore the electrochemical performance test, the hydrophobicity of the Cu-BTA-H electrode was first characterized. As shown in Figure S7, the Cu-BTA-H electrode shows a water contact angle of 121\u00b0, indicating its good hydrophobicity, potentially favorable for hindering the dissolution of ligands into aqueous electrolytes and enhancing its cycling performance. Subsequently, the cyclic voltammograms (CV) in the range of 0.3-1.6 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s-1 of Cu-BTA-H and its analogues were studied. Interestingly, the CV loops of Cu-BTA-H show two cathodic peaks centered at ~0.81 and ~0.66 V (a), in which that at ~0.81 V may be related to the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+ and the other at ~0.66 V should correspond to the transformation of -C\ue5fbN to -C-N bonds upon Zn2+ insertion. Meanwhile, the two anodic peaks in the broad range of ~0.93 and ~1.00 V correspond to the oxidation of -C-N to -C\ue5fbN and Cu+ to Cu2+. In the CV loop of Ni-BTA-H, however, there is only one cathodic peak centered at ~0.73 V and one anodic peak at ~0.96 V, corresponding to the reduction and oxidation between -C\ue5fbN and -C-N species upon the intercalation/extraction of Zn2+ (b). The different reduction voltage for -C\ue5fbN in Ni-BTA and Cu-BTA analogues may be related to the coordinated metal ions. Similarly, there are two pairs of voltage platforms located at ~0.80/1.06 and ~0.65/0.9 V of Cu-BTA-H/L, and one pair of discharge plateaus at ~0.73/0.95 V for Ni-BTA-H in the discharging/charging process (c and Figure S8a), which further confirm the dual-mechanism Zn2+ storage feature for Cu-BTA-H/L and the single Zn2+ storage mechanism for Ni-BTA-H.\n\nBenefiting from the dual-mechanism Zn2+ storage capability, both Cu-BTA-H and Cu-BTA-L show higher reversible capacities than Ni-BTA-H at different current densities. As shown in d and Figure S8b-d, Cu-BTA-H shows the highest reversible capacities of 330, 200, 180, 160, and 125 mAh g-1 at current densities of 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 A g-1, respectively, while Ni-BTA-H possesses the lowest capacities of 200, 120, 105, 95, and 80 mAh g-1 at these current densities. After being tested for 500 cycles at 2.0 A g-1, a high capacity of 106.1 mAh g-1 can still be achieved on Cu-BTA-H, much higher than those of Cu-BTA-L (77 mAh g-1) and Ni-BTA-H (78 mAh g-1). Of note, the low capacity of Ni-BTA-H is attributed to its intrinsic single-type Zn2+ storage mechanism, while the poorer rate performance and lowest reversible capacity after long cycling of Cu-BTA-L should be induced by the low electronic conductivity and the dissolution of BTA linkers into the electrolytes during repeated discharging/charging processes, because of its low crystallinity. Correspondingly, Cu-BTA-H and Ni-BTA-H with high crystallinity show higher capacity retentions of 68.5% and 84.5%, respectively, than that of Cu-BTA-L (only 51.2%) after 500 cycles at 2.0 A g-1 (e). Of note, the redox of Cu-ions and BTA ligands occurring simultaneously inevitably leads to a poorer stability than that of  only via the single redox of BTA ligands, but a largely enhanced crystallinity, even a single-crystal feature of c-MOFs, as well the adoption of modified separators would effectively solve this problem to achieve long-cycling and dual-active c-MOFs based cathodes.\n\nFurthermore, the kinetics of the Zn2+ ion/electron transport in the Cu-BTA-H/L and Ni-BTA-H cathodes were also tested via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) analyses, which indicated the faster ion/electron transport ability for both Cu-BTA-H and Ni-BTA-H, compared with Cu-BTA-L. Specifically, all of the materials' Nyquist plots are composed of three parts: two semicircle parts in the high- and medium-frequency regions followed by an inclined line in the low-frequency region, corresponding to the interfacial impedance between the cathodes and the collector, charge-transfer impedance, and ion-diffusion impedance in the cathodes, respectively. The smaller diameters of the semicircles for Cu-BTA-H and Ni-BTA-H in the medium-frequency region indicate the lower charge-transfer resistance than that of Cu-BTA-L (Figure S9), which is induced by the intrinsic high electronic conductivity of the Cu/Ni-BTA-H framework due to the high crystallinity. Interestingly, the larger particle size for Cu-BTA-H does not hinder the ion diffusion properties, and both Cu-BTA-H and Ni-BTA-H show larger slopes for the inclined line in the low-frequency region than that of Cu-BTA-L, indicating their faster Zn2+ ion diffusion rate. A similar result can also be concluded from the lower W 0-R value (500 \u03a9 vs 560 and 739 \u03a9), larger \u03b4 value (20.7 vs 15.7 and 12.7) from the fitted EIS results and faster ion-diffusion coefficient (~10-10 cm2 s-1 for Ni-BTA-H and ~10-10 cm2 s-1 for Cu-BTA-H vs 10-11 cm2 s-1 for Cu-BTA-L) from the GITT analysis (Figure S10 and Table S1).\n\nSubsequently, the molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) distribution of Cu-BTA/Ni-BTA, using Cu2-BTA and Ni2-BTA molecules as models, was calculated to identify the possible active sites for Zn storage (c). As shown, the red region represents the positive MESP value (i.e., the nucleophilic center) and the blue region stands for the negative MESP value (i.e., the electrophilic center). Obviously, the sites with more negative MESP are attractive for the uptake of carriers. Thus, the nitrogen atoms in both Cu-BTA and Ni-BTA with a negative MESP are highly active for Zn2+ ion uptake. Then, the theoretical capacities of Cu-BTA/Ni-BTA were further assessed by calculating the sequential binding energy (\u0394E) before and after the intercalation of different amounts of Zn ions (d), and the most stable structures with the acceptance of different numbers of Zn2+ ions are shown in e and Figures S15 and 16. Specifically, negative \u0394E values of up to 3 mean that the Cu-BTA polymeric chains with two repeating units (Cu2-BTA molecules) can accept up to 3 Zn2+ ions, while Ni-BTA with two repeating units (Ni2-BTA molecules) can only accept up to 2 Zn2+ ions (d,e). Thus, the theoretical capacities of Cu-BTA/Ni-BTA are calculated to be ~301 and ~200 mAh g-1, respectively, which are well consistent with the experimental results. And the calculated structural evolution and protonation pathway at the discharging process for Cu-BTA and Ni-BTA are shown in f and Figure S17, respectively.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "Cu-BTA-H", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "crystallinity", "value": "high", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "porosity", "value": "abundant", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "band gap", "value": "small", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "coordination structure", "value": "stable", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "particle size", "value": "50-100 nm", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "specific surface area", "value": "25.2 m2/g", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "reversible capacity", "value": "330 mAh/g", "unit": "", "condition": "at 200 mA/g"}, {"property name": "rate performance", "value": "excellent", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "long-cycle stability", "value": "high", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "Coulombic efficiency", "value": "\u223c100%", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "hydrophobicity", "value": "good", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "charge-transfer resistance", "value": "lower", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "ion-diffusion rate", "value": "faster", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "ion-diffusion coefficient", "value": "\u223c10^-10 cm2/s", "unit": "", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["etc"]}, {"idx": "25, 26", "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<p>To confirm this, an open cell with a sufficient\nO<sub>2</sub> supply\nwas assembled.
