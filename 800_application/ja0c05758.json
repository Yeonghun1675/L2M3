As shown in a, typical type IV sorption isotherms were obtained for all three MOFs with N2 adsorption decreasing after linker installation, indicative of the mesoporosity of these materials. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) apparent surface areas for PCN-808, PCN-808-BPDC, and PCN-808-BDBR calculated from the N2 adsorption data are 2384, 2441, and 1894 m2 g-1, respectively. The pore size distribution of PCN-808 and its derivatives were also analyzed by NLDFT methods based on the N2 sorption data, showing two main pores in PCN-808 series MOFs (i.e., micropores of approximately 1.2 nm and mesopores of approximately 2.5-3 nm, ).", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "2384", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}, {"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "2441", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}, {"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "1894", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["surface_area"]}, {"idx": 14, "type": "table", "classification": ["Property"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Aza-Henry Reactions Catalyzed by PCN-808-BDBR</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic content-type=\"header\" id=\"gr4\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ja0c05758_0004.tif\"></graphic>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"4\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\"></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\" nameend=\"col4\" namest=\"col2\" rowsep=\"1\">photocatalyst/conversion (%)<xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"t1fn2\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">substrate<xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"t1fn1\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">PCN-808</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">PCN-808-BDBR</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>1a</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>99</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>27</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>&gt;99</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>1b</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>&gt;99</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>33</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>94</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>1c</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>&gt;99</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>18</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>99</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n<table-wrap-foot>\n<fn id=\"t1fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>For the substrate and the product,\n1a, 2a, R = H; 1b, 2b, R = Br; 1c, 2c, R = OCH<sub>3</sub>.</p>\n</fn>\n<fn id=\"t1fn2\">\n<label>b</label>\n<p>Conversion yields were determined\nby <sup>1</sup>H NMR of the crude product.</p>\n</fn>\n</table-wrap-foot>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "Table 1.
