The catalytic reaction\nwas performed under an oxygen atmosphere and 25 \u00b0C, and experimental\nresults are listed in . With the increase of time, the conversion of benzylamine\nalso increases.

In\nsimilar experimental conditions, conversions of benzylamine derivatives\nwith \u2212CH<sub>3</sub>, \u2212OCH<sub>3</sub>, and \u2212Cl\nafter 6 h are 65.5, 51.2, and 63.1%, respectively (entry 5\u20137\nin ). No other\nproducts except imines were detected, and the selectivity of their\nrespective imines can be determined to be &gt;99%. TOF values of the\nthree reactions are 3275, 2560, and 3155 \u03bcmol\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup>\u00b7h<sup>\u20131</sup>, suggesting that <bold>HNU-64</bold> has\na good catalytic effect on benzylamine derivatives. The conversion\nof Cl-, OCH<sub>3</sub>-, and CH<sub>3</sub>-substituted benzylamines\ndecreased significantly, indicating that the effect of electron donor\ngroups (OCH<sub>3</sub> and CH<sub>3</sub>) and electron-drawing group\n(Cl) will not improve the conversion. Combined with these results,\nit can be found that the conversions are reduced when the para-position\nhydrogen of benzylamine substitutes for larger groups such as \u2212CH<sub>3</sub>, \u2212OCH<sub>3</sub>, and \u2212Cl, which is attributed\nto the steric hindrance of a larger substituent affecting the entry\nof amine molecules through the channels of <bold>HNU-64</bold> instead\nof electronic effect of substituent groups. In addition, the catalytic\nperformances of <bold>HNU-64-CH<sub>3</sub>\n</bold> and <bold>HNU-64-Cl</bold> for photocatalytic oxidation were also studied. As shown in , <bold>HNU-64-CH<sub>3</sub>\n</bold> and <bold>HNU-64-Cl</bold> can also catalyze the coupling\nof benzylamine oxidation under similar mild conditions. After 7 hours,\nTOF values are 3921 and 3887 \u03bcmol\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup>\u00b7h<sup>\u20131</sup>, and the reaction selectivity is more\nthan 99%. Therefore, the three isostructural uranyl MOFs have good\nphotocatalytic performance in the oxidation of benzylamine. The lower\nconversion and TOF values of <bold>HNU-64-CH<sub>3</sub>\n</bold> and <bold>HNU-64-Cl</bold> than those of <bold>HNU-64</bold> are on account\nof their functionalized channels blocking the passage of amine molecules\nvia steric hindrance.\n</p><p>To clarify the potential\nmechanism of their catalytic activity,\nthe electronic band structures and optical properties of three uranyl\nMOFs were then investigated by electrochemical and spectral measurements.\nAccording to the Mott\u2013Schottky plots, the positive slopes suggest\nthat they are typical n-type semiconductors (<ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.2c01594/suppl_file/ic2c01594_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S10a</ext-link>).

Another weight loss of 56.15, 56.75, and 58.14% (calcd 55.98, 56.80, and 58.01%) occurred during 190-568 \u00b0C, respectively. They are attributed to the destruction of the coordinated ligands. HNU-64, HNU-64-CH3 , and HNU-64-Cl display no further weight loss above 568, 466, and 494 \u00b0C, respectively (Figure S5). The results are consistent with results of elemental analysis.\n\nIn order to assess the electronic band structures and optical character of HNU-64, UV-vis absorption spectra and Mott-Schottky plots were tested (Figure S10a,b). It is found that HNU-64 has a broad absorption band in the range of 360-500 nm, suggesting the ability to capture visible light. It is also found that the band energy level of HNU-64 is in the range of -0.87 to 1.65 V, in comparison with the oxygen photoreduction potential (E red = -0.24 V vs Ag/AgCl) and amine oxidation potential (E oxi = +0.56 V vs Ag/AgCl), which indicates that HNU-64 has photocatalytic potential. Therefore, HNU-64 was explored for oxidative coupling of amines, and benzylamine was selected as the reaction substrate example. The catalytic reaction was performed under an oxygen atmosphere and 25 \u00b0C, and experimental results are listed in . With the increase of time, the conversion of benzylamine also increases. Within 7 h, benzylamine is almost completely converted to N-benzylbenzaldimine (entry 1-4) with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 3994 \u03bcmol\u22c5g-1\u22c5h-1 (entry 4). Compared with the reported photocatalysts, HNU-64 shows a higher catalytic activity than inorganic semiconductor materials under similar reaction conditions and better performance than MOF NH2-MIL-125(Ti) and is comparable to other porphyrin or pyridine-based MOF photocatalysts (Table S2). In addition, HNU-64 has good recyclability. After five catalytic cycle reactions, HNU-64 still has good catalytic performance and maintains its crystal structure well (Figure S11).\n\nTo further investigate the effect of substituents of benzylamine on catalytic performance, the photocatalytic oxidation activity of HNU-64 for other benzylamine derivatives was explored. In similar experimental conditions, conversions of benzylamine derivatives with -CH3, -OCH3, and -Cl after 6 h are 65.5, 51.2, and 63.1%, respectively (entry 5-7 in ). No other products except imines were detected, and the selectivity of their respective imines can be determined to be >99%. TOF values of the three reactions are 3275, 2560, and 3155 \u03bcmol\u22c5g-1\u22c5h-1, suggesting that HNU-64 has a good catalytic effect on benzylamine derivatives. The conversion of Cl-, OCH3-, and CH3-substituted benzylamines decreased significantly, indicating that the effect of electron donor groups (OCH3 and CH3) and electron-drawing group (Cl) will not improve the conversion. Combined with these results, it can be found that the conversions are reduced when the para-position hydrogen of benzylamine substitutes for larger groups such as -CH3, -OCH3, and -Cl, which is attributed to the steric hindrance of a larger substituent affecting the entry of amine molecules through the channels of HNU-64 instead of electronic effect of substituent groups. In addition, the catalytic performances of HNU-64-CH3  and HNU-64-Cl for photocatalytic oxidation were also studied. As shown in , HNU-64-CH3  and HNU-64-Cl can also catalyze the coupling of benzylamine oxidation under similar mild conditions. After 7 hours, TOF values are 3921 and 3887 \u03bcmol\u22c5g-1\u22c5h-1, and the reaction selectivity is more than 99%. Therefore, the three isostructural uranyl MOFs have good photocatalytic performance in the oxidation of benzylamine. The lower conversion and TOF values of HNU-64-CH3  and HNU-64-Cl than those of HNU-64 are on account of their functionalized channels blocking the passage of amine molecules via steric hindrance. \n\nTo clarify the potential mechanism of their catalytic activity, the electronic band structures and optical properties of three uranyl MOFs were then investigated by electrochemical and spectral measurements. According to the Mott-Schottky plots, the positive slopes suggest that they are typical n-type semiconductors (Figure S10a). In n-type semiconductors, the CB minimum position is thought to be approximately equivalent to the flat band position. The CB edges of HNU-64, HNU-64-CH3 , and HNU-64-Cl are approximated to be -0.87, -0.91, and -1.10 V versus Ag/AgCl, respectively (Figure S10a). In the UV-vis absorption spectra, they have broad absorption bands, indicating a strong capability of visible-light harvesting (a). According to the Tauc plots, the optical band gap energies are estimated to be 2.52, 2.55, and 2.61 eV for HNU-64, HNU-64-CH3 , and HNU-64-Cl, respectively (inset in a). Combining their optical band gap energies and CB edges, the VB maximum potentials are then calculated to be 1.65, 1.64, and 1.51 V versus Ag/AgCl, respectively (b). The CB and VB levels in the three uranyl MOFs possess enough potential energy for O2 photoreduction to \u22c5O2 - and oxidation of benzylamine. To elucidate the roles of possible active species in photocatalysis, a series of quenching experiments were investigated. As shown in Figure S12, when 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidoxyl as the 1O2 scavenger and p-benzoquinone as the \u22c5O2 - scavenger are added, decreased conversion proves that 1O2 and \u22c5O2 - are main reactive oxygen species in the reaction. The addition of electron scavenger AgNO3 or hole scavenger KI into the mixture also leads to markedly decreased conversions, which demonstrates the importance of photogenerated electrons and holes in the photocatalysis. In addition, a slight decrease of benzylamine conversion is observed with tert-butanol (t-BuOH) as the hydroxyl radical (\u22c5OH) scavenger, suggesting that \u22c5OH contributes little to the formation of imines. Such results prove that 1O2 and \u22c5O2 - as main reactive oxygen species play a vital role in the reaction pathway together with the effect of photogenerated electrons and holes.", "data":
