As shown in Figure , the A-B-A-B circuit (I) defining the rhombic channel of the layer (A and B refer to the different nodes defined vide supra) is six-catenated because it is threaded by a single B\u2013B edge shared by three independent pairs of A-A\u2013B-B circuits. An A-A\u2013B-B circuit (II) that defines the side window of the layer is also six-catenated with three pairs of circuits, but it is threaded by three edges that form a zigzag shape (A-A-B-A). The A-A-A-A circuit (III) generated by connecting the layers into bilayers is threaded by two parallel A-B edges and is catenated with four circuits II. The A-B-A-B circuit (IV) between the bilayers is threaded by two parallel A-A edges, each shared by four different circuits, so circuit IV is eight-catenated. The complicated net represents a high-connected 3D system with, thus far, the highest degree of self-catenation.</p>", "clean_text": "According to topological analysis, the (6,8)-connected net of 2 has a point symbol of (411\u22c564)2(418\u22c5610), representing a brand-new 3D topology featuring multiple self-catenation. MOF examples of (6,8)-connected nets are still very rare. The RCSR database lists four (6,8)-connected 3D nets: ocu, sea, seh, and tph, which, except for sea, have not yet been recognized in real MOFs. All these nets do not display self-catenation. Recently, Su and co-workers reported a Zn(II) MOF that represents the first self-catenated (6,8)-connected net (point symbol (412\u22c55\u22c562)(420\u22c552\u22c566), in which the single catenation component occurs between the four-membered circuits composed of six- and eight-connected nodes, respectively). The new net observed in 2 is clearly different from the above nets and displays very complicated multiple catenations between four-membered circuits. The self-catenation obviously arises from the unusual interconnection of the \"interpenetrated\" (4,6)-connected layer components. As shown in Figure , the A-B-A-B circuit (I) defining the rhombic channel of the layer (A and B refer to the different nodes defined vide supra) is six-catenated because it is threaded by a single B-B edge shared by three independent pairs of A-A-B-B circuits.
