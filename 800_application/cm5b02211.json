As discussed above, the pore opening effect may be due\nto the movement of <bold>MR</bold>, from <italic toggle=\"yes\">trans</italic> to\nthe more compact <italic toggle=\"yes\">cis</italic> form, on the MOF surface when\nirradiated. Thus, the pore opening effect is more enhanced with more\nMR loading. The term MOF surface refers to the external surface of\nthe MOF crystals.

Although previous reports have shown that Mg-MOF-74 displayed a loss in uptake capacity in consecutive cycles, the relaxation of MR in Mg-MOF-74@MR may have gradually degraded the MOF.\n\nVisible light irradiation of MIL-53(Al)@MR displayed a similar pore-opening effect, where significant increase in CO2 uptake was observed upon visible light irradiation. However, a saturation point was not observed. Perhaps, this could be due to the flexibility of the MIL framework accommodating more CO2. It has been shown in the literature that similar gas adsorption behavior with saturation points can be observed in other nonflexible MOFs. Due to its flexibility, the effect of different MR loading concentrations (15 and 50 wt %) was investigated. The results revealed that although total uptake capacities in the nonirradiated state reduced at higher MR loading concentrations, a stronger photoresponse was obtained. Under static conditions, the CO2 uptake capacity of irradiated MIL-53(Al)@MR at 15 wt % was increased by 9% (27 cm3/g STP) (d). This trend was more pronounced at 50 wt % guest loading where uptake was significantly increased by 46% (14 cm3/g STP) (e). Larger adsorption changes were obtained in a higher guest loading level (c). However, a peak was observed at lower guest loading concentration at 0.3 bar. As discussed above, the pore opening effect may be due to the movement of MR, from trans to the more compact cis form, on the MOF surface when irradiated. Thus, the pore opening effect is more enhanced with more MR loading. The term MOF surface refers to the external surface of the MOF crystals. At lower guest loading concentration, the environment would be less constricted and hence a sudden increase in photoresponse at the beginning of an adsorption measurement (c). Similar to Mg-MOF-74@MR, dynamic photoswitching of MIL-53(Al)@MR resulted in a lower total CO2 uptake than that obtained under static conditions. Furthermore, degradation may have occurred after relaxation as lower gas adsorption performance of a nonirradiated sample was also observed. Control studies were undertaken to ensure that the pore opening effect was purely due to the presence of MR with the MOFs during gas adsorption. In the absence of MR, irradiation of Mg-MOF-74 and MIL-53(Al) showed very low photoresponse compared to their corresponding MOF@MRs as 12% and 0.6% reduction in uptake capacity was obtained respectively (Figure SI-15a-b). This could be attributed to the aromatic nature of the MOF, particularly in Mg-MOF-74 where the framework itself absorbs visible light (Figure SI-2).\n\nAlthough formation of cis-MR isomers in both irradiated MOF@MR samples can be detected in UV-vis and FT-IR spectra, X-ray diffraction suggested that photoresponse occurred on a local scale as only subtle changes were observed (Figures SI-2, SI-3, SI-9, SI-10). Mg-MOF-74@MR displayed a general blue-shift in peak positions from those observed in the activated Mg-MOF-74 itself, indicating there was a contraction within the MOF framework (Figure SI-2). However, red and blue peak shifts were observed in MIL-53(Al)@MR, indicating that structural deformations were not unidirectional, which could be attributed to the shrinkage and expansion of the MOF framework (Figure SI-3). These shifts were significantly more pronounced with higher guest loading (50 wt %), which could be due to the increase of packing density (Figure SI-3). The unidirectional shift observed in Mg-MOF-74@MR could be due to the rigid nature of the framework. The observed peak shifts suggested that perhaps MR molecules were coated on the MOF surface, covering the pore channels of the MOF framework. In addition to subtle peak shifts, a general broadening of peaks in both MOF@MR samples, which was further enhanced at higher guest loading, was observed (Figures SI-2, SI-3). Furthermore, there were no peaks due to the pure MR present in all diffraction patterns. Therefore, this may indicate the lowering of crystallinity due to the presence of MOF-MR interactions. This was further supported by the thermal behavior of these materials, in which there were red shifts in their degradation steps (Figure SI-1).", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "MOF@MR", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "enhanced", "unit": "", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": "visible light irradiation"}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "inhibited", "unit": "", "temperature": "", "pressure": "0.7 bar", "condition": "nonirradiated state"}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "increased", "unit": "", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": "pore-opening effect"}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "35%", "unit": "cm3/g STP", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": "static irradiation for 30 min"}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "50%", "unit": "cm3/g STP", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": "static irradiation for 60 min"}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "reversible", "unit": "", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": "relaxed back to initial state overnight"}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "decreased", "unit": "", "temperature": "", "pressure": "0.5 bar", "condition": "gradual decrease in overall performance"}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "36%", "unit": "", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": "reduction after one cycle"}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "19%", "unit": "", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": "further reduction in next cycle"}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "9%", "unit": "cm3/g STP", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": "static conditions at 15 wt% guest loading"}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "46%", "unit": "cm3/g STP", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": "static conditions at 50 wt% guest loading"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "Mg-MOF-74@MR", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "light responsive", "unit": "", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": "pore-opening effect"}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "35%", "unit": "cm3/g STP", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": "static irradiation for 30 min"}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "50%", "unit": "cm3/g STP", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": "static irradiation for 60 min"}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "reversible", "unit": "", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": "relaxed back to initial state overnight"}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "decreased", "unit": "", "temperature": "", "pressure": "0.5 bar", "condition": "gradual decrease in overall performance"}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "36%", "unit": "", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": "reduction after one cycle"}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "19%", "unit": "", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": "further reduction in next cycle"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "MIL-53\u00ad(Al)@MR", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "increased", "unit": "", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": "pore-opening effect"}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "9%", "unit": "cm3/g STP", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": "static conditions at 15 wt% guest loading"}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "46%", "unit": "cm3/g STP", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": "static conditions at 50 wt% guest loading"}]}]], "include_properties": ["gas_adsorption"]}, {"idx": 8, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Visible light-triggered\nactivation of MOFs is a new route to controlling access to the pores.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cm-2015-02211t_0006.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Visible light-triggered activation of MOFs is a new route to controlling access to the pores.
