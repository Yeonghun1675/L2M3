Combined with liquid-phase products, the FE(C2+) products (including ethylene, ethanol, and acetic acid) of Cu-HITP (a) reach 42(2)% with a current density of 5.2 mA cm-2 at -1.2 V versus RHE. We also measured the CO2RR performance of the nanosheet sample (Figure S9) of Cu-HITP. Compared to the rod-like sample, the nanosheet sample shows a much poor performance [FE(C2+) of 14%] of CO2RR to C2+ products. Both the structural analysis (Figure S7) and TEM images (Figures S2 and S8) showed that there are more bi-copper sites on the surface of the rod-like sample, while the nanosheet sample has more CuN4 sites, suggesting that the bi-copper sites () along the c-axis on the surface of the Cu-HITP crystal might be the active sites for CO2RR to give C2+ products. On the one hand, the distance between adjacent Cu sites (d Cu-Cu = 3.4 \u00c5) is very suitable for catalyzing *CO coupling with *COH to form *OCCOH in the low-energy pathway. Additionally, it is possible to improve the FE(C2+) by providing a CO2RR-favored local environment (with proton sources and hydrogen-bond donors) around the bi-copper active sites. \n\nWith amino (-NH-) and phenolic hydroxyl groups, conductive polymer PDA can be used as hydrogen-bond donors and proton sources at the same time (a and S23). Therefore, coating it on the Cu-HITP surface may significantly increase the C2+ products' selectivities. With all this in mind, we assembled PDA in situ on the Cu-HITP surface through the self-polymerization reaction of dopamine and fabricated Cu-HITP@PDA samples with different PDA coating amounts at mass ratios of Cu-HITP/dopamine of 10/1, 10/3, 10/5, and 10/7 (Figure S11) to find out the optimal amount of coating. Also, the HRTEM and SEM images of Cu-HITP@PDA (d and S10-S15) showed that the Cu-HITP crystal was coated by a uniform shell, suggesting the existence of PDA. Besides, compared with the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy line scan mode of Cu-HITP, the shell of Cu-HITP@PDA has an O element, suggesting the shell of PDA on the Cu-HITP core (f). The LSV curves show that Cu-HITP@PDA and Cu-HITP exhibit similar current density (Figure S16). As depicted in a, as the amount of PDA coating increased, the yield of CO and CH4 products decreased, while the selectivity of C2+ products increased; especially, the FE of C2H4 was improved from 30.8 to 51% (Figure S32). Furthermore, with the increase in potential, the FE of the C2+ products increased gradually and reached a maximum value of 75(3)% at -1.2 V versus RHE and then decreased (b). Also, the best performance gives 75(3)% FE(C2+) (C2H4, n-PrOH, EtOH, and CH3COOH), 4(0.39)% FE(CH4), 3(1.5)% FE(HCOOH), 0.62(0.23)% FE(CH3OH), 3(1.1)% FE(CO), and 13(3.1)% FE(H2) at -1.2 V versus RHE (b). The FE(C2+) value of Cu-HITP@PDA is much higher than that of Cu-HITP under the same conditions, indicating that the local chemical environment (local hydrogen bonding and proton sources) formed by the PDA shell around the bi-copper active sites plays a critical role in improving the selectivity of C2+ products. It should be noted that the performance of Cu-HITP@PDA is obviously higher than that of most electrocatalysts and only slightly lower than that of three Cu-based nanomaterials [Re-Cu-I, boron-doped copper, and Cu-polyaniline (PANI)] under neutral conditions in the H-cell (c and Table S2). The definite structure-property relationship established by this well-defined structural model system (Cu-HITP@PDA) can provide more insights on the reaction mechanism for understanding the C-C coupling and optimizing the C-C coupling pathway.\n\nCompared with the H-type cell, CO2 gas can flow continuously through the gas-diffusion layer in a flow cell, thus facilitating the mass transfer of CO2 to the electrocatalyst and leading to an increase in current density. The LSV curves of Cu-HITP@PDA in a three-electrode flow cell with a gas diffusion electrode as the working electrode in a 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous solution were also measured. At -1.2 V versus RHE, the current density increased to 55 mA cm-2 and reached 130 mA cm-2 at -1.5 V versus RHE (Figure S46), and no obvious degradation was observed at 55 mA cm-2 over 10 h of continuous operation (Figure S47). In a 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution, benefitting from diverse functions (influencing Bader charge of catalyst surfaces and tuning the catalytic pathway by nucleophilic reactions with surface intermediates) of OH- ions, the current density could even reach 310 mA cm-2 (-1.2 V vs RHE), which is over the commercially relevant current density of 300 mA cm-2. Importantly, after 10 h of electrolysis at a current density of 310 mA cm-2, no significant decay was observed (Figure S47).", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "Cu-HITP", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "catalytic activity", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "surface of metal\u2013organic frameworks"}, {"property name": "local environment", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "polydopamine coating of Cu-HITP"}, {"property name": "carbon dioxide reduction reaction-favored local environment", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "polydopamine coating of Cu-HITP"}, {"property name": "selectivity", "value": "75(3)%", "unit": "", "condition": "C2+ reduced products"}, {"property name": "selectivity", "value": "51(1)%", "unit": "", "condition": "C2H4"}, {"property name": "selectivity", "value": "30%", "unit": "", "condition": "ethylene"}, {"property name": "selectivity", "value": "17%", "unit": "", "condition": "hydrogen production"}, {"property name": "selectivity", "value": "42(2)%", "unit": "", "condition": "C2+ products (including ethylene, ethanol, and acetic acid)"}, {"property name": "selectivity", "value": "14%", "unit": "", "condition": "nanosheet sample"}, {"property name": "selectivity", "value": "75(3)%", "unit": "", "condition": "Cu-HITP@PDA"}, {"property name": "selectivity", "value": "30.8%", "unit": "", "condition": "Cu-HITP"}, {"property name": "selectivity", "value": "51%", "unit": "", "condition": "C2H4"}, {"property name": "selectivity", "value": "55 mA cm-2", "unit": "", "condition": "three-electrode flow cell"}, {"property name": "selectivity", "value": "130 mA cm-2", "unit": "", "condition": "three-electrode flow cell"}, {"property name": "selectivity", "value": "310 mA cm-2", "unit": "", "condition": "1.0 M KOH aqueous solution"}, {"property name": "selectivity", "value": "300 mA cm-2", "unit": "", "condition": "commercially relevant current density"}]}]], "include_properties": ["etc"]}, {"idx": 4, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Description of Different C\u2013C Coupling Pathways\nand the Corresponding\nEnergy Barriers: (a) *CO Dimerization Pathways; (b) Coupling of *CO\nwith a Hydrogenated *COH to Form a *OCCOH Intermediate When the Distance\nbetween the Metal Active Sites Is Appropriate (2.78\u20133.56 \u00c5);\nand (c) CO<sub>2</sub>RR-Favored Local Environment with Proton Sources\nand Hydrogen-Bond Donors around the Active Sites to Reduce the Coupling\nEnergy Barrier and Promote the C\u2013C Bond Formation<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"s1fn1\"></xref>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr5\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cs2c02002_0006.tif\" xlink:type=\"simple\"></graphic>\n<p>\n<fn id=\"s1fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>Noted: Cu, Orange; C, Gray; O,\nRed; N, Blue; H, White.</p>\n</fn>\n</p>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Description of Different C-C Coupling Pathways and the Corresponding Energy Barriers: (a) *CO Dimerization Pathways; (b) Coupling of *CO with a Hydrogenated *COH to Form a *OCCOH Intermediate When the Distance between the Metal Active Sites Is Appropriate (2.78-3.56 \u00c5); and (c) CO2RR-Favored Local Environment with Proton Sources and Hydrogen-Bond Donors around the Active Sites to Reduce the Coupling Energy Barrier and Promote the C-C Bond Formation      a Noted: Cu, Orange; C, Gray; O, Red; N, Blue; H, White.
