MA and DMA ions have polar structures, that is, dipole moments, while the structure of the GUA ion yields no polar axis, and instead, it exhibits a hexapole moment. These characteristic components have a strong impact on the bulk properties of these MOFPs. a-c shows the temperature-dependent dielectric responses (the dielectric constant \u03b5r and dielectric loss tan \u03b4) of the three MOFPs. For MA-MOF, the dielectric constant monotonically decreases as the temperature (T) is decreased. A noticeable but small dielectric anomaly near 150 K (inset of a) is obtained and possibly related to the commensurate-incommensurate phase transition as reported recently in the analogous [CH3NH3][Co(HCOO)3] single crystal. In the case of DMA-MOF, a steplike dielectric anomaly occurs around 270 K, associated with a strong dielectric relaxation process over the temperature range between 150 and 270 K as reflected by the frequency dispersion of the dielectric constant. The broad dielectric peak indicates an order-disorder phase transition, which is consistent with previous results. The inset plot displays the logarithm of the applied frequency as a function of inverse temperature corresponding to the peak in tan \u03b4 spectra. For the low-temperature region, the data can be well fitted by the Arrhenius law 1     f =   f   0   exp \u2061   -   E   a     R T      Where E a is the activation energy, f 0 is the relaxation frequency constant, and RT is the thermal energy. The fitting results estimate that E a and f 0 are around 0.284 eV and 17 GHz, respectively, which are in the range similar to those for the 120\u00b0 reorientation of the DMA ion around the C-C axis. In the high-temperature range, the peak of the dielectric losses becomes frequency-independent, which is phenomenologically similar to the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition with the softening of the phonon modes. c shows the temperature-dependent dielectric properties of GUA-MOF. Its dielectric constant remains almost invariant over a broad temperature range with no evident frequency dispersion.

The dynamic structure reveals this HN1A being hydrogen bonded to one framework oxygen at a time, hopping rapidly between two configurations at room temperature. The interactions between the MA ions and the Mg(HCOO)- framework are quite weak, as reflected by the GDOS results. Therefore, the molecular polar axis (and thus dipole moment) of MA ions present a large thermal oscillation. With decreasing thermal energy, this oscillating polarization becomes frozen, and hence the dielectric constant decreases almost linearly with the temperature. To accommodate the alignments and freezing of the MA ions, the \u03b2p angle of the primitive cell increases with lowering temperature. With temperatures below 150 K, the thermal energy cannot trigger the two-site jump motion of HN1A, and only one N1-HN1A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O bond is populated. Therefore, the small dielectric anomaly of MA-MOF is likely to be related to the order-disorder transition of HN1A. At the low temperature, the single N1-HN1A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bond breaks the symmetry between two counter O ions, affecting the antiphase octahedral tilting around the [1 0 1]p direction. To accommodate this energy change for both MA ions and frameworks, MA-MOF transfers into an incommensurate phase, showing the similar behavior reported in [CH3NH3][Co(HCOO)3]. Although at room temperature, the dipole moment arising from the MA ion within one parent perovskite unit cell exhibits fluctuations, the coordination environment presented by the distorted MOF framework constrains the overall orientational sense of the MA ions to antiparallel alignments. Therefore, no spontaneous polarization can be obtained on average. In the case of DMA-MOF, the antiphase tilting of MgO6 generates three symmetry-equivalent sites for N to attach through N-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O connections. Therefore, although the orientation of the C-N dipole moment of a single DMA ion is clearly defined over time scales of 20 ps or more, its alignment deduced from SCXRD is either temporally or spatially disordered. The fact that a dielectric anomaly appears at lower temperatures suggests that the disorder is from site hopping. The thermal energy cannot break the associated hydrogen bonds, and individual N atoms begin to freeze into a single unique site. As the DMA ion links with the framework through two hydrogen bonds, one of the three primitive cell axes, the b p-axis in this work, then becomes unique. Considering the triangular geometry of the DMA ion, the \u03b1p and \u03b3p angles will experience a sudden decrease during the R-to-M phase transition. The order-disorder phase transition is also reflected by the GDOS results, and the strong guest-host interaction over the thermal energy forces the ordered structure in DMA-MOF. For GUA-MOF, the A-site ion is tightly restricted by the MOF framework, presenting a strong guest-host interaction. Thus, its dielectric constant is found to be stable over a broad temperature range. With thermal contraction shrinking the size of the A-site cavity, the interaction between the N-H and six MOF framework oxygens is further enhanced, reflected by its strong anharmonic lattice dynamics. Such competition between the guest-host interaction and the thermal energy possibly explains the increase of the dielectric constant at lower temperatures, while the detailed mechanism still needs further investigation. The GUA ion has a planar geometry and alternative alignments along the b p-axis. Thus GUA-MOF exhibits a larger thermal expansion coefficient along the \u27e80 1 0\u27e9p direction than the other two [0 0 1]p directions.

The fitting results estimate that E a and f 0 are around 0.284 eV and 17 GHz, respectively, which are in the range similar to those for the 120\u00b0 reorientation of the DMA ion around the C-C axis. In the high-temperature range, the peak of the dielectric losses becomes frequency-independent, which is phenomenologically similar to the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition with the softening of the phonon modes. c shows the temperature-dependent dielectric properties of GUA-MOF. Its dielectric constant remains almost invariant over a broad temperature range with no evident frequency dispersion. However, it displays the surprising feature that the dielectric constant increases with decreasing temperature, and this trend remains unchanged even at 10 K. This behavior is quite similar to that observed in incipient ferroelectrics such as SrTiO3 and rutile TiO2, although the dielectric constant is several orders of magnitude smaller than those of the other two materials. \n\nThe evolution of the lattice parameters as a function of temperature is summarized in Figure S4. For both MA-MOF and GUA-MOF, the lattice parameters present a continuous change when cooling down from room temperature. It is found that their a- and b-axes exhibit positive thermal expansions, while their c-axes show a negative thermal expansion. Because three MOFPs exhibit different symmetries and axis settings, it is difficult to compare the lattice parameters and associated temperature-dependent behavior directly. b plots the lattice parameters of the primitive perovskite unit cell, which are calculated from the axis relationship listed in Table S3. Both MA-MOF and GUA-MOF have a monoclinic primitive cell with a p = c p \u2260 b p and \u03b1p = \u03b3p = 90\u00b0 \u2260 \u03b2p. Moreover, their a p and b p values present an almost linear temperature dependence, and the thermal expansion coefficients are estimated to be 22.6(4) MK-1 (MA-MOF) and 11.4(4) MK-1 (GUA-MOF) along the a p/c p-axis and 23.7(4) MK-1 (MA-MOF) and 23.2(7) MK-1 (GUA-MOF) along the b p-axis. In other words, the thermal expansion of MA-MOF is almost isotropic along the three [0 0 1]p directions, while GUA-MOF experiences faster thermal expansion along the b p-axis. Intriguingly, the evolution of \u03b2p for MA-MOF and GUA-MOF has an opposite trend. The \u03b2p of two MOF samples can be treated as the hinge angle under the simplified \"hinge-strut\" architecture where the HCOO- ligand and the Mg2+ cation present the hinge and strut, respectively. However, it is noteworthy that the \u03b2p used in this study is the supplementary angle of the hinge angle \u03b8 proposed by Collings et al. in perovskite-like formates. The shape of the A-site molecular ions significantly affects the evolution of hinge angles as a function of temperature. The prolate cations such as MA ions display the opposite trend in comparison with the oblate GUA ion according to the framework hinging mechanism. For DMA-MOF, its R phase structure contains a rhombohedral primitive cell (a p = c p = b p, \u03b1p = \u03b2p = \u03b3p \u2260 90\u00b0), while the M phase has a triclinic primitive cell with the relationship: a p = c p \u2260 b p and \u03b1p = \u03b3p \u2260 \u03b2p. The thermal expansion coefficients are estimated to be 27.5(5) MK-1 (R phase) along three equivalent [0 0 1]p directions, 14.9(7) MK-1 (M phase) along the \u27e81 0 0\u27e9p/\u27e80 0 1\u27e9p direction, and 9.5(4) MK-1 (M phase) along the \u27e80 1 0\u27e9p direction. Additionally, when the R phase transfers into the M phase, the equivalent cell angle splits into two different values (middle panel of b). With further decreasing temperature, the \u03b1p/\u03b3p angle of the M-phase remains almost unchanged, while the \u03b2p angle gradually increases. Despite the primitive cell parameters of the three MOFPs exhibiting different trends when cooling down from room temperature, the cell volumes of the three samples display contractions during this process.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "thermal expansion coefficient": [{"value": "12 x 10-6", "unit": "K-1", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "MA-MOF", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "thermal expansion coefficient": [{"value": "22.6(4)", "unit": "MK-1", "condition": "along the a_p/c_p-axis"}, {"value": "23.7(4)", "unit": "MK-1", "condition": "along the b_p-axis"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "GUA-MOF", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "thermal expansion coefficient": [{"value": "11.4(4)", "unit": "MK-1", "condition": "along the a_p/c_p-axis"}, {"value": "23.2(7)", "unit": "MK-1", "condition": "along the b_p-axis"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "DMA-MOF", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "thermal expansion coefficient": [{"value": "27.5(5)", "unit": "MK-1", "condition": "R phase, along three equivalent [0 0 1]_p directions"}, {"value": "14.9(7)", "unit": "MK-1", "condition": "M phase, along the \u27e81 0 0\u27e9_p/\u27e80 0 1\u27e9_p direction"}, {"value": "9.5(4)", "unit": "MK-1", "condition": "M phase, along the \u27e80 1 0\u27e9_p direction"}]}]], "include_properties": ["thermal_expansion_coefficient"]}, {"idx": 11, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Temperature-dependent dielectric spectra:\n(a) <bold>MA-MOF</bold>.
