Here, we report a novel microporous boron imidazolate\nframework (BIF-108-Zn) that integrates both organic ligands and extra-framework\nspecies as pore partition agents to divide the interconnected channels\ninto isolated cages. This structure possesses a high pore volume with\na reduced pore size and a functionalized pore surface to realize preferential\nbinding of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> over C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>.

The pore size distribution\nderived from the NLDFT model-based analysis upon the corresponding\nN<sub>2</sub> sorption isotherms gave the peak position at 6.4 \u00c5,\nwhich is close to the data from the crystal structure. Moreover, the\nCO<sub>2</sub> isotherms were measured up to 1 bar at different temperatures.\nBIF-108-Zn exhibited reversible CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption with uptake\nvalues of 87.0 cm<sup>3</sup>/g (3.8 mmol/g) at 273 K and 64.4 cm<sup>3</sup>/g (2.9 mmol/g) at 298 K (d), which are comparable to some of the best\nperforming metal\u2013azolate frameworks (e.g., 5A@ZIF-8, 3.0 mmol/g;\nMAF-23, 3.3 mmol/g; MAF-25, 5.2 mmol/g; MAF-26, 3.8 mmol/g).

Introduction of pore partition agents into metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) endows materials with multivariate porous environments for gas adsorption and separation. Here, we report a novel microporous boron imidazolate framework (BIF-108-Zn) that integrates both organic ligands and extra-framework species as pore partition agents to divide the interconnected channels into isolated cages. This structure possesses a high pore volume with a reduced pore size and a functionalized pore surface to realize preferential binding of C2H6 over C2H4. Dynamic breakthrough measurements demonstrated that BIF-108-Zn can directly produce polymer-grade C2H4 with a productivity of 0.69 mmol/g at 298 K and 1 bar from a binary mixture of C2H6/C2H4. Furthermore, the relatively low isosteric enthalpy value endows it with good regenerability and high stability, as verified by multiple adsorption separation tests.\n\nTo investigate the permanent porosity of BIF-108-Zn, the as-synthesized samples were activated by solvent exchange in ethanol for a week and then degassed at 80 \u00b0C under high vacuum prior to the measurement. The N2 sorption measurements at 77 K showed a type-I adsorption isotherm behavior with a maximum uptake of 255 cm3/g, which is characteristic of microporous materials and consistent with the crystal structure (c). The corresponding Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and pore volume of BIF-108-Zn were 708 m2/g and 0.39 cm3/g, respectively.
