The total mass loss in this step is 8.1% [219 atomic mass units (amu); 12.2 H2O molecules per formula unit] for 1 and 8.0% (217 amu; 12.0 H2O molecules per formula unit) for 2. The data correlate well with the amounts of water found by X-ray crystallography and elemental analyses (9.0 and 12.5 H2O molecules per formula unit for 1 and 2, respectively). The removal of H2O molecules coordinated to GdIII ions occurs at the wide temperature range of 130-260 \u00b0C.\n\nCompounds 3 and 4 demonstrate similar methods for thermal decomposition and lose 7.4% and 7.2% of total mass (205 and 200 amu, respectively) at temperatures of 20-130 \u00b0C (c,d). Oxidation of the framework does not affect, therefore, the solvate composition in spite of the partial occupancy of the channel volume by Br- anions. Surprisingly, coordinated H2O molecules were removed at relatively low temperatures (up to 180 \u00b0C) with a maximum rate of weight loss at 141 \u00b0C for both 3 and 4. In this step, the compounds lose 1.7% and 1.9% of their mass (47 and 53 amu, respectively).\n\nThe specific gravimetric surface areas for compounds are not impressive. However, solids 1-4 demonstrate high crystallographic density because of the presence of heavy Re, Se, and Gd atoms in their composition. The corresponding values are about 3.4-3.7 g mL-1 versus about 1.0 or even less for classical MOF materials or silica. Therefore, a comparison of the volumetric surface areas of adsorbents will give a more correct imagination of the real porosity. Thus, the BET surface areas for compounds 1a-4a are 561, 861, 411, and 787 m2 mL-1, correspondingly. These values are comparable with the surface areas of very porous MOFs such as MOF-5 (636 m2 mL-1) and HKUST-1 (845 m2 mL-1). \n\nLow-Pressure Adsorption of CO2, CH4, and N2 at 273 and 298 K\n\nBecause compounds 1-4 possess narrow pores decorated by different heteroatoms, the potential for binary gas mixture separation was evaluated. Adsorption isotherms at 273 and 298 K were measured for CO2, CH4, and N2 (). Gas uptakes at 1 bar and corresponding temperatures are summarized in Table S3. As one can see, CO2 uptake is several times higher than that for CH4 or N2. The gravimetric CO2 uptake on 1a and 2a is not high because of the heavy metal content, but the values obtained at 1 bar and 298 K are comparable with the adsorption capacity of some other MOFs with high CO2 uptake such as MOF-5 (0.82 mmol g-1), ZIF-8 (1.02 mmol g-1), or MIL-53(Cr) (2.03 mmol g-1). Meanwhile, the volumetric uptake is also quite important because of its influence on the volume of the adsorbent bed. The volumetric CO2 uptakes of both 1a and 2a at 1 bar and 298 K are very good and comparable with the best values for MOF materials, such as Mg-MOF-74 (2.92 mmol mL-1) and HKUST-1 (4.91 mmol mL-1). \n\nThe heat of adsorption is another significant parameter influencing the performance of a material for capture and separation applications (Table S7 and Figure S12). The isosteric heat of adsorption can be evaluated by the virial or Clausius-Clapeyron equation using isotherms at two different temperatures for each adsorbate-adsorbent system. Interestingly, the heats of CO2 adsorption are relatively high, ca. 35 kJ mol-1. Such values are characteristic for adsorbents with special interactions between the adsorbate and adsorbent, for example, for MOFs with exposed metal sites or additional base centers such as amines. The quite strong interaction of CO2 with all studied frameworks may be explained by the presence of aqua ligands of Gd atoms even in activated samples as well as by good decoration of the framework channels by different heteroatoms that increase the van der Waals forces between the adsorbed molecules and surface. Such high adsorption enthalpies in the entire coverage range are more than 2 times greater than the enthalpy of CO2 vaporization (~16.5 kJ mol-1). The large volumetric CO2 uptake and modest CH4 and N2 uptakes allow us to suppose that studying materials may possess a good performance for the separation of postcombustion flue gas (predominantly a CO2/N2 separation is needed) or natural gas (the separation of CH4 from CO2 and N2 is important).\n\nBoth compounds 1a and 2a possess high CO2/N2 () and CO2/CH4 (Figure S13) selectivities, while there is no significant CH4/N2 selectivity (Figure S14). According to IAST calculations and the Henry constants, the selectivity factors for CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 separation decrease with increasing temperature, while the ratios of adsorbed volumes follow the opposite tendency. The highest CO2/N2 selectivity factor is demonstrated by compound 2a at 273 K, reaching more than 400 at a total pressure of 1 bar (). According to the IAST prediction, the selectivity factor takes extremely high values at a CO2 mole fraction of less than 0.1, which is useful for the purification of flue gas. In addition, compound 2a demonstrates a higher selectivity factor than 1a for a CO2/CH4 binary mixture at both 273 and 298 K. Such a tendency could be explained by larger CO2 uptake on compound 2a than 1a due to a S-containing fdc moiety instead of an O-containing fdc one.\n\nMagnetochemical Analysis\n\nTo date, investigation of possible exchange interactions in the coordination polymers based on paramagnetic [Re6Q8(CN)6]3- anions and Ln3+ cations was limited to the report where weak antiferromagnetic interactions were found in the inorganic framework. The synthesis of compounds 1-4 provided us an opportunity to find out whether the presence of organic linkers affects the possible exchange interactions in such polymers, so a detailed magnetochemical study was carried out. The magnetic data of both compounds 1 and 2 are shown in . Because the structures of the compounds differ solely in the linkers (fdc vs tdc) between the GdIII centers, the magnetic data are expected to be very similar. Consistent with that expectation, the values of \u03c7m T reach 15.67 cm3 K mol-1 (1) and 15.71 cm3 K mol-1 (2), respectively, at 290 K. These values are slightly below the value of 15.76 cm3 K mol-1 expected for two noninteracting isotropic spin centers (S = 7/2; g = g e ~ 2.00). This is because the g factor of the GdIII centers is slightly less than that of the free electron (g e) because of significant contributions from excited states mixed into the ground state by spin-orbit coupling. Upon cooling of the compound, the values of \u03c7m T stay almost constant down to T ~ 25 K and subsequently decrease to 10.81 and 10.78 cm3 K mol-1, respectively, at 1.0 T and 2.0 K. Although the decrease of \u03c7m T at low temperatures is mainly due to saturation effects caused by an applied field of 1.0 T, it is potentially also due to very small antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between the two GdIII centers mediated via two carboxylate linkers. At 2.0 K, the molar magnetization M m is linear in B up to ca. 0.5 T. At 5.0 T, M m is 13.9N A\u03bcB (for 1) and 13.7N A\u03bcB (for 2), indicating a saturation value of about 14N A\u03bcB (or slightly less, M m,sat = gSN A\u03bcB per GdIII center) in agreement with very small or no exchange interactions between the GdIII centers. The least-squares fits reproduce the data well with relative root-mean-square errors SQ = 0.5% (1) and 0.6% (2), respectively, as indicated by the solid lines in .
