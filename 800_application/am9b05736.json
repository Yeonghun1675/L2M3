The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area for PCN-224 is 2296(8) m2/g. The corresponding pore size distribution was analyzed by the nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT).\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nThe crystal structure of PCN-224 has a she topology with Im3\u0305m space group that contains three-dimensional open channels with the size of 1.9 nm. As biocompatible Zr(IV) has strong interaction with the carboxylate linker, Zr nodes provide the framework robustness and thus ensure that the drug is delivered to cancer cells stably. In addition, the porphyrinic linker in the MOF framework allows efficient PDT without aggregation in the aqueous solution. PCN-224 nanoparticles were synthesized using a synthetic method described in a previous report. Synthesized PCN-224 nanoparticles were observed to have a spherical morphology with the diameter of 100 nm by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) (a,b). Nanoparticles of this size have a higher cellular uptake ability than that of other sizes. The structure of synthesized nanoparticles was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). The experimental PXRD pattern of the MOF nanoparticles matches well with the simulated pattern (c) and still maintains crystallinity after HA coating, implying that the MOF structure remains during the synthesis process. The nanoMOF has a large Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 2296(8) m2/g by N2 adsorption studies at 77K (d, S1a). This high surface area allow drug loading in large quantities, demonstrating the potential of the PCN-224 nanoparticles as a drug delivery carrier. We investigated the loading capacity of the hydrophobic Dox in nonmodified PCN-224 through physical entrapment. The drug encapsulation mechanism is caused by noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions, allowing PCN-224 to interact more effectively with the drug molecule. As shown in Figure S2, PCN-224 showed high loading capacity ability (108%, weight ratio between Dox and nanoMOFs). The porosity of Dox-PCN was confirmed by N2 adsorption. The BET surface area of Dox-PCN is 1353(5) m2/g. Although the surface area and pore size of Dox-PCN decrease, the porosity of Dox-PCN still remains after drug loading (Figure S1c).\n\nAlong with a major limitation in the MOF drug delivery system, the hydrophobicity of the particle surface and open pores of Dox-PCN can cause low colloidal stability and premature drug release. To overcome such drawbacks, the Dox-PCN has been modified by an HA biopolymer through the coordination interaction with the Zr cluster and the carboxylic acid of HA. The DLS experiment indicated an increase in the hydrodynamic radius of HA-Dox-PCN (~250 \u00b1 20 nm) compared to that of PCN-224 (~164 \u00b1 20 nm) (e). After HA coating, MOF still showed the spherical morphology (Figure S3). The structural differences among PCN-224, Dox-PCN, and HA-Dox-PCN were confirmed by TGA. After modifying the Dox and HA with PCN-224, TGA data show different thermal decomposition processes, although a quantitative calculation of the component ratio is difficult because of the pyrolysis temperature overlap of TCPP, Dox, and HA (Figure S4). Furthermore, surface properties of PCN-224 and HA-Dox-PCN were determined by measuring the \u03b6-potential in aqueous solution. The \u03b6-potential experiment indicated a change of the surface charge from a positive potential for PCN-224 (+27 mV) to a negative potential for HA-Dox-PCN (-34 mV) (f). The size and surface charge change indicates that HA was coated successfully on the PCN-224 surface. The HA-Dox-PCN colloidal stability was studied by measuring the size change through varying the time in media. As shown in a, the particle size did not show any significant difference for 48 h, indicative of high colloidal stability. The nanoparticle colloidal stability is important for the safe and effective nanomedicine since low colloidal stability of nanoparticles can lead to capillary blockage in vivo and the nanoparticles are likely to be rapidly removed by the body's reticuloendothelial system.\n\nAs shown in b and S6, the amount of HA was independent of the concentration of sodium chloride and sodium acetate. More interestingly, the HA coating was quite stable even at a high salt concentration (200 mM). These results imply that the coating of HA might have happened by the polyvalent coordination bonds, along with simple electrostatic interaction and single coordination bonds. To further investigate the binding between HA and PCN-224, fluorescence titration was performed. Different molecular weights of FITC-modified HA (high-molecular-weight HA (1500-2200 kDa) and low-molecular-weight HA (8-15 kDa)) were prepared to compare the binding constant. The fluorescence of FITC-modified HA (FITC-HA) was significantly quenched when PCN-224 nanoparticles were added, probably due to the energy transfer from FITC to the porphyrin framework (c and S5). The normalized fluorescence intensities of FITC-HA at 520 nm were plotted against the ratio of the nanoparticle to the polymer. The binding constants (K s) were obtained through the nonlinear least-squares curve-fitting analysis. K s of high-molecular-weight HA-FITC with PCN-224 is 2.9 \u00d7 1011 M-1. Meanwhile, that of low-molecular-weight HA-FITC with PCN-224 was significantly decreased to 3.19 \u00d7 107 M-1. These results suggest that a large number of carboxylate groups of HA affect the binding force. Therefore, polyvalent coordination bonds with Zr clusters on the surface of PCN-224 nanoparticles are very important for a robust and stable gatekeeper system.\n\nDue to high expression of HAdase in cancer cells, the gatekeeper HA can be degraded inside cancer cells to trigger the release of the drug molecules.

(f) Atomic configurations of each state in the reaction coordinate. The atoms in the bond formation reaction are shown by ball-and-stick models, while the remaining atoms are represented by sticks. Except for water molecule colored in blue, the Zr, C, H, and O atoms are colored in cyan, gray, white, and red, respectively.
