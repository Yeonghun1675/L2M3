The conditions used in this work were chosen such that samples could not equilibrate with the substituting linker (24 h exchanges), which thus discourages formation of thick shells with a low exchange percentage in the relatively large MOF-5 crystals studied here (~700-1000 \u03bcm). However, the majority of MOFs relevant to catalysis are much smaller, e.g., on the order of hundreds of nanometers for the ubiquitous UiO-66 system. For such small MOF crystals, linker diffusion (and subsequent equilibration) into the MOF core takes place relatively quickly, and a low degree of exchange can be achieved by using a low-exchanging solvent like N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide or N,N-dibutylformamide. However, if the MOF is large, a solvent which gives thick shells (like N,N-diethylformamide) should be coupled with a lower ratio of exchanging linker:starting linker and long exchange times, such that the system can equilibrate at a high-entropy, well-dispersed state. Development of specific protocols to optimize MOF PSE under equilibrating conditions remains a challenge for future work in the field.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 31, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Non-degenerate Linker Exchange</title><p>While\nthe MOF-5 \u2192\nMOF-5-<italic>d</italic>\n<sub>4</sub> linker exchange is useful for\nits ease of characterization, the majority of linker exchanges performed\nby researchers involve linkers with different electronics, and thus\ndifferent affinities for coordinating MOF metal clusters.
