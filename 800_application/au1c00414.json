Interestingly, a dramatic increase in CO2 adsorption was observed between 30 wt % at about 10 mmol N per gram of MOF amine loading and 50 wt % at about 20 mmol N per gram of MOF amine loading, while poor CO2 adsorption performance was observed at <10 mmol N per gram of MOF amine loading, indicating that differences in the CO2 adsorption mechanism(s) may be present between the two loading conditions. This dramatic step-change in the CO2 adsorption was also observed in our previous study. Previously, we hypothesized that the impregnated amine groups strongly interact with the MOF framework at lower loadings of amine, and many amine sites may not be available for CO2 capture, resulting in lower CO2 adsorption.\n\nThe CO2 uptakes of 50 wt % PEI- and TEPA-loaded samples were 1.81 and 2.14 mmol/g, respectively, at 400 ppm CO2, indicating that the TEPA sample was more effective than the branched PEI sample for direct air capture under ambient dry conditions (25 \u00b0C). This may be because TEPA mainly consists of primary and secondary amines, which have better CO2 adsorption potentials under dry conditions than tertiary amines, or because of the enhanced amine chain mobility in the shorter TEPA chains relative to that of PEI. Thus, TEPA-impregnated MIL-101(Cr) showed a higher amine efficiency than PEI-impregnated sorbents at 25 \u00b0C, as shown in . Also, the ~50 wt % TEPA sample contains about 7.5% more amine groups than the ~50 wt % PEI material, as shown in a. Thus, the higher amine loadings are an additional factor contributing to the higher CO2 uptake of 50 wt % TEPA. However, mild regeneration temperature conditions will likely be required to utilize TEPA-containing sorbents for DAC due to their limited thermal stability induced by amine volatility at elevated desorption temperatures. \n\nThe 400 ppm CO2 adsorption capacities of 30 and 50 wt % PEI- and TEPA-impregnated MIL-101(Cr) sorbents were also measured by a TGA/DSC system at 25 \u00b0C, and the results are shown in Figure S4(a). The pseudoequilibrium CO2 capture capacities obtained from the TGA/DSC system show a trend similar to that of the SAP data shown in a. Table S3 shows the CO2 uptake as a function of time for different PEI and TEPA loadings (30 and 50 wt %) at 25 \u00b0C. Although the 30 wt % PEI- and TEPA-impregnated MIL-101(Cr) samples showed modest DAC performance at 25 \u00b0C due to low amine loadings, they quickly reached their pseudoequilibrium capacities (at 720 min), showing rapid CO2 capture kinetics. The 50 wt % amine-impregnated MIL-101(Cr) samples achieved 1 mmol/g uptakes within 75 (PEI) or 50 min (TEPA), showing promising 400 ppm CO2 capture kinetics at 25 \u00b0C. However, the relatively fast initial CO2 adsorption kinetics were followed by a slow increase in the CO2 uptake due to the increased diffusion resistance encountered by CO2 at long times. These results are comparable to our previous work on PEI-impregnated MIL-101(Cr), as shown in Table S3.\n\nTo probe the CO2 capture mechanism(s) of PEI- and TEPA-impregnated MIL-101(Cr) samples at 25 \u00b0C, CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments were carried out using the TGA/DSC system, as described in the . Figure S5 shows the CO2 concentration of the outlet stream, the sample mass change, and the temperature profiles during the CO2 TPD experiments using 30 and 50 wt % PEI- and TEPA-impregnated MIL-101(Cr). Even during the helium purging step at 25 \u00b0C (first 1 h), some amount of CO2 was desorbed from the sorbents, indicating that the CO2 capture mechanism(s) of the amine-impregnated MIL-101(Cr) materials also included some degree of physisorption. After the 1 h helium purge step, more CO2 was desorbed from the sorbents when the temperature increased. While the 30 wt % PEI- and TEPA-impregnated MIL-101(Cr) sorbents were completely regenerated below 60 \u00b0C (Figure S5(a)), a higher temperature was required for the complete desorption of CO2 from the 50 wt % PEI- and TEPA-impregnated sorbents, confirming that the 50 wt % amine-loaded MIL-101(Cr) samples interacted more strongly with 400 ppm of CO2 than the 30 wt % samples at 25 \u00b0C (Figure S5b).\n\nTo quantify the weak and strong chemisorption, the heats of adsorption of 30 and 50 wt % PEI- and TEPA-impregnated MIL-101(Cr) for 400 ppm of CO2 were measured by TGA/DSC. As shown in Figure S6, the heat of adsorption of 30 wt % amine-impregnated MIL-101(Cr) was between -40 and -65 kJ/mol, supporting the weak chemisorption-dominant CO2 capture mechanism. The 50 wt % amine-loaded sorbents showed strong chemisorption-dominant behavior, with relatively higher (absolute value) heats of adsorption (-95 to -110 kJ/mol).\n\nWhen increasing the amine loadingsup to 50 wt %, the extent of pore filling increased, resulting in decreased pore volumes (see Table S1). Due to the decreased pore volumes, the overall CO2 capture performance may be impacted by CO2 mass transfer through the impregnated amine phase (pore-blocking). Additionally, the effect of pore-blocking should be more significant at cold temperature conditions when polymer chains have slower motions (-20 \u00b0C). Thus, the higher amine loading conditions led to reduced DAC performance at the sub-ambient temperature (-20 \u00b0C). As shown in Figure S4b, the TGA/DSC data obtained at -20 \u00b0C clearly show significantly reduced CO2 capture kinetics for the 50 wt % amine-loaded sorbents after 2 h, after which the amount of CO2 adsorbed only slowly increased up to the end of the 12 h experiment. For example, the initial CO2 capture kinetics of the 50 wt % PEI-impregnated sorbent were dramatically reduced from 0.015 mmol/g/min to 6.21 \u00d7 10-4 mmol/g/min after 2 h at -20 \u00b0C. Even after 12 h at -20 \u00b0C, equilibrium conditions were not achieved. Therefore, the CO2 adsorption capacity even at 12 h is only a pseudoequilibrium value.\n\nAs shown in  and S3, despite the decrease in the adsorption temperature from 25 to -20 \u00b0C, the 30 wt % PEI- and TEPA-impregnated MIL-101(Cr) samples showed promising initial CO2 adsorption kinetics.  presents the initial adsorption rate and the rate after 2 h, while Table S3 provides key numerical values extracted from Figure S4. The data show that with a lower amine loading, the 30 wt % TEPA-impregnated sorbent showed faster initial uptake kinetics (0.021 mmol/g/min) than the 50 wt % TEPA-impregnated material (0.012 mmol/g/min) at -20 \u00b0C. Additionally, we note that the initial CO2 adsorption kinetics of the 50 wt % amine loading samples were not significantly reduced at -20 \u00b0C.
