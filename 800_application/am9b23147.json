Until now, many catalysts based on the porphyrins and their derivatives mimicking the coenzyme have been investigated for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The electrocatalytic activity of PMOF(Fe) and Pt@PMOF(Fe) toward O2 was also investigated (Figure S1). Compared with in N2-saturated PBS, both PMOF(Fe)/GCE and Pt@PMOF(Fe)/GCE have excellent current signal in O2-saturated PBS, demonstrating that PMOF(Fe) and Pt@PMOF(Fe) have the electrocatalytic activity toward ORR. The enhancement in the electrochemical signal is attributed to the linker, FeTCPP, which acted as a catalyst in the electrochemical reduction processes. In addition, the FeTCPP has high activity for ORR with four-electron reduction. Moreover, the peak current with Pt@PMOF(Fe)/GCE in O2-saturated PBS (Figure S16B, curve b) is higher than that with PMOF(Fe) in O2-saturated PBS (Figure S16A, curve b). This performance increase can be attributed to the modified Pt NPs, which could be acted as a catalyst for ORR with four-electron reduction of O2 to H2O. In addition, in the process of ORR, the electron was transferred form the Fe center to O2 to form intermediate Fe(IV), and the Pt NPs could replenish electron to Fe(IV) to protect Fe leaching. Thus, owing to the synergy between PMOF(Fe) and Pt NPs, the Pt@PMOF(Fe) electrochemically active sites and surface area for O2 reduction could be significantly increased. The mechanism should be divided into different steps and described as follows  6    M - Pt +   O   2   +   e   -   \u2192   O   2   - M - Pt     7      O   2   - M - Pt +   H   +   +   e   -   \u2192 HOO - M - Pt     8    HOO - M - Pt +   H   +   +   e   -   \u2192 O - M - Pt +   H   2   O     9      Fe   III   + e - \u2192   Fe   II       10      Fe   II   +   O   2   \u2192   Fe   II   -   O   2       11      Fe   II   -   O   2   + 4   e   -   + 4   H   +   \u2192   Fe   III   +   H   2   O   Here, M is the chemical active site on Pt.

Overall, these results demonstrated that compared with PMOF(Fe), Pt@PMOF(Fe) exhibited excellent stability for oxidizing H2O2 to produce O2 in harsh conditions.\n\nFurthermore, the electrocatalytic activity of Pt@PMOF(Fe) snowflake toward different concentrations of H2O2 was examined via cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in , the reduction current at -0.45 V increased on increasing the H2O2 concentration, suggesting that Pt@PMOF(Fe) could electrocatalyze toward the reduction of H2O2. Moreover, there is a good linear relationship between the reduction current and the concentration of H2O2 from 0 to 10 mM, which is wider than that of H2O2 sensor using Ag@Cu NW (1.0-10 mM) and 3D microsnowflake structured Fe2O3 (0.1-5.5 mM) as electrocatalytic materials. The detection limit was 6.0 \u03bcM at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. The selectivity of Pt@PMOF(Fe) toward the reduction of H2O2 was assessed with a variety of interfering species, including 2.0 mM glucose, 2.0 mM urea acid (UA), 2.0 mM ascorbic acid (AA), and 2.0 mM bisphenol A (BPA). The results showed that all of the interfering species had negligible current change, whereas the current changed remarkably in the presence of H2O2 (Figure S14). It indicates that the current could remain 91% after storing for 7 days at 4 \u00b0C, when the biosensor was not used (Figure S15). These results proved the excellent electrocatalytic activity of Pt@PMOF(Fe) toward H2O2 with excellent selectivity and could be employed for the detection of H2O2 in complex samples.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "PMOF\u00ad(Fe)", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "catalytic activity", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "stability", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "electrocatalytic activity", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "Pt@PMOF\u00ad(Fe)", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "catalytic activity", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "stability", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "electrocatalytic activity", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["etc"]}, {"idx": 5, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>(A) Preparation of Pt@PMOF\u00ad(Fe) and (B) Biomimetic\nCatalysis of Pt@PMOF\u00ad(Fe)</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"am9b23147_0008.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  (A) Preparation of Pt@PMOF(Fe) and (B) Biomimetic Catalysis of Pt@PMOF(Fe)   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 15, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(A) SEM\nand (B) TEM images of PMOF\u00ad(Fe) and (C) SEM and (D) TEM\nimages of Pt@PMOF\u00ad(Fe) (inset: high-resolution TEM and the interplanar\nspacing of high-resolution TEM).</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr2\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"am9b23147_0009.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  (A) SEM and (B) TEM images of PMOF(Fe) and (C) SEM and (D) TEM images of Pt@PMOF(Fe) (inset: high-resolution TEM and the interplanar spacing of high-resolution TEM).
