At 300 K, the x m T value is 4.09 cm3 mol-1 K-1, smaller than 4.38 cm3 mol-1 K-1 (the value that is expected for one high-spin Mn2+ ion). As the temperature decreases, the x m T decreases continuously and achieves a minimum value of 0.26 cm3 mol-1 K-1 at 2 K, identifying a primary AF interaction between MnII ions. The AF interactions between MnII ions in 5 also can be signified by the negative Weiss constant (\u03b8 = -32.55 K), which is acquired through fitting the 1/x m-T data in the 40 and 300 K temperature range by the Curie-Weiss law (Figure S7b). The magnetization curve exhibits a linear behavior and gets to the unsaturation value of 1.16 N\u03b2 at 8 T, demonstrating again the AF magnetic coupling in 5. To estimate the strength of the magnetic coupling between the adjacent MnII ions, the 1D infinite-chain model was adopted. And, the best fit gives g = 2.01, J = -2.89 cm-1, and R = 1.56 \u00d7 10-3.

The value of value is 12.74 cm3 mol-1 K at room temperature, which is slightly lower than the value of 13.13 cm3 mol-1 K expected for three magnetically isolated high-spin Mn2+ ions. With the decreasing temperature, the x m T value decreases monotonically and decreases to 4.31 cm3 mol-1 K at 2 K, which is consistent with the value of one uncoupled Mn2+ ion, which indicates the occurrence of antiferromagnetic (AF) interactions in the Mn3 II units with an up-down-up spin manner. The negative Weiss constant (\u03b8 = -10.76 K) also suggest the antiferromagnetic behavior in 1 (Figure S7a). The M-H curve at 2 K displays a rapid increase at low field (a, inset), reaching the saturation magnetization of 5.01 N\u03b2/Mn3 II at 3.4 T. This value is in accordance with 5.0 N\u03b2 expected for antiferromagnetic Mn3 II clusters and also suggests an up-down-up spin arrangement in Mn3 II clusters. The magnetic data of 1 are analyzed using a linear trimetric Mn2+ model (Scheme S1), in which the magnetic interaction between the terminal manganese ions is negligible (J 2 = 0), and J 1 stands for the exchange constant between the adjacent MnII ions, and also the molecular field approximation is considered. The best fitting gives g = 2.00, J 1 = -0.57 cm-1, zj' = -0.0039 cm-1, and R = 5.63 \u00d7 10-3. This result demonstrates the weak AF coupling between adjacent Mn2+ ions in the trinuclear Mn2+ unit and gives rise to an S = 5/2 ground state. Moreover, the value of x m T at 2 K is also consistent with this (4.31 cm3 mol-1 K compared with the predicted value of 4.38 cm3 mol-1 K for g = 2.00).\n\nThe x m T-T curve for 5 per Mn2+ is displayed in b. At 300 K, the x m T value is 4.09 cm3 mol-1 K-1, smaller than 4.38 cm3 mol-1 K-1 (the value that is expected for one high-spin Mn2+ ion). As the temperature decreases, the x m T decreases continuously and achieves a minimum value of 0.26 cm3 mol-1 K-1 at 2 K, identifying a primary AF interaction between MnII ions. The AF interactions between MnII ions in 5 also can be signified by the negative Weiss constant (\u03b8 = -32.55 K), which is acquired through fitting the 1/x m-T data in the 40 and 300 K temperature range by the Curie-Weiss law (Figure S7b). The magnetization curve exhibits a linear behavior and gets to the unsaturation value of 1.16 N\u03b2 at 8 T, demonstrating again the AF magnetic coupling in 5. To estimate the strength of the magnetic coupling between the adjacent MnII ions, the 1D infinite-chain model was adopted. And, the best fit gives g = 2.01, J = -2.89 cm-1, and R = 1.56 \u00d7 10-3. The result unveils AF coupling between the MnII ions. According to Goodenough's rules, the magnetic interaction type between adjacent metal ions is largely decided by the M-O-M bond angles. Ferromagnetic coupling for the M-O-M bond angle close to 90\u00b0 and antiferromagnetic behavior for the large M-O-M bond angle are anticipated.
