According to the XRD patterns of the synthesized MOFs (e), they match with the diffraction patterns of the CPO-10 and Co3(ABDC)3(DMF)4 MOF structures. We considered four structural models for the MOFs (Figure S5). The optimized bond lengths of Fe-O, Co-O, and Ni-O are 1.93, 1.96, and 2.04 \u00c5, which are in good agreement with those reported in previous theoretical and experimental works. Also, the distances between Fe-Fe, Fe-Co, Co-Co, and Co-Ni are about 3.39, 3.34, 3.26, and 3.35 \u00c5, respectively, which are larger than the kinetic diameter of the H2O molecule (2.65 \u00c5). The latter implies that H2O could penetrate into the metal active centers of the MOFs. The interaction of the H2O molecule with the MOF structures is quantitatively illustrated by the adsorption energy using , which reflects the capability of the MOF structure for purposes of water splitting. E ads is found to be -0.37, -0.45, -0.51, and -1.06 eV for H2O adsorption on 3Fe MOF, 2Fe-Co MOF, Fe-2Co MOF, and Fe-Co-Ni MOF, respectively. The most negative value of E ads on the Fe-Co-Ni MOF indicates the strongest interaction of the H2O molecule on its surface, which is due to the positive charge of the Ni atom (+1.01e, e is the unit of electric charge). This charge is approximately +0.20e larger than those of Fe and Co (see ). We further used molecular surface electrostatic potential (ESP) and HOMO-LUMO energy gap (E gap, ) to understand the origin of the H2O adsorption on the aforementioned MOFs. According to the ESP results (a), the positive ESP (blue color) on the Ni atom is larger than those on the Fe and Co atoms, whereas the O atom in H2O exhibits a strong negative ESP (red color). The latter leads to a strong interaction between the Ni atom and the O atom of the H2O molecule. Furthermore, the calculated E gap values for 3Fe MOF, 2Fe-Co MOF, Fe-2Co MOF, and Fe-Co-Ni MOF are 3.04, 2.89, 1.86, and 0.36 eV, respectively (b). The small band gap of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF corresponds to a strong interaction of this MOF with the H2O molecule, confirming the superior catalytic activity of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF. In all the studied MOFs, the O-H bond length of the H2O molecule elongated up to ~0.06 \u00c5 when a water molecule is adsorbed. Also, the corresponding stretching vibrational frequency displays a 301.25 cm-1 red shift, and the H-O-H angle exceeds 106.0\u00b0 because of the interaction between the lone pairs and the metal nodes (Figure S27, for a water molecule, the bond length is 0.96 \u00c5 and the bond angle is 104.5\u00b0).

Similar to the OER activity, the HER activity trend\nof the samples is as follows: Fe\u2013Co\u2013Ni MOF &gt; Fe\u2013Co\nMOF &gt; Fe MOF &gt; Ni foam.

Herein, we demonstrate a reductive electrosynthesis approach to prepare a layer-by-layer (LbL) assembled trimetallic Fe-Co-Ni metal-organic framework (MOF) in which the metal cations within each layer or at the interface of the two layers are linked to one another by bridging 2-amino-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid linkers. Tailoring catalytically active sites in an LbL fashion affords a highly porous material that exhibits excellent trifunctional electrocatalytic activities toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (\u03b7 j=10 = 116 mV), oxygen evolution reaction (\u03b7 j=10 = 254 mV), as well as oxygen reduction reaction (half-wave potential = 0.75 V vs reference hydrogen electrode) in alkaline solutions. The dispersion-corrected density functional theory calculations suggest that the prominent catalytic activity of the LbL MOF toward the HER, OER, and ORR is due to the initial negative adsorption energy of water on the metal nodes and the elongated O-H bond length of the H2O molecule. The Fe-Co-Ni MOF-based Zn-air battery exhibits a remarkable energy storage performance and excellent cycling stability of over 700 cycles that outperform the commercial noble metal benchmarks. When assembled in an asymmetric device configuration, the activated carbon||Fe-Co-Ni MOF supercapacitor provides a superb specific energy and a power of up to 56.2 W h kg-1 and 42.2 kW kg-1, respectively. This work offers not only a novel approach to prepare an LbL assembled multimetallic MOF but also provides a benchmark for a multifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting and Zn-air batteries.\n\nIn this study, we report a controllable electrodeposition approach for the in situ growth of a trimetallic Fe-Co-Ni MOF on Ni foam in a unique Fe-Co-Ni trilayer architecture. Actually, the three complementary aspects that have effectively been pursued over the past two decades, namely (i) establishing a new synthetic method, (ii) designing new MOF structures, and (iii) opening new avenues for their practical applications, have been met, simultaneously. This versatile layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly offers a route to the fabrication of architecture-tailored multimetallic thin-film electrodes with electrocatalytic properties that go beyond what is possible for a mixed-metal MOF prepared using a mixture of different metal precursors. The obtained single-phase trilayer Fe-Co-Ni MOF preserves high crystallinity, hierarchical porosity, and chemical stability, thus resulting in facilitated mass transport and easily accessible active sites. The trimetallic Fe-Co-Ni MOF exhibits excellent performance as the HER, OER, and ORR electrocatalyst with low overpotentials (\u03b7) of 116 and 254 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for HER and OER, respectively, and an ORR half-wave potential of 750 mV versus reference hydrogen electrode (RHE). This trifunctional catalytic activity of a pure MOF material, supported by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, is of paramount importance because; (1) despite the exciting progress made in the synthesis of monofunctional electrocatalysts, the development of bifunctional and trifunctional electrocatalysts has just begun and faces many challenges and (2) while MOF-based composites and MOF-derived materials are frequently used in electrocatalysis, direct electrochemical applications of pure MOFs are still in their infancy. A rechargeable Zn-air battery assembled by using a bifunctional OER-ORR electrocatalyst as the air cathode delivers an excellent power density of 161 mW cm-2 and an outstanding specific energy of ~945 W h kgZn -1. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor-battery hybrid device (AC||Fe-Co-Ni MOF, AC = activated carbon) delivers a specific capacity of 60 mA h g-1. This study represents a breakthrough in the synthesis of LbL assembled MOFs with synergistic effects between the constituent non-precious metals, exceptional trifunctional catalytic performances toward HER, OER, and ORR, and outstanding energy storage performances that open up new avenues for advanced energy storage and conversion devices.\n\nPhysicochemical Characterization\n\nTo demonstrate that the Fe, Co, and Ni MOF layers are piled one on top of one another in an orderly fashion, we recorded top view and cross-sectional FE-SEM images of the trilayer Fe-Co-Ni MOF (a-c, see also Supporting Information, Figures S6-S8). From the cross-sectional SEM image in c and the corresponding SEM-EDS map presented in d, it can be clearly seen that C, N, and O as constituent elements of the organic linker are evenly distributed throughout the FE-SEM image (except in the bottom part of the image, separated by a dashed yellow line that corresponds to the Ni foam substrate), whereas, Fe, Co, and Ni elements are distributed in distinctly different layers in an LbL assembled fashion. It is evident that a continuous Fe MOF layer (in between the orange and yellow boundaries in the SEM and highlighted in violet in the EDS mapping) is deposited on the Ni foam substrate. The images also show that the Co MOF layer (middle, highlighted in red in the EDS mapping) with a clearly different contrast is deposited in between the Fe MOF (bottom) and Ni MOF (top) layers. All this unequivocally shows the tailored spatial arrangement of the Fe, Co, and Ni MOF layers. From the cross-sectional SEM image, the thickness of the Fe MOF, Co MOF, and Ni MOF layers is estimated to be 1.1, 1.9, and 2.9 \u03bcm, respectively. The SEM cross-sectional image combined with the EDS line scan (Figure S9) provide additional evidence for the successful fabrication of an LbL assembled Fe-Co-Ni MOF. EDS line scans reveal that the cross-sectional morphology of the coating can be divided into three different layers; the top Ni layer, the middle Co layer, and the bottom Fe layer. Note that the high signal of Ni at the bottom of the coating stems from the Ni foam substrate.\n\nOER Activity\n\nTo investigate the electrocatalytic performance of the trilayer Fe-Co-Ni MOF toward overall water splitting, we first evaluated the OER activity in a 1.0 M KOH solution in a standard three-electrode cell setup, using Fe-Co-Ni MOF as the working electrode, double-junction Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode, and a Pt plate as a counter electrode. We converted the data collected with reference to an Ag/AgCl reference electrode to a RHE scale. We also used a binary Fe-Co MOF, a Fe MOF, bare Ni foam, as well as a RuO2 electrode as control samples. a displays linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of all samples at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1. The OER activity trends are as follows: Fe-Co-Ni MOF > Fe-Co MOF > Fe MOF > Ni foam. The bare Ni foam displays the least OER activity with an overpotential of 440 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 (\u03b710 = 440 mV). Fe MOF displays a better OER activity (\u03b710 = 290 mV). The bilayer Fe-Co MOF shows much better OER activity (\u03b710 = 280 mV) likely because of the synergistic effects between Fe and Co metal centers. The trilayer Fe-Co-Ni MOF displays the best OER activity (\u03b710 = 254 mV), among all the samples, that is even far greater than that of the RuO2 catalyst (\u03b710 = 318 mV) and superior to most non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts reported in the literature (Table S2). The excellent OER activity of the trilayer Fe-Co-Ni MOF can be attributed to its well-defined ordered porous structure with useful exploitation of synergistic effects between optimally distributed metal catalysts and a large accessible surface area. The corresponding Tafel slope of the trilayer Fe-Co-Ni MOF (51.3 mV dec-1) is also lower than those of the bilayer Fe-Co MOF (63.0 mV dec-1) and the Fe MOF (67.7 mV dec-1) catalysts, confirming faster kinetics and more favorable OER activity for the trimetallic Fe-Co-Ni MOF (b). In order to examine the stability and durability of the trimetallic Fe-Co-Ni MOF, we performed long-term (48 h) chronopotentiometry at geometric current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm-2 (c). Interestingly, at both low and high current densities, the Fe-Co-Ni MOF maintains an approximately constant potential for 48 h without any obvious degradation in OER activity. Moreover, comparing the LSV and CV curves for OER before and after 1000 CV cycles at a scan rate of 500 mV s-1 shows quite similar shapes, providing additional support for the excellent stability of the trilayer Fe-Co-Ni MOF under harsh water-splitting conditions (c inset).\n\nHER Activity\n\nWe also evaluated the HER performance of the trilayer Fe-Co-Ni MOF and compared it with those of the bilayer Fe-Co MOF, the Fe MOF, Ni foam, and Pt/C in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte at a sweep rate of 5 mV s-1 (d). Similar to the OER activity, the HER activity trend of the samples is as follows: Fe-Co-Ni MOF > Fe-Co MOF > Fe MOF > Ni foam. As can be seen, Fe-Co-Ni MOF shows the best catalytic activity toward HER (\u03b710 = 116 mV, that of Pt/C is 74 mV), followed by the Fe-Co MOF (\u03b710 = 131 mV), the Fe MOF (\u03b710 = 161 mV), and the bare Ni foam substrate (\u03b710 = 260 mV).

Additionally, a long-term (48 h) chronoamperometry test at a constant potential of -0.10 V versus RHE revealed that the electrocatalytic HER activity can be maintained for at least 48 h (Figure S17a). The LSV curves recorded before and after 48 h (Figure S17b) show a negligible potential shift, demonstrating excellent HER catalytic performance of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF compared with other reported non-precious electrocatalysts (Table S3).", "data": ["(SyntaxError('invalid syntax', ('<unknown>', 10, 1, '[{\"meta\":{\"name\":\"MOF-B\", \"symbol\":\"\", \"chemical formula\":\"\"}, \"etc\": [\\n')), '[{\"meta\":{\"name\":\"MOF-A\", \"symbol\":\"\", \"chemical formula\":\"\"}, \"etc\": [\\n    {\\n        \"property name\": \"dielectric constant\",\\n        \"value\": \"4.5\",\\n        \"unit\": \"\",\\n        \"condition\": \"at 1 kHz\"\\n    }\\n]}]\\n\\n[{\"meta\":{\"name\":\"MOF-B\", \"symbol\":\"\", \"chemical formula\":\"\"}, \"etc\": [\\n    {\\n        \"property name\": \"electrical conductivity\",\\n        \"value\": \"0.01\",\\n        \"unit\": \"S/cm\",\\n        \"condition\": \"at room temperature\"\\n    }\\n]}]\\n\\n[{\"meta\":{\"name\":\"NOTT-202\", \"symbol\":\"\", \"chemical formula\":\"\"}, \"etc\": [\\n    {\\n        \"property name\": \"electrical resistance\",\\n        \"value\": \"10000000\",\\n        \"unit\": \"ohm\u00b7cm\",\\n        \"condition\": \"\"\\n    }\\n]}]')"], "include_properties": ["etc"]}, {"idx": "26, 27, 30", "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<title>OER and HER Simultaneously</title><p>Considering\nthe excellent OER and HER activities, we examined the combination\nof OER and HER and the potential difference (\u0394<italic toggle=\"yes\">E</italic>\n<sub>OER\u2013HER</sub>) between them in a 2E cell setup.

However, the XPS measurement after 150\nh of continuous HER/OER indicates that the peak intensity ratio of\nthe trivalent species slightly increased, while the binding energies\nare almost unchanged.

The optimized\nbond lengths of Fe\u2013O, Co\u2013O, and Ni\u2013O are 1.93,\n1.96, and 2.04 \u00c5, which are in good agreement with those reported\nin previous theoretical and experimental works. Also, the distances between Fe\u2013Fe, Fe\u2013Co,\nCo\u2013Co, and Co\u2013Ni are about 3.39, 3.34, 3.26, and 3.35\n\u00c5, respectively, which are larger than the kinetic diameter of\nthe H<sub>2</sub>O molecule (2.65 \u00c5).

The LSV curves for OER and HER show that a potential difference of 1.60 V is required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for the Fe-Co-Ni MOF-based cell, which is much lower than those obtained for the Fe-Co MOF (\u0394E OER-HER = 1.65 V), the Fe MOF (\u0394E OER-HER = 1.67 V), and Ni foam (\u0394E OER-HER = 1.93 V) based cells, and even better than that of the benchmark Pt/C(-)||RuO2(+) electrolyzer (\u0394E OER-HER = 1.62 V) as well (f). The excellent water-splitting activity of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF catalyst is well ahead of those of most of the other non-noble metal electrocatalysts reported in the literature (g, Table S4). Interestingly, it delivers an overall water-splitting cell voltage of 1.60 and 1.63 V in a two-electrode cell compartment at current densities of 10 and 15 mA cm-2, respectively (h). To assess the long-term stability and durability of the cell, we recorded the chronopotentiometry response of the two-electrode electrolyzer at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for 150 h (Figure S18). The plot shows that a voltage of 1.6 V remains almost constant over the course of the working days. We also compared the long-term stability of the MOF-based electrolyzers as well as the Pt/C||RuO2 cell by recording the chronoamperograms for 150 h at a constant overpotential of 1.8 V. The rate of current density loss for the Fe-Co-Ni MOF||Fe-Co-Ni MOF cell (7% after 150 h) is significantly lower than those for Fe-Co MOF||Fe-Co MOF (16%) and Fe MOF||Fe MOF (24%) cells, and much better than that of the state-of-the-art Pt/C||RuO2 (43%) cells (Figure S19). The survival of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF in this long-term stability test is due in part to the strong covalent conjugation of the MOF structures on the Ni foam substrate, as well as the coordination geometry between metals and ligands. Note also that the MOF structures presented in this study are solvent-free structures (i.e., metal sites are all full-coordinated by ligands) that exhibit higher stability than that of solvent-coordinated counterparts. To further investigate the reasons behind the long-term stability of the trilayer Fe-Co-Ni MOF, we assessed the morphological and structural changes of the active materials before and after the HER and OER using FE-SEM (Figures S20-S22) as well as the XPS (Figure S23) and XRD (Figure S24) methods. Postoperation analyses of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF after 2 and 150 h of the HER and OER processes reveal that their morphologies are almost unchanged (Figure S20), and the surface composition is preserved (Figures S21 and S22). However, the XPS measurement after 150 h of continuous HER/OER indicates that the peak intensity ratio of the trivalent species slightly increased, while the binding energies are almost unchanged. This can be likely attributed to the generation of the (oxy)hydroxides during catalysis, consistent with previously reported studies. Partial transformation in the structure of the trilayer MOF after the long-term operation was also verified by XRD measurements. Although the XRD pattern of the MOF is preserved, the postoperation pattern reveals small changes that can be attributed to enriched trivalent metal species. Note that the stable catalytic activity is critically important for practical applications, which is rarely reported for MOF-based electrocatalysts. i displays a photograph illustrating that hydrogen and oxygen bubbles are produced on the surface of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF electrodes operating at a constant current density of 15 mA cm-2 in the assembled electrolyzer (Video S1). For a better understanding of the reasons behind the excellent catalytic performance of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF catalyst, we evaluated the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and turn over frequency (TOF) of the catalyst. The ECSA of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF electrode, which can be estimated by evaluating the double layer capacitance (C dl) of the non-faradaic region of the CV at different scan rates (Figure S25), is 111.2 cm2, which is far higher than those of the Fe-Co MOF (102.7 cm2), the Fe MOF (16.1 cm2), and the mixed-metal FeCoNi MOF (75.7 cm2). It should be mentioned that the mass loadings of the trilayer MOF electrode are almost the same as those of the Fe-Co MOF and the Fe MOF electrodes, thus the huge difference in ECSA of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF electrode compared to the other two electrodes cannot be explained simply by the film thickness, instead, it is due to the high electrochemically active center density of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF that benefits from the synergistic effects between the active centers and the fast electron transfer rate within the electrode and at the electrode-electrolyte interface.\n\nThe TOF is another figure of merit demonstrating enhanced catalytic activity (Figure S26). The highest TOF at an overpotential of 400 mV (0.407 \u00b1 0.016 s-1) also belongs to the trilayer Fe-Co-Ni MOF. These results demonstrate that the high ECSA and TOF of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF catalyst in combination with the synergistic effects between the metal active sites explain the excellent water-splitting performance (facile evolution of the O2 and H2 bubbles and ultrafast gas bubble escape rate) of the catalyst.\n\nTheoretical Studies\n\nWe conducted DFT calculations to gain further insights into the origin of the outstanding catalytic activities of the synthesized MOFs, their electronic structure, and the adsorption energy of the H2O molecules into their structures. According to the XRD patterns of the synthesized MOFs (e), they match with the diffraction patterns of the CPO-10 and Co3(ABDC)3(DMF)4 MOF structures. We considered four structural models for the MOFs (Figure S5). The optimized bond lengths of Fe-O, Co-O, and Ni-O are 1.93, 1.96, and 2.04 \u00c5, which are in good agreement with those reported in previous theoretical and experimental works. Also, the distances between Fe-Fe, Fe-Co, Co-Co, and Co-Ni are about 3.39, 3.34, 3.26, and 3.35 \u00c5, respectively, which are larger than the kinetic diameter of the H2O molecule (2.65 \u00c5). The latter implies that H2O could penetrate into the metal active centers of the MOFs. The interaction of the H2O molecule with the MOF structures is quantitatively illustrated by the adsorption energy using , which reflects the capability of the MOF structure for purposes of water splitting. E ads is found to be -0.37, -0.45, -0.51, and -1.06 eV for H2O adsorption on 3Fe MOF, 2Fe-Co MOF, Fe-2Co MOF, and Fe-Co-Ni MOF, respectively. The most negative value of E ads on the Fe-Co-Ni MOF indicates the strongest interaction of the H2O molecule on its surface, which is due to the positive charge of the Ni atom (+1.01e, e is the unit of electric charge). This charge is approximately +0.20e larger than those of Fe and Co (see ). We further used molecular surface electrostatic potential (ESP) and HOMO-LUMO energy gap (E gap, ) to understand the origin of the H2O adsorption on the aforementioned MOFs. According to the ESP results (a), the positive ESP (blue color) on the Ni atom is larger than those on the Fe and Co atoms, whereas the O atom in H2O exhibits a strong negative ESP (red color). The latter leads to a strong interaction between the Ni atom and the O atom of the H2O molecule. Furthermore, the calculated E gap values for 3Fe MOF, 2Fe-Co MOF, Fe-2Co MOF, and Fe-Co-Ni MOF are 3.04, 2.89, 1.86, and 0.36 eV, respectively (b). The small band gap of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF corresponds to a strong interaction of this MOF with the H2O molecule, confirming the superior catalytic activity of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF. In all the studied MOFs, the O-H bond length of the H2O molecule elongated up to ~0.06 \u00c5 when a water molecule is adsorbed. Also, the corresponding stretching vibrational frequency displays a 301.25 cm-1 red shift, and the H-O-H angle exceeds 106.0\u00b0 because of the interaction between the lone pairs and the metal nodes (Figure S27, for a water molecule, the bond length is 0.96 \u00c5 and the bond angle is 104.5\u00b0).

Based on the obtained results,\nthe outstanding performances and cycling stability of the Zn\u2013air\nbattery employing the Fe\u2013Co\u2013Ni MOF air cathode can be\nascribed to the following factors: (1) the rich porous architecture\nof the Fe\u2013Co\u2013Ni MOF enables catalytically active sites,\nwhich are fully and easily accessible to the electrolyte meanwhile\nenhancing the escape rate of the O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> bubbles;\n(2) the high stability of the Fe\u2013Co\u2013Ni MOF guarantees\nits long-term catalytic activity toward OER/ORR.</p>", "clean_text": "We also evaluated the mechanism of the HER by considering \"M* + H2O\" as an initial state and \"M-H* + H2O\" as the second state that results in the H2 production. d shows the optimized structure and the free energy diagram of the HER promoted by the Fe-Co-Ni MOF. For an ideal system, the value of \u0394G for the HER should be close to zero. The calculated \u0394G for promoting the HER process for external potential values (\u03c6) of 0.00 and 1.23 V is found to be 0.88 and -0.34 eV, respectively. The latter refers to the fact that the adsorption of H over the Fe-Co-Ni MOF is weak without applying a more negative external potential. This negative value, that is close to zero, indicates that the adsorption of hydrogen over the Fe-Co-Ni MOF is possible if one applies a more negative bias (d). Generally, DFT calculations can provide exciting new insights into understanding the catalytic mechanism of water-splitting processes, confirming the robustness of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF catalyst toward the efficient production of oxygen and hydrogen.\n\nORR Activity\n\nWe also evaluated the ORR activities of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF catalyst as well as the control samples by CV in O2- or N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte solution. As shown in Figure S30, the Fe-Co-Ni MOF, as well as the Fe-Co MOF and the Fe MOF electrodes, display a featureless quasirectangular CV curve in the N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. In contrast, in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, a considerably high current reduction peak emerges at a potential of ~0.75 V versus RHE. While a relatively limited number of transition metal-based materials have been reported as efficient ORR electrocatalysts, the remarkable ORR activity of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF, as well as the bimetallic Fe-Co MOF and the Fe MOF, is of paramount importance for practical applications. Furthermore, the smaller the amount of the potential gap between ORR and OER, the higher the bifunctional OER/ORR activity will be. \u0394E OER-ORR of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF catalyst (which is generally the difference between the OER potential at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and the half-wave potential of ORR at a rotation speed of 1600 rpm) is 0.73 V (a), which is lower than or comparable to those of other catalysts used in zinc-air batteries and outperforms those of expensive noble metal-based catalysts (Table S5).\n\nWe investigated the ORR activity of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF as well as the Fe-Co MOF, the Fe MOF, and Pt/C control samples via hydrodynamic voltammetry on a glassy carbon (GC) RDE in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. Hydrodynamic voltammetry provides more insights into the kinetic properties of the ORR activities. We recorded polarization curves of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF/GC, the Fe-Co MOF/GC, the Fe MOF/GC, and Pt/C/GC on an RDE at various rotation speeds of 400, 625, 900, 1225, 1600, and 2025 rpm in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte (Figure S31). b displays the LSV polarization curves of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF/GC, the Fe-Co MOF/GC, the Fe MOF/GC, and Pt/C/GC at a rotation speed of 1600 rpm. We extracted thermodynamic information such as the onset potential (E onset) and the half-wave potential (E 1/2) for all catalysts from the polarization curves presented in b and summarized in Figure S32. b shows that the Fe-Co-Ni MOF/GC exhibits the best ORR catalytic performance compared to the Fe-Co MOF and the Fe MOF catalysts with a highly positive E onset of 0.82 V and E 1/2 of 0.75 V (vs RHE). These values are slightly less than those of a Pt/C reference catalyst (E onset = 0.91 V, and E 1/2 = 0.85 V vs RHE). We used the Koutechy-Levich (KL) equation to obtain kinetic information about the ORR activity of the catalysts, such as the number of electrons (n) and the kinetic current density (J K). Figure S32a shows the comparison of the KL plots for the Fe-Co-Ni MOF/GC, the Fe-Co MOF/GC, the Fe MOF/GC catalyst, as well as Pt/C/GC as a reference. Figure S32b shows the kinetic parameters along with the half-wave potential and the onset potential at a rotation speed of 1600 rpm for all the catalysts. The number of electrons transferred by Fe-Co-Ni MOF per O2 molecule was estimated to be 3.77, suggesting a nearly four-electron reduction pathway. The exceptional catalytic activity of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF can be attributed to the well-ordered porous structure, excellent distribution of active sites, synergistic effects between them, and sufficient diffusion channels to effectively enhance the mass transport of ionic species within the framework structure.\n\nWe assembled a Zn-air battery using Zn powder as an anode and Fe-Co-Ni MOF as an air-cathode according to the scheme shown in c. We also fabricated a control device using a Pt/C + RuO2 air cathode. d displays charge-discharge polarization curves and power density profiles of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF and Pt/C + RuO2 cathodes. The Fe-Co-Ni MOF shows an open-circuit voltage (OCV) as high as 1.424 V, just slightly less than that of Pt/C + RuO2 (OCV = 1.440 V). However, Fe-Co-Ni MOF possesses a smaller potential gap between charge and discharge curves, indicating its better rechargeability compared to the Pt/C + RuO2-based Zn-air battery. Interestingly, at higher current densities the Fe-Co-Ni MOF significantly outperforms the Pt/C + RuO2 electrode (d). The Fe-Co-Ni MOF delivers a maximum power density as high as 161 mW cm-2, whereas Pt/C + RuO2 provides a peak power density of just 138 mW cm-2. In addition, the Fe-Co-Ni MOF-based Zn-air battery delivers an outstanding specific capacity of 733.3 mA h gZn -1 (based on the consumed Zn) at a current density of 5 mA cm-2 with a corresponding specific energy of ~945 W h kgZn -1, whereas the device based on the Pt/C + RuO2 cathode displays a specific capacity of 664.4 mA h gZn -1 and a specific energy of 900 W h kgZn -1 at the same current density of 5 mA cm-2 (e). The Zn-air battery based on the Fe-Co-Ni MOF also displays a superb rate capability and delivers an output voltage of 1.32 V at a current density of 5 mA cm-2 that decreases to 1.15 V at 50 mA cm-2 and returns to 1.28 V (~97% of the initial output voltage) at 5 mA cm-2 over the course of about 11 h working (f). To demonstrate the practical applicability and prospects of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF as the cathode for a Zn-air battery, we connected two devices in series that provide an OCV of each 1.424 V (Figure S34a). Two devices connected in series are capable of turning on a digital 3.0 V clock (Figure S34c), powering 52 green (2.2 V) light-emitting diodes (LEDs, g), lighting a blue (2.8 V) LED (Figure S34d, Video S2), and running a rotor for ~270 s (Video S3).\n\nWe assessed the long-term cycling stability of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF-based Zn-air battery as well as the Pt/C + RuO2-based control device by recording consecutive galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements at a fixed current density of 5 mA cm-2 with a 10 min cycle time (h). The Fe-Co-Ni MOF-based battery displays excellent stability over 700 cycles that is about five times more durable than the Pt/C + RuO2 benchmark (tolerating only 120 cycles, Figure S35a). For the Fe-Co-Ni MOF-based battery, the overpotential increased from 0.46 V for the first cycle to 0.56 V for the 700th cycle (Figure S35b). As a result, 94.4% of the initial energy was retained even after 120 h of cycling, whereas the Pt/C + RuO2-based battery quickly lost its catalytic activity toward ORR and OER, which caused a severely degraded energy efficiency upon cycling (Figure S35a). Based on the obtained results, the outstanding performances and cycling stability of the Zn-air battery employing the Fe-Co-Ni MOF air cathode can be ascribed to the following factors: (1) the rich porous architecture of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF enables catalytically active sites, which are fully and easily accessible to the electrolyte meanwhile enhancing the escape rate of the O2 and H2 bubbles; (2) the high stability of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF guarantees its long-term catalytic activity toward OER/ORR.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "Fe\u2013Co\u2013Ni MOF", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "HER \u0394G", "value": "0.88", "unit": "eV", "condition": "external potential value (\u03c6) of 0.00"}, {"property name": "HER \u0394G", "value": "-0.34", "unit": "eV", "condition": "external potential value (\u03c6) of 1.23"}, {"property name": "electrons transferred", "value": "3.77", "unit": "", "condition": "per O2 molecule"}, {"property name": "onset potential", "value": "0.82", "unit": "V", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "half-wave potential", "value": "0.75", "unit": "V", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "\u0394E OER\u2013ORR", "value": "0.73", "unit": "V", "condition": "difference between OER potential at a current density of 10 mA cm\u20132 and half-wave potential of ORR at a rotation speed of 1600 rpm"}, {"property name": "open-circuit voltage (OCV)", "value": "1.424", "unit": "V", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "maximum power density", "value": "161", "unit": "mW cm\u20132", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "specific capacity", "value": "733.3", "unit": "mA h gZn\u20131", "condition": "at a current density of 5 mA cm\u20132"}, {"property name": "specific energy", "value": "945", "unit": "W h kgZn\u20131", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "output voltage", "value": "1.32", "unit": "V", "condition": "at a current density of 5 mA cm\u20132"}, {"property name": "long-term cycling stability", "value": "700", "unit": "cycles", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["etc"]}, {"idx": "47, 50, 52, 53, 54", "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<title>Supercapacitor\u2013Battery\nHybrid Device</title><p>Energy storage devices (such as supercapacitors,\nbatteries, or\na combination thereof) are thriving in high-value markets, ranging\nfrom portable electronics to electric vehicles to coupling with renewable\nenergy sources for providing secure, reliable, and affordable energy.\nThis research direction can be further facilitated by the introduction\nof new functional materials.

Although plenty of research activities have gone into using MOFs as sacrificial templates to fabricate electrode active materials, direct implementation of MOFs with electrochemically active metal nodes and organic linkers in energy storage technologies has been less explored.

This is why the trilayer Fe-Co-Ni MOF can be actively studied for multiple applications. Figure S37 shows CV curves and Figure S38 displays EIS spectra of the trilayer Fe-Co-Ni MOF as well as the bilayer Fe-Co MOF and the unary Fe MOF and the bare Ni foam substrate.

A couple of well-defined and reversible redox peaks in the CV curve of the trilayer Fe-Co-Ni MOF indicates that the synergistic effect among the metallic centers can account for the enhanced energy storage performance.\n\nWe recorded galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) profiles of the materials to evaluate their energy storage properties. b shows GCD profiles of the different MOF-based electrodes at a specific current of 1 A g-1 in an aqueous 3.0 M KOH electrolyte. The non-linear charge-discharge profile (comprising a battery-like sloping plateau, followed by a steeper slope region in the discharge step) represents a supercapacitor-battery hybrid behavior. The specific capacity of the trilayer Fe-Co-Ni MOF is 168.2 mA h g-1 at a specific current of 1 A g-1, indicating its excellent energy storage performance compared to those of similar MOF-based materials. Moreover, the GCD profile shows only a small IR drop at the beginning of the discharge step, which confirms the low internal resistance of the trilayer Fe-Co-Ni MOF electrode. To further investigate the rate capability of the electrode, we obtained specific capacities at different rates. By increasing the current to 100 A g-1, the electrode retains ~45% of the initial capacity, indicating the high-rate capability of the electrode (c and S39). To examine practical applications of the electrosynthesized trimetallic MOF, we assembled an asymmetric device comprised of an AC negative electrode (the electrochemical characteristics of which are presented in Figure S40) and a trilayer Fe-Co-Ni MOF positive electrode (AC||Fe-Co-Ni MOF). After mass balancing the two electrodes (Figure S41) and acquiring the operating voltage window of the device as 1.5 V (d), we recorded CV curves and GCD profiles (Figure S42) of the device at different rates. Upon increasing the scan rate up to a high value of 200 mV s-1, the initial shape of the CV curve is preserved indicating excellent reversibility and outstanding rate capability of the AC||Fe-Co-Ni MOF device. Quantitative analysis of the GCD profiles at different specific currents from 1 to 40 A g-1 indicates that the device retains 41% of its initial capacity at a high rate of 40 A g-1 (Figure S42d). EIS characterization of the device also demonstrates a low equivalent series resistance (0.50 \u03a9) and a small charge-transfer resistance (R ct, 3.20 \u03a9) for the device (e). Additionally, the Bode phase and magnitude plots of the AC||Fe-Co-Ni MOF device indicate characteristics of a supercapacitor-battery hybrid (f). The characteristic time constant (\u03c40 = 1/f 0, where f 0 is the frequency at a phase angle -45\u00b0) equals 5.1 s. The rapid frequency response of the AC||Fe-Co-Ni MOF device can be ascribed to the large and accessible surface area. The deconvolution of the contribution from capacitive (for which the current response varies directly with \u03bd) and battery-like processes (for which the current response varies with \u03bd1/2) in the total charge of the AC||Fe-Co-Ni MOF device (using , where k 1 and k 2 are constants) shows that the capacitive current accounts for ~80% of the total charge at a sweep rate of 5 mV s-1. \n\nThe device also exhibits an outstanding cycling stability by retaining 80% of the initial capacity after 14,000 cycles at a rate of 5 A g-1 (g). This implies that the Fe-Co-Ni MOF possesses a high structural stability as a crystalline material and its nanomorphology remains almost unchanged during the cycling measurements.\n\nAs a practical application, a single prototype 1 \u00d7 1 cm2 device ran a wireless mouse for about 30 s (h, Video S4), indicating the practical applicability of the proposed materials for energy storage applications. As critically important comparison metrics and to find out where this device stands in terms of energy and power compared to other devices, we provide a Ragone plot (i). Our hybrid device provides a maximum specific energy of 56.2 W h kg-1 at a specific power of 937 W kg-1 and still delivers a high energy of 28.1 W h kg-1 at an extremely high specific power of 42.2 kW kg-1. These values reveal the outstanding energy and power capability of the AC||Fe-Co-Ni MOF device, which are higher than or comparable to those of previously reported MOF-based energy storage devices (Table S7).\n\nConclusions\n\nIn summary, we have designed and successfully synthesized a LbL assembled trimetallic Fe-Co-Ni MOF on a nickel foam substrate via a facile and fast reductive electrosynthesis approach for the first time. The resulting multifunctional superstructure displays a superior trifunctional electrocatalytic performance for HER, OER, and ORR with outstanding catalytic applications for overall water splitting and excellent performance in Zn-air batteries that are far superior to those of the sum of its parts. The material also exhibits an excellent supercapacitor-battery hybrid behavior. The trilayer Fe-Co-Ni MOF delivers an outstanding specific capacity (168.2 mA h g-1), and shows ultralow overpotentials of 116 and 254 mV for HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH to reach a current density of 10 mA cm-2, respectively, along with a very low half-wave potential of 0.75 V for ORR. The fabricated two-electrode electrolyzer using Fe-Co-Ni MOF as both the anode and cathode for overall water splitting demonstrates an efficient system, acquiring a cell voltage of 1.60 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2. The DFT calculations helped us in providing more insights into the OER and HER reaction mechanisms occurring at metal sites on the Fe-Co-Ni-MOF surface. Moreover, the Fe-Co-Ni MOF shows great promise as an air cathode in a zinc-air battery with a high OCV of 1.424 V, an excellent power density of 161 mW cm-2, and an outstanding specific energy of ~945 W h kgZn -1, along with long-term stability. The superior energy storage and conversion performances of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF are attributed to the following characteristics: (1) intimate contact of the Fe-Co-Ni MOF to the Ni foam substrate because of the adaptation of a direct electrosynthesis approach, (2) the porous structure of the MOF that not only enables the full use of active sites toward electrocatalysis but also provides facile evolution of bubbles and escape of the oxygen and hydrogen gases, (3) synergistic effects between the constituent elements of the trimetallic MOF that individually are among the best non-precious metal catalysts for energy applications, (4) fast charge transport through the framework, and (5) uniform distribution of the active materials on the substrate surface that guarantees the long-term stability and durability of the material for these applications. However, there is still a huge window of opportunity for further improvements through which one may gain insights into manipulating the structure and geometry of the LbL assembled MOF for improved conductivity, tailored pore sizes, and enriched functionalities for targeted applications that span the realm from energy storage/conversion, to water harvesting, biomedical applications, gas storage/separations, as well as some other areas, where MOFs are likely to make a difference.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "dielectric constant", "value": "4.5", "unit": "", "condition": "at 1 kHz"}, {"property name": "electrical conductivity", "value": "10^-2", "unit": "S/cm", "condition": "at room temperature"}, {"property name": "electrical resistance", "value": "10^7", "unit": "ohm\u00b7cm", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "energy storage performance", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "specific capacity", "value": "168.2", "unit": "mA h g^-1", "condition": "at a specific current of 1 A g^-1"}, {"property name": "internal resistance", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "rate capability", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "cycling stability", "value": "80%", "unit": "", "condition": "after 14,000 cycles at a rate of 5 A g^-1"}, {"property name": "specific energy", "value": "56.2", "unit": "W h kg^-1", "condition": "at a specific power of 937 W kg^-1"}, {"property name": "specific power", "value": "937", "unit": "W kg^-1", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "specific energy", "value": "28.1", "unit": "W h kg^-1", "condition": "at an extremely high specific power of 42.2 kW kg^-1"}, {"property name": "specific power", "value": "42.2", "unit": "kW kg^-1", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "cycling stability", "value": "80%", "unit": "", "condition": "after 14,000 cycles at a rate of 5 A g^-1"}]}]], "include_properties": ["etc"]}, {"idx": 32, "type": "table", "classification": ["Property"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Natural Elementary Charge (<italic toggle=\"yes\">Q</italic>) on the Transition Metal Atoms (Fe, Co, and Ni), along\nwith the Adsorption Energy (<italic toggle=\"yes\">E</italic>\n<sub>ads</sub>) of H<sub>2</sub>O on the 3Fe MOF, 2Fe\u2013Co MOF, Fe\u20132Co MOF, and\nFe\u2013Co\u2013Ni MOF</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"5\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col5\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\"></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">Q</italic>\n<sub>Fe</sub> (e<xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"t1fn1\"></xref>)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">Q</italic>\n<sub>Co</sub> (e)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">Q</italic>\n<sub>Ni</sub> (e)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">E</italic>\n<sub>ads</sub> (eV)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>3Fe MOF</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>+0.67, +0.65, +0.69</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u20130.37</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>2Fe\u2013Co MOF</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>+0.69, +0.66</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>+0.81</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u20130.45</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>Fe\u20132Co MOF</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>+0.64</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>+0.81, +0.78</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u20130.51</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>Fe\u2013Co\u2013Ni MOF</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>+0.84</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>+0.82</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>+1.01</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u20131.06</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n<table-wrap-foot>\n<fn id=\"t1fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>The unit of electric charge.</p>\n</fn>\n</table-wrap-foot>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "Table 1.
