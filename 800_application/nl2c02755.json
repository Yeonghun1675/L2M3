Herein, we report a facile strategy to fabricate ultrathin metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheet arrays doped with two rare-earth elements, Y and Ce, and self-supported on nickel foam (NF) to enhance the HER and OER performance by constructing abundant active sites and bimetallic synergistic effects. The NiYCe-MOF/NF features an ultrathin nanosheet array structure and is uniformly and richly codoped by Y and Ce. When it was explored as both the anode and cathode electrocatalysts for overall water splitting, it achieved 10 mA cm-2 at 136 and 245 mV for the HER and OER in an alkaline electrolyte, respectively. Notably, an extremely low cell voltage of 1.54 V was required to achieve 100 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH solution, making it a promising substitute for noble-metal catalysts.\n\nHerein, we report the synthesis of Y- and Ce-doped ultrathin MOF nanosheet array electrocatalysts by a simple hydrothermal method using Ni-MOF as a template. The obtained NiYCe-MOF/NF was employed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst to explore the overall water splitting. In particular, the structural characterizations verified that the doping of rare-earth atoms at the Ni sites induced electron transfer to the Ni sites. Benefiting from the unique electronic and structural features of the constructed catalyst, the resulting NiYCe-MOF/NF showed excellent electrochemical HER and OER activities with overpotentials of 136 and 245 mV at 10 mA cm-2, respectively, which are significantly better than those of previously reported Ni-MOF-based catalysts.\n\nXANES and EXAFS were measured to further explore the chemical states of typical Ni-MOF and NiYCe-MOF using Ni foil, NiO, and Ni(OH)2 as references. As shown in a, the peaks of the samples located at approximately 8349 eV in the pre-edge region can be attributed to the dipole-forbidden but quadrupole-allowed transition from 1s to 3d, which were equivalent to the NiO benchmark. The positions of the rising edges of the samples compared to the reference value of the Ni foil indicated that the oxidation state of Ni was between Ni0 and NiII. Meanwhile, the rising-edge positions of Ni-MOF were negatively shifted compared to those of NiO, while NiYCe-MOF showed a similar trend. This phenomenon indicated that some electrons were transferred to the site of Ni after the introduction of Y and Ce, which may be due to the rearrangement of electron distribution caused by the interaction of Ni with rare-earth elements. As presented in b, the FT-EXAFS intensities of all the corresponding peaks for the NiYCe-MOF were decreased relative to those of Ni foil, NiO, Ni(OH)2, and Ni-MOF control samples, indicating an increase in the coordination number of the Ni atoms. The EXAFS spectra of Ni-MOF and NiYCe-MOF showed a main peak at 1.62 \u00c5, corresponding to Ni-O coordination, which indicated that Ni ions were dominant in the oxidation state. The above results showed that the coordination number of the Ni-O shell remained nearly constant after Y and Ce codoping, suggesting a well-preserved stability structure. At the same time, the maximum intensities of Ni states in the WT contour map of Ni-MOF and NiYCe-MOF were also significantly different from those of Ni foil and NiO (c-f), suggesting that the Y and Ce heteroatoms were successfully doped into the Ni-MOF matrix. g shows that NiYCe-MOF exhibited a highly abundant porous structure along with the highest absorption capacity, resulting in the highest specific surface area (124.6 m2/g); additionally, the specific surface areas of Ni-MOF, NiCe-MOF, and NiYCe-MOF were 106.4, 112.0, and 94.2 m2/g, respectively (Figure S13). In addition, the porous structure of NiYCe-MOF further exhibited a hierarchical porous size, extending from nanometers to sub-micrometers, with an average pore size of 30 nm (see the inset in g). These results indicated that NiYCe-MOF contained a substantial number of mesopores, which favored the mass transfer process.\n\nThe electrocatalytic performances of the samples were evaluated in 1.0 M KOH solution with a typical system of commercial Pt/C (20 wt %) and RuO2 catalysts as benchmarks. The quantitative analysis data of doping elements and the amounts of catalyst loadings are detailed in Figured S14-S16 in the Supporting Information. A representative LSV test (a) shows that NiYCe-MOF/NF exhibited superior OER activity compared with Ni-MOF/NF, NiY-MOF/NF, and NiCe-MOF/NF. Even the OER performance of NiYCe-MOF/NF is significantly better than that of commercial RuO2. Likewise, the line-fitting Tafel plot of 65 mV dec-1 for NiYCe-MOF/NF in b was lower than those of Ni-MOF/NF, NiY-MOF/NF, NiCe-MOF/NF, and commercial RuO2, indicating the more effective reaction kinetics of NiYCe-MOF/NF for the OER. As shown in c, a chronopotentiometric test was employed to estimate the stability of NiYCe-MOF/NF. The retention rate of the initial catalytic activity can reach 94% after 100 h at 100 mA cm-2, while NiYCe-MOF/NF a suffered slight performance degradation (10%) at 200 mA cm-2. The above analysis results illustrated that NiYCe-MOF/NF possessed excellent stability in the long-term OER operation process. As shown in Figure S17, the EIS of the samples showed that NiYCe-MOF/NF exhibited a small polarization resistance and demonstrated faster catalytic kinetics and an enhanced electron transfer rate relative to Ni-MOF/NF, NiY-MOF/NF, and NiCe-MOF/NF due to the abundant active catalytic sites and the synergistic effect between different metal centers. In addition, the electrochemical active surface areas (ECSAs) were also calculated by measuring the Cdl values from CV curves (d and Figure S18). NiYCe-MOF/NF exhibited a Cdl value of nearly 36.5 mF cm-2, higher than those of Ni-MOF/NF (4.1 mF cm-2), NiY-MOF/NF (25.9 mF cm-2) and NiCe-MOF/NF electrodes (29.8 mF cm-2), indicating that NiYCe-MOF/NF was equipped with more active sites. The mass activity (the current density normalized to the mass) of NiYCe-MOF/NF was 614 A g-1 at 1.5 V vs RHE, which was approximately 6-fold higher than that of RuO2 (e). The corresponding specific activity (the current density normalized to the ECSA) of NiYCe-MOF/NF was 22.6 mA cm-2, which was 7 times higher than that of the commercial RuO2 catalyst. In contrast, Ni-MOF/NF had almost no catalytic activity toward the OER. As shown in f and Table S1, the as-prepared NiYCe-MOF/NF showed remarkable catalytic performance compared with state-of-the-art RuO2 and other recently reported OER electrocatalysts, suggesting that NiYCe-MOF/NF was a promising substitute for noble-metal electrocatalysts.\n\nAs shown in a, the HER activity was first evaluated by LSV at 10 mV s-1; NiYCe-MOF/NF showed the highest HER activity with the lowest overpotential of 136 mV vs RHE, which was obviously better than those of Ni-MOF/NF (260 mV), NiY-MOF/NF (236 mV), and NiCe-MOF/NF (180 mV) at 10 mA cm-2. Moreover, the catalytic HER reaction kinetics were investigated by fitting the corresponding Tafel slopes to the LSV curves (b). The Tafel slope of NiYCe-MOF/NF was 74 mV dec-1, lower than those of Ni-MOF/NF (148 mV dec-1), NiY-MOF/NF (126 mV dec-1), and NiCe-MOF/NF (91 mV dec-1), indicating a more favorable electrocatalytic kinetics for the HER. The HER durability of NiYCe-MOF/NF was also tested by running 3000 consecutive LSV cycles and long-term chronopotentiometric tests over 100 h (c). In all, 3000 LSV cycles under a low-voltage window showed negligible current degeneration. Meanwhile, the chronopotentiometric test results showed that NiYCe-MOF/NF can be stably operated for more than 100 h with almost no attenuation.\n\nTo evaluate the electrocatalytic stability of the constructed samples in practical applications, overall water-splitting measurements were performed in a two-electrode cell (d).

The chemical compositions of NiYCe-MOF were also deeply investigated after a 240 h long-term test (Figures S19 and S20). It can be seen that the morphology of NiYCe-MOF can still be well maintained, and the XRD pattern of NiYCe-MOF/NF after testing showed that the characteristic peaks were still tightly held without the formation of the other phase, demonstrating that the MOF structure effectively prevented the corrosion of the metal.
