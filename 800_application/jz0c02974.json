However, no obvious broadening was observed in the time-dependent PL intensity profiles (Figure S8). This suggests that the exciton transport distance in the PQD film is shorter than our instrument spatial resolution (~54 nm, see Supplementary Note 1). We therefore designed a PL-quenching measurement to determine the diffusion coefficient and diffusion length in the PQD solid film. By applying [6,6]-Phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM, electron acceptor) to the surface of the PQDs solid film, the PL intensity of PQDs is quenched (a, quenching efficiency \u03b7Quench = 33.8%) along with a faster PL decay (c). For the PQDs film with a thickness of ~200 nm, the PL quenching process should then include the transport of excitons to the PQDs/PCBM interface followed by an ultrafast interfacial electron transfer (~10 ps, Figure S9) from PQD to PCBM. Therefore, by fitting the PL decays of PQDs solid film with and without PCBM (c) to a 1D exciton diffusion and surface quenching model (see Supplementary Note 2 and Figure S10 for details), a diffusion coefficient of D = 0.0022 \u00b1 2.1 \u00d7 10-5 cm2/s and L  D  = 40.3 \u00b1 0.2 nm were determined. This exciton transport distance is similar to those in PbS and CdSe QD solid films and is about 7 times shorter than that in PQDs@MOF.\n\nThe observed long-distance exciton transport in MAPbBr3 PQDs@MOF indicates a very efficient exciton hopping between the PQDs embedded in the MOF crystal. We believe that the dot-to-dot energy transfer in PQDs@MOF should follow a Fo\u0308rster resonance energy-transfer (FRET) mechanism, rather than the Dexter energy-transfer pathway. This is because the centroid distance between adjacent PQDs in MOF is ~3.34 nm in average, which is much longer than the critical distance for the Dexter energy transfer. According to a reported exciton hopping model, the exciton hopping time (\u03c4Hop) between adjacent PQDs is estimated to be \u03c4Hop = 0.87 ps for PQDs@MOF and 53.2 ps for PQDs solid films by using their corresponding exciton diffusion lengths and exciton lifetimes (see Supplementary Note 3 for calculation). The obtained exciton hopping time for PQDs@MOF is 61.1 times faster than that of PQDs solid film. According to the FRET model, the huge difference in energy-transfer time should mainly result from the different dot-to-dot distance, which is 3.34 nm in PQDs@MOF and ~5.92 nm in PQD solid film (see Supplementary Note 4). \n\nIn summary, using time-resolved and PL-scanned imaging microscopy, we observed a high diffusion coefficient of 0.0428 \u00b1 0.0039 cm2/s and a long 1D exciton diffusion length of 278 \u00b1 12.6 nm in MAPbBr3 PQDs@MOF crystals. This long exciton diffusion length is enabled by an efficient dot-to-dot energy migration (~0.87 ps) in the PQDs@MOF and also a longer exciton lifetime caused by surface passivation of PQDs encapsulated in MOF. We speculate that similar long-distance exciton transport may also occur in other PQDs@MOF materials with different perovskite compositions and MOF structures, establishing the potential of this class of material for application in PQD-based optoelectronic devices.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "PQDs@MOF", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "exciton diffusion distance", "value": "278 \u00b1 12.6", "unit": "nm", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "diffusion coefficient", "value": "0.0428 \u00b1 0.0039", "unit": "cm^2/s", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "exciton hopping time", "value": "0.87", "unit": "ps", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["etc"]}, {"idx": 4, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Schematic of exciton\ntransport process in PQDs@MOF.
