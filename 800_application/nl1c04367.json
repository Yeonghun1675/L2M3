Two asymmetric peaks appear in the process of Li+ migration because the surrounding ion environment of Li ions that migrated from layer A to layer B (Li1) is different from those that migrated from layer B to layer A (Li2). The corresponding Li+ diffusion energy barrier at Li1 site for Cu-THQ is much higher than that for Cu/Co-THQ and Cu/Ni-THQ, suggesting that the lowest Li+ migration occurs in the pristine Cu-THQ. Furthermore, a lower energy barrier is obtained in Cu/Co-THQ at Li2 site compared with that in Cu/Ni-THQ, which is beneficial for fast reaction kinetics and superior electrochemical properties of Cu/Co-THQ. The smallest bandgap of the Cu/Co-THQ is demonstrated by UV-vis spectra (f), which is calculated to be ~0.34 eV, much lower than that for the Cu-THQ (0.72 eV) and Cu/Ni-THQ (0.57 eV). This result matches well with the DFT results. Therefore, the Cu/Co-THQ@CNTs@rGO microlattice in all of the M-THQ@CNTs@rGO microlattice cathode 12 layers thick achieves the best electrochemical performance according to the X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectrum and experimental results (g-i).", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 14, "type": "text", "classification": ["property"], "content": "<p>The 3D-printed LIHCs device is composed of 3D-printed Cu/Co-THQ@CNTs@rGO\ncathode, C60@VNNWs@rGO anode, and LiPF<sub>6</sub>/EC/DMC liquid electrolyte\n(a, <ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c04367/suppl_file/nl1c04367_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S21</ext-link>).

In these electrodes, the viscous pseudoplastic positive electrode's nanocomposite ink is composed of M-THQ, CNTs and rGO, while that of the negative electrode consists of the fullerene (C60), VN nanowires (VNNWs), and rGO. In these microlattices, M-THQ, VNNWs, and rGO yield high capacitance, which combined with thick electrode architectures with high specific surface area, resulting in a high energy density. Moreover, the high electrical conductivity of CNTs and rGO enables a fast charge transfer within the thick electrode, enhancing the electrochemical property of the electrodes. Furthermore, the M-THQ and C60 can be served as the \"lubricant\" between the rGO layers, modifying the partial structural deformation (Figure S1). Moreover, the porous aerogels with periodic microlattices are constructed from mixed-dimensional components, maintaining structural stability under a certain extent of deformation. Regarding the charge balance between the Cu/Co-THQ@CNTs@rGO aerogel cathode and C60@VNNWs@rGO aerogel anode, the assembled LIHCs device delivers a high operating voltage of 4 V, a maximum gravimetric specific capacity of 178.68 F g-1 and gravimetric energy density of 396.89 Wh kg-1. Therefore, the strategy of constructing multidimensional architectures provides an effective approach for the next-generation scalable energy storage devices.\n\nThe 2D Cu-THQ, Cu/Co-THQ (Cu/Co = 39:61), and Cu/Ni-THQ (Cu/Ni = 43:57) were synthesized by a kinetically controlled synthesis process, and the specific statements are provided in Supporting Information (SI). The field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and the high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images clearly reveal the morphology and microstructures of 2D Cu-THQ, Cu/Co-THQ and Cu/Ni-THQ with the crystallite sizes are around 10-30 nm (Figure S2a-f). All of the hexagonal pores of 2D Cu-THQ, Cu/Co-THQ, and Cu/Ni-THQ are ~1.2 nm, corresponding to the expected structure and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern (a-c, Figure S3c-f), and the crystalline structures of Cu-THQ, Cu/Co-THQ, and Cu/Ni-THQ agree well with their standard Kagome lattice and reported PXRD patterns of Cu-THQ (a, Figure S3a,b), which manifests the formation of M-THQ. Rietveld refinements of M-THQ (green line in a and Figure S3a,b) demonstrate that the unit cell ascribes to Cmcm space group, which is consistent with agreement with the previous reports. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra (d) of Cu-THQ, Cu/Co-THQ, and Cu/Ni-THQ exhibit that the absorption features at 3350 and 1700 cm-1 correspond to C-O and C\ue5fbO stretching modes, respectively. Additionally, a wide band at 3000 cm-1 was discovered in FTIR spectra of the above-mentioned ink materials, which is in accordance with the NH stretching modes of ethylenediamine molecules within the CMOFs for charge balancing. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra demonstrate that a mixed valence state of Cu centered is presented in all of the M-THQ (e), which agrees well with the previous report. Furthermore, O 1s XPS spectra (f) exhibits the binding energy of the O 1s electron increases when changing the metal atom in THQ from Cu (530.53 eV) to Cu/Co (530.67 eV), indicating that outer electron density on the O-M-O motif reduced with the introduction of Co atoms.\n\nFurthermore, electrochemical performances of Cu-THQ@CNTs@rGO, Cu/Co-THQ@CNTs@rGO, and Cu/Ni-THQ@CNTs@rGO microlattice cathodes were investigated in a two-electrode system. Benefiting from the high specific surface areas of Cu-THQ@CNTs@rGO, Cu/Co-THQ@CNTs@rGO, and Cu/Ni-THQ@CNTs@rGO microlattices (Figure S8d, Figure S9d, and Figure S12), the 3D-printed Cu/Co-THQ@CNTs@rGO electrode with four layers achieved a high specific capacity of 338.19 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1. The 3D-printed Cu/Co-THQ@CNTs@rGO with 8 and 12 layers shows a similar gravimetric capacity with 4 layers (332.18 and 325.44 mAh g-1, respectively), which demonstrates that ion diffusion continues to not restrict the capacitive performance even in the 12 layers thick electrode (m). Additionally, the 3D-printed electrode with 16 layers thick yields a low capacity due to the long electron transfer path (m). To realize the feasibility and practicability of the printing microlattice cathode, the Cu/Co-THQ@CNTs@rGO electrode with 12 layers is selected. no, Figure S13, Figure S14, and Figure S15 indicate that the 3D-printed Cu/Co-THQ@CNTs@rGO electrode delivers an excellent rate and cycling performance, low electrical resistance, and high reversibility. Moreover, the electrochemical performance of the C60@VNNWs@rGO microlattice anode was investigated (Figure S16), the specific details are provided in the SI.\n\nDensity functional theory (DFT) calculations were also performed to deepen the understanding about the process of improvement in electrochemical performance of Cu/Co-THQ. Density of states (DOS) plots of Cu-THQ, Cu/Co-THQ, and Cu/Ni-THQ are demonstrated in d and Figure S20a,b, respectively. Evidently, no band gap at 0 eV can be observed, revealing that all Cu-THQ, Cu/Co-THQ, and Cu/Ni-THQ show metallic properties. Meanwhile, there is a conspicuous band gap at 2.5 eV in Cu-THQ and Cu/Ni-THQ, which indicates that Cu/Co-THQ possesses more empty states for electrons, and consequently higher electronic conductivity (Table S4). In addition, the Li+ migration through Cu-THQ, CuCo-MOF, and CuNi-MOF was surveyed by climbing-image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) methods. The calculated energy barrier of Li-ion migration for three THQs is shown in e and Figure S20c,d. The inset of these figures displays the corresponding migration process, containing seven Li ions which represent the whole path. Two asymmetric peaks appear in the process of Li+ migration because the surrounding ion environment of Li ions that migrated from layer A to layer B (Li1) is different from those that migrated from layer B to layer A (Li2). The corresponding Li+ diffusion energy barrier at Li1 site for Cu-THQ is much higher than that for Cu/Co-THQ and Cu/Ni-THQ, suggesting that the lowest Li+ migration occurs in the pristine Cu-THQ. Furthermore, a lower energy barrier is obtained in Cu/Co-THQ at Li2 site compared with that in Cu/Ni-THQ, which is beneficial for fast reaction kinetics and superior electrochemical properties of Cu/Co-THQ. The smallest bandgap of the Cu/Co-THQ is demonstrated by UV-vis spectra (f), which is calculated to be ~0.34 eV, much lower than that for the Cu-THQ (0.72 eV) and Cu/Ni-THQ (0.57 eV). This result matches well with the DFT results. Therefore, the Cu/Co-THQ@CNTs@rGO microlattice in all of the M-THQ@CNTs@rGO microlattice cathode 12 layers thick achieves the best electrochemical performance according to the X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectrum and experimental results (g-i).\n\nThe 3D-printed LIHCs device is composed of 3D-printed Cu/Co-THQ@CNTs@rGO cathode, C60@VNNWs@rGO anode, and LiPF6/EC/DMC liquid electrolyte (a, Figure S21). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) carried out on the 3D-printed LIHCs device between 0 and 4.0 V is exhibited in Figure S22a, demonstrating an excellent reversibility. b exhibits the charging/discharging curves of the 3D-printed LIHCs device at the different current densities of 1-12 A g-1 in a two-electrode configuration. The large specific capacity of 178.68 F g-1 and symmetric triangular-like GCD curves (b,c) demonstrate that the 3D-printed LIHCs deliver a fine capacitive behavior and rate capability. Additionally, the 3D-printed LIHC device yields an excellent areal specific capacitance of 2.99 F cm-2 and volumetric specific capacitance of 53.98 F cm-3. These values have exceeded those of previously reported electrochemical energy storage systems (d), such as M-TiO2-RG//PDPC, TSNs electrode, 3D-Ti3C2//HPAC, G-ZVO||OM-HSTC, OCG||OCG, PEDOT@MnO2//C@Fe3O4, CNT@MnO2/CNT@PPy, rGO/CNT@NiCo BOH, MnO x @TiN/C@TiN, VN-RGO//APDC, G/ZnV2O6/Co3V2O8//G/VN, and 3D GA/MnO2//SF-3D GA. Meanwhile, the relatively low electrical resistance of the as-printed LIHCs demonstrates its excellent electrochemical performance (Figure S22b). Ragone plots of the 3D-printed LIHCs show a high gravimetric energy density of 396.89 Wh kg-1 at the gravimetric power density of 1999.90 W kg-1, depict a gravimetric energy density of 313.56 Wh kg-1 at a ultrahigh gravimetric power density of 24002.04 W kg-1 (e), which surpasses the most advanced energy storage devices reported previously, and further confirm the excellent electrochemical property of the printed LIHCs device.
