First, the biocompatibility of ZCNs (60, 110, and 200 nm) is measured with 293T cell lines (a), indicating that the ZCNs have a good biocompatibility with normal cells; meanwhile, the dark toxicity of the ZCNs is measured with A549 cell lines for 24 h. As shown in b, all A549 cell viabilities are over 90%, even at the highest concentration (200 \u03bcg mL-1), indicating excellent biocompatibility of the ZCNs. Subsequently, to test the phototherapy effect in vitro, cellular uptake experiments are performed to verify the suitable treatment point; the results (Figure S16, Supporting Information) show that 4 h is enough for the uptake of ZCNs, which are then cultured with A549 cancer cells and irradiated with 808 nm laser (3 W cm-2, 5 min). As shown in c, A549 cells are killed in a dose-dependent manner after 808 nm laser treatment with ZCNs and the IC50 of ZCN-60, ZCN-110, and ZCN-200 for phototherapy are 37.6, 36.1, and 33.7 \u03bcg mL-1, respectively. Noteworthy, when the concentration of ZCNs is 50 \u03bcg mL-1, the MTT results reveal that ZCN-110 and ZCN-200 show a significantly better phototherapy effects to kill cancer cells compared with ZCN-60; meanwhile, a much significant result appears when the concentration rises up to 100 \u03bcg mL-1. This phenomenon can be attributed to the enhanced phototherapy effects with the increase in nanoparticle size because the photothermal effects and the ROS generation are enhanced with increase in the nanoparticle size, respectively, and the combination of PTT and PDT can kill much more cancer cells. Meanwhile, as a representative, the respective PDT and PTT therapeutic effects of ZCN-110 are further measured (d). For the 4 \u00b0C + NIR group, in which the heating effect of the photothermal effects is eliminated, the results predominate the PDT effect. The cell viability is about 45% when the concentration is 50 \u03bcg mL-1. Meanwhile, NaN3, which is a well-known ROS scavenger to avoid ROS generation, and the 25 \u00b0C + NIR + NaN3 group reveal the PTT effect and the cell viability is about 38%. However, the cell viability of the 25 \u00b0C + NIR group is about 18% when the concentration is 50 \u03bcg mL-1, this result illustrates that the heat and ROS generated by the ZCNs can effective kill cancer cells by the combination of PTT and PDT. Meanwhile, confocal fluorescence imaging of calcein acetoxymethyl ester (calcein-AM) and propodium (PI) co-stained with A549 cells also reveals the phototherapy efficacy of ZCN-110. From the CLSM pictures (e), the results show that the cells are barely alive, which illustrates that the ZCNs could kill cancer cells under NIR laser irradiation. Hemolysis experiments are measured to detect the biocompatibility of ZCNs (Figure S17, Supporting Information), the distilled water group shows obvious color change; however, the PBS group and of the ZCNs group (200 \u03bcg mL-1) shows a clear supernatant, indicating a good biocompatibility and biosafety of the injection.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 30, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig4\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Cell viability\nof 293T cells (a) and A549 cells (b) incubated with\nZCN-60, ZCN-110, and ZCN-200 for 24 h with different concentrations.\n(c) In vitro phototherapy efficacy of ZCN-60, ZCN-110, and ZCN-200\nin various concentrations on A549 cells upon NIR laser irradiation\n(808 nm, 3 W cm<sup>\u20132</sup>, irradiation time = 300 s).

Notably, due to the constitution of graphite-like carbon from the\nZCNs, these nanomaterials are generally regarded as good photothermal\nagents for PTT. The results show that original ZIF-8 nanoparticles\nhave rare photothermal effects (a). However, after carbonization, all the ZCNs have\npotential as photothermal agents. Meanwhile, with increase in the\ncarbonization temperature, the photothermal effects improve and ZCN-110\n(900 \u00b0C) shows the best photothermal effects (\u0394T \u2248\n40 \u00b0C), with further increase in the temperature reducing the\nphotothermal effect of ZCN-110 (1000 \u00b0C). To reveal the rule\nof the photothermal effects, UV\u2013vis spectra are measured (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.8b15828/suppl_file/am8b15828_si_001.pdf\">Figure S12</ext-link>, Supporting Information), the UV\u2013vis\nabsorption at 808 nm enhanced with increase in carbonization temperature.\nThe relationship between photothermal\neffects and absorbance at 808 nm is shown in b, with the results indicating that improvement\nin photothermal effects can contribute to the increase in absorbance\nat 808 nm. Hence, 900 \u00b0C is an ideal carbonization temperature\nfor photothermal effects and selected for this work.</p><p>Meanwhile, according\nto our knowledge, many nanoparticles show\nenhanced photothermal effects with increase in the nanoparticle size. Hence, three sizes of ZCNs (60, 110, and 200 nm) are utilized to\ndemonstrate whether the size of the nanoparticles does influence the\nphotothermal performance. The results show an enhanced photothermal\neffects with the increase in the size of ZCNs (c). ZCN-200 can elevate the temperature to\n70 \u00b0C after NIR laser irradiation (808 nm, 3 W cm<sup>\u20132</sup>); however, the temperatures increase to 64.5 and 60 \u00b0C for\nZCN-110 and ZCN-60. To find the reason for this phenomenon, two factors\nare considered: the absorbance at 808 nm and photothermal conversion\nefficiency (\u03b7). As shown in d, the absorbance of ZCNs increases with\nincrease in the size of the nanoparticles at 808 nm. Meanwhile, the\n\u03b7 values of ZCN-60, ZCN-110, and ZCN-200 are calculated as 36.5,\n42.7, and 41.6%, respectively (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.8b15828/suppl_file/am8b15828_si_001.pdf\">Figure S13</ext-link>, Supporting Information). The photothermal conversion efficiency\nof ZCN-200 and ZCN-110 is higher than that of other photothermal agents,\nsuch as carbon nanospheres, carbon dots, and gold nanoshells. Therefore, owing to the enhanced NIR absorbance and photothermal\nconversion efficiency, the ZCNs exhibit enhanced photothermal effects\nwith increase in size.</p><title>ROS Generation of ZCNs</title><p>With a porphyrin-like\nstructure of carbon nanoparticles, which has been proved to be constructed from divacancy and four pyridinic Ns, and a strong NIR\nabsorbance, these materials also have the prerequisites as PDT photosensitizer. To confirm the ROS generation of ZCNs upon NIR\nlaser irradiation, free indocyanine green (ICG) is selected as the\nreference to calculate the ROS quantum yield of different sizes of\nZCNs. In the experiment, the absorptions of ZCNs and ICG\u2013phosphate-buffered\nsaline (PBS) solution at 808 nm are adjusted to about 0.5 OD to avoid\ninner-filter effects. As shown in a\u2013d, the UV\u2013vis absorbance\nof both ICG and ZCNs systems at 419 nm declined after NIR laser irradiation,\nwhich is the characteristic absorption of 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran\n(DPBF) as the ROS trapping agent, indicating\nthat DPBF is photobleached by ROS generated by ZCNs and ICG. The rate\nconstant for DPBF decomposition by ZCNs is little faster than that\nof ICG (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.8b15828/suppl_file/am8b15828_si_001.pdf\">Figure S14</ext-link>, Supporting Information).\nMoreover, compared with ICG (\u03a6<sub>ICG</sub> = 0.0020), the\nROS quantum yields of ZCN-60, ZCN-110, and ZCN-200 are calculated\nto be \u22480.0022, 0.0023, and 0.0024, respectively. The results\nalso show the generation of ROS enhanced with the increase in the\nnanoparticle size. Meanwhile, we find out that Zn element is not the\nkey factor for ZCNs to generate ROS. After HCl solution treatment,\nZCN-110 (non-Zn) is utilized to confirm the ROS generation upon NIR\nlaser irradiation. As the results show (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.8b15828/suppl_file/am8b15828_si_001.pdf\">Figure S15</ext-link>, Supporting Information), DPBF is also photobleached by\nZCN-110 (non-Zn) and the ROS quantum yield is \u22480.0019, which\nis slightly lower than the value of ZCN-110. The results prove that\nthe non-Zn ZCN-110 can also generate ROS and Zn element in the ZCNs\nonly slightly affects the efficiency of the generation of ROS.</p><title>In Vitro Phototherapy</title><p>Encouraged\nby the excellent phototherapy results, we further investigate its\nbioapplication in vitro. Standard MTT assay is employed to reveal\nthe phototherapy efficacy of ZCNs in vitro. First, the biocompatibility\nof ZCNs (60, 110, and 200 nm) is measured with 293T cell lines (a), indicating that\nthe ZCNs have a good biocompatibility with normal cells; meanwhile,\nthe dark toxicity of the ZCNs is measured with A549 cell lines for\n24 h. As shown in b, all A549 cell viabilities are over 90%, even at the highest\nconcentration (200 \u03bcg mL<sup>\u20131</sup>), indicating excellent\nbiocompatibility of the ZCNs. Subsequently, to test the phototherapy\neffect in vitro, cellular uptake experiments are performed to verify\nthe suitable treatment point; the results (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.8b15828/suppl_file/am8b15828_si_001.pdf\">Figure S16</ext-link>, Supporting Information) show that 4 h is enough for the\nuptake of ZCNs, which are then cultured with A549 cancer cells and\nirradiated with 808 nm laser (3 W cm<sup>\u20132</sup>, 5 min).\nAs shown in c, A549 cells are killed in a dose-dependent manner after 808 nm\nlaser treatment with ZCNs and the IC50 of ZCN-60, ZCN-110, and ZCN-200\nfor phototherapy are 37.6, 36.1, and 33.7 \u03bcg mL<sup>\u20131</sup>, respectively. Noteworthy, when the concentration of ZCNs is 50\n\u03bcg mL<sup>\u20131</sup>, the MTT results reveal that ZCN-110\nand ZCN-200 show a significantly better phototherapy effects to kill\ncancer cells compared with ZCN-60; meanwhile, a much significant result\nappears when the concentration rises up to 100 \u03bcg mL<sup>\u20131</sup>. This phenomenon can be attributed to the enhanced phototherapy\neffects with the increase in nanoparticle size because the photothermal\neffects and the ROS generation are enhanced with increase in the nanoparticle\nsize, respectively, and the combination of PTT and PDT can kill much\nmore cancer cells. Meanwhile, as a representative, the respective\nPDT and PTT therapeutic effects of ZCN-110 are further measured (d). For the 4 \u00b0C\n+ NIR group, in which the heating effect of the photothermal effects\nis eliminated, the results predominate the PDT effect. The cell viability\nis about 45% when the concentration is 50 \u03bcg mL<sup>\u20131</sup>. Meanwhile, NaN<sub>3</sub>, which is a well-known ROS scavenger\nto avoid ROS generation, and the 25 \u00b0C + NIR + NaN<sub>3</sub> group reveal the PTT effect and the cell viability is about 38%.\nHowever, the cell viability of the 25 \u00b0C + NIR group is about\n18% when the concentration is 50 \u03bcg mL<sup>\u20131</sup>,\nthis result illustrates that the heat and ROS generated by the ZCNs\ncan effective kill cancer cells by the combination of PTT and PDT.\nMeanwhile, confocal fluorescence imaging of calcein acetoxymethyl\nester (calcein-AM) and propodium (PI) co-stained with A549 cells also\nreveals the phototherapy efficacy of ZCN-110. From the CLSM pictures\n(e), the results\nshow that the cells are barely alive, which illustrates that the ZCNs\ncould kill cancer cells under NIR laser irradiation. Hemolysis experiments\nare measured to detect the biocompatibility of ZCNs (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.8b15828/suppl_file/am8b15828_si_001.pdf\">Figure S17</ext-link>, Supporting Information), the distilled water group\nshows obvious color change; however, the PBS group and of the ZCNs\ngroup (200 \u03bcg mL<sup>\u20131</sup>) shows a clear supernatant,\nindicating a good biocompatibility and biosafety of the injection.</p>", "clean_text": "Results and Discussion\n\nPreparation of ZIF-8-Derived Carbon Nanoparticles\n\nZIF-8 nanoparticles are prepared by directly mixing different molar ratios of 2-methylimidazole with zinc nitrate hexahydrate in methanol at 40 \u00b0C for 2 h.

Notably, due to the constitution of graphite-like carbon from the ZCNs, these nanomaterials are generally regarded as good photothermal agents for PTT. The results show that original ZIF-8 nanoparticles have rare photothermal effects (a). However, after carbonization, all the ZCNs have potential as photothermal agents. Meanwhile, with increase in the carbonization temperature, the photothermal effects improve and ZCN-110 (900 \u00b0C) shows the best photothermal effects (\u0394T ~ 40 \u00b0C), with further increase in the temperature reducing the photothermal effect of ZCN-110 (1000 \u00b0C). To reveal the rule of the photothermal effects, UV-vis spectra are measured (Figure S12, Supporting Information), the UV-vis absorption at 808 nm enhanced with increase in carbonization temperature. The relationship between photothermal effects and absorbance at 808 nm is shown in b, with the results indicating that improvement in photothermal effects can contribute to the increase in absorbance at 808 nm. Hence, 900 \u00b0C is an ideal carbonization temperature for photothermal effects and selected for this work.\n\nMeanwhile, according to our knowledge, many nanoparticles show enhanced photothermal effects with increase in the nanoparticle size. Hence, three sizes of ZCNs (60, 110, and 200 nm) are utilized to demonstrate whether the size of the nanoparticles does influence the photothermal performance. The results show an enhanced photothermal effects with the increase in the size of ZCNs (c). ZCN-200 can elevate the temperature to 70 \u00b0C after NIR laser irradiation (808 nm, 3 W cm-2); however, the temperatures increase to 64.5 and 60 \u00b0C for ZCN-110 and ZCN-60. To find the reason for this phenomenon, two factors are considered: the absorbance at 808 nm and photothermal conversion efficiency (\u03b7). As shown in d, the absorbance of ZCNs increases with increase in the size of the nanoparticles at 808 nm. Meanwhile, the \u03b7 values of ZCN-60, ZCN-110, and ZCN-200 are calculated as 36.5, 42.7, and 41.6%, respectively (Figure S13, Supporting Information). The photothermal conversion efficiency of ZCN-200 and ZCN-110 is higher than that of other photothermal agents, such as carbon nanospheres, carbon dots, and gold nanoshells. Therefore, owing to the enhanced NIR absorbance and photothermal conversion efficiency, the ZCNs exhibit enhanced photothermal effects with increase in size.\n\nROS Generation of ZCNs\n\nWith a porphyrin-like structure of carbon nanoparticles, which has been proved to be constructed from divacancy and four pyridinic Ns, and a strong NIR absorbance, these materials also have the prerequisites as PDT photosensitizer. To confirm the ROS generation of ZCNs upon NIR laser irradiation, free indocyanine green (ICG) is selected as the reference to calculate the ROS quantum yield of different sizes of ZCNs. In the experiment, the absorptions of ZCNs and ICG-phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution at 808 nm are adjusted to about 0.5 OD to avoid inner-filter effects. As shown in a-d, the UV-vis absorbance of both ICG and ZCNs systems at 419 nm declined after NIR laser irradiation, which is the characteristic absorption of 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) as the ROS trapping agent, indicating that DPBF is photobleached by ROS generated by ZCNs and ICG. The rate constant for DPBF decomposition by ZCNs is little faster than that of ICG (Figure S14, Supporting Information). Moreover, compared with ICG (\u03a6ICG = 0.0020), the ROS quantum yields of ZCN-60, ZCN-110, and ZCN-200 are calculated to be ~0.0022, 0.0023, and 0.0024, respectively. The results also show the generation of ROS enhanced with the increase in the nanoparticle size. Meanwhile, we find out that Zn element is not the key factor for ZCNs to generate ROS. After HCl solution treatment, ZCN-110 (non-Zn) is utilized to confirm the ROS generation upon NIR laser irradiation. As the results show (Figure S15, Supporting Information), DPBF is also photobleached by ZCN-110 (non-Zn) and the ROS quantum yield is ~0.0019, which is slightly lower than the value of ZCN-110. The results prove that the non-Zn ZCN-110 can also generate ROS and Zn element in the ZCNs only slightly affects the efficiency of the generation of ROS.\n\nIn Vitro Phototherapy\n\nEncouraged by the excellent phototherapy results, we further investigate its bioapplication in vitro. Standard MTT assay is employed to reveal the phototherapy efficacy of ZCNs in vitro. First, the biocompatibility of ZCNs (60, 110, and 200 nm) is measured with 293T cell lines (a), indicating that the ZCNs have a good biocompatibility with normal cells; meanwhile, the dark toxicity of the ZCNs is measured with A549 cell lines for 24 h. As shown in b, all A549 cell viabilities are over 90%, even at the highest concentration (200 \u03bcg mL-1), indicating excellent biocompatibility of the ZCNs. Subsequently, to test the phototherapy effect in vitro, cellular uptake experiments are performed to verify the suitable treatment point; the results (Figure S16, Supporting Information) show that 4 h is enough for the uptake of ZCNs, which are then cultured with A549 cancer cells and irradiated with 808 nm laser (3 W cm-2, 5 min). As shown in c, A549 cells are killed in a dose-dependent manner after 808 nm laser treatment with ZCNs and the IC50 of ZCN-60, ZCN-110, and ZCN-200 for phototherapy are 37.6, 36.1, and 33.7 \u03bcg mL-1, respectively. Noteworthy, when the concentration of ZCNs is 50 \u03bcg mL-1, the MTT results reveal that ZCN-110 and ZCN-200 show a significantly better phototherapy effects to kill cancer cells compared with ZCN-60; meanwhile, a much significant result appears when the concentration rises up to 100 \u03bcg mL-1. This phenomenon can be attributed to the enhanced phototherapy effects with the increase in nanoparticle size because the photothermal effects and the ROS generation are enhanced with increase in the nanoparticle size, respectively, and the combination of PTT and PDT can kill much more cancer cells. Meanwhile, as a representative, the respective PDT and PTT therapeutic effects of ZCN-110 are further measured (d). For the 4 \u00b0C + NIR group, in which the heating effect of the photothermal effects is eliminated, the results predominate the PDT effect. The cell viability is about 45% when the concentration is 50 \u03bcg mL-1. Meanwhile, NaN3, which is a well-known ROS scavenger to avoid ROS generation, and the 25 \u00b0C + NIR + NaN3 group reveal the PTT effect and the cell viability is about 38%. However, the cell viability of the 25 \u00b0C + NIR group is about 18% when the concentration is 50 \u03bcg mL-1, this result illustrates that the heat and ROS generated by the ZCNs can effective kill cancer cells by the combination of PTT and PDT. Meanwhile, confocal fluorescence imaging of calcein acetoxymethyl ester (calcein-AM) and propodium (PI) co-stained with A549 cells also reveals the phototherapy efficacy of ZCN-110. From the CLSM pictures (e), the results show that the cells are barely alive, which illustrates that the ZCNs could kill cancer cells under NIR laser irradiation. Hemolysis experiments are measured to detect the biocompatibility of ZCNs (Figure S17, Supporting Information), the distilled water group shows obvious color change; however, the PBS group and of the ZCNs group (200 \u03bcg mL-1) shows a clear supernatant, indicating a good biocompatibility and biosafety of the injection.", "data": ["This model's maximum context length is 4097 tokens.
