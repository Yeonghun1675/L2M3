In the last step, however, the mmen ligands, which are elongated by the adsorption of CO2, participate in more favorable hydrogen-bonding interactions across the linker. This reveals how crucial the length of the amine is for systems of this type, in which the structural constraints of the adsorbent govern the amine-amine interactions. The adsorption mechanism elucidated in this study is a clear example of the high potential of MOFs to exhibit new types of reactivity.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 18, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Computational details, computed\nstructures and energies, discussions of experimental data, and a summary\nof previously reported mechanisms.
