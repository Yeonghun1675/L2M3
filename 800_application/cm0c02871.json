In the case of 1,8-nonadiyne, the oxygen content can be explained by covalently bound oxygen (C-O), which presumably originates from the 1,8-nonadiyne. The XPS C 1s narrow scan can be deconvoluted into different components which can be assigned to a C-C bond peak (285.0 eV), Si-C\ue5fbC bonds (284.0 eV), C-O/C-CO2H (286.0 eV), and C-CO2H (290.0 eV). A glance at the Si 2p narrow scan reveals that the Si-O peak at 101-104 eV is nonexistent. This observation indicates the formation of densely packed SAMs that prevented the oxidation of the etched Si-H substrate surfaces. The O 1s narrow scan can be found in the Supporting Information, Chapter S3. IRRAS spectra (see Supporting Information, Chapter S4) show the symmetric and antisymmetric C-H stretch vibrations and the C\ue5fbO stretching vibration for the carboxylic acid-terminated self-assembled monolayer, in accordance with the literature. The static water contact angle of the surfaces (see Supporting Information, Chapter S5) is 93 \u00b1 3\u00b0 for the alkyne-terminated monolayer, 65\u00b0 for the -COOH-terminated monolayers, and 54\u00b0 for the native oxide surface on silicon. Therefore, IRRAS spectra, XPS spectra, and water contact angle measurements confirm the successful formation of dense monolayers on the etched silicon surfaces.\n\nThe particle diameter determined by SEM (see Supporting Information, Chapter S6) is about ~23 nm for all NMOFs and changes slightly by surface functionalization. The values for NMOF 1 and NMOF 3 were already reported in the literature [22 nm \u00b1 8 nm (NMOF 1) and 22 nm \u00b1 5 nm (NMOF 3) and are similar to our measurements. The crystalline domain size of the samples was determined with the Scherrer equation applied to multiple reflections (see Supporting Information, Chapter S7 for more information). The calculated domain sizes in comparison with the SEM data suggest that each of the particles contains 1-2 crystallite domains. DLS spectra (see Supporting Information, Chapter S8) show the average hydrodynamic diameter of the particles in solution, which is typically larger than the particle diameter because of the solvent shell adsorbed at the surface of the NMOF. The measured diameter of the NMOF shows that the NMOF 1 aggregates over time resulting in an increased hydrodynamic radius and precipitation of the particles from the solution. In contrast to this, NMOF 3 forms a more stable colloidal solution. A slight increase in the hydrodynamic radius is observed over time, but the solution is still colloidal, and any increase after 4 weeks is still within the margin of error. Hence, NMOF 2 and 4 are stable colloidal solutions, which do not aggregate over time.\n\nWe investigated the accessible inner surface areas of the NMOF particle surface area before and after the exterior NMOF particle surface functionalization with nitrogen adsorption experiments. The N2 adsorption isotherms measured at 77 K are documented in the Supporting Information, Chapter S10. The obtained weight-specific BET surface areas show an expected slight reduction by 15.3% [NMOF 2 (918; 777 m2/g)] and 12.0% [NMOF 4 (1856; 1632 m2/g)], respectively, which matches with the range of the weight-specific NMOF particle surface functionalization. Overall, the internal surface area of the functionalized NMOFs is still accessible and only slightly reduced.\n\nFurthermore, we investigated the surfaces of the substrates by employing electron microscopy (). These images should display the distribution and arrangement of the NMOFs on the surfaces. First, the images show small particles in the same size regime as reported and measured for the NMOFs. The particles are slightly agglomerated but only to a small extent, and the individual particles are still visible. A more detailed analysis of 200 particles, respectively, shows that the average particle diameter of the NMOFs is 18.0 \u00b1 2.8 nm (S1), 22.4 \u00b1 3.3 nm (S2), and 24.2 \u00b1 3.3 nm (S3), which agrees with the measured size of NMOF 2 and 4. NMOF 2 seems to agglomerate more during the reaction. Therefore, we observed a denser particle structure in S1 than for NMOF 4 in S3.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "crystal size": [{"value": "\u223c23", "unit": "nm", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["crystal_size"]}, {"idx": 14, "type": "table", "classification": ["Property"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Particle Diameters, Hydrodynamic Diameters,\nand Crystallite Domain Sizes of <bold>NMOF 1\u20134</bold> Determined\nby SEM, DLS, and PXRD.</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"5\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\"\u00b1\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\"\u00b1\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\"\u00b1\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\"\u00b1\" colname=\"col5\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\" rowsep=\"1\">determined\nby</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\" rowsep=\"1\">SEM</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\" rowsep=\"1\">PXRD</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\" nameend=\"col5\" namest=\"col4\" rowsep=\"1\">DLS</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">Sample</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">particle\ndiameter [nm]</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">crystallite\ndomain size [nm]</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">hydrodynamic\ndiameter [nm]</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">hydrodynamic\ndiameter [nm] after 4\u00a0weeks</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<bold>NMOF 1</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>21.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.3</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>17.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>164\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>531\u00a0\u00b1\u00a076</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<bold>NMOF 2</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>23.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>16.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a038</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<bold>NMOF 3</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>26.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.9</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>12.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.8</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>79\u00a0\u00b1\u00a033</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>106\u00a0\u00b1\u00a047</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<bold>NMOF 4</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>24.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.8</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>13.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a034</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a046</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "Table 1.
