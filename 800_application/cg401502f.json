As described in the preceding section, compound 1 is characterized by a 2D coordination network, in which the Co-ADA forms paddle-wheels (SBUs) that are connected through ADA2- ligand to form a 2D (4,4) connected planar sheets. On the other hand, compound 3 has a 3D network, consisting of 2D (4,4) connected Co-IPTA sheets, interlinked by px2ampy linker. Notably, in the crystal structure of compound 3, the SBUs are Co-dimers rather than paddle-wheel SBUs, found in the crystal structure of compound 1. The change in dimensionality from 2D (compound 1) to 3D (compound 3) occurs due to two different connectivity patterns of px2ampy linker with the 2D metal-acid layer in these compounds. Generally, the secondary linker px2ampy has a tendency to assist the formation of the paddle-wheels and pillar the metal acid layers to higher dimension, which has been discussed in our previous report. But in the present study, in the case of compound 1, the px2ampy linker plays a role of interweaving the metal-acid layer rather than pillaring of different layers. This unusual connectivity of the px2ampy linker in the present case can be described as an intriguing behavior of the ADA2- ligand (toward px2ampy linker) compared to the other regular acid ligands due to its nonplanar twisted conformation. The coordination skeleton of the ADA2- molecule allows connecting the metal polyhedra in a helical coordination pattern because of its twisted conformation. The helical coordination tendency of ADA2- generates 1D zigzag chains connecting the paddle-wheel units along both axes. This conformation and connectivity of ADA2- ligand create a vacant coordination strand along the 1D zigzag chain, which allows the secondary linker px2ampy to coordinate to the Co(II) centers of the paddle-wheels of the same chain in a zigzag fashion to fulfill the coordination site of the vacant strand. It is then logical to argue that the helical chain, formed by the ADA2- ligand, perhaps directs the px2ampy (secondary linker) to connect along the same chain in an interweaving mode rather than pillaring the 2D ADA-paddle-wheel layer (Figure ). It is noteworthy, here, to mention that that among the two axes of the 2D sheet, the px2ampy linker prefers to attach the vacant strand along the b-axis, where the SBUs are separated by a longer distance (10.334 \u00c5) than the other axis (where the relevant separation is 8.319 \u00c5) because it (px2ampy) is a long spacer. The conformational freedom, existing with px2ampy due to its flexibility, also stipulates its coordination in interweaving the metal centers of same plane rather than pillaring different planes (2D layers); thus the overall dimensionality is reduced to 2D rather than 3D, even though px2ampy normally acts as a pillaring component. On the other hand, in the case of compound 3, the planar and rigid IPTA2- ligand connects with Co-dimers (SBUs) affording corrugated 2D sheets. In these sheets, the 1D (Co-IPTA) chains are linear in contrast to the zigzag type chains observed in the compound 1. As a result, the px2ampy linker, in this case, is unable to interweave the metal centers of the same layer, but it highly favors pillaring the metal-acid layers (2D sheets) resulting in the formation of a 3D network.

In the crystal structure of compound 1, the Co(II)-ADA network forms a 2D layer with the paddle-wheel as a 4-connector node, but in the case of compound 2, Cd(II)-ADA forms a 1D chain with Cd2-dimer as a 2-connector node. Even though the nodes (paddle-wheel in 1 and dimer in 2) in both compounds contain four ADA2- molecules, the metal acid architectures are not identical in their respective crystal structures. A close inspection of coordination spheres of compounds 1 and 2 reveals that, around the Co(II) center (compound 1), four carboxylate oxygen atoms from four ADA2- linkers are present, whereas in the case of the Cd(II) metal center (compound 2) five carboxylate oxygen atoms from four ADA2- linkers form the coordination sphere.

In this view, the crowdedness experienced by the Cd-dimer (compound 2) is more compared to that gained by the Co-paddle-wheel (compound 1), which in turn is reflected on the metal coordination sphere. In compound 1, due to less adaptability of more bulkiness around a Co(II) center, the bulkiness is distributed to the other coordination spheres and thereby connectivity of ADA2- forms a single chain rather a double chain in 2 (Figure ). As explained in the previous section, the connectivity of the px2ampy linker completes coordination saturation of the second strand in a single chain to form the double chain in 1, and in 2 it connects the already formed double chain to form a 2D layer.

The larger ionic radius MnII always forms octahedral coordination spheres. However, Co(II) can, in general, form octahedral, square pyramidal, and tetrahedral coordination geometries.

It can be noted that, in the case of compound 3, the Co-dimer consists of two different coordination spheres, i.e., octahedral {CoO5N} and tetrahedral {CoO3N}. On the other hand, the Mn-dimer in compound {Mn(IPTA)(px3ampy)} n  (4) consists of two identical {MnO4N2} octahedral coordination spheres. This diversity makes the situation complicated to do a comparison study among these structures. In a simple way, this structural diversity can be understood as described previously: in compound {Co2(IPTA)2(px2ampy)} n  (3), four IPTA2- linkers are distributed among five dimers and in compound {Mn(IPTA)(px3ampy)} n  (4), four IPTA2- linkers are distributed to three dimers, which clearly indicates that the crowdedness around the Mn(II) center in compound 4 is higher compared to that around the Co(II) center in compound 3. A close observation of metal centers reveals that, due to the higher coordination number exhibited by the Co(II) center (compound 3) in terms of the number of carboxylate oxygen atoms, i.e., the existence of {CoO5} moiety in compound 3 compared to the existence MnO4 moiety in 4, a 2D metal-acid layer is found to be formed in compound 3. But the adoptability of more bulkiness around the Mn(II) center (compound 4) is displayed in terms of the incorporation of two bulky px3ampy linkers, which is unusual. On the whole, the structural aspects of these two compounds (3 and 4), in view of above observations, can be described as follows: the adoptability of more bulkiness around the Mn(II) ion (compound 4) facilitates the incorporation of the two bulky px3ampy linkers, thereby reducing the coordination of carboxylate oxygen atoms resulting in formation of a lower dimensional structure; on the other hand, in the case of compound 3, it incorporates only one px2ampy around the Co(II) ion in its coordination sphere and increases its carboxylate oxygen atoms resulting in the formation of a higher dimensional structure. The secondary linker px2ampy pillars the 2D metal-acid sheets in 3 to form a 3D framework, and in 4, 1D metal-acid chains are linked by a px3ampy linker to form 2D layers, as IPTA2- is a rigid linker, which does not allow the pyridyl linker to connect the metal polyhedra on the same layer, as discussed in the previous section.
