The PXRD pattern of <bold>hybrid-CPP-III</bold> (b) showed the coexistence of both MIL-68 and MOF-NDC\nstructures within the particles. All peaks from both the MIL-68 core\nand MOF-NDC shell were found in the PXRD pattern of <bold>hybrid-CPP-III</bold>. The ratio of BDC and NDC within the particles and thus the relative\namounts of the MIL-68 core and MOF-NDC shell were determined to be\n1:1.11 by integrating the peaks correlated to H<sub>2</sub>BDC and\nH<sub>2</sub>NDC in the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of <bold>hybrid-CPP-III</bold> (e). The\n1:1.11 molar ratio of the MIL-68 core and MOF-NDC shell within <bold>hybrid-CPP-III</bold> corresponds to the 1:1.30 weight ratio of the\nMIL-68 core and MOF-NDC shell. (For this calculation, we have assumed\nthat MOF-NDC has a chemical formula of [In\u00ad(OH)\u00ad(NDC)]<sub>\n<italic>n</italic>\n</sub>, similar to [In\u00ad(OH)\u00ad(BDC)]<sub>\n<italic>n</italic>\n</sub> for\nMIL-68.)

CPP-I of the MIL-68 structure is known to be a quite porous material, as shown in its sorption isotherms [red line in Figure S1; the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and total pore volume were 1564 m2 g-1 and 0.69 cm3 g-1, respectively]. The BET surface area and total pore volume of CPP-II of the MIL-68-Br structure (1062 m2 g-1 and 0.47 cm3 g-1, respectively) were slightly lower than those of CPP-I because of the bromo moieties within the MIL-68-Br structure (blue line in Figure S1 and Table S1). Compared to CPP-I made from H2BDC, the extra bromo moieties within CPP-II decrease the void volume within the structure and increase the relative weight per unit volume, thereby reducing the total pore volume per gram of CPP-II. N2 sorption isotherms of CPP-III of the MOF-NDC structure also displayed type I behavior, typical of microporous materials (purple line in Figure S1), and its BET surface area and total pore volume (597 m2 g-1 and 0.27 cm3 g-1, respectively) were lower than those of CPP-I and CPP-II (Table S1). Pore size distributions of CPP-I -CPP-III were calculated from the nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) method (Figure S2). CPP-I and CPP-II have two different pores (ca. 0.6 and 1.2 nm); however, CPP-III has only one dominant pore at ca. 0.7 nm. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves and infrared (IR) spectra of all samples are shown in Figures S3 and S4. Three CPPs (CPP-I-CPP-III) have a similar thermal stability, as shown in their TGA curves (Figure S3).\n\nThe relative amounts of the MIL-68 core and MIL-68-Br shell within MIL-68@MIL-68-Br were determined from the 1H NMR spectrum. First, hybrid-CPP-II was digested in a cosolvent of acetic acid-d 4 and DMSO-d 6; the relative ratio of H2BDC to H2BDC-Br and thus the relative amounts of the MIL-68 core and MIL-68-Br shell within hybrid-CPP-II were determined to be 1:3.65 by integrating the peaks correlated to H2BDC and H2BDC-Br (i). N2 sorption isotherms of hybrid-CPP-II (green line in j) revealed that its BET surface area (1346 m2g-1) and total pore volume (0.58 cm3 g-1, Table S1) values are situated roughly between those of MIL-68 (red line in j) and MIL-68-Br (blue line in j).\n\nThe next attempt to investigate the growth of MOF on MOF was conducted using H2NDC as an organic building block. First, it should be mentioned that a totally different framework (MOF-NDC) was constructed from the reaction of In(NO3)3 and H2NDC, compared to the formation of MIL-68-like structures from H2BDC and H2BDC-Br. SEM images () of hybrid-CPP-III revealed an obvious increase in particle size and the exclusive formation of the fascinating semitubular particles after 20 min. The pure MIL-68 template did not remain after the reaction, and the significant pure MOF-NDC was not generated after the reaction. The formation of the semitubular particles was clearly confirmed again from TEM images (d). These semitubular particles can be constructed from the anisotropic growth of the secondary MOF-NDC on the six rectangular facets but not on the two hexagonal facets of hexagonal lump templates of MIL-68. After the initial formation of MOF-NDC on the ac plane of the template, MOF-NDC can further grow along the c axis to form semitubular particles. As the reaction time or the amounts of H2NDC and In(NO3)3 increased, the resulting particle size of hybrid-CPP-III increased while retaining the semitubular shape (Figure S6). As a control experiment, the growth of MIL-68 on the MOF-NDC template resulted in similar semitubular particles (Figure S7). The PXRD pattern of hybrid-CPP-III (b) showed the coexistence of both MIL-68 and MOF-NDC structures within the particles. All peaks from both the MIL-68 core and MOF-NDC shell were found in the PXRD pattern of hybrid-CPP-III. The ratio of BDC and NDC within the particles and thus the relative amounts of the MIL-68 core and MOF-NDC shell were determined to be 1:1.11 by integrating the peaks correlated to H2BDC and H2NDC in the 1H NMR spectrum of hybrid-CPP-III (e). The 1:1.11 molar ratio of the MIL-68 core and MOF-NDC shell within hybrid-CPP-III corresponds to the 1:1.30 weight ratio of the MIL-68 core and MOF-NDC shell. (For this calculation, we have assumed that MOF-NDC has a chemical formula of [In(OH)(NDC)] n , similar to [In(OH)(BDC)] n  for MIL-68.) The increasing amount of MOF-NDC on the MIL-68 template was relatively lower than that of MIL-68-Br, as verified from their final sizes (c and c) and the relative ratios of the initial and secondary MOFs within hybrid-CPP-II (1:3.65) and hybrid-CPP-III (1:1.11). N2 sorption isotherms of hybrid-CPP-III (MIL-68@MOF-NDC) revealed that its BET surface area (1021 m2 g-1) and total pore volume (0.46 cm3 g-1) values are located between those of MIL-68 and MOF-NDC (f). These values were quite similar to those (1017 m2 g-1 and 0.45 cm3 g-1, respectively) calculated from the simple sum of the 1:1.30 weight contributions of pure MIL-68 and MOF-NDC within hybrid-CPP-III.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "CPP-I", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": {"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "1564", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}, "porosity": {"proboe": "", "value": "0.69", "unit": "cm3/g", "condition": ""}}, {"meta": {"name": "CPP-II", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": {"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "1062", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}, "porosity": {"proboe": "", "value": "0.47", "unit": "cm3/g", "condition": ""}}, {"meta": {"name": "CPP-III", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": {"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "597", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}, "porosity": {"proboe": "", "value": "0.27", "unit": "cm3/g", "condition": ""}}]], "include_properties": ["surface_area", "porosity"]}, {"idx": 5, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Solvothermal Reactions for the Synthesis\nof <bold>CPP-I</bold>\n<bold>-CPP-III</bold>\n<xref rid=\"fn1sch1\"></xref>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ja-2016-08821v_0008.tif\"></graphic>\n<p>\n<fn id=\"fn1sch1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>The box shows ball-and-stick\nrepresentations of the MIL-68 structure, which has a three-dimensional\nhexagonal structure of [In\u00ad(OH)\u00ad(BDC)]<sub>\n<italic>n</italic>\n</sub>,\nconsisting of a one-dimensional metal ion chain in the <italic>c</italic> direction.</p>\n</fn>\n</p>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Solvothermal Reactions for the Synthesis of CPP-I -CPP-III       a The box shows ball-and-stick representations of the MIL-68 structure, which has a three-dimensional hexagonal structure of [In(OH)(BDC)] n , consisting of a one-dimensional metal ion chain in the c direction.
