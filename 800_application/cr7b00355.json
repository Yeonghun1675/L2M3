Early work reported on uranium extraction from seawater regarded uranium speciation as forming the anionic triscarbonato-uranyl complex, UO2(CO3)3 4-, resulting in development of adsorbents capable of extracting a highly anionic complex. However, the literature abounds with instances of M nUO2(CO3)3 2(2-n)- complex identification, particularly in areas of geochemical research and environmental remediation. The first work to report an aqueous Can[UO2(CO3)3]2(2-n)- complex involved the application of time-resolved laser fluorescence to seepage waters of a mine tailing pile. The authors proposed the neutral Ca2[UO2(CO3)3] as the dominant species, which was independently supported shortly thereafter. X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS) has been applied at various points, and while Can[UO2(CO3)3]2(2-n)- complexes can be identified, precise quantification of the Ca coordination number is impeded by spectral overlap in the extended XAFS (EXAFS) region with the distal oxygen of the carbonate group, which is further complicated by the presence of a NamCan[UO2(CO3)3](2(2-n)-m)- complex.

Similar to GMA, 4-HAGE possesses an epoxide group which can be opened through nucleophilic attack by sterically unencumbered amines, as well as an acryl functionality which is amenable to RIGP. The primary difference is the length of the alkyl chain between the acryl and epoxide groups, with 4-HAGE an additional six atoms farther away and putatively affording faster adsorption and improved performance. As reported previously, following polymerization on a nonwoven PE coated PP fabric, the epoxide group was opened with EDA, DETA, TETA, and diethylamine (DEA) affording chelator densities ranging from 1.6 to 3 mmol g-1.

This is most likely due to the size of the uranyl ion. The triscarbonatouranyl(VI) anion has a diameter that is approximately 0.8 nm equatorially and 0.6 nm axially. This represents a bulky anion that can significantly block microporosity thereby negating the rest of the polymer in the micropores. It was also determined that the larger pores are required as the mesoporosity did not significantly contribute to the overall capacity.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 258, "type": "table", "classification": null, "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl6\" position=\"float\">\n<label>6</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Uranium Capacity as a Function of\nPore Size</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"3\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">sample</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">pore size\n(nm)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">uranium adsorption\ncap.

While these are very encouraging preliminary results, the absence of any specific experimental details is a cause for concern. Previous adsorption measurements were performed with only 10 mL of solution, and adsorbents were collected by centrifugation. It is unreasonable to centrifuge 1 L of solution following the protocol delineated by the authors, and a contact time of 1 min is not possible as discussed above. The authors claim elution of the uranium and reuse of the adsorbent, achieving uptake of 0.51 mg of uranium/g and 0.47 mg of uranium/g for the second and third trials. If the material is removed by filtration, negative controls need to be performed and reported to ensure the uranium is not extracted by the filter or bottle. Finally, the authors indicate ICP-MS analysis of the seawater simulant solution is used to determine uptake. However, ICP-MS analysis of dilute, high-matrix solutions such as seawater requires special considerations for analytical accuracy, as discussed in .

The performance of 81 different inorganic materials are reported as of 1979, with lead sulfide, lead naphthalene, and hydrous titanium dioxide all achieving uranium capacities exceeding 1 mg of uranium/g of metal in adsorbent. Despite the ultimate consensus that hydrous titanium dioxide was the best material, the number of lead-based inorganic adsorbents that were investigated is approximately equal to the number of nonlead-based adsorbents. \n\nLarge scale marine experiments were also performed by the Japanese, with the longest lasting from 1999-2001. Noting the additional energy demand from pumping seawater across an adsorbent bed, they sought to use passive diffusion of seawater through adsorbent stacks deployed in the ocean. Adsorbent stacks were prepared from amidoxime-functionalized polyethylene fabric, which was then cut into smaller sheets. 144 adsorbent stacks were placed into a 16 m2 adsorption bed, of which three were suspended from an 8 m \u00d7 8 m floating frame anchored to the seafloor.  displays an example of the adsorbent stack as well as a scheme of the floating frame and adsorbent beds. A crane ship extracted adsorbent beds every 20-40 days for fractional elution with 0.5 M HCl. Over the two year study, approximately 1 kg yellowcake was collected, affording an average of 0.5 mg uranium/g-adsorbent every 30 days. \n\nIt was determined the most expensive part of the experiment with sorbent stacks was the floating frame. An innovative redesign involved preparation of a braided adsorbent that could be anchored to the seafloor, creating a sorbent bed biomimetic of a kelp farm. Attaching a float to the top of the sorbent braid allowed their suspension in seawater, and upon wireless release from the anchor, facilitated their recovery with a fishing boat. After 30 days of soaking, the polymer fiber recovered 1.5 mg uranium g-1 adsorbent.  displays the proposed deployment system for the braided adsorbent. \n\nA very recent report from the same group depicts use of polysulfide/layered double hydroxide composite materials for uranyl sequestration. When added at a reasonable phase ratio of 1 g L-1, the layered double hydroxide materials were able to extract 96-99% of uranium from deionized water, achieving a sorption capacity of 330 mg g-1. While significant variation in initial pH values for isotherm solutions adds uncertainty the accuracy of this number, the results are impressive nevertheless. Distribution coefficients (K d) as high as 3.4 \u00d7 106 were achieved, which are competitive with the best inorganic uranium sorbents reported in the literature. These results were decreased by 1-2 orders of magnitude upon addition of Ca2+ and Na+ but remain among the best literature results for uranyl extraction. The authors subsequently investigated these materials for extracting uranium from environmental seawater from near Tianjin City, China. The report that 78% of uranium was removed over 24 h would suggest rapid kinetics and great promise as an adsorbent material. However, a close reading reveals adsorbents were added at a phase ratio of 15 g L-1 for this experiment. Furthermore, control experiments reveal the concentration of uranium in this seawater exceeded 9 ppb, more than 2.5\u00d7 the concentration of uranium typically anticipated under open ocean conditions. External validation of the performance for this material is essential, in particular when deployed at a reasonable phase ratio and in environmentally relevant uranium concentrations.\n\nThe sorbents were investigated for 99Tc and 238U sorption at a phase ratio of 50-100 g L-1 in deionized water for 1 week, with radionuclide removal ranging from 57-98% for 99Tc and 68-99% for 238U. Sorption of iodine was measured by flowing gaseous I2 over a sorbent bed at 125 \u00b0C. All chalcogel materials bound >99% of all iodine, as determined by ICP-MS of a 0.1 M NaOH solution through which chalcogel-filtered gas was bubbled. The ability to process these chalcogels into monolithic materials makes them a potentially useful technology for uranyl extraction from seawater; however, the use of expensive, rare, and toxic metals limits their applicability in current form. Furthermore, external validation must be performed, as the current report only discusses performance when deployed at phase ratios which are untenable for environmental conditions and large-scale deployment. \n\nUranium uptake studies reveal optimal performance is achieved at pH 5 in a 25 ppm uranium solution, while approximately 90% of the uranium is recovered at pH 8, affording an uptake of 4.5 mg of uranium g-1. The material saturation capacity was investigated through an isotherm, but a modest maximum uptake of approximately 10 mg g-1 was observed. Comparatively poor performance at acidic pH was ascribed to competition of the uranium with the proton in solution, suggesting an ion exchange mechanism and anticipation of poor performance in solutions with high ionic strength, such as seawater. \n\nAn inorganic/organic composite, zirconyl-molybdopyrophosphate-tributyl phosphate (ZMPP-TBP), was prepared by coprecipitation of sodium molybdate and potassium pyrophosphate with zirconyl oxychloride. While a maximum uptake was observed at pH 6, there was minimal performance variation across a wide pH range, and >99% of the uranium was recovered from a 5 ppm aqueous solution when contacted at a 1 g L-1 phase ratio. Inclusion of various mono- or divalent cations (Zn2+, Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+) or carbonate effected a < 5% decrease in uranium uptake, suggesting promising performance in complex matrixes. The saturation isotherm was also obtained, yielding a maximum capacity of 196 mg of uranium g-1 and achieving equilibrium in 80 min. In contrast to most adsorbents, variable temperature investigations with ZMPP-TBP reveal uranium uptake is inversely related to temperature. A negative Gibbs free energy for uranyl complexation was experimentally determined, demonstrating adsorption to be a spontaneous reaction, while the inverse relationship with temperature attests to a enthalpically driven process. Finally, the uranium could be easily eluted with dilute HCl and the material recycled up to four-times with negligible loss of performance. Although not investigated directly for recovery of uranium from seawater or an appropriate brine, the performance is promising and may merit further investigation.\n\nMagnetic Adsorbents\n\nSeveral magnetic inorganic adsorbents have also been reported of recent for uranium recovery from seawater. A magnetic cobalt ferrite/multiwalled carbon nanotube (CoFe2O4/MWCNT) system was investigated for uranium extraction from several aqueous solutions. When contacted at a phase ratio of 0.4 g L-1 in a 50 ppm uranium solution, a strong pH dependence was observed, with a maximum uptake of 212.7 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent reported at pH 6. When the pH increased to 8, a 33% decrease in performance was reported.

Increasing ionic strength up to 0.5 M NaCl results in a decrease of adsorption at lower pH, but no decrease from pure aqueous solutions were observed at pH 6 or 7.

A saturation capacity of 206 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was achieved at pH 5 by application of an adsorption isotherm.\n\nThe adsorbents were investigated for uranium uptake from an 8 ppm uranyl nitrate brine solution, also containing 193 ppm sodium bicarbonate and 25600 ppm sodium chloride. The sample that was not heat-treated achieved an uptake of approximately 175 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent, while maximum uptake for samples receiving post-amidoximation heat-treatment in DMSO, DMF, and propylene carbonate achieved uptake of approximately 225, 220, and 185 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent, respectively. Further investigations were performed using adsorbents heated in DMSO, which displayed more rapid uranyl-binding kinetics compared to the untreated material and improvement in recovery of uranium following 56-days of contact with seawater from Sequim Bay, WA in flow through columns. A seawater uranium recovery capacity of approximately 4.2 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was achieved for the DMSO-treated sample, while 3.5 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent were obtained for the untreated analogue. However, increases in uptake were also observed in the binding of numerous other metals present in seawater, in particular Ca, Mg, Fe, V, Mn, and Cr. Taken comprehensively, it is clear the cyclic imidedioxime plays a critical role in the performance of amidoxime-functionalized polymer adsorbents, though achieving the necessary selectivity and chemical stability for repeated use remains an elusive and highly desirable objective.\n\nPolymer Adsorbents Prepared by Neither RIGP Nor ATRP\n\nSuspension/Emulsion Polymerization\n\nThe first amidoxime-functionalized polymer-based adsorbents were prepared by thermally initiated suspension polymerization of (AN) and divinylbenzene (DVB) dissolved in toluene and dispersed in water ().

An identical polymerization approach was implemented by Hirotsu, who investigated the role of the hydrophilicity of the cross-linking comonomer on adsorbent performance. Substituting tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate (4EGDM) for divinylbenzene resulted in an adsorbent with superior kinetics compared to poly(AO-co-DVB). A 40-day test of the best performing poly(AO-co-DVB) afforded an uptake of approximately 0.2 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent, while the poly(AO-co-4EGDM) achieved 0.4 mg of uranium/g in only 28 days. Follow up work with poly(AO) adsorbents cross-linked with different ratios of DVB/4EGDM revealed by X-ray microanalysis that uranium was more homogeneously distributed throughout the adsorbent as more 4EGDM was incorporated, whereas binding in the poly(AO-co-DVB) was localized to the surface.

Using ethylenediaminetetraacetic\nacid (EDTA) as a metal complexant to form an anionic uranyl species,\na modest affinity for uranium was reported (40% in solution), which\nwas further suppressed by the presence of other competing metals.\nIn contrast, substitution of EDTA for SCN<sup>\u2013</sup> or CO<sub>3</sub>\n<sup>2\u2013</sup> resulted in a marked improvement in performance.\nFor SCN<sup>\u2013</sup>, 85% of the uranium was extracted from\nsolution (albeit, at pH 1), while 95% of uranium was extracted in\na carbonate solution. Furthermore, at pH 5.5 uranium could be selectively\nseparated from solutions containing up to 100\u00d7 excess of competing\nmetal ions. When investigated for recovery of uranium from seawater,\n200 mL of seawater was contacted with 100 mg of adsorbent for 4 h,\nwith 0.42 \u03bcg of uranium recovered.

However, as noted by the authors a mmol of uranium per\nmol of ligand affords a more appropriate comparison in light of the\nadded mass from more expansive amine functionalities. By this metric,\nthe adsorbent functionalized with pTEPA achieved the best uptake of\n17.7 mmol of uranium mol<sup>\u20131</sup>, followed closely by\npTAEA (16.0 mmol mol<sup>\u20131</sup>) and then by pDETA and pEDA\n(13.3 and 13.2 mmol mol<sup>\u20131</sup>, respectively).

Following postsynthetic conversion to the amidoxime form, the adsorbent displayed a high capacity for uranium and V over Cu2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ competing ions. Calculation of the K d for each metal, i.e., the ratio of metal ions in the solution to the metal ions bound in the adsorbent, reveal strong selectivity for U. The K d value for uranium of nearly 2 \u00d7 105 mL g-1 was more than three times greater than that for V and more than 150\u00d7 greater than the other competing ions. This selectivity was rationalized by the authors as attributable to intramolecular H-bonding promoting formation of the syn-hydroxyamino form, where metal-assisted hydroxyl deprotonation would occur prior to bonding and be governed by hard/soft acid/base theory. \n\nThis adsorbent was investigated in seawater collected from the coast of Mutsu Sekine-Hama in the Aomori Prefecture in a recirculated column configuration at a flow rate of 6 mL min-1. After 1 h, 1 day, and 1 week of contact, the adsorbents were eluted with HCl and the uranium uptake determined, affording values of 13.1, 28.1, and 27.1 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent. While these results are remarkably good, it is perplexing that such technology has not been successfully commercialized. It is suggested that the results be externally validated to confirm the performance and ensure the results are not a typographical error. In comparison to other adsorbents contacted under similar conditions, results in the \u03bcg of uranium g-1 adsorbent are more commonplace.\n\nCompolymers of AA, AcA, and trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) were formed with an ammonium persulfate initiator, with the resulting nonamidoxime-functionalized adsorbents used to extract uranyl from a 5% NaCl solution. Performance was tested as a function of time, temperature, pH and ionic strength. Saponification of the polymer with NaOH afforded carboxylate groups, which are the putative uranyl-binding species in the adsorbent and also increase adsorbent hydrophilicity. The swelling of the hydrogel increased upon formation of carboxylic functionalities, though both swelling and adsorbent performance decreased when contacted with electrolytes possessing high ionic strength, such as seawater. Swelling also decreased with increasing cross-linking, afforded by a greater molar quantity of TMPTA. A maximum uranium uptake of 250 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was achieved from contact of 0.15 g of material with 50 mL of a 502 ppm uranyl solution at pH 7.\n\nIon-imprinted polymers (IIPs) have also been prepared through chemical polymerization. This type of material is prepared by first coordinating uranyl with chelating monomers and then polymerizing the complex followed by elution of the bound uranium (). For example, Rao and co-workers dissolved stoichiometric quantities of uranyl nitrate with select chelating ligands, including salicylaldoxime, catechol, succinic acid, 5,7-dichloroquinoline-8-ol (DCQ), and 4-vinylpyridine (VP), in 2-methoxy ethanol, followed by polymerization in the presence of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and ethylene glycol-dimethacrylate (EGDMA) with an AIBN initiator (). Following elution of the bound uranium, adsorbents prepared with succinic acid, DCQ, and VP afforded enrichment of uranium recovery in seawater simulant when contacted at 0.02 g of resin per 1 L of seawater. While capacities of up to 33 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent were achieved during screening in uranyl-spiked DI water, the nonimprinted controls also achieved up to 80% of this capacity. Good selectivity was reported for these materials, achieving >99% extraction of uranium in the presence of Th(IV), Fe(III), Co(II), Ni(II), Mn(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II), while adjustment of pH had no effect on performance. When Na2CO3 was added to the screening solution, recovery for the succinic acid/VP adsorbent was only 25%, while 99% recovery was still achieved by the DCQ/VP material. The DCQ/VP IIP was tested for uranium extraction from Arabian Seawater, recovering 1.59 \u03bcg of uranium/L of seawater and an uptake value of 0.08 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent.\n\nShamsipur and colleagues later reported preparation of IIPs grafted on the surface of a silica gel adsorbent, with the IIPs polymerized from surface-bound azo groups. Polymerization was performed in the presence of a MA-uranyl complex with EGDMA, followed by elution of the uranium. Adsorption studies were performed by adding 100 mg of adsorbent to 10 mL of an aqueous 5 ppm uranyl solution over pH 1.5-4. The best uptake was achieved at pH 3, where 100% of the uranium was extracted affording an uptake in excess of 0.5 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent. Significant selectivity was displayed for uranyl over a wide range of di- and trivalent cations, including Cu(II), Ni(II), Fe(III), and Mn(II), among others. The adsorbent also achieved efficient recovery of uranium from spiked environmental samples, though recovery of uranium from tap water and Caspian Sea water were below limits of quantification for their analytical method.\n\nBiofouling-resistant polymer adsorbents were also prepared by UV-initiated photopolymerization, where poly(ethylene glycol methacrylate phosphate) was polymerized in solution with Ag nanoparticles and subsequently reinforced with a thermally bonded nonwoven PP fibrous sheet. As mentioned earlier, a uniform distribution of Ag nanoparticles in the adsorbent was observed, and when incubated with E. coli, no growth was observed on the adsorbent. This suggests inclusion of Ag nanoparticles imparts some significant resistance to biofouling. When contacted with a 1788 ppm uranyl solution in seawater, a capacity of 550 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was obtained, though large quantities of other cationic metals were also extracted. \n\nRamkumar reported the chemical oxidation of aniline to generate polyaniline, followed by its application in recovery of uranium from seawater. Due to incorporation of anions, such as Cl- or SO4 2-, in the polymer during synthesis, it was expected anionic exchange with anionic uranyl complexes could be achieved. Using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as a metal complexant to form an anionic uranyl species, a modest affinity for uranium was reported (40% in solution), which was further suppressed by the presence of other competing metals. In contrast, substitution of EDTA for SCN- or CO3 2- resulted in a marked improvement in performance. For SCN-, 85% of the uranium was extracted from solution (albeit, at pH 1), while 95% of uranium was extracted in a carbonate solution. Furthermore, at pH 5.5 uranium could be selectively separated from solutions containing up to 100\u00d7 excess of competing metal ions. When investigated for recovery of uranium from seawater, 200 mL of seawater was contacted with 100 mg of adsorbent for 4 h, with 0.42 \u03bcg of uranium recovered. This amounts to a 72% uranium recovery efficiency and an uptake of 0.0042 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent. Nevertheless, the extremely high phase ratio of 500 mg L-1 is unreasonable for realistic seawater deployment conditions.\n\nSellin and Alexandratos reported the application of a series of polymer-supported primary amines for uranium extraction (). Poly(VBC-co-DVB) (VBC = vinylbenzyl chloride) gel beads were synthesized as a support, followed by postsynthetic functionalization with an array of amines possessing different lengths, structures, and substituents. HCl titrations revealed comparable quantities of amine sites with capability for uranyl binding, while uranium uptake was analyzed from a synthetic seawater spiked to 50 ppm with uranyl. On a mass- uranium per mass-adsorbent basis, the short-chain primary amine (pA) afforded the maximum uptake of 14.8 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent. However, as noted by the authors a mmol of uranium per mol of ligand affords a more appropriate comparison in light of the added mass from more expansive amine functionalities. By this metric, the adsorbent functionalized with pTEPA achieved the best uptake of 17.7 mmol of uranium mol-1, followed closely by pTAEA (16.0 mmol mol-1) and then by pDETA and pEDA (13.3 and 13.2 mmol mol-1, respectively). These uptake values also correlate reasonably well with the number of amine sites in the adsorbent, with values of 8.51, 8.43, 7.10, and 6.61 mmol of N/g of polymer for pTEPA, pDETA, pTAEA, and pEDA, respectively. A poly(DVB-co-VBC) functionalized with diamidoxime was also synthesized and investigated under the same conditions as a control. A comparatively modest uranyl capacity of 2.34 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was achieved, while the adsorbent has 10.4 mmol g-1 protonation sites, converting to 3.79 mmol of uranium/mol of binding site.\n\nWhile DETA- and DETA-derivative-functionalized poly(AN) adsorbents displayed some affinity to uranium, inclusion of amidoxime functionalities dramatically improved the uptake. Uranium was completely removed from 0.9 ppm uranyl solutions, 97-99% removed from 6 ppm solutions, and approximately 95% removed from the 50 ppm solution. In comparison, a pure poly(amidoxime) adsorbent prepared from the same poly(AN) precursor achieved similar performance at 0.9 and 6 ppm, but only extracted 82.5% of the uranium from the 50 ppm solution. Seawater-contacted results also reveal superior performance for the bifunctional adsorbents, with AO-DETA extracting 0.54 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent and AO-phon-DETA recovering 0.79 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent. Pure poly(amidoxime) recovered 0.12 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent, while the nonamidoximated phon-DETA extracted a comparable 0.14 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent. This work demonstrates that affinity of amidoxime-functionalized adsorbents for uranyl can be enhanced by incorporation of auxiliary DETA ligands. While detailed FTIR investigations by the authors support activation of the amidoxime by the amine, they assert additional experiments are needed to determine whether the enhanced performance is attributable to true activation of the amidoxime group or is primarily the sum of individual binding from multiple functionalities. \n\nChitin, a biopolymer, was also used as a chemically modified polymer support for the recovery of uranium. Rogers and co-workers started with shrimp shell waste, extracting chitin into an ionic liquid composed of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate. The chitin was wet-jet spun into fibers which were subsequently deacetylated with NaOH to form primary amine groups on the surface. Treatment with hydroxylamine appended hydroxamic acid functionalities for seawater uranium recovery. Approximately 2.5 mg of wet fibers were contacted for 144 h with 1 mL of DI water spiked with a 233U radiotracer, affording a final uptake of approximately 0.28 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent. Although the performance is underwhelming, and poor fiber integrity is noted by the authors of the publication, this work constitutes a particularly innovative approach to the preparation of novel uranium adsorbents, as well as the effective utilization of a biological waste stream. Assuming adequate performance can be achieved, additional benefits from this class of polymer include the expectation of mild environmental impact, as well as access to a hydrophilic trunk material capable of facilitating transport of water through the adsorbent.\n\nPerformance of the poly(AO)-block-poly(St)-co-poly(St/DVB) was analyzed by deploying 15 mg particles in a dialysis bag, immersed in 200 mL of uranyl solution. A maximum capacity of 85 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was obtained in a 6 ppm uranyl solution at pH 6.5, while the analogous uptake at the more seawater-relevant pH 8 was approximately 60 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent. A saturation capacity of 247 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was obtained via an isotherm at pH 6.5. Introduction of competing cations (Na+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Co2+, Fe3+, Pb3+, and Ni2+) reduced adsorption efficiency from 4-30% at pH 6, and a modest decrease in performance was observed over five recycles.

A\nmaximum uranium uptake of slightly more than 0.5 mg of uranium/g of\nadsorbent was obtained over 50 d of contact with 2 L of environmental\nseawater, which was replenished every 2 d.\n</p><p>A report from the same group compared\nthe performance of adsorbents prepared by RIGP of AN with different\nhydrophilic comonomers from a PE trunk fiber, followed by amidoximation\nwith hydroxylamine. As in their prior\nwork, MA was used as one comonomer, while HEMA was the other. As expected,\nmodulating the weight ratios of the comonomers afforded adsorbents\nwith differing hydrophilicities, and it was noted that the amidoxime\ndensity and water content needed to be balanced to achieve optimal\nuranium uptake. Water uptake by the adsorbents (postconversion with\nhydroxylamine treatment) was maximized when AN was not included in\nthe initial copolymer. For the MA copolymer, water uptake decreased\nlinearly with increasing amidoxime, while the HEMA copolymer did not\ndisplay an appreciable decrease in water uptake until amidoxime exceeded\n60 wt %. Seawater uranium recovery by the adsorbent materials was\ninvestigated both in lab-based flow-through experiments, where 20\nL of natural seawater was circulated through a column for 24 h, as\nwell as in open-ocean deployments off the coast of Japan, where the\nmaterials were submerged at 15 m below the surface.

Similar\nto aforementioned work involving MA, water uptake and Dg increased\nwith AA content, with a maximum uptake afforded from a 50:50 amidoxime:AA\nratio. Uranium extraction was assessed from a 100 ppm solution over\n1-d contact, with poly\u00ad(acrylamidoxime-<italic>co</italic>-AA) performing\ncomparably to simple poly\u00ad(amidoxime) and achieving uptake of 25 mg\nof uranium/g. This similarity in performance is almost certainly attributable\nto the excessive uranium concentration in the screening solution. A resin-based adsorbent was also prepared by\nRIGP of AN and AA.

Performance was investigated at pH 8 in natural seawater,\ncontacted with a lab-based column flow-through system at a velocity\nof 3 L min<sup>\u20131</sup>. A total of 2 days of contact afforded\n0.141, 0.145, and 0.135 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent for 60, 70, and\n80 wt % amidoxime-containing materials, respectively. Notably, the\n70:30 material displayed the best performance, in contrast to the\n60:40 ratio determined for purely a fibrous PE support. Increasing seawater contact time for the optimized\nadsorbent to 7 days afforded a maximum uptake of 0.300 mg of uranium/g\nof adsorbent. This nonwoven adsorbent\nwas subsequently used for a large scale open-ocean deployment. A total\nof 52\u202f000 sheets totaling 350 kg were packaged in 3 \u00d7\n16 m<sup>2</sup> adsorption cages, then deployed for 240 days at 20\nm deep, 7 km off the coast of Japan. 1 kg of uranium (yellowcake)\nwas obtained, affording an uptake of 2.8 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent\nper 240 days.\n</p><p>A PE-coated PP support\nwas used to attach bis-amidoxime groups\nthrough a glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) intermediate, polymerized by\nRIGP.

Subsequent treatment with hydroxylamine results in the\ndesired bis-amidoxime-functionalized adsorbent (). Although this adsorbent\nwas not tested for uranium uptake from natural seawater, adsorption\nperformed in a 100 ppb uranyl solution at pH 5 revealed rapid uptake\n(&gt;80% in 30 min). When contacted with a 1 ppm uranyl solution,\nan\nuptake of 1.6 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was obtained, though competing\nions V, Cu and Co all displayed significant adsorption, with values\nof 1.5, 0.9, and 0.9 mg/g, respectively.

The poly\u00ad(AN) functionalities were converted to amidoxime\nby treatment with hydroxylamine, and the adsorbent was pretreated\nin an aqueous KOH solution. Water uptake capacity for the adsorbent\nwas 200 wt % in seawater, compared to 260 wt % in DI water, suggesting\nan influence of ionic strength on polymer hydrophilicity. Uranium\nuptake was determined by scintillation counting using a <sup>233</sup>U radiotracer, though no explicit concentration values were provided.\nAn uptake of 380 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was determined, affording\na 1:4 uranium:amidoxime binding mode assuming exclusive formation\nof the open-chain amidoxime.</p><p>Initial studies performed in the Trombay Estuary () suggested 12\nd deployment\nto be the optimal time frame, balancing uranium uptake against biofouling,\nwhich was determined to be detrimental to uranium uptake. Subsequent\nexperiments performed at the power station intake/outfall canals supported\nthis result. Approximately 30% improvement in uranium uptake was observed\nfor the adsorbents deployed by the outfall canal over those deployed\nat the intake canal, putatively attributed to the elevated temperature\nand suggesting endothermic thermodynamics for uranium binding. The\nelution of 1.8 and 4.85 ppm uranium was reported for the outfall canal\n(following 330 and 570 h deployment, respectively), while the comparative\nresults for the intake canal were 1.3 and 3.92 ppm. Insufficient data were provided to determine the uptake\ncapacity of the adsorbent following seawater deployment.</p><p>In an effort\nto address the poor mechanical properties exhibited\nby polymers following irradiation, as well as increase the Dg by promoting\npostirradiation radical stability, Wu and co-workers applied RIGP\nto graft ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). When investigated by electron paramagnetic\nresonance, the radical lifetime on the UHMWPE was approximately 100\u00d7\nlonger than on PE, suggesting superior potential for polymerization. Upon exposure to 50 kGy \u03b3-radiation from\na <sup>60</sup>Co source, UHMWPE fibers were immersed in a solution\nof AN and AA which had been purged with N<sub>2</sub>. Ammonium iron\u00ad(II)\nsulfate, more commonly known as Mohr\u2019s salt, was added to the\npolymerization solution to suppress homopolymerization and promote\nthe growth of the poly\u00ad(AN-<italic>co</italic>-AA) graft chain. The\nstudy reveals that the tensile strength of the fiber decreases dramatically\nupon radiation, from 3 to 1.3 GPa. While surface grafting improved\ntensile strength, subsequent treatment with hydroxylamine mitigated\nany gains and a final tensile strength of 1.2 GPa was obtained. The\nUHMWPE-<italic>graft</italic>-poly\u00ad(amidoxime-<italic>co</italic>-AA)\nadsorbent was screened in a 3 ppb solution for 11 d at 30 \u00b0C,\naffording a respectable uptake of 1.3 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent.\nWhen the uranyl concentration was increased to 5 ppm, the capacity\nimproved to 21 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent at 30 \u00b0C and 28 mg\nof uranium/g of adsorbent at 40 \u00b0C, again indicative of an endothermic\nuranium binding process. Lastly, the adsorbent was investigated for\nrecovery of uranium from natural seawater, performed by PNNL. The adsorbent was suspended in a column packed\nwith glass beads which was then contacted with filtered seawater from\nSequim Bay, Washington, U.S.A. Following 42 d of contact, an uptake\nof 2.3 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was obtained. Subsequent studies on the same adsorbent deployed in a\n331 ppb uranium screening solution contacted by batch and flow through\ntechniques afforded uranium uptake of 4.54 and 2.97 mg of uranium/g\nof adsorbent, respectively. When exposed to filtered seawater at PNNL, a capacity of 0.48 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent\nwas obtained over 42 d. Finally, when deployed directly in the East\nChina Sea of Xiamen Island for 60 d, 0.25 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent\nwas reported.\n</p>", "clean_text": "When applied to recovering uranium from seawater, several important observations were reported. First, uranium uptake was observed to be linearly correlated with the amount of amidoxime grafted to the trunk. Second, the molar ratio of uranium to amidoxime groups was approximately 1:10-4, revealing poor overall efficiency. Finally, inclusion of the AA comonomer was observed to appreciably increase uranium uptake over the pure amidoxime graft polymer by approximately 20% following 7 d of batch contact with environmental seawater. A maximum uranium uptake of slightly more than 0.5 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was obtained over 50 d of contact with 2 L of environmental seawater, which was replenished every 2 d. \n\nA report from the same group compared the performance of adsorbents prepared by RIGP of AN with different hydrophilic comonomers from a PE trunk fiber, followed by amidoximation with hydroxylamine. As in their prior work, MA was used as one comonomer, while HEMA was the other. As expected, modulating the weight ratios of the comonomers afforded adsorbents with differing hydrophilicities, and it was noted that the amidoxime density and water content needed to be balanced to achieve optimal uranium uptake. Water uptake by the adsorbents (postconversion with hydroxylamine treatment) was maximized when AN was not included in the initial copolymer. For the MA copolymer, water uptake decreased linearly with increasing amidoxime, while the HEMA copolymer did not display an appreciable decrease in water uptake until amidoxime exceeded 60 wt %. Seawater uranium recovery by the adsorbent materials was investigated both in lab-based flow-through experiments, where 20 L of natural seawater was circulated through a column for 24 h, as well as in open-ocean deployments off the coast of Japan, where the materials were submerged at 15 m below the surface. Submersion experiments subsequently validated by column studies revealed ratios of 60:40 for amidoxime:MA and 70:30 amidoxime:HEMA were optimal (). Uranium uptake, measured at 10, 20, and 40 d, revealed superior kinetics for the MAA-containing adsorbent, outperforming the HEMA-containing adsorbent by 1.7\u00d7 and the pure poly(amidoxime) material by 3\u00d7. The best performing material, a 60:40 amidoxime:MA copolymer on a fibrous PE trunk, achieved an uptake of 0.9 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent following 20 d deployment in the open ocean. \n\nMore recently, work from Oyola and colleagues built off the work of Omichi and investigated a series of RIGP-prepared adsorbents composed of PE-graft-poly(amidoxime-co-MA), where various high surface area PE trunk fibers were used instead of the traditional round fibers presented in previous work. These PE supports were prepared by bicomponent melt-spinning technology prior to RIGP, reducing the fiber diameter, changing the cross-sectional shape, or by combinations of both.

Dissolution of the PLA results in a fiber containing as many as 156000 nanofiber \"islands.\" High surface area PE fibers possessing round morphologies of varying diameter () were grafted with 70:30 AN:MA by RIGP, followed by amidoximation and performance screening in an 8 ppm uranium brine solution. The best performing adsorbent also had the smallest diameter, 0.24 mm, and in general adsorbents with smaller diameters outperformed those with larger diameters. Uranium uptake ranged from 30 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent (d = 20 mm) to 140 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent (d = 0.24 mm).\n\nThe performance of nonround fibers as PE trunks was also investigated in the same work. Using bicomponent melt-spinning technology, new shapes including solid or hollow flowers, gears, trilobal shapes, and others were investigated as supports for RIGP-prepared adsorbents ().

Following 11-12 weeks of contact in column-based flow through systems, the JAEA fiber achieved an uptake of 1.1 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent, while uptakes ranging from 2.3 to 3.1 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent were obtained for the high surface area materials.

However, simultaneous investigation of six batches of adsorbent prepared on the same hollow-gear trunk revealed variability in performance, with uranium uptake ranging from 2.7 to 3.5 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent over 8 weeks of exposure.

Uranium extraction was assessed from a 100 ppm solution over 1-d contact, with poly(acrylamidoxime-co-AA) performing comparably to simple poly(amidoxime) and achieving uptake of 25 mg of uranium/g. This similarity in performance is almost certainly attributable to the excessive uranium concentration in the screening solution. A resin-based adsorbent was also prepared by RIGP of AN and AA. In this particular example, an 80:20 amidoxime:AA ratio was optimal, affording an uptake of 924 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent from a 100 ppm UO2(NO3)2 solution. AN and MA grafted on PP by RIGP was also investigated, then analyzed for uranium uptake as a function of pH. In contrast to aforementioned studies, water uptake increased with additional amidoxime content.

Following irradiation in an inert environment, the PE-coated PP fibers were immersed in a comonomer mixture in degassed DMSO, the composition of which was tuned to afford AN:MA ratios ranging from 60:40 to 80:20. Performance was investigated at pH 8 in natural seawater, contacted with a lab-based column flow-through system at a velocity of 3 L min-1. A total of 2 days of contact afforded 0.141, 0.145, and 0.135 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent for 60, 70, and 80 wt % amidoxime-containing materials, respectively. Notably, the 70:30 material displayed the best performance, in contrast to the 60:40 ratio determined for purely a fibrous PE support. Increasing seawater contact time for the optimized adsorbent to 7 days afforded a maximum uptake of 0.300 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent. This nonwoven adsorbent was subsequently used for a large scale open-ocean deployment. A total of 52000 sheets totaling 350 kg were packaged in 3 \u00d7 16 m2 adsorption cages, then deployed for 240 days at 20 m deep, 7 km off the coast of Japan. 1 kg of uranium (yellowcake) was obtained, affording an uptake of 2.8 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent per 240 days. \n\nA PE-coated PP support was used to attach bis-amidoxime groups through a glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) intermediate, polymerized by RIGP. The PE@PP-graft-poly(GMA) was then reacted with 3,3'-iminodipropionitrile, ring-opening the epoxide group on the GMA functionality and installing two nitriles. Subsequent treatment with hydroxylamine results in the desired bis-amidoxime-functionalized adsorbent (). Although this adsorbent was not tested for uranium uptake from natural seawater, adsorption performed in a 100 ppb uranyl solution at pH 5 revealed rapid uptake (>80% in 30 min). When contacted with a 1 ppm uranyl solution, an uptake of 1.6 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was obtained, though competing ions V, Cu and Co all displayed significant adsorption, with values of 1.5, 0.9, and 0.9 mg/g, respectively. Although the performance of the GMA-grafted adsorbents are not remarkable, these works comprise a particularly important contribution because they establish the use of an intermediate ligand to afford the rational design and inclusion of precisely engineered uranyl binding sites.\n\nIn 2008, Pandey and co-workers reported the application of RIGP to prepare PP membranes grafted with poly(AN). Following irradiation in air to a 200 kGy dose, the PP membranes were immersed in a DMF/AN solution at 50 \u00b0C, affording a 125 wt % Dg. The poly(AN) functionalities were converted to amidoxime by treatment with hydroxylamine, and the adsorbent was pretreated in an aqueous KOH solution. Water uptake capacity for the adsorbent was 200 wt % in seawater, compared to 260 wt % in DI water, suggesting an influence of ionic strength on polymer hydrophilicity. Uranium uptake was determined by scintillation counting using a 233U radiotracer, though no explicit concentration values were provided. An uptake of 380 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was determined, affording a 1:4 uranium:amidoxime binding mode assuming exclusive formation of the open-chain amidoxime.\n\nInitial studies performed in the Trombay Estuary () suggested 12 d deployment to be the optimal time frame, balancing uranium uptake against biofouling, which was determined to be detrimental to uranium uptake. Subsequent experiments performed at the power station intake/outfall canals supported this result. Approximately 30% improvement in uranium uptake was observed for the adsorbents deployed by the outfall canal over those deployed at the intake canal, putatively attributed to the elevated temperature and suggesting endothermic thermodynamics for uranium binding. The elution of 1.8 and 4.85 ppm uranium was reported for the outfall canal (following 330 and 570 h deployment, respectively), while the comparative results for the intake canal were 1.3 and 3.92 ppm. Insufficient data were provided to determine the uptake capacity of the adsorbent following seawater deployment.\n\nIn an effort to address the poor mechanical properties exhibited by polymers following irradiation, as well as increase the Dg by promoting postirradiation radical stability, Wu and co-workers applied RIGP to graft ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). When investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance, the radical lifetime on the UHMWPE was approximately 100\u00d7 longer than on PE, suggesting superior potential for polymerization. Upon exposure to 50 kGy \u03b3-radiation from a 60Co source, UHMWPE fibers were immersed in a solution of AN and AA which had been purged with N2. Ammonium iron(II) sulfate, more commonly known as Mohr's salt, was added to the polymerization solution to suppress homopolymerization and promote the growth of the poly(AN-co-AA) graft chain. The study reveals that the tensile strength of the fiber decreases dramatically upon radiation, from 3 to 1.3 GPa. While surface grafting improved tensile strength, subsequent treatment with hydroxylamine mitigated any gains and a final tensile strength of 1.2 GPa was obtained. The UHMWPE-graft-poly(amidoxime-co-AA) adsorbent was screened in a 3 ppb solution for 11 d at 30 \u00b0C, affording a respectable uptake of 1.3 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent. When the uranyl concentration was increased to 5 ppm, the capacity improved to 21 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent at 30 \u00b0C and 28 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent at 40 \u00b0C, again indicative of an endothermic uranium binding process. Lastly, the adsorbent was investigated for recovery of uranium from natural seawater, performed by PNNL. The adsorbent was suspended in a column packed with glass beads which was then contacted with filtered seawater from Sequim Bay, Washington, U.S.A.

When exposed to filtered seawater at PNNL, a capacity of 0.48 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was obtained over 42 d. Finally, when deployed directly in the East China Sea of Xiamen Island for 60 d, 0.25 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was reported.

The max Dg obtained was 553 wt %, but a slow increase in\nDg with dose in excess of 20 kGy suggests a high amount of homopolymerization\nat higher dose and monomer concentration. 10 kGy and 10% monomer concentration\nin the graft solution were deemed ideal. Following polymerization,\nthe GMA was ring-opened by reaction with EDA, with subsequent addition\nof AN to pendant amino groups, yielding nitrile functionalities which\nwere subsequently converted to amidoxime (). Although affording the traditional amidoxime\nfunctionality on the adsorbent, this approach also separates the chelating\nfunctions from the graft chain, while adding amino groups to promote\nhydrophilicity. Furthermore, this physical separation should dramatically\nreduce the extent of cyclic imidedioxime formation, as adjacent amidoximes\nare necessary to accommodate the generation of the 6-member ring,\naffording exclusively the open-chain amidoxime on the adsorbent.

An important observation\nmade by the authors was that the increase in uranium adsorption capacity\nwas correlated with grafting of AN, suggesting that one potential\nrole of the comonomer is simply to promote AN polymerization.</p><p>For the AF materials, varying the AN:IA ratio in the grafting solution\nfrom 3.76:1 to 23.36:1 afforded Dg values of 154\u2013354 wt %.\nFor the AI series, AN:PA ratios varied from 1.91:1 to 7.39:1, resulting\nin Dgs of 110\u2013300 wt %. When screened for uranium uptake in\nthe brine solution, the AF series showed consistent performance of\napproximately 170\u2013190 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent, regardless\nof Dg. A maximum uptake of 200 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent obtained\nfor the material with a 7.57:1 AN:IA ratio, conditioned in KOH for\n3 h prior to contact. In contrast, the AI series displayed a dramatic\nchange in performance in the brine solution as a function of comonomer\nratio. While a PE-<italic>graft</italic>-poly\u00ad(amidoxime) adsorbent\nyielded an uptake of 165 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent, progressive\ninclusion of PA afforded increasing uptake, maximized at a ratio of\napproximately 3.2\u20133.5:1 (). The maximum uptake was approximately\n187 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent, following 3 h of KOH conditioning.</p><p>For both AF and AI materials, trends observed during\nbrine screening\nloosely predicted performance upon deployment in seawater (). For AF, the\nbest material performance was achieved by a 10.14:1 AN:IA ratio contacted\nfor 1 h with KOH, affording 3.9 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent. This\nis a slightly higher monomer ratio than determined ideal by the screening\nstudy, underscoring the importance of actual seawater tests in providing\nmeaningful adsorption data and for analyzing the effect of synthetic\nmodifications to adsorbents. For AI materials, the same AN:PA ratios\nas identified in screening afforded the optimal performance, though\nthe material composed of 3.52:1 AN:PA out-performed the material with\na 3.21:1 ratio. In contrast to the screening studies, the differences\nin uranium uptake were much less distinct, with most materials, including\nPE-<italic>graft-</italic>poly\u00ad(amidoxime), achieving capacities ranging\nfrom 2.8\u20133.2 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent. The best uptake\nof 3.4 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was achieved following 3 h of\nKOH conditioning of the material with a 3.52:1 AN:PA ratio.</p><p>Wang and colleagues performed a closely related work, using\npreirradiation\nto graft emulsified GMA (with Tween-20 surfactant) onto PE nonwoven\nfabric. In addition to TETA, DETA, and\nEDA, tetraethylenepentamine was also used to functionalize the poly\u00ad(GMA)-<italic>graft</italic>-PE material. While Dg of up to 325 wt % could be obtained\nwith a dose of 30 kGy and 60 min polymerization at 75 \u00b0C, the\nhigh Dg materials were observed to embrittle, and an optimal Dg of\n195 wt % was selected. Uranium uptake was determined from various\nscreening solutions with the best performing material containing the\nsimple EDA chelator which afforded the highest molar density (). When contacted\nwith a 1 ppm uranyl solution in water, a capacity of 1.6 mg of uranium/g\nof adsorbent was achieved. Inclusion of carbonate reduced the uptake\nto 1.3 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent. Reducing the uranium concentration\nto that of natural seawater afforded uptake of 0.006 and 0.003 mg\nof uranium/g of adsorbent, for DI water and carbonate solutions, respectively.\n</p><p>Related work was recently published articulating the preparation\nof PE@PP-<italic>graft</italic>-poly\u00ad(4-hydroxybutyl acrylate glycidyl\nether) (4-HAGE) by RIGP and emulsion polymerization in a 5% graft\nligand and 0.5% Tween-20 solution. Similar\nto GMA, 4-HAGE possesses an epoxide group which can be opened through\nnucleophilic attack by sterically unencumbered amines, as well as\nan acryl functionality which is amenable to RIGP. The primary difference\nis the length of the alkyl chain between the acryl and epoxide groups,\nwith 4-HAGE an additional six atoms farther away and putatively affording\nfaster adsorption and improved performance. As reported previously,\nfollowing polymerization on a nonwoven PE coated PP fabric, the epoxide\ngroup was opened with EDA, DETA, TETA, and diethylamine (DEA) affording\nchelator densities ranging from 1.6 to 3 mmol g<sup>\u20131</sup>. Uranium adsorption studies were performed revealing DETA to achieve\nfastest adsorption kinetics, followed by DEA, TETA, and EDA, and a\nmaximum uranium uptake of 64.3 mg of uranium/g. While pH had a negligible\neffect on the uranium uptake over the range of 4\u20138.5, deploying\nthe adsorbents in uranyl solutions with 3.5% salinity, appropriate\nfor a seawater simulant, resulted in a 55% loss of capacity. Furthermore,\nadsorption was optimal when performed at 25 \u00b0C, outperforming\nstudies performed at 35 \u00b0C and far superior to performance at\nlower temperature. These results not only prevent determination of\nbinding enthalpy, but also suggest factors in addition to those occurring\nat the atomistic scale influence the energetics of uranium binding\nin this system.\n</p><p>Wang, Li and colleagues\nreported the first instance of emulsion\npolymerization of AN for development of adsorbents for the recovery\nof uranium from seawater. PE nonwoven\nfabric was preirradiated and contacted with AN emulsified with Tween-20,\nfollowed by treatment with hydroxylamine to generate PE-<italic>graft</italic>-poly\u00ad(amidoxime), as reported in a previous work. Characterization of uranium uptake was performed at different\nconcentrations and temperatures in 3.5 L of uranyl solutions.

Application of the Arrhenius\nequation afforded an activation energy of 65.8 kJ mol<sup>\u20131</sup>, and the increase in uranium uptake as a function of temperature\nis indicative of an endothermic binding process.\n</p><p>Later work from the same group reported the preparation of\npoly\u00ad(AN-<italic>co</italic>-VP) interpenetrating polymer networks\n(IPNs), synthesized\nby \u03b3-irradiation of solutions of AN in VP. Nitriles were converted\nto amidoxime by treatment with hydroxylamine, which was monitored\nby FTIR and correlated well with uranyl uptake. While the poly\u00ad(AN-<italic>co</italic>-VP) IPN afforded a uranium uptake of 540 mg of uranium/g\nof adsorbent prior to treatment with hydroxylamine, performance improved\nto 750 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent after formation of the amidoxime\ngroups. While the importance of forming the amidoxime species cannot\nbe overstated, these uptake experiments were performed at a concentration\nof 1400 ppm uranium, without any carbonate or consideration for ionic\nstrength. Accordingly, a high uptake is observed for even the nonamidoximated\nmaterial, and little insight is afforded regarding the materials potential\nfor seawater uranium recovery.\n</p><p>This first generation of ATRP adsorbents were screened in\na 6 ppm\nuranium brine solution under laboratory conditions, achieving uptake\nof 141\u2013179 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent. However, when deployed\nin filtered natural seawater in a flow-through column setup, uptake\nwas lower than that of other high-surface-area adsorbents, attributed to slower adsorption kinetics resulting from suppressed\nmass transfer. The next iteration on the adsorbent included the installation\nof a hydrophilic block of poly\u00ad(<italic>t</italic>BA) on the end of\nthe graft chain terminus, resulting in the doubling of the seawater\nadsorption capacity from 1.56 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent to over\n3 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent following 56 d of exposure. This investigation\nrevealed the importance of polymer chain conformation and optimization\nof hydrophilic comonomers in the development of advanced adsorbents\nfor uranium recovery from seawater.</p><p>Brown and colleagues recently\nreported the complete elimination\nof the RIGP step to further advance the preparation of adsorbents\nvia ATRP. In order to afford ATRP initiation\nsites, a new class of trunk materials were prepared by chlorination\nof PP round fibers, a hollow-gear-shaped PP fiber, and a hollow-gear-shaped\nPE fiber (shaped fibers, including representative pictures, are discussed\nabove in section 4.2.2). ATRP of AN and <italic>t</italic>BA from\nthe halide-functionalized trunk fibers was successfully achieved,\nwith Dg as high as 2570 wt % obtained. Amidoximation was achieved\nby the usual approach. An overview of the synthesis of this new adsorbent\nis provided in . The maximum adsorption capacity from a 6 ppm uranium screening\nbrine solution was 146.6 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent, approximately\ndoubling an adsorbent provided by the JAEA as a control (75.1 mg of\nuranium/g of adsorbent).</p>", "clean_text": "UHMWPE was subsequently used by the same group as the fibrous polymer support for grafting of GMA and MA by RIGP, again using a 60Co source to afford \u03b3-irradiation. The Dg was analyzed in the material as a function of monomer concentration and dose. The max Dg obtained was 553 wt %, but a slow increase in Dg with dose in excess of 20 kGy suggests a high amount of homopolymerization at higher dose and monomer concentration. 10 kGy and 10% monomer concentration in the graft solution were deemed ideal. Following polymerization, the GMA was ring-opened by reaction with EDA, with subsequent addition of AN to pendant amino groups, yielding nitrile functionalities which were subsequently converted to amidoxime (). Although affording the traditional amidoxime functionality on the adsorbent, this approach also separates the chelating functions from the graft chain, while adding amino groups to promote hydrophilicity. Furthermore, this physical separation should dramatically reduce the extent of cyclic imidedioxime formation, as adjacent amidoximes are necessary to accommodate the generation of the 6-member ring, affording exclusively the open-chain amidoxime on the adsorbent. For these reasons, the synthetic avenue pursued in the development of this adsorbent shows significant promise for the rational design of model systems which would afford insight into identification of adsorbent functional groups and metal binding environments. The adsorbent was tested in a seawater simulant under continuous flow conditions, affording an adsorbent uptake of 1.97 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent. The adsorbent also displayed much better uptake of uranium over vanadium, a metal which traditionally is highly competitive for binding sites. The uptake of metals by the adsorbent was as follows: U > Cu > Fe > Ca > Mg > Ni > Zn > Pb > V > Co. \n\nA later work reported the tuning of AN/AA feed ratios during the RIGP preparation of UHMWPE adsorbents. The series of materials possessed AN:AA ratios of 4:1, 1.3:1, 0.92:1, and 0.3:1, and were screened with a 300 ppb uranium solution in seawater simulant, as well as deployment off the coast of Xiamen Island at 3 m deep for 60 d. Tensile tests revealed a 50% reduction in strength upon irradiation, with further reduction upon grafting and deployment in seawater. Furthermore, the authors noted higher ratios of AN:AA were not favorable for uranium extraction, consistent with previously reported work, and proposed a potential synergism between the carboxylic acid and amidoxime functionalities in achieving uranium binding. Uranium recovery from simulant was 5.49, 8.10, 7.01, and 3.62 mg-uranium/g-adsorbent, respectively. Similarly, adsorption upon oceanic deployment afforded uptake of 0.29, 0.50, 0.77, and 0.33 mg-uranium/g-adsorbent. From this work, the authors concluded that the 0.92:1 ratio of AN:AA afforded the best adsorbent, but also that there was no definitive correlation between the quantity of amidoxime groups and the adsorption capacity. \n\nOyola and Dai reported the systematic investigation of uranium uptake as a function of different comonomers grafted by RIGP on a PE fiber. Using a brine solution for screening performance, they observed uranium uptake as a function of comonomer was as follows: AA < vinyl sulfonic acid < MA < itaconic acid (IA) < vinyl phosphonic acid (PA), which achieved an uptake of approximately 160 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent. When exposed to environmental seawater, the performance changed: MA < AA (with Mohr's salt) < vinyl sulfonic acid < IA (with Mohr's salt) < IA (without Mohr's salt) < PA. Several different formulations of the adsorbents were investigated, affording seawater uranium uptake as high as 5 mg of uranium/g of adsorbnet over 11 weeks or 4.4 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent over 8 weeks. CHN analysis revealed a low cografting of hydrophilic monomers (e.g., <10 wt % IA and <3 wt % PA). An important observation made by the authors was that the increase in uranium adsorption capacity was correlated with grafting of AN, suggesting that one potential role of the comonomer is simply to promote AN polymerization.\n\nFor the AF materials, varying the AN:IA ratio in the grafting solution from 3.76:1 to 23.36:1 afforded Dg values of 154-354 wt %. For the AI series, AN:PA ratios varied from 1.91:1 to 7.39:1, resulting in Dgs of 110-300 wt %. When screened for uranium uptake in the brine solution, the AF series showed consistent performance of approximately 170-190 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent, regardless of Dg. A maximum uptake of 200 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent obtained for the material with a 7.57:1 AN:IA ratio, conditioned in KOH for 3 h prior to contact. In contrast, the AI series displayed a dramatic change in performance in the brine solution as a function of comonomer ratio. While a PE-graft-poly(amidoxime) adsorbent yielded an uptake of 165 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent, progressive inclusion of PA afforded increasing uptake, maximized at a ratio of approximately 3.2-3.5:1 (). The maximum uptake was approximately 187 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent, following 3 h of KOH conditioning.\n\nFor both AF and AI materials, trends observed during brine screening loosely predicted performance upon deployment in seawater (). For AF, the best material performance was achieved by a 10.14:1 AN:IA ratio contacted for 1 h with KOH, affording 3.9 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent. This is a slightly higher monomer ratio than determined ideal by the screening study, underscoring the importance of actual seawater tests in providing meaningful adsorption data and for analyzing the effect of synthetic modifications to adsorbents. For AI materials, the same AN:PA ratios as identified in screening afforded the optimal performance, though the material composed of 3.52:1 AN:PA out-performed the material with a 3.21:1 ratio. In contrast to the screening studies, the differences in uranium uptake were much less distinct, with most materials, including PE-graft-poly(amidoxime), achieving capacities ranging from 2.8-3.2 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent. The best uptake of 3.4 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was achieved following 3 h of KOH conditioning of the material with a 3.52:1 AN:PA ratio.\n\nWang and colleagues performed a closely related work, using preirradiation to graft emulsified GMA (with Tween-20 surfactant) onto PE nonwoven fabric. In addition to TETA, DETA, and EDA, tetraethylenepentamine was also used to functionalize the poly(GMA)-graft-PE material. While Dg of up to 325 wt % could be obtained with a dose of 30 kGy and 60 min polymerization at 75 \u00b0C, the high Dg materials were observed to embrittle, and an optimal Dg of 195 wt % was selected. Uranium uptake was determined from various screening solutions with the best performing material containing the simple EDA chelator which afforded the highest molar density (). When contacted with a 1 ppm uranyl solution in water, a capacity of 1.6 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was achieved. Inclusion of carbonate reduced the uptake to 1.3 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent. Reducing the uranium concentration to that of natural seawater afforded uptake of 0.006 and 0.003 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent, for DI water and carbonate solutions, respectively. \n\nRelated work was recently published articulating the preparation of PE@PP-graft-poly(4-hydroxybutyl acrylate glycidyl ether) (4-HAGE) by RIGP and emulsion polymerization in a 5% graft ligand and 0.5% Tween-20 solution. Similar to GMA, 4-HAGE possesses an epoxide group which can be opened through nucleophilic attack by sterically unencumbered amines, as well as an acryl functionality which is amenable to RIGP. The primary difference is the length of the alkyl chain between the acryl and epoxide groups, with 4-HAGE an additional six atoms farther away and putatively affording faster adsorption and improved performance. As reported previously, following polymerization on a nonwoven PE coated PP fabric, the epoxide group was opened with EDA, DETA, TETA, and diethylamine (DEA) affording chelator densities ranging from 1.6 to 3 mmol g-1. Uranium adsorption studies were performed revealing DETA to achieve fastest adsorption kinetics, followed by DEA, TETA, and EDA, and a maximum uranium uptake of 64.3 mg of uranium/g. While pH had a negligible effect on the uranium uptake over the range of 4-8.5, deploying the adsorbents in uranyl solutions with 3.5% salinity, appropriate for a seawater simulant, resulted in a 55% loss of capacity. Furthermore, adsorption was optimal when performed at 25 \u00b0C, outperforming studies performed at 35 \u00b0C and far superior to performance at lower temperature. These results not only prevent determination of binding enthalpy, but also suggest factors in addition to those occurring at the atomistic scale influence the energetics of uranium binding in this system. \n\nWang, Li and colleagues reported the first instance of emulsion polymerization of AN for development of adsorbents for the recovery of uranium from seawater.

Characterization of uranium uptake was performed at different concentrations and temperatures in 3.5 L of uranyl solutions. At the environmentally relevant concentration of 3 ppb and pH 7.5, the adsorbent achieved 0.024-0.036 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent following 10 days contact at 10-30 \u00b0C. Application of the Arrhenius equation afforded an activation energy of 65.8 kJ mol-1, and the increase in uranium uptake as a function of temperature is indicative of an endothermic binding process. \n\nLater work from the same group reported the preparation of poly(AN-co-VP) interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs), synthesized by \u03b3-irradiation of solutions of AN in VP. Nitriles were converted to amidoxime by treatment with hydroxylamine, which was monitored by FTIR and correlated well with uranyl uptake. While the poly(AN-co-VP) IPN afforded a uranium uptake of 540 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent prior to treatment with hydroxylamine, performance improved to 750 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent after formation of the amidoxime groups. While the importance of forming the amidoxime species cannot be overstated, these uptake experiments were performed at a concentration of 1400 ppm uranium, without any carbonate or consideration for ionic strength.

Sorption\ndata were not collected above pH 7, but this study reveals negligible\nsorption would be expected by unfunctionalized activated carbon under\nseawater conditions.\n</p><p>Electrosorption\nusing activated carbon slurries prepared with polyvinylidene\nfluoride (PVDF) has also been studied. This technique utilizes the conductivity of the carbon to extract\nions through isolation within the electrical double layer formed when\na bias potential is applied to the electrodes. Through optimizing\nthe applied potential at +0.4 V (), uranyl can be selectively separated from\nseawater. A capacity after 300 min of applied potential was reported\nas 3.4 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent, comparable to high surface area\nadsorbents recently developed at ORNL. The authors speculate that\nno cationic species is adsorbed; therefore, the triscarbonatouranyl\u00ad(VI)\nanion must be the electrosorbed species. However, the calcium and\nmagnesium response, two cations reported to have strong binding affinity\nto the triscarbonatouranyl\u00ad(VI) anion, do not appear to increase with\nthe uranium uptake. While this work is promising, more work is required\ndue to the large decrease in surface area from the use of 50 wt %\nbinder (PVDF) to stabilize the activated carbon electrode. Further\nwork is required to understand the electrosorption process and further\ncharacterize the ion extraction as no high valent metals are discussed\noutside of uranium. The high oxidation state transition metals should\nbe electrosorbed as well and will impact the reported economics of\nthe process.</p><p>The authors\nfirst tested the amidoxime-functionalized carbon electrode\nand HW-ACE method in seawater spiked with uranium concentrations ranging\nfrom 150 ppb to 2000 ppm, revealing the formation of (UO<sub>2</sub>)\u00adO<sub>2</sub>\u00b72H<sub>2</sub>O crystals on the surface of the\nelectrode. In a head-to-head comparison against pure physicochemical\nadsorption, performance improvements through application of the HW-ACE\napproach were obvious. Near 100% recovery of uranium was achieved\nby HW-ACE across all concentrations, while physicochemical adsorption\nvaried from approximately 10% to 80%, as displayed in . The difference in performance\nwas also observed by EDX using a poly\u00ad(amidoxime)-coated electrode\npatterned with parallel Pt lines on an insulating quartz substrate.\nAfter extraction of uranium, EDX mapping clearly revealed uranium\nbinding to map directly on the conduction Pt pattern on the electrode\n(), confirming\nthat the application of the bias and resulting uranium concentration\nresulted in the improved uranium uptake. When subsequently tested\nin filtered, unspiked, environmental seawater, the HW-ACE approach\nachieved a uranium uptake of 1.62 \u03bcg, compared to 0.55 \u03bcg\nfor physicochemical adsorption.</p><p>Benzoylthiourea-functionalized\nactivated carbons were prepared\nthrough in situ generation of diazonium cations. These materials were investigated for uranyl sorption from\npH 1\u20135, with differing speciation of uranyl again providing\nthe rationale for why sorption was not continued to environmental\npH. A saturation capacity of 82 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was obtained,\nwhich surpassed the unmodified activated carbon by three times. The\nbinding motif for the benzoylthiourea-functionalized carbon was proposed\nto be chelation of one uranyl by two cooperating benzoylthiourea functionalities\nthrough the carboxylic oxygen and thiourea sulfur, while the imide\nand amine nitrogen were proposed to be Lewis bases donating electron\npairs to other uranyl molecules.\n</p><p>CMK-3, a nanoporous ordered carbon, was functionalized with a carboxymethylated\npolyethylenimine substrate. Upon functionalization, the surface area\nof the material decreased by approximately 50%, while degree of functionalization\nwas estimated at 24% by total organic carbon analysis. Sorption isotherms\ndisplayed good sorption from pH 3\u20134, with saturation capacities\nof 119 and 222 mg g<sup>\u20131</sup>, respectively. It was proposed\nfurther deprotonation of the imine and carboxylic acids resulted in\nthe improved sorption capacity at higher pH. CMK-3 was also functionalized by oxidation to generate a surface\ncarboxylic acid. A maximum saturation capacity of 190 mg g<sup>\u20131</sup> was observed at pH 5.5, decreasing to 160 mg g<sup>\u20131</sup> at pH 7.5. Interestingly, the pristine CMK-3 also displayed a maximum\nsorption capacity of 120 mg g<sup>\u20131</sup> at pH 6, decreasing\nto 90 mg g<sup>\u20131</sup> at pH 7.5.\n</p><p>A related activated carbon material, CMK-5, was functionalized\nwith 4-acetophenone oxime by thermally induced diazonitization with\nisoamyl nitrite (). Batch sorption experiments\nwere performed to investigate uranyl sorption from simulated effluent\nfrom nuclear processing. The simulant contained multiple competing\ndi- and trivalent transition metals as well as several lanthanides.\nWhile poor sorption was observed below pH 3, a maximum sorption capacity\naround 65 mg g<sup>\u20131</sup> was obtained at pH 4.5. This was\nrationalized by the extent to which the oxime could be deprotonated,\nforming a proposed uranyl complex of four equatorial monodentate-coordinating\noxime ligands.\n</p><p>A salicylaldeneimine-functionalized hydrothermal carbon was\nprepared\nby functionalizing an activated hydrothermal carbon with ethylenediamine. Condensation with salicylaldehyde resulted\nin the final material, which was investigated for extraction of uranyl\nover the pH range of &lt;1\u20134.5. Uptake increased with increasing\npH, with a maximum uptake of 261 mg g<sup>\u20131</sup> obtained\nat pH 4.3, while kinetic studies revealed more than 80% of the total\nadsorption occurred in the first minute. Competitive adsorption of\nuranyl from simulated nuclear processing effluent revealed remarkable\nselectivity for uranyl, with a <italic>K</italic>\n<sub>d</sub> of approximately\n9.5 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> mL g<sup>\u20131</sup>.\n</p><p>In an effort to provide a more direct basis for comparison,\nCarboni\net al. prepared a library of organic functional groups and grafted\nthem to commercially available mesoporous carbon through formation\nof in situ diazonium cations (). Containing many functional\ngroups investigated on MS materials by Vivero-Escoto, a similar result was obtained: a phosphylated mesoporous\ncarbon material possessed the highest sorption capacity, at both pH\n4 and 8.2. Saturation capacities of 85 and 50 mg g<sup>\u20131</sup> were obtained under these conditions, respectively. Not surprisingly,\nsorption of uranyl was pH-dependent, with a dramatic increase observed\nabove pH 3.5 attributed to the first deprotonation of the surface\nphosphoryl groups.\n</p>", "clean_text": "The same group simultaneously reported graft-polymerizing from a commercially available poly(vinyl chloride)-co-chlorinated poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC-co-CPVC) fiber through application of ATRP (). This direct approach eliminates any modification of the trunk material, simplifying the process and reducing the adsorbent cost. The ratio of AN to tBA was systematically varied to identify the optimal ratio of hydrophilicity and uranyl binding amidoxime functionalities, derived from the AN by treatment with hydroxylamine. The best performing adsorbent possessed a tBA:AN ratio of 0.356 and a Dg of 1390 wt %. When deployed in flow-through column studies and contacted with filtered natural seawater, remarkable uptake was obtained. Following 42 days exposure, the material uptake ranged from 2.42-3.24 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent, while 5.22 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was recovered following 49 d of exposure. To date, this remains the highest uranium uptake reported in the open literature.\n\nWhile displaying remarkable promise, questions remain unresolved regarding interbatch reproducibility for the PVC-co-CPVC-graft-poly(AO-co-tBA) material. As reported in the publication, three different batches of adsorbent were analyzed for recovery of uranium from filtered natural seawater, each affording different uptake kinetics and calculated saturation capacities. While the best performing batch reached a half-saturation around 14 days contact, the worst performing batch required nearly twice as long (). Accompanying calculated saturation uptake ranged from 3.94 to 6.91 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent. Comparison against JAEA reference fibers deployed and measured simultaneously also displayed significant fluctuations, though the changes in uptake did not correlate with those observed for the ATRP-prepared material. The authors attributed slight compositional differences to be the driving force in the dramatic changes in performance. Further investigation is necessary to achieve sufficiently precise control over the polymer composition and validate the influence on adsorbent performance. If this hypothesis is correct, it implies extreme sensitivity of the adsorbent to subtle changes in synthetic approach, and causes one to question whether such control is achievable at industrial scale.\n\nATRP has also been applied to the synthesis of mesoporous polymer adsorbents, functionalized with poly(amidoxime). As first reported by Yue and co-workers, a copolymer monolith support was synthesized by conventional free radical polymerization of VBC and DVB in the presence of AIBN. A surface area of 572 m2 g-1 was achieved by optimizing the ratio of the two comonomers. Subsequent ATRP of AN was initiated from the chloride in the poly(VBC-co-DVB), which was subsequently converted to amidoxime by treatment with hydroxylamine.  displays a representative schematic of the synthesis process.\n\nWhen screened for uranium adsorption in a 6.8 ppm uranyl brine solution at pH 8, the material achieved an uptake of 80 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent, outperforming several commercially available adsorbent materials. Furthermore, when deployed in 5 gallons (18.92 L) of environmental seawater for 27 d, an uptake of 2.0 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was achieved. \n\nThe same group applied ATRP to the functionalization of a porous aromatic framework (PAF) with poly(AN), followed by conversion to PAF-graft-poly(AO) with hydroxylamine. Uranium uptake was assessed in laboratory screening tests using a 6 ppm uranium brine solution, where the adsorbent outperformed several commercially available adsorbents as well as a reference fiber obtained from the JAEA. Uptakes of 64.1 and 65.2 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent were obtained for the \"as prepared\" sample, as well as following a KOH-conditioning step. The statistically insignificant difference in uranium uptake indicates the alkaline preconditioning normally required for polymer adsorbents is not necessary for this particular material. While easy to overlook this important detail, the identity of the trunk is the primary difference that differentiates this polymer adsorbent from the many different adsorbent materials discussed above, and further research is warranted to elucidate the relationship between trunk material and need for KOH conditioning prior to achieving promising performance.\n\nThe adsorbent was also tested via batch-contact in filtered environmental seawater spiked to an 80 ppb uranium concentration. Following 42 d of contact, an adsorption capacity of 4.81 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was achieved. Furthermore, kinetics analysis revealed approximately 80% of all uranium was adsorbed after 2 weeks of contact, suggesting a reduced deployment time would be plausible. Nevertheless, no appreciable uranium uptake was detected by the authors when the material was deployed in unspiked seawater, though the low concentration of uranium was near the limits of their analytical quantification. \n\nChi and co-workers further developed the above work, varying the ratio of DVB:VBC and polymerizing AN by ATRP. As in the work by Yue and colleagues, the surface area and pore architectures of the poly(DVB:VBC) could be tuned as a function of the DVB:VBC ratio. Furthermore, the authors noted that poly(AN) length varied as the structure of the poly(DVB-co-VBC) support changed. While the highest Dg was obtained for the material formed on the 1:1 DVB:VBC support, the best performing adsorbent was prepared on 2:1 DVB:VBC, suggesting the structure of the support may supersede Dg in determining adsorbent performance. When contacted with a 100 ppm aqueous uranyl solution at pH 8.3, a uranium uptake of 75 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was achieved. When the concentration was reduced to 10 ppb, an uptake of 2 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was reported.\n\nThe first instance of functionalized carbon for extraction of uranium was by Starvin et al. in 2004. An activated carbon compound was functionalized with diarylazobisphenol through treatment in an aqueous solution, similar to previously reported functionalization of single-wall carbon nanotubes through chemical modification with a diazonium compound. No information is provided regarding surface area coverage or even characterization of the carbon material. It was packed into a column and investigated for preconcentration of uranium in the pH range of 4-5, saturating at approximately 18 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent. \n\nUnfunctionalized activated carbon was also investigated for batch adsorption. Varying contact time, pH, concentration of uranium, and temperature, a maximum uptake of 28 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was obtained at pH 3 and 20 \u00b0C with 4 h contact time. Uranium sorption was observed to decrease significantly below pH 2 and above pH 6. It was suggested optimal saturation occurs at pH 3 because this is the acidity at which \"free\" uranium is maximized, meaning uranyl speciates to a penta-aqua complex and there is minimal formation of dimers or tetramers. Sorption data were not collected above pH 7, but this study reveals negligible sorption would be expected by unfunctionalized activated carbon under seawater conditions. \n\nElectrosorption using activated carbon slurries prepared with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) has also been studied. This technique utilizes the conductivity of the carbon to extract ions through isolation within the electrical double layer formed when a bias potential is applied to the electrodes. Through optimizing the applied potential at +0.4 V (), uranyl can be selectively separated from seawater. A capacity after 300 min of applied potential was reported as 3.4 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent, comparable to high surface area adsorbents recently developed at ORNL. The authors speculate that no cationic species is adsorbed; therefore, the triscarbonatouranyl(VI) anion must be the electrosorbed species. However, the calcium and magnesium response, two cations reported to have strong binding affinity to the triscarbonatouranyl(VI) anion, do not appear to increase with the uranium uptake. While this work is promising, more work is required due to the large decrease in surface area from the use of 50 wt % binder (PVDF) to stabilize the activated carbon electrode. Further work is required to understand the electrosorption process and further characterize the ion extraction as no high valent metals are discussed outside of uranium. The high oxidation state transition metals should be electrosorbed as well and will impact the reported economics of the process.\n\nThe authors first tested the amidoxime-functionalized carbon electrode and HW-ACE method in seawater spiked with uranium concentrations ranging from 150 ppb to 2000 ppm, revealing the formation of (UO2)O2\u22c52H2O crystals on the surface of the electrode. In a head-to-head comparison against pure physicochemical adsorption, performance improvements through application of the HW-ACE approach were obvious. Near 100% recovery of uranium was achieved by HW-ACE across all concentrations, while physicochemical adsorption varied from approximately 10% to 80%, as displayed in . The difference in performance was also observed by EDX using a poly(amidoxime)-coated electrode patterned with parallel Pt lines on an insulating quartz substrate. After extraction of uranium, EDX mapping clearly revealed uranium binding to map directly on the conduction Pt pattern on the electrode (), confirming that the application of the bias and resulting uranium concentration resulted in the improved uranium uptake. When subsequently tested in filtered, unspiked, environmental seawater, the HW-ACE approach achieved a uranium uptake of 1.62 \u03bcg, compared to 0.55 \u03bcg for physicochemical adsorption.\n\nBenzoylthiourea-functionalized activated carbons were prepared through in situ generation of diazonium cations. These materials were investigated for uranyl sorption from pH 1-5, with differing speciation of uranyl again providing the rationale for why sorption was not continued to environmental pH. A saturation capacity of 82 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was obtained, which surpassed the unmodified activated carbon by three times. The binding motif for the benzoylthiourea-functionalized carbon was proposed to be chelation of one uranyl by two cooperating benzoylthiourea functionalities through the carboxylic oxygen and thiourea sulfur, while the imide and amine nitrogen were proposed to be Lewis bases donating electron pairs to other uranyl molecules. \n\nCMK-3, a nanoporous ordered carbon, was functionalized with a carboxymethylated polyethylenimine substrate. Upon functionalization, the surface area of the material decreased by approximately 50%, while degree of functionalization was estimated at 24% by total organic carbon analysis. Sorption isotherms displayed good sorption from pH 3-4, with saturation capacities of 119 and 222 mg g-1, respectively. It was proposed further deprotonation of the imine and carboxylic acids resulted in the improved sorption capacity at higher pH. CMK-3 was also functionalized by oxidation to generate a surface carboxylic acid. A maximum saturation capacity of 190 mg g-1 was observed at pH 5.5, decreasing to 160 mg g-1 at pH 7.5. Interestingly, the pristine CMK-3 also displayed a maximum sorption capacity of 120 mg g-1 at pH 6, decreasing to 90 mg g-1 at pH 7.5. \n\nA related activated carbon material, CMK-5, was functionalized with 4-acetophenone oxime by thermally induced diazonitization with isoamyl nitrite (). Batch sorption experiments were performed to investigate uranyl sorption from simulated effluent from nuclear processing. The simulant contained multiple competing di- and trivalent transition metals as well as several lanthanides. While poor sorption was observed below pH 3, a maximum sorption capacity around 65 mg g-1 was obtained at pH 4.5. This was rationalized by the extent to which the oxime could be deprotonated, forming a proposed uranyl complex of four equatorial monodentate-coordinating oxime ligands. \n\nA salicylaldeneimine-functionalized hydrothermal carbon was prepared by functionalizing an activated hydrothermal carbon with ethylenediamine. Condensation with salicylaldehyde resulted in the final material, which was investigated for extraction of uranyl over the pH range of <1-4.5. Uptake increased with increasing pH, with a maximum uptake of 261 mg g-1 obtained at pH 4.3, while kinetic studies revealed more than 80% of the total adsorption occurred in the first minute. Competitive adsorption of uranyl from simulated nuclear processing effluent revealed remarkable selectivity for uranyl, with a K d of approximately 9.5 \u00d7 104 mL g-1. \n\nIn an effort to provide a more direct basis for comparison, Carboni et al. prepared a library of organic functional groups and grafted them to commercially available mesoporous carbon through formation of in situ diazonium cations (). Containing many functional groups investigated on MS materials by Vivero-Escoto, a similar result was obtained: a phosphylated mesoporous carbon material possessed the highest sorption capacity, at both pH 4 and 8.2. Saturation capacities of 85 and 50 mg g-1 were obtained under these conditions, respectively. Not surprisingly, sorption of uranyl was pH-dependent, with a dramatic increase observed above pH 3.5 attributed to the first deprotonation of the surface phosphoryl groups.

The\nauthors reported that a high intensity ultrasonication, using an ultrasonic\nhorn as the source, provided more conformal polymer coatings within\nthe pores compared to the standard lab bath ultrasound. This was observed\nthrough the nitrogen sorption isotherms where a hysteresis of the\nlab bath ultrasound was extended instead of sharply closing, as in\nthe case of the high intensity ultrasound, a phenomenon attributed\nto pore constrictions ().

While much of this report duplicates previous\nwork, the authors do perform sorption\nexperiments up to pH 9, where a dramatic decrease in uptake is observed\n(). The pH\nof the sorption solution was adjusted with small amounts of HNO<sub>3</sub> or Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, which suggests that at higher\npH there would be an appreciable effect from formation of [UO<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>4\u2013</sup>.

Interestingly, negative uptake\nwas reported at pH 2.</p><p>Rapid absorption uptake was observed in a kinetics investigation,\nwith complete uptake achieved in less than 1 min. However, this experimental setup does not provide meaningful\ninformation, as the experiment was performed at a concentration where\nthe adsorbent was not saturated. Similar kinetics would be observed\nfor most materials where absorption kinetics are performed below saturation\nconcentrations. Moreover, the instantaneous completion of adsorption\ncasts doubt on the analytical rigor. The only data point which was\nnot 90 \u00b1 5 mg of uranium/g of ads was the data point at <italic>t</italic> = 0.

Subsequent adsorption isotherms reveal a saturation\ncapacity of 126 mg of uranium/g of ads at pH 2 in DI water, despite\nonly having a contact time of 5 min.

The authors report an increase in degree of grafting through sonochemical approaches compared to efforts with free radical polymerization. They propose pore blockage occurs during free radical polymerization, but penetration of the monomer is encouraged through sonication. The authors reported that a high intensity ultrasonication, using an ultrasonic horn as the source, provided more conformal polymer coatings within the pores compared to the standard lab bath ultrasound. This was observed through the nitrogen sorption isotherms where a hysteresis of the lab bath ultrasound was extended instead of sharply closing, as in the case of the high intensity ultrasound, a phenomenon attributed to pore constrictions (). Homogeneous polymerization of poly(AN) throughout the mesoporous material was coupled with nitric acid surface oxidation and CO2 pore activation to achieve enhanced sorbent performance. Modest sorption capacities of <1-4 mg g-1 were obtained, but these experiments were performed in a seawater simulant at pH 8.2 with carbonate sources, which typically reduces sorption dramatically. \n\nCarbon nanotubes have also been investigated for uranium sorption. First reports involve acid treatment for enhancing colloidal stability, with sorption capacities of approximately 45 mg g-1 achieved at pH 5. Similar results were obtained by oxidation of multiwalled carbon nanotubes, affording a sorption capacity of 36 mg g-1. Finally, carboxymethyl cellulose was also attached to the surface of multiwalled carbon nanotubes by plasma induced grafting. After exposure to an N2 plasma, the nanotubes were combined with carboxymethyl cellulose and heated to 80 \u00b0C for 1 week with stirring. Sorption isotherms obtained at pH 5 yield a sorption capacity of approximately 110 mg g-1. \n\nVery recently, a graphene oxide (GO)/amidoxime hydrogel adsorbent was developed for the removal of uranium from aqueous solution, including seawater simulant. Amino acids, polyamines, and metformin possess multiple nitrogen basic moieties which bind with carboxylic or alcohol groups on GO sheets, forming hydrogels. Iminodiacetonitirle (IDAN) was treated with hydroxylamine to form the amidoxime derivative, AO-IDAN, which was then used as a cross-linking agent in the GO dispersion. Uranium adsorption experiments reveal pH affects performance significantly, with maximum uptake achieved from pH 5-7. A slight decrease was observed at pH 8, followed by a precipitous drop at higher pH. When contacted with a 3.7 ppb uranium seawater simulant at a phase ratio of 0.5 mg L-1, the hydrogel adsorbed 88% of the uranium in solution, affording an uptake of 0.006 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent over 6 h. An isotherm performed at pH 6 yields a saturation capacity of 398 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent.\n\nApplying this process yielded supports with degree of grafting ranging from 280-509 wt %, displaying a linear correlation with density of initiator sites. The authors do note extensive grafting may ultimately fill or block mesopores, a phenomenon discussed previously regarding functionalization of mesoporous carbon. Deployment of the mesoporous copolymer sorbents in simulated seawater at environmental pH resulted in adsorption capacities as high as 80 mg g-1, surpassing that of four commercially available adsorbent materials (12-50 mg g-1) and that of nonwoven amidoxime-functionalized polyethylene fabric (0.75 mg g-1). Batch experiments involving 5 gallons of seawater were performed using the ATRP-grafted mesoporous polymer. A uptake behavior of the mesoporous polymer sorbent, 0.33 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent/day, was observed with a moderate capacity of 1.99 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent. This behavior is similar to that of an poly(amidoxime-co-MA) sorbent produced by ORNL (0.30 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent/day).\n\nAll three MOFs were investigated for the extraction of uranium from several aqueous solutions. Measurements were made at pH 2.5 and 5 in DI water, with maximum saturation capacities of 217 and 109 mg of uranium/g of ads obtained at pH 2.5 for 1 and 2, respectively. When the pH was elevated to 5, saturation capacities decreased to 152 and 104 mg of uranium/g of ads accordingly. No uptake was observed for 3 under any conditions. MOFs 1 and 2 were also tested in a seawater simulant containing various sodium salts, carbonate, and both Mg and Ca cations. For both materials, a reduced uptake was observed, with 188 and 32 mg of uranium/g of ads obtained at pH 2.5 for 1 and 2. Isotherms are displayed in . Subsequent DFT calculations suggested the uranium was bound cooperatively by two adjacent ligands through monodentate coordination with the phosphoryl oxygen. This DFT-proposed 2:1 ligand to metal ratio (L:M) was supported by investigation of the uranyl uptake, as experimental L:M of 2:1 and 2.3:1 were obtained for MOF 1 in DI water and seawater simulant, respectively.\n\nMOFs 4, 4-NH2, 4-ED, and 4-DETA were investigated for uranium sorption in DI water over the pH range of 3-6. Uptake was negligible for all materials at pH < 4, but rose dramatically up to pH 6, while kinetic studies performed at pH 5.5 revealed rapid saturation of all materials occurred in less than 1 h of contact time. Sorption isotherms, again at pH 5.5 in DI water, afforded saturation capacities of 20, 90, 200, and 350 mg of uranium/g of ads for 4, 4-NH2, 4-ED, and 4-DETA, respectively. These results are displayed in . The authors noted the trend in capacity was inversely correlated with coverage of the functional groups. Though correlation breaks down for 4, which was unfunctionalized, the implication is that sorption is related to the accessibility of the binding sites located in the center of the MOF, in conjunction with the enhanced Lewis basicity of an aliphatic amine (as on 4-ED and 4-DETA) as opposed to an aromatic amine (4-NH2). The flexibility of the binding moiety on the SBU-functionalized 4-ED and 4-DETA was also proposed to enhance uptake.\n\nSelectivity studies on a series of metals at pH 5.5 were also performed, with high K d values achieved for uranium (>6000 mL g-1) in contrast to relatively low values for competing ions (<100 mL g-1) when all are present at an 0.5 mM initial concentration (). While these results are interesting, the selection of metals contains six lanthanides which are not present in seawater at appreciable concentrations and three transition metals, none of which are known to strongly compete for uranyl-binding sites in previously reported adsorbents. Most conspicuously absent are V, Fe, and Cu from the list of competing metals.\n\nSimilar work was reported shortly thereafter by Zhang et al., again using MIL-101(Cr) and functionalizing at the metal SBU with ED. While much of this report duplicates previous work, the authors do perform sorption experiments up to pH 9, where a dramatic decrease in uptake is observed (). The pH of the sorption solution was adjusted with small amounts of HNO3 or Na2CO3, which suggests that at higher pH there would be an appreciable effect from formation of [UO2(CO3)3]4-. A capacity of approximately 200 mg of uranium/g of ads was obtained for 4-ED at pH 5, essentially identical to previously reported data. The capacity at pH 8 decreased to approximately 150 mg of uranium/g of ads, while at pH 9 the capacity was around 80 mg of uranium/g of ads. Interestingly, negative uptake was reported at pH 2.\n\nRapid absorption uptake was observed in a kinetics investigation, with complete uptake achieved in less than 1 min. However, this experimental setup does not provide meaningful information, as the experiment was performed at a concentration where the adsorbent was not saturated. Similar kinetics would be observed for most materials where absorption kinetics are performed below saturation concentrations. Moreover, the instantaneous completion of adsorption casts doubt on the analytical rigor. The only data point which was not 90 \u00b1 5 mg of uranium/g of ads was the data point at t = 0. Moreover, adsorbents were collected by centrifugation for 10 min, which makes the measurements at t < 10 questionable. Subsequent adsorption isotherms reveal a saturation capacity of 126 mg of uranium/g of ads at pH 2 in DI water, despite only having a contact time of 5 min. These results do support rapid uranyl sorption.\n\nThe first use of an unfunctionalized MOF for uranium extraction was reported by Wang et al., utilizing the iconic Cu MOF HKUST-1 (6). The effect of pH was evaluated over the range of 2-10 in DI water, with capacities of 200 mg of uranium/g of ads achieved until pH 8 (). At pH 10, the adsorption decreased to approximately 140 mg of uranium/g of ads, attributed to formation of [UO2(CO3)2]2- and [UO2(CO3)3]4- from solvation of atmospheric CO2. Adsorption isotherms were performed at pH 6 at 25, 35, and 45 \u00b0C, which yielded saturation capacities of 787, 826, and 840 mg of uranium/g of ads when fitted with the Langmuir model. As the Langmuir model assumes monolayer coverage and isolated adsorption sites, the authors assert such an adsorption process must occur. The authors suggest the large number of carboxyl groups coordinating the Cu SBUs provide the uranyl adsorption sites. The SBU adopts a paddle-wheel structure, as is commonplace for Cu MOFs, where four carboxylates and two water molecules coordinate two Cu atoms. Consideration of the solvent-free formula for 6, Cu3(BTC)2, affords a molar ratio of 1.34-1.42 uranium per SBU at saturation.\n\nSorption kinetics were observed at a phase ratio of 0.4 g L-1 and a pH of 3 (). Saturation was observed at approximately 300 min when all of the uranium was extracted from solution. The authors rationalize from the changes in the rate of uptake that the rate of bulk diffusion, surface adsorption, and intraparticle diffusion all contribute to the observed uranium adsorption rate. The adsorption was also obtained for 7 at pH 3 with a phase ratio of 0.4 g L-1 and a contact time of 5 h. A saturation capacity of 298 mg of uranium/g of ads was obtained by fitting the data with the Langmuir model. Finally, extracting from a solution with competing ions assessed the selectivity of 7 for uranium. While still not containing the most environmentally relevant metals (V, Fe, and Cu), selectivity over other metals with appreciable seawater concentration was observed (e.g., Pb, Zn, Sr, and Ni).\n\nSynthesis of the isostructural MOF 8 was achieved using Tb to form the SBUs. While uranium adsorption data were not provided, quenching of the suspension luminescence was observed upon introduction of uranyl cations. At a concentration of 0.002 M, luminescence intensity was reduced by 50% and almost eliminated completely at 0.1 M. The authors note this characteristic allows the MOF to be used as a sensor for detecting uranium in aqueous waste; however, limits of detection were not determined. Moreover, the lowest concentration solution for which luminescence quenching was reported is equivalent to 0.5 mg of uranium/mL of solution. As 8 was added at 3 mg mL-1 to perform the luminescence experiments, significant improvements in sensitivity are needed for this MOF-based sensor to be a viable technology.", "data": ["(SyntaxError('invalid syntax', ('<unknown>', 10, 1, '[{\"meta\":{\"name\":\"MOF-B\", \"symbol\":\"\", \"chemical formula\":\"\"}, \"etc\": [\\n')), '[{\"meta\":{\"name\":\"MOF-A\", \"symbol\":\"\", \"chemical formula\":\"\"}, \"etc\": [\\n    {\\n        \"property name\": \"dielectric constant\",\\n        \"value\": \"4.5\",\\n        \"unit\": \"\",\\n        \"condition\": \"at 1 kHz\"\\n    }\\n]}]\\n\\n[{\"meta\":{\"name\":\"MOF-B\", \"symbol\":\"\", \"chemical formula\":\"\"}, \"etc\": [\\n    {\\n        \"property name\": \"electrical conductivity\",\\n        \"value\": \"0.01\",\\n        \"unit\": \"S/cm\",\\n        \"condition\": \"at room temperature\"\\n    }\\n]}]\\n\\n[{\"meta\":{\"name\":\"NOTT-202\", \"symbol\":\"\", \"chemical formula\":\"\"}, \"etc\": [\\n    {\\n        \"property name\": \"electrical resistance\",\\n        \"value\": \"10000000\",\\n        \"unit\": \"ohm\u00b7cm\",\\n        \"condition\": \"\"\\n    }\\n]}]')"], "include_properties": ["etc"]}, {"idx": "297, 305, 316, 318, 321, 325, 327, 331, 332, 335, 341", "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<p>The most recent effort in\nthis field was reported by Yuan et al.,\nwho used UiO-66 (<bold>9</bold>) and the amine-modified UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub> (<bold>10</bold>) to extract uranium from aqueous solutions.

A graphical depiction\nof this system is provided in . Extrapolating their 2 h adsorption data to a continuous\nprocess, the authors calculate as much as 75 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent\ncould be achieved over a 60 d deployment, compared to 4 mg of uranium/g\nof adsorbent for traditional polymer materials.</p><p>From these promising initial results, a super uranyl-binding\nprotein\n(SUP) was designed by genetic modification of <italic>Methanobacterium\nthermoautotrophicum</italic>.

Following polymerization, treatment with hydroxylamine converts the nitriles of the grafted polymer (PPN-6-PAN) to amidoximes (PPN-6-PAO). After base conditioning with 3% KOH aqueous solution at room temperature, PPN-6-PAO was tested for uranium uptake in seawater spiked to 80 ppb with uranium. PPN-6-PAO demonstrated a uranium uptake of 96 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent after 42 d of contact ().\n\nMa and co-workers also very recently reported a functionalized porous organic polymer for the recovery of uranium from seawater, based on the PPN-6 structure. In contrast to previous work where poly(amidoxime) is grown from halide initiators in the POP, amidoxime groups decorated the channels of the porous support directly, providing site accessibility and rapid transport of uranium to the binding sites (). An isotherm collected in aqueous uranium solutions revealed a saturation capacity of 304 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent, while kinetic experiments demonstrated >95% equilibration after a mere 3 h contact. The material could be eluted with Na2CO3, affording negligible decrease in performance over two recycles. A K d of approximately 1 \u00d7 106 mL g-1 suggested very high affinity for uranium, which was supported by investigations in seawater simulant. When deployed in a brine solution containing 25.6 g L-1 NaCl and 0.198 g L-1 NaHCO3 with 7 ppm uranium, a capacity of 40 mg of uranium g-1 was obtained. Subsequent EXAFS analysis supported binding of uranium by an average of 1.4 \u00b1 0.3 amidoxime functionalities in an \u03b72-motif, suggesting cooperativity between adjacent amidoxime species may contribute to the observed performance.\n\nFryxell and colleagues reported the first use of MS materials for extraction of actinides with self-assembled monolayers on mesoporous supports (SAMMS). The materials possessed a surface area of approximately 1000 m2 g-1 had high binding site density and a rigid open pore structure to facilitate diffusion through the MS channels. SAMMS were functionalized with glycinyl-urea, salicylamide, and acetamide-phosphonate and then investigated for sorption of actinides at acidic pH. Impressive sorption was observed using the glycinyl-urea-functionalized SAMMS, with maximum K d of 2.4 \u00d7 105, 1.6 \u00d7 105, and 9.1 \u00d7 104 mL g-1 for Am(III), U(VI), and Th(IV), respectively. As importantly, equilibrium was reached in 1-2 h, indicating rapid dissociation through the material and fast binding. \n\nThough in principle the same type of heterogeneous support was used in all of the aforementioned studies, the differences in surface areas and pore structure between different MS materials is significant. Moreover, as different pH ranges, contact times, phase ratios, degrees of grafting, and uranyl concentrations were used, direct comparisons are challenging if not impossible. In an effort to mitigate this difficulty, Vivero-Escoto et al. synthesized a library of organo-functionalized MS materials on the commercially available silica MSU-H (). Following identical grafting and pretreatment conditions, they performed the first direct comparison of more than nine different functionalities including amidoxime, bis-amidoxime, cyclic imide dioxime, carboxylic acid, phosphate diester, phosphonate, phosphoric acid, and bis-phosphoric acid. When sorption was performed in deionized water, the unfunctionalized MSU-H outperformed all but one sorbent, indicating that nonspecific binding to the MS support is significant. This result raises concern about other MS investigations for uranium extraction, as no indication of sorption by an unfunctionalized support had previously been published, suggesting background sorption by silanol functionalities had not been considered. When sorption was performed in seawater simulant, background sorption dramatically decreased, and a phosphoric acid attached to the MS support through a urea bridge was observed to have the highest saturation capacity of around 60 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent. The cyclic imide dioxime- functionalized material extracted approximately 47 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent, while the amidoxime-functionalized material extracted approximately 25 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent. \n\nAn interesting hybrid material was reported, formed from amidoxime-functionalized magnetic mesoporous silica (MMS-AO), synthesized through co-condensation of tetraethyl orthosilicate and 2-cyanoethyltriethoxysilane on the surface of silica-coated Fe3O4. Following transformation of the nitrile to amidoxime, a saturation capacity of 277 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was obtained for the material at pH 5, facilitated by rapid magnetic separation. Performance was observed to be strongly pH dependent, though a respectable uptake of 83 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was achieved at pH 8 following 24 h contact. \n\nVery recently, a series of organo-functionalized silicas were surface grafted with various (di)-phosphonic acids, imino diacetic acid, and HOPO and then investigated for the recovery of uranium from environmental seawater (). Adsorption isotherms reveal saturation capacities of the phosphate functionalized silica adsorbents outperform all commercial adsorbents and activated carbon, with PropPhos- and HOPO-functionalized silica achieving capacities of approximately 60 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent, while Diphos-functionalized silica saturated at 128 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent. K d values determined for Diphos-, PropPhos-, and HOPO-grafted materials were in excess of 3.5 \u00d7 106 mL g-1, while AcPhos- and IDAA- functionalized silica afforded values of 3.3 \u00d7 106 and 1.7 \u00d7 106 mL g-1, respectively.\n\nDiphos-, HOPO-, and PropPhos-functionalized silica were processed into a thin film membrane, composed of 50 wt % adsorbent and 50 wt % Nafion polymeric binder. A DiPhos-functionalized silica membrane adsorbent reached equilibrium in 24 h of contact with seawater spiked to 34 ppb in uranium and at pH 7.5; 1.1 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent were recovered. Similar results were claimed for HOPO and PropPhos materials as well. When contacted with 200 mL of unspiked seawater, 0.104 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent was extracted over 2 h contact time. Based on their reported Na2CO3 elution data, which show complete elution of uranium, and recycling experiments, which show no statistically significant decrease in uranium uptake over four runs for both Diphos- and PropPhos-functionalized materials following an acid regeneration step, dramatic advantages over traditional polymeric adsorbents are asserted. The authors propose a continuous-deployment system where the membrane-supported silica adsorbents are immersed in seawater, eluted with Na2CO3, pre-conditioned with acid, and then reimmersed in seawater. A graphical depiction of this system is provided in . Extrapolating their 2 h adsorption data to a continuous process, the authors calculate as much as 75 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent could be achieved over a 60 d deployment, compared to 4 mg of uranium/g of adsorbent for traditional polymer materials.\n\nFrom these promising initial results, a super uranyl-binding protein (SUP) was designed by genetic modification of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum. While the wild-type protein had a modest distribution coefficient, strategic mutations resulted in nearly a 6 order of magnitude increase in affinity and a distribution coefficient of 7.4 \u00d7 10-15 M (est. 6.7 \u00d7 10-11 mL g-1) at pH 8.9. The super uranyl-binding protein could be fixed sulfhydryl resin and displayed impressive selectivity for uranyl over other competing ions present in seawater, even when added at more than 106\u00d7 excess. Cu2+ and VO2+ were the only ions for which the protein had comparable affinity, but the authors note even in light of their greater concentration in seawater they would not be capable of competing with uranyl binding. Indeed, 17%, 30%, and 90% of uranyl was extracted from simulated seawater when contacted for 30 min with 1, 10, and >6000 equiv of protein. This remarkable affinity and rapid sorption reveals genetically engineered proteins could offer a viable means for extracting uranium from seawater. However, there are significant challenges to the viable deployment of engineered proteins such as cost, deployment motif, and selectivity toward uranium, specifically related to vanadium and copper.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "UiO-66", "symbol": "9", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "uranium extraction", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "aqueous solutions"}, {"property name": "sorption", "value": "110", "unit": "mg of uranium/g of ads", "condition": "pH 5.5"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "amine-modified UiO-66-NH2", "symbol": "10", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "uranium extraction", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "aqueous solutions"}, {"property name": "sorption", "value": "115", "unit": "mg of uranium/g of ads", "condition": "pH 5.5"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "COF SCU1", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "uranium extraction", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "seawater"}, {"property name": "sorption", "value": "50", "unit": "mg of uranium/g of adsorbent", "condition": "pH 2.5"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "poly\u00ad(amidoxime)", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "uranium extraction", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "seawater"}, {"property name": "sorption", "value": "80", "unit": "mg of uranium/g of adsorbent", "condition": "spiked uranyl brine"}, {"property name": "sorption", "value": "1.99", "unit": "mg of uranium/g of adsorbent", "condition": "actual seawater"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "PPN-6-PAO", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "uranium extraction", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "seawater"}, {"property name": "sorption", "value": "96", "unit": "mg of uranium/g of adsorbent", "condition": "seawater spiked with uranium"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "PPN-6", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "uranium extraction", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "seawater"}, {"property name": "sorption", "value": "304", "unit": "mg of uranium/g of adsorbent", "condition": "aqueous uranium solutions"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "SAMMS", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "actinide extraction", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "acidic pH"}, {"property name": "sorption", "value": "2.4 \u00d7 10^5", "unit": "Kd", "condition": "Am\u00ad(III)"}, {"property name": "sorption", "value": "1.6 \u00d7 10^5", "unit": "Kd", "condition": "U\u00ad(VI)"}, {"property name": "sorption", "value": "9.1 \u00d7 10^4", "unit": "Kd", "condition": "Th\u00ad(IV)"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "MSU-H", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "uranium extraction", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "deionized water"}, {"property name": "sorption", "value": "60", "unit": "mg of uranium/g of adsorbent", "condition": "phosphate functionalized silica adsorbents"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "MMS-AO", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "uranium extraction", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "pH 5"}, {"property name": "sorption", "value": "277", "unit": "mg of uranium/g of adsorbent", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "sorption", "value": "83", "unit": "mg of uranium/g of adsorbent", "condition": "pH 8"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "organo-functionalized silicas", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "uranium extraction", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "environmental seawater"}, {"property name": "sorption", "value": "128", "unit": "mg of uranium/g of adsorbent", "condition": "Diphos-functionalized silica"}, {"property name": "sorption", "value": "60", "unit": "mg of uranium/g of adsorbent", "condition": "phosphate functionalized silica adsorbents"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "super uranyl-binding protein", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "uranium extraction", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "seawater"}, {"property name": "sorption", "value": "7.4 \u00d7 10^-15", "unit": "M", "condition": "pH 8.9"}]}]], "include_properties": ["etc"]}, {"idx": 342, "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<p>In an effort to address some\nof these potential challenges, very\nrecent work articulates the integration of the SUP into a hydrogel\nthrough thiol-maleimide click chemistry ().

The desired coordination features are identified (step 1), the protein database is surveyed and a protein selected for further study (step 2), possible mutations for the protein are considered (step 3), potential uranyl binding sites are searched (step 4), and uranyl coordination geometries for the selective potential binding sites are evaluated and scored (step 5). If no hits are identified, the computational algorithm returns to step 2. Figure reprinted with permission from ref . Copyright 2014, Nature Publishing Group.
