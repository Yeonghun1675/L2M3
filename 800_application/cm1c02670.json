Both the magnetic ordering temperature and conductivity of this material can be readily modified through post-synthetic reduction. Further, the large number of electrochemically accessible redox states suggests that the magnetic and electronic properties of monolayers of 1 could be easily tuned in an electrically gated device. Importantly, while the spin carriers of 1 are isotropic S = 5/2 FeIII metal centers and S = 1/2 L3-\u22c5 linkers, magnetic measurements on nonoriented powders reveal a large coercive field of H c = 2630 Oe at 1.8 K, suggesting the presence of magnetic anisotropy. \n\nMo\u0308ssbauer and Raman spectroscopies were used to confirm that the metal-organic layers of 2 possess a similar electronic structure to those in 1. Mo\u0308ssbauer spectroscopy confirms the presence of a high-spin FeIII center with a similar isomer shift (\u03b4 = 0.574(1) mm/s) and quadrupole splitting (\u0394E Q = 1.125(5) mm/s) as in 1 (Figure S4), and Raman spectroscopy indicates partial ligand reduction and electron delocalization (Figure S5). Together, these results suggest an in situ metal-to-ligand electron transfer during framework formation and a formal approximate composition of [Fe2 III(L2-)(L3-\u22c5)2]2-. This formulation is further supported by the observation of an intervalence charge-transfer band in the near-infrared diffuse reflectance spectrum and a room-temperature electronic conductivity comparable to that of 1 (Figures S6 and S7). As in 1, the presence of linkers with substantial radical character in 2 results in a strong direct exchange between FeIII centers and ligand-based spins, leading to long-range ferrimagnetic order below 34 K (). A small frequency dependence in the ac susceptibility indicates the presence of some glassy dynamics in 2, but the observation of magnetic saturation at high fields suggests that 2 is best described as a glassy ferrimagnet rather than a disordered spin glass (Figures S8-S13; see the Supporting Information for an extended discussion of the magnetic properties of nonoriented samples of 2). While the ordering temperature of 2 is lower than that of 1, potentially due to the larger interlayer spacing or slight differences in the degree of linker reduction (see extended discussion in the Supporting Information), their coercive fields at 1.8 K are nevertheless similar (2630 and 3013 Oe for 1 and 2, respectively) (, inset). Magnetic coercivity cannot be directly correlated to magnetic anisotropy, but the coercive fields observed here suggest the presence of substantial anisotropy in 1 and 2, despite containing only isotropic S = 5/2 FeIII- and S = 1/2 linker-based spin carriers. In contrast, a three-dimensional (3D) structural isomer exhibits a coercive field of only 100 Oe at 2 K, while the isostructural framework material Na3(NMe4)2[Mn2L3], which possesses similar S = 5/2 metal centers and S = 1/2 linkers, displays a coercive field of only 300 Oe at 1.8 K. Together, these results suggest that neither the metal-ligand covalency nor the layered structure of 1 and 2 can alone explain the coercivities of the materials, although the combination of these factors may give rise to magnetocrystalline anisotropy.\n\nVariable-field dc magnetization data collected at 1.8 K reveal distinct magnetic behavior for different substrate orientations (a). When the field is applied parallel to the c axis, perpendicular to the 2D layers (H||c), M z gradually increases with field up to 0.8 T, at which point a rapid increase is observed, reaching the saturation magnetization near 1.2 T. The rapid increase in magnetization occurs at H c (see the discussion of hysteresis below), suggesting that the small magnetization observed at lower fields corresponds to an even distribution of crystals with magnetizations aligned parallel and antiparallel to the applied field. Here, applied magnetic field strengths below H c are too weak to overcome the magnetic anisotropy energy. When the field strength reaches H c, the antiparallel magnetizations flip and the overall magnetization becomes saturated. In contrast, when the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the c axis, parallel to the 2D layers (H\u22a5c), M z gradually increases with field up to ~5 T, at which point saturation behavior is observed. A small kink in the magnetization at 0.8 T most likely corresponds to a small number of crystals with their c axis parallel to the substrate. These results indicate a clear magnetocrystalline anisotropy in 2, with an easy axis of magnetization aligned with the c axis and a hard plane aligned with the ab plane.\n\nThe presence of an easy axis is further demonstrated by magnetic hysteresis data collected at 1.8 K (b). For H||c, the hysteresis loop displays a rectangular shape, with H c = 8845 Oe at a sweep rate of 1.98 Oe/s. This shape profile indicates that the magnetic domains remain aligned along the easy axis and reverse abruptly at the coercive field (b and S17). In contrast, for H\u22a5c, the hysteresis loop displays a spindle shape, with H c = 8042 Oe with a sweep rate of 1.88 Oe/s. Unlike the rapid switching of the magnetization observed with H||c, the gradual increase and decrease in the magnetization for H\u22a5c indicate a gradual reversal of the magnetic domains with changing field. The differences between the two hysteresis loops can be quantified using the squareness ratio, which is the ratio of the remnant magnetization (M r) to the saturation magnetization (M s). The squareness ratios M r/M s for H||c and H\u22a5c are 0.86 and 0.20, respectively, which indicate that the magnetization at zero field is better preserved when the magnetic field is parallel to the c axis. Films of the commercial permanent magnet SmCo5 with large magnetic anisotropy display similar differences in the squareness ratio for hysteresis loops measured along the easy axis (0.96) and hard plane (0.15). As such, the observed differences for 2 further support the presence of an easy axis of magnetization aligned along the c axis.", "data": ["(SyntaxError('invalid syntax', ('<unknown>', 10, 1, '[{\"meta\":{\"name\":\"MOF-B\", \"symbol\":\"\", \"chemical formula\":\"\"}, \"etc\": [\\n')), '[{\"meta\":{\"name\":\"MOF-A\", \"symbol\":\"\", \"chemical formula\":\"\"}, \"etc\": [\\n    {\\n        \"property name\": \"dielectric constant\",\\n        \"value\": \"4.5\",\\n        \"unit\": \"\",\\n        \"condition\": \"at 1 kHz\"\\n    }\\n]}]\\n\\n[{\"meta\":{\"name\":\"MOF-B\", \"symbol\":\"\", \"chemical formula\":\"\"}, \"etc\": [\\n    {\\n        \"property name\": \"electrical conductivity\",\\n        \"value\": \"0.01\",\\n        \"unit\": \"S/cm\",\\n        \"condition\": \"at room temperature\"\\n    }\\n]}]\\n\\n[{\"meta\":{\"name\":\"NOTT-202\", \"symbol\":\"\", \"chemical formula\":\"\"}, \"etc\": [\\n    {\\n        \"property name\": \"electrical resistance\",\\n        \"value\": \"10000000\",\\n        \"unit\": \"ohm\u00b7cm\",\\n        \"condition\": \"\"\\n    }\\n]}]')"], "include_properties": ["etc"]}, {"idx": "17, 22", "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<p>To quantify the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (<italic toggle=\"yes\">E</italic>\n<sub>a</sub>) of <bold>2</bold>, we determined the uniaxial\nanisotropy\nconstant <italic toggle=\"yes\">K</italic>\n<sub>u</sub> using the Stoner\u2013Wohlfarth\nmodel:<disp-formula id=\"eq1\">\n<label>1</label>\n<alternatives>\n<graphic orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cm1c02670_m001.gif\" xlink:type=\"simple\"></graphic>\n<mml:math display=\"block\">\n<mml:mfrac>\n<mml:mrow>\n<mml:mn>2</mml:mn>\n<mml:msub>\n<mml:mrow>\n<mml:mi>K</mml:mi>\n</mml:mrow>\n<mml:mrow>\n<mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">u</mml:mi>\n</mml:mrow>\n</mml:msub>\n</mml:mrow>\n<mml:mrow>\n<mml:msub>\n<mml:mrow>\n<mml:mi>M</mml:mi>\n</mml:mrow>\n<mml:mrow>\n<mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">s</mml:mi>\n</mml:mrow>\n</mml:msub>\n</mml:mrow>\n</mml:mfrac>\n<mml:mo>=</mml:mo>\n<mml:msub>\n<mml:mrow>\n<mml:mi>\u03bc</mml:mi>\n</mml:mrow>\n<mml:mrow>\n<mml:mn>0</mml:mn>\n</mml:mrow>\n</mml:msub>\n<mml:msub>\n<mml:mrow>\n<mml:mi>H</mml:mi>\n</mml:mrow>\n<mml:mrow>\n<mml:mi>sat</mml:mi>\n</mml:mrow>\n</mml:msub>\n</mml:math>\n</alternatives>\n</disp-formula>which assumes a fully magnetized,\nsingle-domain\nstate, where <italic toggle=\"yes\">M</italic>\n<sub>s</sub> is the saturation magnetization\nand <italic toggle=\"yes\">H</italic>\n<sub>sat</sub> is the magnetic field above which\nthe sample is fully magnetized.
