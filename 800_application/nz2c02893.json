A proof-of-concept example of this process incorporated thin layers of UiO-66(Zr) MOFs over Ag electrocatalyst surfaces for CO2 reduction. UiO-66-layered Ag electrodes showed an improved Faradaic efficiency for CO production (FECO = 79%) compared to the bare Ag electrode (FECO = 43%) at -0.8 V vs RHE, despite similarities in the electrochemically active surface area between the two electrodes. These results suggested that the MOF overlayer could enhance the CO2 reduction activity through three mechanistic routes: (i) enhancing CO2 reduction activities by increasing local CO2 concentrations via increased mass transfer through MOF pores, (ii) second coordination sphere hydrogen-bonding stabilization between MOF acid sites and adsorbed *COO- intermediates, and (iii) ion functionalization for controllable proton delivery. To decouple the effects of second coordination sphere acid site stabilization from the effects of mass transport, OH groups on Zr6O4(OH)4 node components were titrated using benzoic acid. This modified overlayer showed a decrease in FECO to ~60%, suggesting that, while limiting mass transport can improve the FECO of the MOF-overlayered Ag electrodes, the additional effect of proton stabilization for pendant OH groups on Lewis acid sites can further stabilize CO2 reduction intermediates. Further enhancements were achieved through the incorporation of 3-(carboxypropyl)trimethylammonium (TMA) into the MOF overlayer backbone, resulting in a semipermeable ion-selective membrane that showed an improved FECO (90%) compared to the non-functionalized MOF membrane at 79% and the bare Ag electrode at 49%. This utilization and systematic evaluation of UiO-66(Zr) as a model overlayer to enhance electrochemical CO2 reduction demonstrates the utility of MOFs as tandem materials that can indirectly enhance catalysis on catalytically active surfaces; however, the translational utility of this strategy will require a demonstration of electrocatalytic activity at partial current densities above ~-1.0 mA/cm2.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 26, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>\n\nThis discussion\nof defect-influenced electrocatalytic mechanisms on MOFs, ultimately\nto inform electrocatalyst design strategies, will principally focus\non utilizing the MOF itself as the active catalyst, stipulating that\nthe bulk structural crystallinity of the MOF remains intact under\nelectrochemical bias.</p>", "clean_text": "  This discussion of defect-influenced electrocatalytic mechanisms on MOFs, ultimately to inform electrocatalyst design strategies, will principally focus on utilizing the MOF itself as the active catalyst, stipulating that the bulk structural crystallinity of the MOF remains intact under electrochemical bias.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 27, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>As MOFs become more prevalent\nporous materials to integrate with\ngas-phase electrolyzer technologies, defect modifications to pristine\nMOF structures will become a crucial material design strategy.

For example, a recent report demonstrated the use of in situ spectroelectrochemical and electroanalytical techniques to interrogate the influence of defect sites within the Ni-MOF-74 structure on a model electrochemical hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). In situ Raman and attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) spectroelectrochemical techniques showed that defects in the Ni-MOF-74 structure were systematically incorporated by modulating the ratio of linkers containing the absence of free hydroxyl functionalities capable of binding to nearby Ni sites. Additionally, ex situ spectroscopic techniques were able to identify signals corresponding to the presence of highly electron dense NiO4 defect sites in XPS, while Raman spectroscopic measurements were able to further corroborate this by identifying shifts in the Ni-O bands. The defect-rich Ni-MOF-74 converted HMF to FDCA at a 95% yield with an 80% Faradaic efficiency. Moreover, the difference in the Tafel slopes for HMF oxidation between the defect-rich Ni-MOF-74 (160 mV/decade) and defect-free Ni-MOF-74 (300 mV/decade) reveals the influence of Ni coordination defects on the electrocatalytic activity of the defective material.

While this indicates that defective Ni-MOF-74 shows promise as a viable electrocatalyst for HMF oxidation to FDCA, additional investigations should focus toward maintaining a similar level of performance under larger, more industrially relevant current densities than those reported here (~1-20 mA/cm2).\n\nDefects can also be produced post-synthetically, as exemplified in a report that showed that photoirradiation of a bimetallic NiFe node MOF (with 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid ligands) can induce lattice strain and systematically increase the fringe lattice parameter from 1.16 nm in the pristine MOF to 1.18, 1.20, and 1.21 nm. The lattice-strained NiFe MOF demonstrated specific activities of 500 A/gmetal at a half-wave potential of 0.83 V for the ORR, which outperformed the benchmark Pt/C specific activity of 262 A/gmetal at 0.83 V. Similarly, the lattice-strained MOF demonstrated a 2000 A/gmetal at 0.30 V overpotential for the OER, which outperformed benchmark RuO2 OER catalysts by 2 orders of magnitude (~17 A/gmetal at 300 mV overpotential). Notably, the electrocatalytic OER and ORR experiments showed stable current densities of 200 mA/cm2 and -100 mA/cm2 with near unity Faradaic efficiencies for both reactions across an operational lifetime of 200 h. The corresponding benchmark materials (RuO2 for OER and Pt/C for ORR) both showed a 50% decrease in current density over the same operational lifetime, indicating that the strain-defect-containing MOFs exhibit both increased activity and stability over corresponding benchmark materials. The increase in electrocatalytic performance of the defect-strained MOFs was suggested to derive from the strain-induced Ni 3d-O 2p hybridization in the valence band, which promoted electron transfer from the N 3d band into the O 2p band and enabled favorable binding of oxo species to more electron-deficient Ni sites. Mechanistic insights using synchrotron radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed a band at ~1050 cm-1 that was observed for both ORR and OER applications, which the authors assigned to adsorbed superoxide *OOH intermediate present in both OER and ORR proposed mechanisms.\n\nWhile MOFs can be used and manipulated as electrocatalysts, similar tunings in electrocatalyst performance can be achieved by using a MOF as a non-catalytic layered component over a more traditional electrocatalyst. A proof-of-concept example of this process incorporated thin layers of UiO-66(Zr) MOFs over Ag electrocatalyst surfaces for CO2 reduction. UiO-66-layered Ag electrodes showed an improved Faradaic efficiency for CO production (FECO = 79%) compared to the bare Ag electrode (FECO = 43%) at -0.8 V vs RHE, despite similarities in the electrochemically active surface area between the two electrodes. These results suggested that the MOF overlayer could enhance the CO2 reduction activity through three mechanistic routes: (i) enhancing CO2 reduction activities by increasing local CO2 concentrations via increased mass transfer through MOF pores, (ii) second coordination sphere hydrogen-bonding stabilization between MOF acid sites and adsorbed *COO- intermediates, and (iii) ion functionalization for controllable proton delivery. To decouple the effects of second coordination sphere acid site stabilization from the effects of mass transport, OH groups on Zr6O4(OH)4 node components were titrated using benzoic acid. This modified overlayer showed a decrease in FECO to ~60%, suggesting that, while limiting mass transport can improve the FECO of the MOF-overlayered Ag electrodes, the additional effect of proton stabilization for pendant OH groups on Lewis acid sites can further stabilize CO2 reduction intermediates. Further enhancements were achieved through the incorporation of 3-(carboxypropyl)trimethylammonium (TMA) into the MOF overlayer backbone, resulting in a semipermeable ion-selective membrane that showed an improved FECO (90%) compared to the non-functionalized MOF membrane at 79% and the bare Ag electrode at 49%. This utilization and systematic evaluation of UiO-66(Zr) as a model overlayer to enhance electrochemical CO2 reduction demonstrates the utility of MOFs as tandem materials that can indirectly enhance
