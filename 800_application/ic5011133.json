The procedure of hot filtration was same as what we reported previously. \n\nResults and Discussion\n\nSynthesis\n\nBecause surfactants are very powerful to direct the growth of inorganic or organic materials at the nano/microscale, it is reasonable to employ surfactants to control the crystal growth at the macroscale. Surfactants have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups, which not only enhance the solubility of inorganic salts and organic linkers but also efficiently direct crystal growth through strong interaction between the crystal faces and surfactants. It is worth noting that the final products under surfactant-thermal synthesis are normally unpredictable because this type of synthesis is a relatively complex process. In addition, the ratio of starting compounds also plays an important role in control of the formation of new materials and their crystal growth. For example, the reaction mixtures with Co2+: H3BTC = 2:1 can produce NTU-Z30, while Co2+:H3BTC = 1:1 gives NTU-Z32. In fact, our experimental conditions reported here are optimized, and the other conditions that we have tried have been summarized and provided in Table S1 (). It clearly indicates that, without surfactants, no MOF crystals or a small amount of poor MOF crystals are available. In addition, PXRD has been employed to confirm the phase purities of all as-prepared crystals (Figure S2, ). Note that because the channels of MOFs reported here have been occupied by organic cations and removing these cations will cause the collapse of MOFs, it might not be necessary to measure the pores' sizes.

In this new trimeric SBU, two Co2+ centers (Co2 and Co3) display a trigonal-bipyramidal configuration and coordinate with one \u03bc3-OH (Co-O 1.9723-2.1390 \u00c5, Co3-\u03bc3-OH 2.0526 \u00c5, and Co2-\u03bc3-OH 2.0768 \u00c5) and four different O species from different COO units, while the third Co2+ center (Co1) is four-connected with one \u03bc3-OH (Co-O 1.9633-1.9957 \u00c5) and three different O atoms from different COO units.

The two SBUs are further linked together through BTC units to form three-dimensional structures with an intercrossed channel along the a and b axes (Figure f,g). Protonated HTEA+ and guest H3O+ cations act as charge-balance species and fill up the empty space in the channels. TGA (Figure S3, ) for NTU-Z30 reveals that the weight loss (22.85%) in the first stage between 80 and 375 \u00b0C is attributed to the loss of TEA and H2O (calcd 23.30%), and the weight loss of 64.35% in the second stage between 375 and 600 \u00b0C can be explained by the loss of BTC linkers (calcd 63.74%). The final residue of 12.80% is close to the calculated amount of CoO (12.96%; Figure S3, ).\n\nStructure Description of NTU-Z31 \n\nAs shown in Figure a, a three-dimensional structure of NTU-Z31 is made from dimeric cobalt carboxylate clusters and BTC linkers. In Co2(COO)6 clusters, one Co atom has an inversion center symmetry to the other. Each Co center has a distorted tetrahedral geometry (Co-O 1.9488-2.0048 \u00c5) and coordinates with four O atoms from four different but symmetrically equivalent BTC ligands through a bridging \u03bc2-\u03b71:\u03b71 mode and two monodentate \u03b71 modes (Figure b), resulting in a three-dimensional network (Figure c). As shown in Figure d, the framework of NTU-Z31 can be viewed as a decorated rutile net, where each BTC ligand links to three different SBUs and each SBU connects to six BTC ligands. The guest H2O and guest HTEA+ occupy the vacancies made by asymmetric units and have strong interaction with the network via hydrogen bonds.

The final residue of 17.57% is close to the calculated amount of CoO (17.39%; see Figure S3, ).\n\nStructure Description of NTU-Z32 \n\nThe three-dimensional framework of NTU-Z32 is constructed by BTC ligands and trinuclear [Co3(COO)8]2- SBUs. As shown in Figure a, the linear Co3 SBU consists of three crystallographically independent Co centers (Co1, Co2, and Co3). The central Co atom (Co2) has an octahedral configuration with all bridging -COO species from six different BTC ligands, while the terminal centers Co1 and Co3 adopt a four-coordinated distorted tetrahedron, which is completed by bridging four -COO groups from three different BTC ligands. The lengths of the Co-O bonds are in the range of 1.9452-2.1642 \u00c5. The Co1-Co2-Co3 angle is ca. 144.556\u00b0 (30), and the distances between metal centers are about 3.3969(11) \u00c5. In addition, two independent BTC linkers are observed in NTU-Z32: one BTC is linked to Co centers via -COO groups through \u03bc2-\u03b72 mode, \u03bc2-\u03b71:\u03b71 mode, and monodentate \u03b71 mode (Figure b), and the second one has \u03bc2-\u03b71:\u03b71 mode and \u03b71 mode (Figure b). The framework of NTU-Z32 has channels with a diameter of ~12.56 \u00c5 along the b axis, where HTEA+ cations were filled for charge balance (Figure c). In NTU-Z32, each Co3 SBU connects with eight BTC ligands, and every BTC ligand links two or three Co3 SBUs, leading to the formation of a three-dimensional framework (Figure d). Noting that NTU-Z32 is an analogue of Ni3(NMe4)(BTC)3(DMF)2 except the coordination environments of metal atoms. TGA for NTU-Z32 (Figures S3, ) shows that the weight loss (20.05%) in the first stage (150-300 \u00b0C) belongs to the evaporation of guest TEA (calcd 20.28%), and the weight loss (59.58%) in the second stage (300-600 \u00b0C) comes from the loss of coordination BTC ligands (calcd 57.06%). The final residue of 21.37% is close to the calculated amount of CoO (22.66%; Figure S3, ).\n\nMagnetic Properties\n\nThe magnetic properties of NTU-Z30 (a), NTU-Z31 (b), and NTU-Z32 (c) have been examined for possible applications as molecular magnets. The magnetic susceptibilities (\u03c7M) of all samples were tested from 300 to 2 K under 100 Oe (Figure ), and \u03c7M of all materials follows the Curie-Weiss law in the testing temperature range. The calculated Curie (C) and Weiss (\u03b8) constants for NTU-Z30, NTU-Z31, and NTU-Z32 are 3.10 cm3 K mol-1 and -33.50 K, 2.92 cm3 K mol-1 and -24.51 K, and 2.34 cm3 K mol-1 and -33.10 K, respectively. These results suggest that the neighboring Co cations in all three MOFs have weak antiferromagnetic interactions.\n\nAlthough they could show some certain catalytic activities, NTU-Z31 and NTU-Z32 are unstable in DMF and are screened out for catalytic examination. The stable NTU-Z30 is the main object to be examined on the catalytic activity in the aerobic epoxidation as below. Figure  displays the relationship between the time and epoxidation ratio of trans-stilbene, where the conversion (98.2%) and selectivity (95.6%) toward the epoxide can be observed after 7 h of reaction. The average turnover frequency (TOF) of 17.6 h-1 based on the cobalt mass was obtained for a reaction lasting for 6 h at 100 \u00b0C with an O2 flow rate of 30 mL min-1. Elevating the reaction temperature or O2 flow rate could further improve the average TOFs (TOF = 20.5 h-1 when the reaction temperature is 120 \u00b0C). The catalytic activity of NTU-Z30 has been compared with the reported representative catalysts for the same reaction, and the results are summarized in Table . For transformation from trans-stilbene to its corresponding epoxide, NTU-Z30 shows high epoxide selectivity, excellent conversion ratio, and high TOF value, surpassing most of the reported MOF-based heterogeneous catalysts for the same reaction, and even rivals some traditional catalysts. Note that most reports involving MOF-based catalysts have to involve either cocatalyst or peroxides because of their poor catalytic behaviors.

The recycle experiments of NTU-Z30 were performed, and the results are summarized in Figure . Surprisingly, after the first run, the recycled NTU-Z30 showed an even greater catalytic activity. In the second run, the conversion and selectivity of trans-stilbene toward epoxide reaches 92.5% and 99.3%, respectively. After the third run, the conversion got increased to 97.4% and the selectivity is 98.6%. According to the calculation from Diamond software, the larger pore size of NTU-Z30 is 12 \u00d7 10 \u00c5 along the a axis; hence, the molecule as large as trans-stilbene is unable to enter the pore and contact with the active cobalt sites inside. Here we attribute the active cobalt sites to the cobalt sites on the outer surface of NTU-Z30. Therefore, the improved catalytic activity in the recycle test infers that NTU-Z30 turns to fragments to some extent and then a larger surface area is exposed or rather the number of active sites increases, which leads to the improved catalytic activity. The catalyst stability was further examined by PXRD and FTIR spectra. The PXRD (Figure S5, ) study of both pristine and spent NTU-Z30 shows no phase change, while no obvious peak shifts in the FTIR spectra (Figure S6, ) further confirm the stability of NTU-Z30, which is in agreement with the result of recycle usage.
