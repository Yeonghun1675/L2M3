Lactate (LA), glucose (Glu), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are inflammation-related molecules; ascorbic acid (AA), glutathione (GSH), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are critical in neuroprotection and neuromodulation; and dopamine (DA) is a typical neurotransmitter. The response of each sensor toward 100 \u03bcM molecules is first studied in Figures S1 and a, in which I 0 and I represent the fluorescence intensity at 616 nm of the sensor before and after the reaction with molecules, respectively. The potential mechanism of the molecule-induced optical change is examined, and the results are shown in Figure S2. The luminescence change of EM2 is not obvious, mainly because Cu2+ in HKUST-1 can quench the lanthanide luminescence. There is no overlap for the absorption of molecules with the corresponding wavelengths (Figure S2a) with the excitation/emission wavelength of 300:616 nm; thus, no inner filter effect occurs between molecules and the three EMs. After the reaction with H2O2, the crystal structure of EM1 is disrupted (Figure S2b), which may lead to the luminescence quenching of EM1, while the crystal structure of EM3 is stable (Figure S2c). It can be seen from Figures S2d-f that the lifetime of Eu3+ emission in EM1 and EM3 decrease in the presence of DA, indicating nonradiative energy transfer from the Eu3+ ion to the DA molecule. In addition, 100 \u03bcM DA was separately reacted with three EMs, then the mixtures were centrifugated, and the UV-vis absorption spectra of the supernatant were measured. The result in Figure S2g reveals that an abundance of DA can coordinate with EM1, which may also contribute to the highest response of EM1. The lifetime of three EMs after reacting with GSH, LA, Glu, and AA, respectively, is detected. As shown in Figures S2h-k, the four molecules can all prolong the lifetime of lanthanide luminescence more or less, implying an enhanced antenna effect toward Eu3+-doped MOFs. The different levels of emission enhancement are also estimated to have resulted from the various surface areas and charges of three EMs. The H2S can react with Cu2+ in EM2 to induce the structural collapse of EM2 (Figure S2l), which disrupts the quenching by Cu2+ and increases luminescence of EM2.
