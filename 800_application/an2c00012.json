Compared to previously simulated and measured MOF-CVD ZIF-8 diffractograms, the [200] diffraction is enhanced w.r.t. to the [110] and [211] diffractions, particularly for the 18 h sample, which might be attributed to a slightly preferential [100] orientation. Also, the [110]/[211] diffraction intensity ratio is <1 for the 18 h sample, whereas for the 15 h sample, it is >1. Upon activation, the [110] diffraction intensity is expected to increase in intensity due to desorption of unreacted linkers from the pores (see Figure S3a).

A second ZnO film, underneath the AlOx layer and not converted to ZIF-8, is included as an optical spacer to demonstrate SPP \u03bbr tuning for samples with very thin ZIF-8 films. The samples are named \"Sx_y\", with x and y being the thicknesses of the ZnO precursor and optical spacer layers, respectively. An overview of the sample structures and MOF-CVD conversion times is given in .

As illustrated in Figure S8, 6 h of MOF-CVD redshifts the SPP peaks by 160 \u00b1 10 nm for each of these samples, which corresponds to the formation of 35-40 nm ZIF-8. AFM images of all samples are given in Figure S9a, and the RMS roughness increases with increasing ZIF-8 thickness, from <10 nm for the S4 samples to >40 nm for sample S12.

The magnitude of the sensor response to high MeOH concentrations is roughly the same in dry and humidified nitrogen. Exposure to 40% H2O increases the MOF refractive index by 0.00489 (from 1.35041 to 1.35530). Mixing 8000 ppm MeOH into the humidified N2 increases n by another 0.00425 (to 1.35955), while 8000 ppm MeOH into dry nitrogen does increase n by 0.00543 (from 1.34961 to 1.35504), i.e., by 0.00118 RIUs (26%) more than in humidified nitrogen. Nevertheless, the MeOH response drops more quickly at lower concentrations in humidified nitrogen compared to dry nitrogen and vanishes at a few tens of ppm (f). For the \u03a8 readout (at one wavelength each), the differences between the measurements in humidified and dry nitrogen are more pronounced (Figure S13a,c). As another example, we studied the LoD of toluene, which is a biomarker for lung cancer. As shown in Figure S14, the refractive index and \u03a8 responses to vapors in the 1-2 ppm range are 4 and 3 times stronger than for methanol, respectively. Furthermore, an LoD of about 90-100 ppb is observed, which is better than a previously reported plasmonic-based sensor with ZIF-8 (200 ppm) and on par with optical ring-oscillator sensing concepts (76 ppb). At 120 ppb toluene, the SPP/ZIF-8 sensor can still resolve a \u0394n step of 0.00003.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-CVD ZIF-8", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "peak spectrum": [{"value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["peak_spectrum"]}, {"idx": 21, "type": "table", "classification": ["Property"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Structure and SPP Properties of Samples\nS4\u2013S12<xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"t1fn1\"></xref>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"GRAPHIC-d7e998-autogenerated\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"an2c00012_0010.eps\" xlink:type=\"simple\"></graphic>\n<table-wrap-foot>\n<fn id=\"t1fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>Layer thickness, SPP \u03bb<sub>r</sub>, FWHM, and AFM RMS roughness values are given in nm.</p>\n</fn>\n</table-wrap-foot>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "Table 1.
