The architectural stability and permanent porosity of PCN-136 were confirmed by nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurement at 77 K with a reversible type-I isotherm feature (Figure S8a).

For comparison, the N2 sorption isotherm of pbz-MOF-1 was also performed at 77 K (Figure S9). The BET surface area and pore volume of pbz-MOF-1 are similar to those of PCN-136. As shown in Figure S10, carbon dioxide adsorption-desorption isotherms of PCN-136 at 273 K were measured. Carbon dioxide uptake was as high as 61.01 cm3 g-1 at saturation. This result suggests that the interactions between sp2-bonded carbon atoms from the hexabenzocoronene fragments and CO2 molecules may play an important role in the carbon dioxide uptake.

These results suggested that the electrons of PCN-136 can be more easily promoted to an excited state upon the visible-light irradiation when compared to free HCHC or pbz-MOF-1. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the possible difference in the optical bandgap in pbz-MOF-1 and PCN-136 that may have resulted from the \u03c0-conjugated organic fragments. As shown in Figure S13, the frontier molecular orbital distributions for organic linkers (HCBB and HCHC) in pbz-MOF-1 and PCN-136 are presented. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) in HCBB is mainly delocalized over the exterior biphenyl carboxylic acid fragments, while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is delocalized over both the central benzene ring and the exterior biphenyl carboxylic acid fragments. The HOMO in the HCHC ligands mostly delocalizes over the central \u03c0-conjugated hexabenzocoronene unit, while the LUMO is formally delocalized over both the central \u03c0-conjugated hexabenzocoronene unit and the terminal benzoic acid fragments. It can be clearly seen that more extended conjugation generally leads to a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap (4.26 eV for HCBB vs 3.32 eV for HCHC). This accordingly enhances the degree of charge transfer from the ground state to the excited state. The DFT calculations confirm that the MOFs containing larger \u03c0-conjugated fragments would be more efficient for the utilization of the solar spectrum with similar metal nodes and frameworks. In addition, the photocurrent profiles of PCN-136 and pbz-MOF-1 also indicated that PCN-136 is more active than pbz-MOF-1 under visible-light illumination (b). The replacement of the central phenyl core in pbz-MOF-1 with the hexabenzocoronene moiety in PCN-136 did not lead to a significant change in the structural feature, but the optical absorption ability was greatly tuned. It is postulated from this result that the presence of a flat hexabenzocoronene central core will improve the light harvesting of a desired MOF. With this in mind, the use of HCHC linkers can be shown to endow PCN-136 with light-harvesting capabilities in order to be utilized as a suitable platform for photocatalytic studies.\n\nThe Mott-Schottky measurements on PCN-136 and pbz-MOF-1 were performed at a frequency of 500, 1000, and 1500 Hz, in order to elucidate their semiconductor characters and the possibility for the subsequent CO2 photoreduction study. As shown in c and S14, the positive slope of the obtained C2- values (vs the applied potentials) is consistent with those of typical n-type semiconductors. The intersection points are independent of the frequency, and the flat-band position of PCN-136 is determined from the intersection to be ~-0.95 V vs Ag/AgCl (i.e., -0.75 V vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)). Generally, the bottom of the conduction band (LUMO) in n-type semiconductors can be determined to be approximately equal to the flat-band potential. According to this, the LUMO of PCN-136 is estimated to be -0.75 V vs NHE. The optical bandgap of PCN-136 was calculated to be 1.18 eV based on the UV-vis spectrum (Figure S15), and its valence band (HOMO) was estimated to be 0.43 V vs NHE (c).

The results suggest that PCN-136 is superior to pbz-MOF-1 for applications as an active photocatalytic material in the conversion of CO2 to HCOO- under visible-light irradiation. The presence of extended \u03c0-conjugated hexabenzocoronene-based linkers in PCN-136 not only improves the optical absorption of the materials but also largely increases the yield of the photocatalytic reaction. As a comparison, Ru(bpy)3Cl2 (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) was introduced into the pbz-MOF-1 (20 mg) system as the photosensitizer with an amount of 11.2 mg (15 \u03bcmol) under similar conditions (Figure S18). Under these conditions, the amount of HCOO- anion produced from pbz-MOF-1 increased from 3.53 \u03bcmol after 12 h to 11.11 \u03bcmol in 12 h, which is comparable to that of PCN-136. These results demonstrate that PCN-136 is very active and capable of selectively converting CO2 to HCOO- under visible-light irradiation. PCN-136 exhibits one of the highest performances of visible-light-driven CO2 photoreduction to formate among reported MOFs or crystalline photocatalysts. In addition, PCN-136 can be easily separated and recovered from the reaction media by centrifugation for continued use. The recycling performance of the material was further investigated to examine the stability of PCN-136. The results of the cycling performance suggested that no obvious change in the yield rate of HCOO- occurred during the four continuous runs (b). After the photocatalytic experiments, the PXRD pattern was analyzed demonstrating that the structure of PCN-136 was maintained after reaction cycling (Figure S5).", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "PCN-136", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "reversible type-I isotherm feature", "unit": "", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "61.01", "unit": "cm3/g", "temperature": "273 K", "pressure": "saturation", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "pbz-MOF-1", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "similar to those of PCN-136", "unit": "", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "HCHC", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": []}]], "include_properties": ["gas_adsorption"]}, {"idx": 6, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Schematic View of the Preparation for PCN-136</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr5\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ja-2018-11042p_0005.tif\" xlink:type=\"simple\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Schematic View of the Preparation for PCN-136   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 9, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Structural comparison\nbetween PCN-136 and pbz-MOF-1: (a\u2013c)\nthe structures of Zr<sub>6</sub> cluster, HCHC, and HCBB as six-connected\nnodes and (d, e) the 3D structures and (f) pbz-net.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ja-2018-11042p_0001.tif\" xlink:type=\"simple\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Structural comparison between PCN-136 and pbz-MOF-1: (a-c) the structures of Zr6 cluster, HCHC, and HCBB as six-connected nodes and (d, e) the 3D structures and (f) pbz-net.
