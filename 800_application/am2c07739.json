In this model, mice were first inoculated with 4T1 cells on the one side and then inoculated on the other side 3 days later (A). Inhibiting of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway is a common method of clinical immune checkpoint blocking therapy in recent years. Therefore, we used the antibody of PD-1 (aPD-1) to interrupt PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway in combination with 3D Cu@COF-TATB to enhance antitumor immunity in vivo. The tumor-bearing mice were randomly assigned into seven groups and intratumorally injected with (1) PBS; (2) PBS + laser; (3) 3D COF-TATB; (4) 3D Cu@COF-TATB; (5) 3D COF-TATB + laser; (6) 3D Cu@COF-TATB + laser; (7) 3D Cu@COF-TATB + laser + aPD-1, respectively. As illustrated in B and SI Figure S8A, the tumor inhibition effect of PBS, PBS + laser and 3D COF-TATB group was negligible, which indicated that laser alone and 3D COF-TATB had poor therapy efficacy against tumor. And the inhibition effect of 3D Cu@COF-TATB was moderate because 3D Cu@COF-TATB only produced \u22c5OH by CDT. After laser irradiation, the growth of tumors was suppressed in 3D COF-TATB + laser group through PDT to some extent. And 3D Cu@COF-TATB + laser group showed obvious tumor inhibition due to the production of multiple ROS through PDT and CDT, indicating that the multiple ROS-based strategy had better antitumor effect. H&E staining analysis was also observed that 3D Cu@COF-TATB under laser radiation induced extensive tumor cells apoptosis (D), which was consistent with the above results. We further studied the abscopal antitumor effect of 3D COF-TATB and 3D Cu@COF-TATB. The distant tumors grew rapidly in PBS, PBS + laser and 3D COF-TATB group. In the 3D Cu@COF-TATB, 3D COF-TATB + laser, 3D Cu@COF-TATB + laser and 3D Cu@COF-TATB + laser + aPD-1 groups, the distal tumors showed varying degrees of inhibition.

Moreover, the hydrodynamic sizes\nof 3D COF-TATB and 3D Cu@COF-TATB were about 100 nm by dynamic light\nscattering (DLS) (C). The stability of 3D Cu@COF-TATB was further studied.

Then Cu<sup>+</sup> reacts with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to produce \u2022OH and Cu<sup>2+</sup> through\na Fenton-like reaction. Hence, the GSH consumption level was investigated\nfirst. As shown in <ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.2c07739/suppl_file/am2c07739_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">SI Figure S5</ext-link>, the GSH\nlevel obviously decreased in the GSH+3D Cu@COF-TATB group, while negligible\nchanged in GSH+3D COF-TATB group, which indicated that the Cu<sup>2+</sup> reacted with GSH to exert CDT. Then the catalytic properties\nand doping efficiency of Cu<sup>2+</sup> were further assessed. In\norder to study the catalytic performance of 3D COF-TATB and 3D Cu@COF-TATB,\nthe methylene blue (MB) degradation experiments were carried out.\nThe Cu catalytic site in 3D Cu@COF-TATB has the ability to catalyze\nthe conversion of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to \u2022OH through\nthe Fenton-like reaction. As shown in D,E, the blue MB was degraded to colorless\nand the absorption intensity of MB at 664 nm significantly decreased\nwith the addition of 3D Cu@COF-TATB and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The result verified that 3D Cu@COF-TATB could be used as a potential\nnanozyme for CDT via Fenton-like reaction. Interestingly, we found\nthat this 3D COF-TATB also had a certain catalytic performance of\nH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to \u2022OH, which is the main reason\nthat the 3D COF-TATB was chosen in this work. The absorption intensity\nof MB in 3D COF-TATB with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> reduced by nearly\n4 times compared to that without H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (E), which indicated\nthe catalytic property of 3D COF-TATB to generate ROS without laser\nirradiation. Subsequently, the ability of 3D Cu@COF-TATB to generate <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> was studied utilizing 9,10-anthracenediyl-bis\u00ad(methylene)\u00addimalonic\nacid (ABMD) and 2,7-dichlorofluorescein (DCFH). As shown in F,G, only laser irradiated\nproduced almost no singlet oxygen and other ROS, which indicated that\nno influence was caused by the laser irradiation. As shown in F, the absorbance\nintensity of ABMD treated with 3D Cu@COF-TATB obviously decreased\nafter laser irradiation, which suggested that 3D Cu@COF-TATB had good\nability to produce <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> under 635 nm light irradiation.\nAnd the experimental results by DCFH probe were consistent with the\nabove results (G), which also verify the ROS production capacity of 3D Cu@COF-TATB.\nIn a word, 3D Cu@COF-TATB could produce a variety of highly toxic\nROS to fight against cancer. Studies have shown that paramagnetic\nmetal ions can inhibit the photosensitization of porphyrin, thus affecting\nthe effect of PDT. Therefore, we further investigated\nthe optimal Cu<sup>2+</sup> binding efficiency of 3D COF-TATB via\nDCFH probe. The total amount of produced ROS was adjusted by changing\nthe ratio of 3D COF-TATB and Cu<sup>2+</sup>. As can be seen in the H,I, with the increase\nof Cu<sup>2+</sup>, the generation of ROS first rose and then fell.\nWhen the mass ratio of Cu<sup>2+</sup> to 3D COF-TATB was 1:2, the\nROS produced by 3D Cu@COF-TATB was the most significant, which was\nabout 10 times more than that of 3D COF-TATB alone. However, as the\nratio of Cu<sup>2+</sup> to 3D COF-TATB exceeded 1:2, the 3D Cu@COF-TATB,\nthe total production of ROS by 3D Cu@COF-TATB gradually decreased\nbecause the coordination of Cu<sup>2+</sup> limited the ability of\nporphyrins to generate <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>. Under optimal condition\n(Cu<sup>2+</sup>: 3D COF-TATB = 1:2), the coordination efficiency\nof Cu<sup>2+</sup> in 3D COF-TATB was about 0.039 mg mg<sup>\u20131</sup> measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS)\n(<ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.2c07739/suppl_file/am2c07739_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S6</ext-link>).</p><title>The Intracellular Antitumor\nPerformance of 3D Cu@COF-TATB</title><p>We further studied the intracellular\ntherapeutic effect of the\n3D COF-TATB and 3D Cu@COF-TATB by MTT assays. The survival rate of\n4T1 cells was up to more than 90% under laser irradiation alone, which\nindicated that the power and irradiation time that we chose had low\ncytotoxicity. In the absence of laser irradiation, 4T1 cells had a\nlower survival rate after incubated with 3D Cu@COF-TATB than that\nof 3D COF-TATB, indicating the good CDT effect of 3D Cu@COF-TATB.\nAnd cells treated with 3D COF-TATB or 3D Cu@COF-TATB showed significant\nconcentration-dependent toxicity under laser irradiation (A). In addition,\nthe cell killing efficiency of 3D COF-TATB and 3D Cu@COF-TATB was\nverified by the live/dead cell staining assay. As shown in B, cancer cells pretreated\nwith 3D Cu@COF-TATB and laser irradiation exhibited strongest red\nfluorescence and weakest green fluorescence among all the groups,\nimplying that the 3D Cu@COF-TATB under laser irradiation had the most\nsevere lethality to living cells. Subsequently, 2,7-dichlorofluorescein\ndiacetate (DCFH-DA) was used to study the ability of 3D COF-TATB and\n3D Cu@COF-TATB to produce ROS in vitro. As illustrated in C,D, 4T1 cells incubated\nwith 3D Cu@COF-TATB under laser irradiation showed the most intensely\ngreen fluorescence, suggesting the excellent ROS production performance\nin cancer cells. In addition, compared with 3D COF-TATB, the cells\ntreated with 3D Cu@COF-TATB exhibited stronger green fluorescence\nsignal, which indicated that Cu<sup>2+</sup> could be reduced to Cu<sup>+</sup> by GSH and further catalyze the transformation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into \u2022OH to generate more ROS in cells. These\nresults were further demonstrated via flow cytometry assay. 4T1 cells\ntreated with 3D Cu@COF-TATB and laser irradiation showed the strongest\nfluorescent signal in E, which also suggested its ability to produce ROS. Excess\nROS can trigger mitochondrial destruction to induce cell apoptosis.\nThe mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) of 4T1 cells with different\ntreatments were studied by rhodamine 123. As shown in <ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.2c07739/suppl_file/am2c07739_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">SI Figure S7</ext-link>, the MMP decreased with the increase\nof ROS. In particular, the MMP decreased the most obviously in the\ngroup of 3D Cu@COF-TATB under laser irradiation, which verified that\nthe serious mitochondrial destruction was caused by excess ROS.</p><title>In Vivo Antitumor Therapeutic Effect</title><p>In order to evaluate\nthe in vivo antitumor therapeutic effects of proximal and distal tumors,\na 4T1 bilateral subcutaneous tumor-bearing model was established.\nIn this model, mice were first inoculated with 4T1 cells on the one\nside and then inoculated on the other side 3 days later (A). Inhibiting of\nPD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway is a common method of clinical immune\ncheckpoint blocking therapy in recent years. Therefore, we used the\nantibody of PD-1 (aPD-1) to interrupt PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway\nin combination with 3D Cu@COF-TATB to enhance antitumor immunity in\nvivo. The tumor-bearing mice were randomly assigned into seven groups\nand intratumorally injected with (1) PBS; (2) PBS + laser; (3) 3D\nCOF-TATB; (4) 3D Cu@COF-TATB; (5) 3D COF-TATB + laser; (6) 3D Cu@COF-TATB\n+ laser; (7) 3D Cu@COF-TATB + laser + aPD-1, respectively. As illustrated\nin B and <ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.2c07739/suppl_file/am2c07739_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">SI Figure S8A</ext-link>, the tumor inhibition effect of\nPBS, PBS + laser and 3D COF-TATB group was negligible, which indicated\nthat laser alone and 3D COF-TATB had poor therapy efficacy against\ntumor. And the inhibition effect of 3D Cu@COF-TATB was moderate because\n3D Cu@COF-TATB only produced \u2022OH by CDT. After laser irradiation,\nthe growth of tumors was suppressed in 3D COF-TATB + laser group through\nPDT to some extent. And 3D Cu@COF-TATB + laser group showed obvious\ntumor inhibition due to the production of multiple ROS through PDT\nand CDT, indicating that the multiple ROS-based strategy had better\nantitumor effect. H&amp;E staining analysis was also observed that\n3D Cu@COF-TATB under laser radiation induced extensive tumor cells\napoptosis (D), which was consistent with the above results. We further studied\nthe abscopal antitumor effect of 3D COF-TATB and 3D Cu@COF-TATB. The\ndistant tumors grew rapidly in PBS, PBS + laser and 3D COF-TATB group.\nIn the 3D Cu@COF-TATB, 3D COF-TATB + laser, 3D Cu@COF-TATB + laser\nand 3D Cu@COF-TATB + laser + aPD-1 groups, the distal tumors showed\nvarying degrees of inhibition. And 3D Cu@COF-TATB + laser + aPD-1\nhad the best inhibitory effect on distal tumors, suggesting that 3D\nCu@COF-TATB combining with aPD-1 caused systemic immune responses\nto inhibit the growth of abscopal tumor (C and <ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.2c07739/suppl_file/am2c07739_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">SI Figure S8B</ext-link>).

These experiments indicated the good biological safety and tumor\ninhibition effect of 3D Cu@COF-TATB, which will advance the application\npotential in vivo.</p>", "clean_text": "Results and Discussion\n\nPreparation and Characterizations of 3D Cu@COF-TATB\n\nThe 3D porphyrin-based COF-TATB was first prepared by a classical solvothermal method (Supporting Information (SI) Figure S1). The as-prepared 3D COF-TATB was then ground and crushed in mortar to obtain uniform COF particles in nanometer scale. The crystal structures of 3D COF-TATB was proved via the PXRD analysis. As shown in SI Figure S2, a strong peak at 6.67\u00b0 and an acromion at 7.20\u00b0 were observed. The 3D COF-TATB was further modified with Cu2+ through the coordination between the porphyrin ring and Cu2+ to obtain 3D Cu@COF-TATB. From the FT-IR spectrum (A), the characteristic peak of 3D COF-TATB at 1610 cm-1 indicated the formation of C = N linkage. And the characteristic peak of N-H bond in the porphyrin ring of 3D Cu@COF-TATB was moved from 964 to 999 cm-1, which confirmed the successful coordination of Cu2+. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (B) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (SI Figure S3) images showed that 3D COF-TATB and 3D Cu@COF-TATB had uniform morphology and size. Moreover, the hydrodynamic sizes of 3D COF-TATB and 3D Cu@COF-TATB were about 100 nm by dynamic light scattering (DLS) (C). The stability of 3D Cu@COF-TATB was further studied. In SI Figure S4, the hydrodynamic size of 3D Cu@COF-TATB was basically unchanged for 7 days, indicating the long-term stability of 3D Cu@COF-TATB.\n\nIn this system, the Cu2+ is reduced by the GSH to generate the Cu+ and GSSH. Then Cu+ reacts with H2O2 to produce \u22c5OH and Cu2+ through a Fenton-like reaction. Hence, the GSH consumption level was investigated first. As shown in SI Figure S5, the GSH level obviously decreased in the GSH+3D Cu@COF-TATB group, while negligible changed in GSH+3D COF-TATB group, which indicated that the Cu2+ reacted with GSH to exert CDT. Then the catalytic properties and doping efficiency of Cu2+ were further assessed. In order to study the catalytic performance of 3D COF-TATB and 3D Cu@COF-TATB, the methylene blue (MB) degradation experiments were carried out. The Cu catalytic site in 3D Cu@COF-TATB has the ability to catalyze the conversion of H2O2 to \u22c5OH through the Fenton-like reaction. As shown in D,E, the blue MB was degraded to colorless and the absorption intensity of MB at 664 nm significantly decreased with the addition of 3D Cu@COF-TATB and H2O2. The result verified that 3D Cu@COF-TATB could be used as a potential nanozyme for CDT via Fenton-like reaction. Interestingly, we found that this 3D COF-TATB also had a certain catalytic performance of H2O2 to \u22c5OH, which is the main reason that the 3D COF-TATB was chosen in this work. The absorption intensity of MB in 3D COF-TATB with H2O2 reduced by nearly 4 times compared to that without H2O2 (E), which indicated the catalytic property of 3D COF-TATB to generate ROS without laser irradiation. Subsequently, the ability of 3D Cu@COF-TATB to generate 1O2 was studied utilizing 9,10-anthracenediyl-bis(methylene)dimalonic acid (ABMD) and 2,7-dichlorofluorescein (DCFH). As shown in F,G, only laser irradiated produced almost no singlet oxygen and other ROS, which indicated that no influence was caused by the laser irradiation. As shown in F, the absorbance intensity of ABMD treated with 3D Cu@COF-TATB obviously decreased after laser irradiation, which suggested that 3D Cu@COF-TATB had good ability to produce 1O2 under 635 nm light irradiation. And the experimental results by DCFH probe were consistent with the above results (G), which also verify the ROS production capacity of 3D Cu@COF-TATB. In a word, 3D Cu@COF-TATB could produce a variety of highly toxic ROS to fight against cancer. Studies have shown that paramagnetic metal ions can inhibit the photosensitization of porphyrin, thus affecting the effect of PDT. Therefore, we further investigated the optimal Cu2+ binding efficiency of 3D COF-TATB via DCFH probe. The total amount of produced ROS was adjusted by changing the ratio of 3D COF-TATB and Cu2+. As can be seen in the H,I, with the increase of Cu2+, the generation of ROS first rose and then fell. When the mass ratio of Cu2+ to 3D COF-TATB was 1:2, the ROS produced by 3D Cu@COF-TATB was the most significant, which was about 10 times more than that of 3D COF-TATB alone. However, as the ratio of Cu2+ to 3D COF-TATB exceeded 1:2, the 3D Cu@COF-TATB, the total production of ROS by 3D Cu@COF-TATB gradually decreased because the coordination of Cu2+ limited the ability of porphyrins to generate 1O2. Under optimal condition (Cu2+: 3D COF-TATB = 1:2), the coordination efficiency of Cu2+ in 3D COF-TATB was about 0.039 mg mg-1 measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) (Figure S6).\n\nThe Intracellular Antitumor Performance of 3D Cu@COF-TATB\n\nWe further studied the intracellular therapeutic effect of the 3D COF-TATB and 3D Cu@COF-TATB by MTT assays. The survival rate of 4T1 cells was up to more than 90% under laser irradiation alone, which indicated that the power and irradiation time that we chose had low cytotoxicity. In the absence of laser irradiation, 4T1 cells had a lower survival rate after incubated with 3D Cu@COF-TATB than that of 3D COF-TATB, indicating the good CDT effect of 3D Cu@COF-TATB. And cells treated with 3D COF-TATB or 3D Cu@COF-TATB showed significant concentration-dependent toxicity under laser irradiation (A). In addition, the cell killing efficiency of 3D COF-TATB and 3D Cu@COF-TATB was verified by the live/dead cell staining assay. As shown in B, cancer cells pretreated with 3D Cu@COF-TATB and laser irradiation exhibited strongest red fluorescence and weakest green fluorescence among all the groups, implying that the 3D Cu@COF-TATB under laser irradiation had the most severe lethality to living cells. Subsequently, 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) was used to study the ability of 3D COF-TATB and 3D Cu@COF-TATB to produce ROS in vitro. As illustrated in C,D, 4T1 cells incubated with 3D Cu@COF-TATB under laser irradiation showed the most intensely green fluorescence, suggesting the excellent ROS production performance in cancer cells. In addition, compared with 3D COF-TATB, the cells treated with 3D Cu@COF-TATB exhibited stronger green fluorescence signal, which indicated that Cu2+ could be reduced to Cu+ by GSH and further catalyze the transformation of H2O2 into \u22c5OH to generate more ROS in cells. These results were further demonstrated via flow cytometry assay. 4T1 cells treated with 3D Cu@COF-TATB and laser irradiation showed the strongest fluorescent signal in E, which also suggested its ability to produce ROS. Excess ROS can trigger mitochondrial destruction to induce cell apoptosis. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) of 4T1 cells with different treatments were studied by rhodamine 123. As shown in SI Figure S7, the MMP decreased with the increase of ROS. In particular, the MMP decreased the most obviously in the group of 3D Cu@COF-TATB under laser irradiation, which verified that the serious mitochondrial destruction was caused by excess ROS.\n\nIn Vivo Antitumor Therapeutic Effect\n\nIn order to evaluate the in vivo antitumor therapeutic effects of proximal and distal tumors, a 4T1 bilateral subcutaneous tumor-bearing model was established. In this model, mice were first inoculated with 4T1 cells on the one side and then inoculated on the other side 3 days later (A). Inhibiting of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway is a common method of clinical immune checkpoint blocking therapy in recent years. Therefore, we used the antibody of PD-1 (aPD-1) to interrupt PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway in combination with 3D Cu@COF-TATB to enhance antitumor immunity in vivo. The tumor-bearing mice were randomly assigned into seven groups and intratumorally injected with (1) PBS; (2) PBS + laser; (3) 3D COF-TATB; (4) 3D Cu@COF-TATB; (5) 3D COF-TATB + laser; (6) 3D Cu@COF-TATB + laser; (7) 3D Cu@COF-TATB + laser + aPD-1, respectively. As illustrated in B and SI Figure S8A, the tumor inhibition effect of PBS, PBS + laser and 3D COF-TATB group was negligible, which indicated that laser alone and 3D COF-TATB had poor therapy efficacy against tumor. And the inhibition effect of 3D Cu@COF-TATB was moderate because 3D Cu@COF-TATB only produced \u22c5OH by CDT. After laser irradiation, the growth of tumors was suppressed in 3D COF-TATB + laser group through PDT to some extent. And 3D Cu@COF-TATB + laser group showed obvious tumor inhibition due to the production of multiple ROS through PDT and CDT, indicating that the multiple ROS-based strategy had better antitumor effect. H&E staining analysis was also observed that 3D Cu@COF-TATB under laser radiation induced extensive tumor cells apoptosis (D), which was consistent with the above results. We further studied the abscopal antitumor effect of 3D COF-TATB and 3D Cu@COF-TATB. The distant tumors grew rapidly in PBS, PBS + laser and 3D COF-TATB group. In the 3D Cu@COF-TATB, 3D COF-TATB + laser, 3D Cu@COF-TATB + laser and 3D Cu@COF-TATB + laser + aPD-1 groups, the distal tumors showed varying degrees of inhibition. And 3D Cu@COF-TATB + laser + aPD-1 had the best inhibitory effect on distal tumors, suggesting that 3D Cu@COF-TATB combining with aPD-1 caused systemic immune responses to inhibit the growth of abscopal tumor (C and SI Figure S8B). CD3+ and CD8+ T cells in tumors were studied by the immunofluorescence staining assay to proof the immune response. After treatments, the tumors of mice were gained and stained. SI Figure S9 showed that 3D Cu@COF-TATB+laser + aPD-1 group exhibited the most CD3+ and CD8+ T cells in tumor slides, which indicated the most significant immune response. Additionally, body weights (E) of mice remained negligible changed during treatments, which showed the biocompatibility of the materials. H&E staining images of major organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney) indicated that no obvious damage was caused to normal tissues (SI Figure S10). These experiments indicated the good biological safety and tumor inhibition effect of 3D Cu@COF-TATB, which will advance the application potential in vivo.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "COF-TATB", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "crystal structures", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "FT-IR spectrum", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "A"}, {"property name": "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "B"}, {"property name": "Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "<ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.2c07739/suppl_file/am2c07739_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">SI Figure S3</ext-link>"}, {"property name": "hydrodynamic sizes", "value": "100", "unit": "nm", "condition": "C"}, {"property name": "stability", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "<ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.2c07739/suppl_file/am2c07739_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">SI Figure S4</ext-link>"}, {"property name": "methylene blue (MB) degradation", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "D,E"}, {"property name": "ability to produce ROS without laser irradiation", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "E"}, {"property name": "ability to generate <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "F,G"}, {"property name": "optimal Cu<sup>2+</sup> binding efficiency", "value": "0.039", "unit": "mg mg<sup>\u20131</sup>", "condition": "<ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.2c07739/suppl_file/am2c07739_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S6</ext-link>"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "Cu@COF-TATB", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "intracellular therapeutic effect", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "A,B"}, {"property name": "ability to produce ROS in vitro", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "C,D"}, {"property name": "mitochondrial destruction", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "<ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.2c07739/suppl_file/am2c07739_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">SI Figure S7</ext-link>"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "Cu@COF-TATB", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "in vivo antitumor therapeutic effects", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "B,C"}, {"property name": "immune response", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "<ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.2c07739/suppl_file/am2c07739_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">SI Figure S9</ext-link>"}, {"property name": "biological safety", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "<ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.2c07739/suppl_file/am2c07739_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">SI Figure S10</ext-link>"}]}]], "include_properties": ["etc"]}, {"idx": 5, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Schematic\nIllustration of 3D Cu@COF-TATB for Cancer Immunotherapy\nvia PDT- and CDT- triggered ICD</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"am2c07739_0007.tif\" xlink:type=\"simple\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Schematic Illustration of 3D Cu@COF-TATB for Cancer Immunotherapy via PDT- and CDT- triggered ICD   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 16, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(A) FT-IR spectrum of 3D COF-TATB and 3D Cu@COF-TATB.\n(B) TEM images\nof 3D COF-TATB and 3D Cu@COF-TATB (scale bars: 100 nm).
