The XRPD patterns of anhydrous Zn3mim5Cl collected at 200 \u00b0C (a, red pattern) and 25 \u00b0C (blue pattern) are not identical. The pattern collected at room temperature exhibits additional reflections that can be indexed as 100, 1\u030502, and 012. In addition, there is a pronounced separation of overlapping reflections like 122 and 3\u03051\u03051 (a, gray-highlighted background). Therefore, the pattern can be indexed by the same unit cell metrics but with space group  P 21/ c . Thus, there are two polymorphs of anhydrous Zn3mim5Cl: a room-temperature modification, referred to as \u03b1-Zn3mim5Cl and a high-temperature polymorph, \u03b2-Zn3mim5Cl, with the latter one being previously reported. All patterns of anhydrous Zn3mim5X compounds, with X = F, Br, Cl, or OH are almost identical and can be indexed with the  P 21/ c  unit cell, as indicated by the presence of the 012 reflection (b) and can be therefore denoted as \u03b1-Zn3mim5X, with X = F, Br, Cl, or OH.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 30, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig4\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Comparison of the in situ XRPD pattern of anhydrous\nZn<sub>3</sub>mim<sub>5</sub>Cl collected at 200 \u00b0C and the <italic toggle=\"yes\">ex situ</italic> XRPD pattern of Zn<sub>3</sub>mim<sub>5</sub>Cl\ncollected at 25 \u00b0C produced by thermal dehydration of Zn<sub>3</sub>mim<sub>5</sub>ClH<sub>2</sub>O\u00b70.74H<sub>2</sub>O at\n225 \u00b0C including space group symmetries and selected reflection\nindices.

The fluoride-, hydroxide-, or the bromide-substituted, anhydrous yqt-type ZIF does not exhibit an \u03b1-\u03b2-transition between 120 and 498 K (Supporting Information Figures S15 and S16). This may be explained by the size and charge density of the inorganic anion: While fluoride and hydroxide seem too small to fill the void within the interpenetrated tfa networks with a linear Zn-X-Zn bridge, chloride has the proper size for a linear bridge. Nevertheless, due to their electronic configuration, these anions still prefer a tetrahedral coordination sphere (Supporting Information, Figure S19), which could be the driving force of the \u03b1-\u03b2-phase transition. In contrast, bromide is large and has a significantly lower charge density, which allows an almost linear, symmetrical Zn-Br-Zn bridge () and directs the lattice toward trigonal pseudo-symmetry. The Zn-Br bond shows enough flexibility to allow for a monoclinic distortion. The temperature-dependent expansion and contraction of the lattice parameters, which was monitored during heating and cooling cycles between 120 and 498 K (, filled and empty symbols), show anisotropic behavior for all investigated compounds. Upon cooling, both the a- and b-axes show significant contraction (, black and red symbols), between -1 and -2% (), whereas the c*-axes, corresponding to the 001 lattice plane distance, expands upon cooling (, blue symbols) or only shows minor contraction for the Br phase (). For all phases, except the chloride phase, the b-axis shows a higher contraction upon cooling than the a-axis. In the F/OH-substituted phase, this trend is more pronounced than in the pure OH-substituted yqt-type ZIF (a,b). The thermal expansion of the Br-substituted phase reflects the pseudo-trigonal lattice symmetry, as the a- and b-axes show an almost identical expansion behavior. In addition, this phase exhibits the smallest overall thermal expansion (). The expansion of the chloride-substituted phase, however, is outstanding, as it shows the highest volume expansion (), the most pronounced anisotropic thermal expansion with the highest expansion of the c*-axis and the largest contraction of the a-axis upon cooling and a nonlinear thermal behavior of the a-axis (c).", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 38, "type": "table", "classification": null, "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl4\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Change in the Lattice Parameters of\nZn<sub>3</sub>mim<sub>5</sub>X Compounds with X = Br, Cl, F, or OH\nupon Cooling from 498 to 123 K</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"5\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col5\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">change in lattice\nparameter</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">Zn<sub>3</sub>mim<sub>5</sub>F<sub>1<italic toggle=\"yes\">\u2013x</italic>\n</sub>(OH)<italic toggle=\"yes\">\n<sub>x</sub>\n</italic>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">Zn<sub>3</sub>mim<sub>5</sub>OH</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">Zn<sub>3</sub>mim<sub>5</sub>Cl</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">Zn<sub>3</sub>mim<sub>5</sub>Br</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">\n<bold>a</bold>\n</italic>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u20130.88%</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u20130.96%</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u20132.60%</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u20130.84%</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">\n<bold>b</bold>\n</italic>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u20131.72%</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u20131.32%</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u20131.39%</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u20130.93%</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">\n<bold>c*</bold>\n</italic>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>+0.32%</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>+0.23%</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>+1.18%</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u20130.11%</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">\n<bold>V</bold>\n</italic>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u20132.27%</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u20132.03%</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u20132.83%</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u20131.86%</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 39, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>For a more in-depth\nanalyses of the thermal expansion of the \u03b1-Zn<sub>3</sub>mim<sub>5</sub>X materials, we calculated the thermal expansion\ncoefficients along the orthogonalized principal direction (Supporting\nInformation <ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.cgd.2c00174/suppl_file/cg2c00174_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Table S11</ext-link>) using the PASCAL\nsoftware.

Cross-peaks with 1H resonances indicate the directly bound protons in the methyl group. Following the reasoning above, we attribute the methyl resonance at 17.5 ppm (purple) to mim1 and mim2 with longer distances of more than 4 \u00c5 to the F- anion, and the resonance at 15.6 and 14.8 ppm to mim3 and mim4 (green), with distances of 3.5 and 3.3 \u00c5 to F-, respectively. mim5 is again distinguished by a weaker signal at 12.5 ppm (cyan). Only two different quaternary carbon positions Cq can be discerned, reflecting their position at the center of the imidazolate molecules with less interactions to neighboring groups. They are correlated to the three groups of methyl protons around 2 ppm in an intramolecular coupling and to the imidazolate protons around 6 ppm either by intramolecular or by intermolecular interactions with neighboring imidazolate moieties. The aromatic imidazolate carbon positions CHmim are visible at 126.0, 124.9, and 123.9 ppm with an intensity ratio of approximately 2:2:1. Here, the two aromatic carbon positions in mim5 (cyan) have the same chemical shifts, as they are tethered to zinc atoms bound to an OH group each.

The expansion of the chloride-substituted phase, however, is outstanding, as it shows the highest volume expansion (), the most pronounced anisotropic thermal expansion with the highest expansion of the c*-axis and the largest contraction of the a-axis upon cooling and a nonlinear thermal behavior of the a-axis (c).", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "thermal expansion coefficient": [{"value": "12", "unit": "x 10-6 K-1", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "\u03b1- and \u03b2-Zn3mim5Cl", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "thermal expansion coefficient": [{"value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "chloride phase", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "thermal expansion coefficient": [{"value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "fluoride-, hydroxide-, or the bromide-substituted, anhydrous yqt-type ZIF", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "thermal expansion coefficient": [{"value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "bromide", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "thermal expansion coefficient": [{"value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "all investigated compounds", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "thermal expansion coefficient": [{"value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "F/OH-substituted phase", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "thermal expansion coefficient": [{"value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "pure OH-substituted yqt-type ZIF", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "thermal expansion coefficient": [{"value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "Br-substituted phase", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "thermal expansion coefficient": [{"value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "chloride-substituted phase", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "thermal expansion coefficient": [{"value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["thermal_expansion_coefficient"]}, {"idx": 16, "type": "table", "classification": ["Property"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Elemental Analysis\nof All Investigated\nPhases<xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"t1fn2\"></xref>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"5\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"left\"></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">Zn<sub>3</sub>mim<sub>5</sub>F<sub>0.35</sub>(OH)<sub>0.65</sub> found\n(calc.)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">Zn<sub>3</sub>mim<sub>5</sub>ClH<sub>2</sub>O\u00b70.74H<sub>2</sub>O</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">Zn<sub>3</sub>mim<sub>5</sub>BrH<sub>2</sub>O\u00b70.45H<sub>2</sub>O</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">Zn<sub>3</sub>mim<sub>5</sub>OH<xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"t1fn1\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<bold>C</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>38.6 (38.8)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>35.3 (35.9)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>35.3 (33.9)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>38.5 (38.8)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<bold>H</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>6.3 (4.2)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>4.7 (4.3)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>4.3 (4.0)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>4.2 (4.2)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<bold>N</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>22.6 (22.6)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>20.8 (21.0)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>20.5 (19.8)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>22.5 (22.6)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<bold>O</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>n.d.
