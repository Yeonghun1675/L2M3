Walton and Sholl recently remarked on the importance of elucidating the\neffects of industrially relevant processing procedures on materials\ndiscussed in academic work, and pelletization is often required for\nnon-supported adsorbents in packed-bed columns. Subsequently, this observation recognizes how the H<sub>2</sub>S adsorption potential of MIL-101\u00ad(Cr) may be deleteriously\naffected by application-specific pre-exposure processing steps. Decreased\nadsorption potential is most directly obvious from the measured sharp\ndecrease in the accessible pore space for H<sub>2</sub>S adsorption;\nthis reduces the adsorption capacity expected from the pristine framework.\nAdditionally, the observed structural changes may lead to further\nchemically induced degradation in the presence of other possible natural\ngas species, such as water vapor.</p><p>Dynamic adsorption curves for amine-functionalized samples\nin the\n1% H<sub>2</sub>S/CH<sub>4</sub> mixture are compared in d.

The importance of adding multicomponent complexity\nis clearly demonstrated by this change in adsorbent ranking.

Significant\nmethane adsorption competition at &lt;1 atm partial pressure is unexpected\nin the mesoporous adsorbent, which explains why the fixed-bed results\nare comparable to those acquired with an inert carrier gas. Because\nmethane is a major constituent in natural gas, the relative insensitivity\nof MIL-101\u00ad(Cr) to methane adsorption\u00a0competition is beneficial\nfor selective H<sub>2</sub>S removal.

Figures S1, S2, and Table S2 show that pelletization and subsequent H2S exposure does not affect the diffraction patterns or accessible surface areas of UiO-66(Zr), UiO-66-NH2(Zr), MIL-125(Ti), or MIL-125-NH2(Ti). However, sample pelletization did change the diffraction pattern for MIL-101(Cr). b depicts  microstrained crystalline features corresponding to peaks between 2\u03b8 = 2-5\u00b0 for MIL-101(Cr) and MIL-101-NH2(Cr) after pelletization. These low-angle features are furthermore completely absent in the pattern for MIL-101(Cr) after H2S exposure. Decreased N2 uptake at 77 K after pelletization evidenced in Figures S5 and S6 supports this observation. Table S2 additionally shows that Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas for MIL-101(Cr) materials significantly decrease after pelletization. Qualitative changes after pelletization are also apparent in the pore size distributions for MIL-101(Cr)-type MOFs in Figures S8 and S9. A relatively larger porosity loss is experienced for these pelletized samples after acid gas exposure in Figure S5, in comparison to their pristine counterparts. Pelletized MIL-101(Cr) exhibits a 10% loss in the BET surface area, greater than that seen with MIL-101-NH2(Cr). These results show that the pelletization process partially destroys the MIL-101(Cr) framework and in-turn compromises the characteristic acid gas stability of the material. Textural property changes in HKUST-1 reported by Peterson et al. within the same pelletization pressure range (1000-10000 psi) used in this study (~8000 psi) demonstrate the commonality of material changes through this process on certain MOFs. Changes in structure-property relationships in other hierarchically structured porous adsorbents through similar processing have been examined as well. Walton and Sholl recently remarked on the importance of elucidating the effects of industrially relevant processing procedures on materials discussed in academic work, and pelletization is often required for non-supported adsorbents in packed-bed columns. Subsequently, this observation recognizes how the H2S adsorption potential of MIL-101(Cr) may be deleteriously affected by application-specific pre-exposure processing steps. Decreased adsorption potential is most directly obvious from the measured sharp decrease in the accessible pore space for H2S adsorption; this reduces the adsorption capacity expected from the pristine framework. Additionally, the observed structural changes may lead to further chemically induced degradation in the presence of other possible natural gas species, such as water vapor.\n\nDynamic adsorption curves for amine-functionalized samples in the 1% H2S/CH4 mixture are compared in d. MIL-125-NH2(Ti) exhibited the best H2S removal performance of the candidate MOFs, with a saturation capacity of 0.559 mmol H2S g-1 in the 99% CH4 mixture. This is also the largest increase (~170%) in the H2S saturation capacity from the parent MOF observed in this study. Later discussion on the sensitivity of MIL-125-NH2(Ti) hydroxyl and primary amine sites to adsorbing H2S, investigated through in situ FTIR experiments, elaborates more on this phenomenon.\n\nMIL-125-NH2(Ti) was replaced by MIL-101-NH2(Cr) as the material with the greatest H2S saturation capacity when using the 1% H2S/10% CO2/CH4 mixture. The importance of adding multicomponent complexity is clearly demonstrated by this change in adsorbent ranking. For instance, this dynamic would not be easily discernable from comparing single-component isothermal uptake measurements or previous fixed-bed adsorption studies utilizing H2S mixtures with inert balances (e.g., He and N2). Saturation capacities for all materials in both 1% H2S/CH4 and 1% H2S/10% CO2/CH4 are provided in . The markedly lower accessible BET surface area of UiO-66-NH2(Zr) compared to MIL-125-NH2(Ti) and MIL-101-NH2(Cr), even after pelletization, likely caused this MOF to possess the lowest H2S saturation capacity of the primary amine-containing adsorbents in both mixtures. H2S adsorption capacities for MIL-101(Cr) materials in the methane carrier gas here are similar to those reported by Zou and co-workers through 1% H2S/10% CO2/89% He breakthrough experiments. Significant methane adsorption competition at <1 atm partial pressure is unexpected in the mesoporous adsorbent, which explains why the fixed-bed results are comparable to those acquired with an inert carrier gas. Because methane is a major constituent in natural gas, the relative insensitivity of MIL-101(Cr) to methane adsorption competition is beneficial for selective H2S removal. In contrast to MIL-101(Cr), the H2S capacities measured here for UiO-66-NH2(Zr) for 1% H2S/CH4 and 1% H2S/10% CO2/CH4 mixtures are significantly lower than the 0.909 mmol g-1 capacity reported by Zou and co-workers. As previously explained, this difference is mainly ascribed to the differences in synthesis procedures compared with the previous study. Still, the ~50% lower H2S saturation capacity measured in 1% H2S/99% CH4 here suggests that competitive binding effects from methane significantly reduce H2S adsorption performance in small-pore UiO-66-NH2(Zr). All H2S saturation capacities exhibit order-of-magnitude agreement with previous calculations and/or equilibrium H2S adsorption experiments (previous data not available for MIL-101-NH2) around P/P 0 = 0.01.
