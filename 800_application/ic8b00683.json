The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of this MOF was found to be 1480 m2 g-1, with a pore volume of 0.88 cm3 g-1. From a topological point of view, it has a 3,3,4,4-connected net with  mfj  topology and can be considered as a close packing of channels, shown in c. The framework was endowed with large spherical cages (b) with a diameter of ~11 \u00c5 (atom-atom distances excluding van der Waals radii). The Lewis acidity of these cages increased because of the vacant coordination positions (d) on copper, and hence, the compound was explored as a nanomolecular vessel for C-O bond and C-C bond coupling reactions, viz., cross-dehydrogentaive coupling (CDC) and Friedla\u0308nder reactions, respectively.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "1480", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}], "pore volume": [{"probe": "", "value": "0.88", "unit": "cm3/g", "condition": ""}], "topology": [{"value": "3,3,4,4-connected", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "1'", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "1480", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}], "pore volume": [{"probe": "", "value": "0.88", "unit": "cm3/g", "condition": ""}], "topology": [{"value": "3,3,4,4-connected", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["surface_area", "porosity", "pore_volume", "topology"]}, {"idx": 12, "type": "table", "classification": ["Property"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>CDC Reactions under\nSolvent Free Conditions at 100 \u00b0C<xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"t1fn1\"></xref>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic content-type=\"header\" id=\"fx1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2018-006837_0005.tif\"></graphic>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"5\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">entry</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">catalyst</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">R<sub>1</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">R<sub>2</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">yield (%)<xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"t1fn2\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>1</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1\u2032</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>H</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>H</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>96</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>2</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1\u2032</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>H</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>OMe</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>92</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>3</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1\u2032</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>Cl</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>H</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>84</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>4</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1\u2032</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>NO<sub>2</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>H</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>65</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>5</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1\u2032</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>unsubstituted phenol</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u2013</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>10</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>6</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>Cu(OAc)<sub>2</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>H</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>H</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>73</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>7</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>Cu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>H</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>H</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>71</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>8</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>no catalyst</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>H</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>H</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>no reaction</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n<table-wrap-foot>\n<fn id=\"t1fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>Reaction conditions: hydroxybenzaldehyde\n(1.0 mmol), <bold>1\u2032</bold> (1 wt %), 1,4-dioxane (4 mL, 50\nmmol), <italic>tert</italic>-butyl hydroperoxide (70 wt % in water,\n0.436 mL, 3.0 mmol).</p>\n</fn>\n<fn id=\"t1fn2\">\n<label>b</label>\n<p>Yield\nof the isolated product.</p>\n</fn>\n</table-wrap-foot>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "Table 1.
