The percentage of degradation with the SOS@ZnO sphere was calculated to be 85.7% from the UV-vis data, higher than that of ZnO nanoparticles (73.9%, D). The ZnO layer covers the SOS particles. We do not expect any adsorption of methyl orange onto the SOS particles. To confirm this, the SOS-SH particles were thermally treated in the same way (i.e., heating in air to 550 \u00b0C) and then tested for dye adsorption/degradation.

It should be noted that the commercial catalyst comprises only ZnO, whereas the loading of ZnO in the SOS@ZnO composite spheres was around 9.6%.

The SOS spheres have thiol groups on\ntheir surface that offer high affinity to a range of metal ions. When SOS particles were mixed with Zn\u00ad(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> solutions, the affinity of Zn<sup>2+</sup> to \u2212SH groups\nled to the adsorption of Zn<sup>2+</sup> onto SOS particles, which\ncould act as anchoring points for the formation and growth of ZIF-8\nnanocrystals. ZIF-8 crystals could be synthesized in organic solvents\nand in water. Organic solvents are not only expensive but also pose environmental\nrisks such as toxicity and flammability. It was possible to promote\ncrystal growth in aqueous solutions by using high concentrations of\n2-MeIM. Here, we first attempted synthesis of ZIF-8\ncrystals onto SOS particles in aqueous medium with a high ratio of\n2-MeIM to Zn<sup>2+</sup> (procedure 1 with water). SEM imaging of\nthe obtained material showed that the SOS microspheres were covered\nwith nanoparticles around \u223c50 nm in diameter (B). The crystallinity of this\nmaterial was confirmed (C) and consistent with the PXRD pattern of the commonly synthesized\nZIF-8 crystals. The PXRD pattern showed sharp and high intensity peaks, demonstrating\nthat highly pure ZIF-8 nanocrystals were formed. The TGA analysis\nin air at 1000 \u00b0C (D) showed the inorganic component of 44.48% (SiO<sub>2</sub> + ZnO), 5.28% higher than the inorganic component of SOS particles\nonly. The surface coverage of ZIF-8 nanocrystals\nwas quite uniform. It appeared that the nanocrystals were prone to\ngrowing onto the silica nanospheres and not densely covering the whole\nsurface, probably because of the easy access to the silica nanosphere\nactive sites (E). It should be mentioned that the description of uniform or densely\ngrowing ZIF-8 nanocrystals is based on the SEM imaging and comparison\nof the SOS@ZIF-8 composite microspheres prepared in this study.</p><p>The PXRD pattern again confirmed the crystalline\nphase of the ZIF-8 coating (B).

The pore size distribution calculated\nusing NLDFT method showed micropores peaked at 1.2 nm (or 12 \u00c5,\nconsistent with the pore cage diameter) and 1.8 nm\n(or 18 \u00c5, D).

However, the\nseparation of the test mixtures (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5b04979/suppl_file/am5b04979_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S11</ext-link>) was poor (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5b04979/suppl_file/am5b04979_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figures S12 and S13</ext-link>). There\nwas only a slight improvement compared to the column packed with SOS\nparticles. This is likely the result of low loading and larger interstitial\nvoids between the ZIF-8 nanocrystals on SOS surface. The SOS-COOH@ZIF-8\nparticles (prepared by procedure 2 in methanol, D) with densely aggregated ZIF-8 nanocrystals\nand the overall spherical shape (for efficient packing) were then\nevaluated. The change of the column back pressure with the mobile\nphase was investigated by flushing the packed column at different\nflow rates. Compared to the column back pressure of the SOS-COOH particles\npacked column, the column back pressure was increased about 40% in\nthe presence of ZIF-8 nanocrystals (A). The SOS@ZIF-8 packed column generated\na column pressure of 186 bar, whereas the back pressure was 132 bar\nfor the SOS-COOH packed column at 1 mL/min. The increase in the back\npressure was due to the presence of ZIF-8 nanocrystals between the\nnanospheres on SOS particles. However, the introduction of ZIF-8 on\nthe surface could result in an increase in \u03c0\u2013\u03c0\ninteraction with aromatic compounds caused by an imidazole group. This was demonstrated here by separation of\n1-(4-hydroxyl phenyl) ethanol, 3-[1-(methyl amino) ethyl] phenol,\nand 3-[1-(dimethyl amino) ethyl] phenol (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5b04979/suppl_file/am5b04979_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S11</ext-link>). With the SOS-COOH packed column, these aromatic compounds\nwere not resolved and eluted as a large single peak (B). The separation selectivity\nwas improved with ZIF-8 nanocrystals on the SOS surface. All three\naromatic compounds were resolved in less than 3 min. This separation\nwas achieved with a flow rate of 0.35 mL/min and back pressure of\n59 bar (B).\nThe separation of similar aromatic compounds was previously carried\nout using ZIF-8 particles as the stationary phase. It was found that\nZIF-8 showed a good selectivity but gave inadequate mass transfer\nand poor chromatographic resolution. Using\nthe SOS-COOH@ZIF-8 particles as stationary phase resulted in improved\nchromatographic resolution and efficiency (column efficiency reaching\nup to 19\u202f148 plates/m on the basis of peak 3 in B). Another example of separation\nvia the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interaction mechanism was demonstrated\nwith phenol, hydroquinone, and bibenzyl-4,4\u2032-diol (C). The baseline\nseparation was achieved within 5 min at a flow rate of 0.35 mL/min.\nBibenzyl-4,4\u2032-diol showed stronger retention on the stationary\nphase and resulted in a retention factor of 5.7. This could be attributed\nto the additional \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interaction with the increase\nin aromaticity. Indeed, compared to the SOS-COOH column, the retention\ntimes of all these aromatic compounds are longer on the column packed\nwith SOS-COOH@ZIF-8 particles. It is clear that the difference in\n\u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interaction between the aromatic compounds\nand the coated ZIF-8 nanocrystals has led to the improved separation.</p><p>This study was to demonstrate\nthe potential use of SOS@ZnO microsphere for dye photodegradation.\nOne type of SOS@ZIF-8 composite microsphere was selected and thermally\ntreated for a dye degradation test. During the thermal treatment in\nair at 550 \u00b0C, the organic components including the carbon chains\nand surface functional groups were decomposed to produce inorganic\nsilica. Therefore, the SOS surface functional\ngroups (\u2212COOH, \u2212SH, and \u2212NH<sub>2</sub>) could\nnot contribute to the degradation performance, although the surface\nfunctional groups did impact the ZIF-8 morphology. The SOS-SH@ZIF-8\ncomposite mcirospheres (B) were chosen because of the relatively uniform coating of\nsmall ZIF-8 nanocrystals. This could, in principle, lead to smaller\nZnO nanoparticles that could have better performance for the degradation\nof methyl orange. The thermally treated microspheres resembled the\nSOS spheres (A). The PXRD pattern showed no diffraction peaks for crystalline\nZIF-8. Instead, it exhibited characteristic diffraction peaks at {100},\n{002}, {101}, {102}, and {110}, indicating the hexagonal wurtzite\nstructure of ZnO (B). Individual ZnO nanocrystals could\nnot be seen on the SOS particles. Higher-resolution SEM images showed\na layer of ZnO consisting of small nanograins (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5b04979/suppl_file/am5b04979_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S14</ext-link>). To estimate the loading of ZnO, the composite\nspheres (10 mg) were dissolved in 10 mL of acid solution (mixture\nof 0.5 M citric acid and 0.5 M HCl, with the presence of citric acid\nfacilitating ZnO dissolution). The ICP\nanalysis gave a Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentration of 77 ppm. The calculation\nshowed a ZnO loading of 9.6 wt % in the composite microspheres.</p><p>As a control, the degradation of methyl orange\nwas initially carried out in the presence of ZnO (20\u2013100 nm, <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5b04979/suppl_file/am5b04979_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S15</ext-link>) and ZIF-8 nanoparticles (synthesized\nwith procedure 1 in water without the presence of SOS particles, <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5b04979/suppl_file/am5b04979_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S8</ext-link>). Methyl orange with an initial concentration\nof 10 mg/L was used throughout this work. The degradation reaction\nwas carried out at room temperature, and the reaction was monitored\nwith a UV\u2013vis spectrometer. Methyl orange exhibits strong absorption\nat 465 nm. A change of absorbance at 465 nm was used to monitor the\ndye\u2019s degradation. The experiments showed that the photodegradation\ndid not occur in the presence of ZIF-8. As expected, the degradation\nof methyl orange with ZnO nanoparticles as catalyst was observed.\nMethyl orange was completely decomposed into colorless small molecules\nwithin 6 h.\n</p><p>The composite SOS@ZnO particles were tested for the photodegradation\nof methyl organic under the same conditions (120 mg of catalyst per\n1 L of methyl orange solution) as used in the control experiment.\nAfter 4 h of UV radiation at 365 nm, the yellow solution turned nearly\ncolorless, indicating the photodegradation of methyl orange (C). The percentage\nof degradation with the SOS@ZnO sphere was calculated to be 85.7%\nfrom the UV\u2013vis data, higher than that of ZnO nanoparticles\n(73.9%, D).\nThe ZnO layer covers the SOS particles. We do not expect any adsorption\nof methyl orange onto the SOS particles. To confirm this, the SOS-SH\nparticles were thermally treated in the same way (i.e., heating in\nair to 550 \u00b0C) and then tested for dye adsorption/degradation.\nThere was no decrease of the concentration observed when the SOS particles\nwere soaked in the methyl orange solution for up to 3 days. It should\nbe noted that the commercial catalyst comprises only ZnO, whereas\nthe loading of ZnO in the SOS@ZnO composite spheres was around 9.6%.\nBecause the same mass of the materials was used for the photodegradation\nreactions, this indicated a much higher catalytic efficiency from\nthe SOS@ZnO microspheres. A thin film of nanocrystalline ZnO was observed\nto cover the SOS silica microspheres. The easy access to the supported\nand very small ZnO nanocrystals is thought to be the reason for the\nsuperior degradation performance of the SOS@ZnO microspheres. When\nthe concentration of the catalyst was increased to 200 mg/L, the percentage\nof methyl orange degradation was increased by 10%, with still no catalytic\nactivity observed for ZIF-8 nanocrystals. However, the percentage\nof degradation was still higher for the SOS@ZnO composite spheres\n(D). The catalytic\nphotodegradation by SOS@ZnO particles was repeated three times.

Although\nthe SOS particles were nonporous, the SOS@ZIF-8 core\u2013shell\nparticles exhibited BET surface areas up to 500 m<sup>2</sup>/g, attributed\nto the intrinsic ZIF-8 microporosity and the interstices between the\nshell nanoparticle. The morphology of ZIF-8 nanocrystals on SOS microspheres\nwas strongly influenced by the silica surface functional groups (\u2212SH,\n\u2212COOH, and \u2212NH<sub>2</sub>) and precursor conditions\n(mainly the molar ratio of the ligand 2-MeIM to Zn<sup>2+</sup>).\nThe SOS@ZIF-8 core\u2013shell microspheres could be easily packed\ninto a column for HPLC separation.

The SOS spheres have thiol groups on their surface that offer high affinity to a range of metal ions. When SOS particles were mixed with Zn(NO3)2 solutions, the affinity of Zn2+ to -SH groups led to the adsorption of Zn2+ onto SOS particles, which could act as anchoring points for the formation and growth of ZIF-8 nanocrystals. ZIF-8 crystals could be synthesized in organic solvents and in water. Organic solvents are not only expensive but also pose environmental risks such as toxicity and flammability. It was possible to promote crystal growth in aqueous solutions by using high concentrations of 2-MeIM. Here, we first attempted synthesis of ZIF-8 crystals onto SOS particles in aqueous medium with a high ratio of 2-MeIM to Zn2+ (procedure 1 with water). SEM imaging of the obtained material showed that the SOS microspheres were covered with nanoparticles around ~50 nm in diameter (B). The crystallinity of this material was confirmed (C) and consistent with the PXRD pattern of the commonly synthesized ZIF-8 crystals. The PXRD pattern showed sharp and high intensity peaks, demonstrating that highly pure ZIF-8 nanocrystals were formed. The TGA analysis in air at 1000 \u00b0C (D) showed the inorganic component of 44.48% (SiO2 + ZnO), 5.28% higher than the inorganic component of SOS particles only. The surface coverage of ZIF-8 nanocrystals was quite uniform. It appeared that the nanocrystals were prone to growing onto the silica nanospheres and not densely covering the whole surface, probably because of the easy access to the silica nanosphere active sites (E). It should be mentioned that the description of uniform or densely growing ZIF-8 nanocrystals is based on the SEM imaging and comparison of the SOS@ZIF-8 composite microspheres prepared in this study.\n\nThe PXRD pattern again confirmed the crystalline phase of the ZIF-8 coating (B). Nitrogen sorption measurement of the SOS-SH@ZIF-8 particles at 77K revealed a type-I isotherm, indicating a highly microporous material (C). This resulted from the ZIF-8 coating because the as-prepared SOS-SH particles were nonporous. The apparent BET surface area of the composite microspheres was 495 m2/g with pore volume of 0.19 mL/g. Total N2 uptake of 124 mL/g at a relative pressure p/p 0 = 0.95 is 31% of that observed for the pure bulk ZIF-8 (400 mL/g). The pore size distribution calculated using NLDFT method showed micropores peaked at 1.2 nm (or 12 \u00c5, consistent with the pore cage diameter) and 1.8 nm (or 18 \u00c5, D). A slight hysteresis was observed upon desorption, which revealed mesopores around 83 nm on the basis of Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) calculation (mesopore volume = 0.0154 mL/g). These mesopores and the additional macropores (>50 nm) compared to ZIF-8 are believed to be from the interstices of aggregated particles in the material. The TGA data showed an inorganic component of 45.07% at 1000 \u00b0C (Figure S1).\n\nZIF-8 crystals contain hydrophobic micropores. The columns packed with ZIF-8 particles or silica-ZIF-8 core-shell particles have been assessed for reversed-phase HPLC. Herein, the column packed with SOS-COOH@ ZIF-8 particles (procedure 1 in H2O, Figure S4, morphology similar to that shown in B) was first assessed using methanol/ethanediol (99.5:0.5 v/v%) as mobile phase. However, the separation of the test mixtures (Figure S11) was poor (Figures S12 and S13). There was only a slight improvement compared to the column packed with SOS particles. This is likely the result of low loading and larger interstitial voids between the ZIF-8 nanocrystals on SOS surface. The SOS-COOH@ZIF-8 particles (prepared by procedure 2 in methanol, D) with densely aggregated ZIF-8 nanocrystals and the overall spherical shape (for efficient packing) were then evaluated. The change of the column back pressure with the mobile phase was investigated by flushing the packed column at different flow rates. Compared to the column back pressure of the SOS-COOH particles packed column, the column back pressure was increased about 40% in the presence of ZIF-8 nanocrystals (A). The SOS@ZIF-8 packed column generated a column pressure of 186 bar, whereas the back pressure was 132 bar for the SOS-COOH packed column at 1 mL/min. The increase in the back pressure was due to the presence of ZIF-8 nanocrystals between the nanospheres on SOS particles. However, the introduction of ZIF-8 on the surface could result in an increase in \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction with aromatic compounds caused by an imidazole group. This was demonstrated here by separation of 1-(4-hydroxyl phenyl) ethanol, 3-[1-(methyl amino) ethyl] phenol, and 3-[1-(dimethyl amino) ethyl] phenol (Figure S11). With the SOS-COOH packed column, these aromatic compounds were not resolved and eluted as a large single peak (B). The separation selectivity was improved with ZIF-8 nanocrystals on the SOS surface. All three aromatic compounds were resolved in less than 3 min. This separation was achieved with a flow rate of 0.35 mL/min and back pressure of 59 bar (B). The separation of similar aromatic compounds was previously carried out using ZIF-8 particles as the stationary phase. It was found that ZIF-8 showed a good selectivity but gave inadequate mass transfer and poor chromatographic resolution. Using the SOS-COOH@ZIF-8 particles as stationary phase resulted in improved chromatographic resolution and efficiency (column efficiency reaching up to 19148 plates/m on the basis of peak 3 in B). Another example of separation via the \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction mechanism was demonstrated with phenol, hydroquinone, and bibenzyl-4,4'-diol (C). The baseline separation was achieved within 5 min at a flow rate of 0.35 mL/min. Bibenzyl-4,4'-diol showed stronger retention on the stationary phase and resulted in a retention factor of 5.7. This could be attributed to the additional \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction with the increase in aromaticity. Indeed, compared to the SOS-COOH column, the retention times of all these aromatic compounds are longer on the column packed with SOS-COOH@ZIF-8 particles. It is clear that the difference in \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction between the aromatic compounds and the coated ZIF-8 nanocrystals has led to the improved separation.\n\nThis study was to demonstrate the potential use of SOS@ZnO microsphere for dye photodegradation. One type of SOS@ZIF-8 composite microsphere was selected and thermally treated for a dye degradation test. During the thermal treatment in air at 550 \u00b0C, the organic components including the carbon chains and surface functional groups were decomposed to produce inorganic silica. Therefore, the SOS surface functional groups (-COOH, -SH, and -NH2) could not contribute to the degradation performance, although the surface functional groups did impact the ZIF-8 morphology. The SOS-SH@ZIF-8 composite mcirospheres (B) were chosen because of the relatively uniform coating of small ZIF-8 nanocrystals. This could, in principle, lead to smaller ZnO nanoparticles that could have better performance for the degradation of methyl orange. The thermally treated microspheres resembled the SOS spheres (A). The PXRD pattern showed no diffraction peaks for crystalline ZIF-8. Instead, it exhibited characteristic diffraction peaks at {100}, {002}, {101}, {102}, and {110}, indicating the hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO (B). Individual ZnO nanocrystals could not be seen on the SOS particles. Higher-resolution SEM images showed a layer of ZnO consisting of small nanograins (Figure S14). To estimate the loading of ZnO, the composite spheres (10 mg) were dissolved in 10 mL of acid solution (mixture of 0.5 M citric acid and 0.5 M HCl, with the presence of citric acid facilitating ZnO dissolution). The ICP analysis gave a Zn2+ concentration of 77 ppm. The calculation showed a ZnO loading of 9.6 wt % in the composite microspheres.\n\nAs a control, the degradation of methyl orange was initially carried out in the presence of ZnO (20-100 nm, Figure S15) and ZIF-8 nanoparticles (synthesized with procedure 1 in water without the presence of SOS particles, Figure S8). Methyl orange with an initial concentration of 10 mg/L was used throughout this work. The degradation reaction was carried out at room temperature, and the reaction was monitored with a UV-vis spectrometer. Methyl orange exhibits strong absorption at 465 nm. A change of absorbance at 465 nm was used to monitor the dye's degradation. The experiments showed that the photodegradation did not occur in the presence of ZIF-8. As expected, the degradation of methyl orange with ZnO nanoparticles as catalyst was observed. Methyl orange was completely decomposed into colorless small molecules within 6 h. \n\nThe composite SOS@ZnO particles were tested for the photodegradation of methyl organic under the same conditions (120 mg of catalyst per 1 L of methyl orange solution) as used in the control experiment. After 4 h of UV radiation at 365 nm, the yellow solution turned nearly colorless, indicating the photodegradation of methyl orange (C). The percentage of degradation with the SOS@ZnO sphere was calculated to be 85.7% from the UV-vis data, higher than that of ZnO nanoparticles (73.9%, D). The ZnO layer covers the SOS particles. We do not expect any adsorption of methyl orange onto the SOS particles. To confirm this, the SOS-SH particles were thermally treated in the same way (i.e., heating in air to 550 \u00b0C) and then tested for dye adsorption/degradation. There was no decrease of the concentration observed when the SOS particles were soaked in the methyl orange solution for up to 3 days. It should be noted that the commercial catalyst comprises only ZnO, whereas the loading of ZnO in the SOS@ZnO composite spheres was around 9.6%. Because the same mass of the materials was used for the photodegradation reactions, this indicated a much higher catalytic efficiency from the SOS@ZnO microspheres. A thin film of nanocrystalline ZnO was observed to cover the SOS silica microspheres. The easy access to the supported and very small ZnO nanocrystals is thought to be the reason for the superior degradation performance of the SOS@ZnO microspheres. When the concentration of the catalyst was increased to 200 mg/L, the percentage of methyl orange degradation was increased by 10%, with still no catalytic activity observed for ZIF-8 nanocrystals. However, the percentage of degradation was still higher for the SOS@ZnO composite spheres (D). The catalytic photodegradation by SOS@ZnO particles was repeated three times. The degradation of methyl orange (>90%) was achieved in each case, with a standard deviation of <3% (Figure S16). SOS@ZnO can be readily recovered by gravimetric sedimentation or simple filtration. With spherical morphology and the micrometer sizes, these spheres may be easily packed into a column to allow continuous wastewater treatment, in a manner similar to HPLC separation.\n\nConclusions\n\nSOS silica microspheres were used as support to prepare SOS@ZIF-8 composite microspheres. Uniform and dense coatings of ZIF-8 with significantly varied morphologies on the SOS particles were formed in a one-step synthesis, without the usual multiple coating procedures required. PXRD patterns confirmed the formation of crystalline ZIF-8. Although the SOS particles were nonporous, the SOS@ZIF-8 core-shell particles exhibited BET surface areas up to 500 m2/g, attributed to the intrinsic ZIF-8 microporosity and the interstices between the shell nanoparticle. The morphology of ZIF-8 nanocrystals on SOS microspheres was strongly influenced by the silica surface functional groups (-SH, -COOH, and -NH2) and precursor conditions (mainly the molar ratio of the ligand 2-MeIM to Zn2+). The SOS@ZIF-8 core-shell microspheres could be easily packed into a column for HPLC separation. The ZIF-8 coating provided shell porosity and enhanced \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction with the aromatic compounds. This led to the fast HPLC separation of the mixtures of aromatic compounds, with column efficiency reaching up to 19000 plates/m. Furthermore, the SOS@ZIF-8 microspheres could be transformed into SOS@ZnO upon thermal treatment in air. PXRD, SEM imaging, and ICP analysis confirmed a layer of crystalline ZnO at loading of 9.6% formed on the SOS spheres. Efficient photodegradation of methyl orange in water was demonstrated by SOS@ZnO microspheres, with easy removal of catalysts by gravimetric sedimentation and facile packing capability potentially allowing for continuous flow treatment.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "495", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}], "porosity": [{"proboe": "", "value": "0.19", "unit": "mL/g", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["surface_area", "porosity"]}, {"idx": 17, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(A) The SEM\nimage of the as-prepared SOS-SH particles before modification.
