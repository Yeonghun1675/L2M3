Single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that 1-Zn crystallizes in the space group C2/c. There are two crystallographically independent Zn2+ ions and two deprotonated obb2- ligands in each formula unit. Each V-shaped obb ligand connects two pairs of independent Zn2+ ions through two carboxylate ends. Two symmetry-related Zn2+ ions are bridged by four carboxylate groups of four obb ligands to form a common paddle wheel unit. Since each Zn2+ ion has square-pyramidal coordination geometry, its axial position is further coordinated by a solvent DMF molecule (Figure a). Because of the V-shaped nature of the obb linkers, they bridge the resulting Zn2(COO)4 units into a complicated three-dimensional network with very open channels along the c-axis (Figure b). The rhombic window of a channel consists of eight Zn2(COO)4 units and eight obb ligands, which shows a large dimension about 47.8 \u00d7 27.3 \u00c52. Such a framework can be topologically represented as a 4-connected pts net by reducing two kinds of Zn2(COO)4 units as two kinds of nodes and the obb ligands as the linkers (). Another Zn-obb compound MCF-22 has been reported previously, but MCF-22 possessed a distinct 4-connected lvt topological network. 3-Fold framework interpenetration is also found for this open structure of 1, but its whole structure still has channels with effective window size 7 \u00d7 8 \u00c52 along the c-axis (Figure b). The large free spaces in 1-Zn are occupied by coordinated DMF molecules and structural disordered solvent molecules. The void volumes of 1 with and without coordinating DMF molecules are 35.8% and 53.8%, respectively, as estimated by the PLATON program.\n\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) on the as-synthesized sample of 1-Zn indicated a weight loss of 30.85% in the temperature range 20-230 \u00b0C, which is consistent with the release of two coordinating DMF molecules and two DMF guest molecules (calc. 31.23%) per formula unit (). The TGA of the CH2Cl2-exchanged sample (1a-Zn) prepared by soaking 1-Zn in CH2Cl2 shows that all of the structural disordered guests can be completely exchanged by CH2Cl2. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of desolvated solid (1-Zn-ht), prepared by heating 1a-Zn at 100 \u00b0C for 8 h under vacuum, indicates that framework distort or structural transformation may occur, because the peaks are obviously changed as compared to that of the as-synthesized sample of 1-Zn (Figure ). Notably, the origin open structure of 1-Zn can be restored after 1-Zn-ht is reimmersed in DMF for one day, as evidenced by PXRD patterns. However, further gas sorption measurements reveal that 1-Zn-ht is hard to adsorb any gas, such as N2, H2, and CO2 (). The above results may conclude that compound 1-Zn is a flexible framework and tends to shrink without the sustainers.\n\nViewed from the TGA curve of 2, the first weight loss of 8.18% in the range of 25-230 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of one guest DMF molecule per formula unit (calc. 8.36%). No further weight loss is observed until 350 \u00b0C (). The guest-free compound (2-ht) underwent a minor structure change after evacuation at 150 \u00b0C under dynamic vacuum for 5 h, as confirmed by PXRD analysis (Figure ).\n\nTopological analysis indicates that one simple framework of 3 features an unusual binodal (4,6)-connected seh topology when the paddle-wheel units are simplified as 4-connected and 6-connected nodes, respectively (). Notably, if the 4,4'-bpy linkers are omitted, the simple Cu-obb framework has 4-connected lvt topology which is similar to MCF-22. It is clear now that this (4,6)-connected seh net can be derived from a lvt net through inserting additional linkers. Although 3-fold interpenetration is formed to avoid an extremely large void space, 3 still possesses a significant solvent accessible space. Actually, disordered DMF guest molecules were found in the irregular rectangular channels. The effective window size of each channel in 3 is 4 \u00d7 8 \u00c52, which is larger than that in 2. Taking into account the guest solvent molecules as well as the coordinated DMF molecules, the solvent-accessible volume in 3 is estimated to be 45.6% of the unit cell volume, among them 35.8% occupied by disordered DMF guest molecules.\n\nTGA of 3 reveals 24.17% weight loss from 25 to 260 \u00b0C (), which corresponds to the loss of all DMF molecules in the framework (calc. 24.31%). The host framework starts to decompose rapidly from 285 \u00b0C. The high eliminating temperature of DMF might be related to the cage-like cavity of the structure. For gas adsorption studies, the sample of 3 was completely exchanged by methanol, and the methanol-exchanged sample was further activated by heating at 100 \u00b0C for 8 h under vacuum, giving a hollow framework 3-ht. The PXRD pattern of 3-ht is coincident with that of the simulated pattern derived from the X-ray single-crystal raw data, which confirms that integrity of the framework is maintained upon solvent removal (Figure ). These results reveal that the framework structure of 3 becomes much rigid and stable under the help of additional 4,4'-bpy pillars.\n\nTo verify the porosity of solid 2-ht and 3-ht, gas sorption isotherms were measured with N2, H2, CO2, and CH4. Solid 3-ht adsorbs N2 to show a reversible type I isotherm, which indicates a permanent microporosity (Figure ). However, 2-ht does not sorption N2 because of the size-exclusion effect (N2 kinetic diameter: 3.6 \u00c5). Solid 3-ht shows N2 uptake of approximately 228 cm3\u22c5g-1 (STP) at 1 bar. The BET and Langmuir surface areas of 3-ht are estimated to be 829 m2\u22c5g-1 and 906 m2\u22c5g-1, respectively. Pore size distribution based on Horvath-Kawazoe (H-K) model gives a pore diameter of 9.0 \u00c5. The measured pore volume (0.337 cm3\u22c5g-1) from the N2 sorption was slightly higher than that (0.316 cm3\u22c5g-1) estimated from the single crystal structure, which indicated that the N2 molecules in the pore were compressed to a greater extent than in the liquid nitrogen at 77 K. \n\nTo further explore their potential properties on gas separation under ambient conditions, the adsorption isotherms of CO2, CH4, and N2 for 2-ht and 3-ht were measured. Under 273 K and 1 bar, 3-ht can hardly adsorb N2 (2.9 cm3\u22c5g-1) (Figure f), but the capacity of CO2 for 3-ht are 65.9 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 273 K and 36 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 298 K and that of 2-ht are 24 and 17 cm3\u22c5g-1, respectively (Figure a-c, e). The enthalpy of CO2 adsorption for 2-ht and 3-ht were estimated from the sorption isotherms at 273 and 298 K using the virial equation to understand the strong affinity toward CO2. At zero coverage, the enthalpy of CO2 adsorption is 26.5 kJ/mol for 2-ht and 21.3 kJ/mol for 3-ht. The higher enthalpy of CO2 adsorption for 2-ht can be attributed to its narrow pores. The initial slopes of the CO2 and N2 adsorption isotherms were calculated, and the ratios of these slopes were used to estimate the adsorption selectivity for CO2 over N2 (). From these data, the calculated CO2/N2 selectivity is 30:1 at 273 K. In addition, the capacity of 3-ht to adsorb CH4 is 19.2 cm3\u22c5g-1 (1.4 wt %) and much less than that of CO2 (65.9 cm3\u22c5g-1, 12.9 wt %) under the same conditions (Figure d), but at 72 bar, the uptake of CH4 can reach 125.4 cm3\u22c5g-1 (9.0 wt %, ).\n\nBoth H2 sorption isotherms at 77 and 87 K of 3-ht show type I behavior (Figure ). Note that the adsorption and desorption isotherm curves overlap with each other with no hysteresis and no noticeable change in the properties upon repeated cycling. At 77 K and 1 bar, solid 3-ht adsorbs H2 up to 150.4 cm3\u22c5g-1 (1.34 wt %). Under the same conditions, the fraction of the pore volume filled by liquid H2 (\u03c1H2 = 0.0708 g/cm3) at 1 atm and 77 K for 3-ht is 55.7%, notably higher than the corresponding values for MOF-5 (13.7%), IRMOF-2 (19.2%), IRMOF-6 (18.3%), IRMOF-11 (31.4%), IRMOF-13 (33.5%), and IRMOF-20 (12.5%) but lower than that of IRMOF-74 (64.1%). Moreover, the H2 adsorption enthalpy (Q st) calculated by the virial equation from the adsorption isotherms measured at 77 and 87 K is 7.0 kJ\u22c5mol-1. Because the H2 sorption isotherm of 3-ht is not fully saturated at 1 bar, a higher H2 sorption capacity may be expected under higher pressures.\n\nThe sorption isotherms of benzene and cyclohexane vapor for 3-ht also were measured at room temperature (Figure ). The amount of benzene adsorbed by 3-ht is 20.6 wt %, a value surpassing that of cyclohexane (14.9 wt %). Remarkable, large hysteresis loops without complete desorption were observed in the both sorption isotherms of benzene and cyclohexane. It is possible to physically lock (imprison or encapsulate) guest molecules in a cage-like container with a diameter of approximate 0.9 nm, inducing strong sorbate-sorbent interactions to incomplete desorption.
