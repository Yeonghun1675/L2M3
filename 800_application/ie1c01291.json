However, their shared selectivity for ethylene arises from two different mechanisms. CuBTC and Ni-MOF-74 have a large number of open metal sites that can form strong \u03c0-complexation interactions with unsaturated double bonds of ethylene, while 13X separates ethylene from ethane with its electropositive cations (Na+) that can form strong interactions with the unsaturated double bond of C2H4. To evaluate the dry and humid C2H4/C2H6 separation performance of these three materials, breakthrough experiments were conducted at 293 K and 1 bar. In agreement with literature results, all adsorbents were more selective for C2H4 than C2H6, as seen in . In all three breakthrough curves, the weakly binding adsorbate exits the column earlier than the strongly binding adsorbate. The rollup observed in the breakthrough curves was caused by the simultaneous adsorption of C2H4, promoting the forced desorption of C2H6 shown in .  shows that the dynamic adsorption capacity for ethylene in CuBTC (4.22 mmol/g) is higher than that of both Ni-MOF-74 (3.00 mmol/g) and 13X (1.79 mmol/g) at 1 bar (partial pressure of the C2H4/C2H6 gas mixture is 0.5 bar). This result is due to CuBTC having a higher surface area and pore volume than both Ni-MOF-74 and 13X. The breakthrough C2H4/C2H6 selectivity for each material was calculated as 1     S =     x   1       x   2     \u22c5     y   2       y   1        where S is the selectivity for component 1 over component 2, x is the adsorbed phase mole fraction, and y is the gas phase mole fraction.

Although CuBTC displayed the highest C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> capacity, its adsorption selectivity (2.3) is lower than\nthat of both Ni-MOF-74 (3.7) and 13X (5.3) due to a lower open-metal-site\ndensity (the percentage of sites with preferential adsorption of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> over C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>).

This essentially creates an isolated segment of the\nbed with only dry C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> separation happening. The selectivity increases in both Ni-MOF-74\nand CuBTC after humid breakthroughs might have been caused by a reduction\nin pore sizes after water adsorption. Since the molecular size of\nC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> is slightly smaller than that of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, the impact of pore size reduction on C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> adsorption is relatively smaller than that on\nC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>. A larger selectivity difference was observed\nfor Ni-MOF-74 than that for CuBTC because Ni-MOF-74 is comprised of\none-dimensional pore channels. As a result, the diffusion and adsorption\nof gas molecules in Ni-MOF-74 will be more affected by a pore size\nchange. Furthermore, due to the competitive adsorption of water, more\nC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> desorbed from the adsorption sites compared\nto that in the dry breakthrough, which can be observed from the area\ndifference of rollups of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> between dry and\nhumid breakthrough curves in .

However, their shared selectivity for ethylene arises from two different mechanisms. CuBTC and Ni-MOF-74 have a large number of open metal sites that can form strong \u03c0-complexation interactions with unsaturated double bonds of ethylene, while 13X separates ethylene from ethane with its electropositive cations (Na+) that can form strong interactions with the unsaturated double bond of C2H4. To evaluate the dry and humid C2H4/C2H6 separation performance of these three materials, breakthrough experiments were conducted at 293 K and 1 bar. In agreement with literature results, all adsorbents were more selective for C2H4 than C2H6, as seen in . In all three breakthrough curves, the weakly binding adsorbate exits the column earlier than the strongly binding adsorbate. The rollup observed in the breakthrough curves was caused by the simultaneous adsorption of C2H4, promoting the forced desorption of C2H6 shown in .  shows that the dynamic adsorption capacity for ethylene in CuBTC (4.22 mmol/g) is higher than that of both Ni-MOF-74 (3.00 mmol/g) and 13X (1.79 mmol/g) at 1 bar (partial pressure of the C2H4/C2H6 gas mixture is 0.5 bar). This result is due to CuBTC having a higher surface area and pore volume than both Ni-MOF-74 and 13X. The breakthrough C2H4/C2H6 selectivity for each material was calculated as 1     S =     x   1       x   2     \u22c5     y   2       y   1        where S is the selectivity for component 1 over component 2, x is the adsorbed phase mole fraction, and y is the gas phase mole fraction. Although CuBTC displayed the highest C2H4 capacity, its adsorption selectivity (2.3) is lower than that of both Ni-MOF-74 (3.7) and 13X (5.3) due to a lower open-metal-site density (the percentage of sites with preferential adsorption of C2H4 over C2H6). This result is consistent with previously reported data. \n\nHumid Ethylene/Ethane Separation and Water Vapor Adsorption\n\nDue to its high intrinsic polarity, water should bind to adsorbents more strongly than C2H4 and C2H6. As expected, C2H4 and C2H6 adsorption capacity decreased on CuBTC, Ni-MOF-74, and 13X after humid C2H4/C2H6 breakthrough experiments were conducted (). Despite these lower loadings, the selectivity of CuBTC actually increased from 2.3 to 2.6, and the selectivity of Ni-MOF-74 also increased from 3.7 to 5.4. Under both dry and humid feed conditions, no significant differences in the breakthrough time for C2H6 and C2H4 were observed. The most important factor is related to the fixed-bed behavior. As water molecules enter the fixed bed, they will be immediately adsorbed near the feed entrance. Due to the strong adsorption behavior, the water concentration front will move through the bed very slowly relative to the other components in the mixture (Figures S11 and S12), effectively allowing C2H4 and C2H6 to \"see\" a clean bed as both molecules travel ahead of the water. The behavior can be supported by the DeVault equation ()  2     w =   v   1 +  (   1 - \u03b5   \u03b5   )  f '  ( c )       where w is the wave velocity, v is the interstitial velocity, \u03f5 is the bed porosity, and f'(c) is the slope of the equilibrium isotherm at concentration c. As CuBTC, Ni-MOF-74, and 13X have favorable water adsorption isotherms ( and S13), f'(c) will be large at the low-concentration region, leading to a small wave velocity. This essentially creates an isolated segment of the bed with only dry C2H4/C2H6 separation happening. The selectivity increases in both Ni-MOF-74 and CuBTC after humid breakthroughs might have been caused by a reduction in pore sizes after water adsorption. Since the molecular size of C2H4 is slightly smaller than that of C2H6, the impact of pore size reduction on C2H4 adsorption is relatively smaller than that on C2H6. A larger selectivity difference was observed for Ni-MOF-74 than that for CuBTC because Ni-MOF-74 is comprised of one-dimensional pore channels. As a result, the diffusion and adsorption of gas molecules in Ni-MOF-74 will be more affected by a pore size change. Furthermore, due to the competitive adsorption of water, more C2H6 desorbed from the adsorption sites compared to that in the dry breakthrough, which can be observed from the area difference of rollups of C2H6 between dry and humid breakthrough curves in . Compared to CuBTC and MOF-74, zeolite 13X showed very different separation performances under dry and humid conditions. For zeolite 13X, the breakthrough time difference between C2H4 and C2H6 decreased from approximately 10 min/g (dry) to 5 min/g (humid), and the adsorption capacity of C2H4 dropped from 1.79 to 1.45 mmol/g. However, the C2H6 uptake slightly increased from 0.34 to 0.47 mmol/g because less-adsorbed C2H6 was desorbed during the competitive adsorption based on the area of the rollups of C2H6. Ultimately, the C2H4/C2H6 selectivity of 13X decreased from 5.3 to 3.1.\n\nThese conflicting separation performances may have been caused by their differing pore volumes and hydrophilicity. 13X has a smaller pore volume than CuBTC and Ni-MOF-74 (Table S1), which leads to a lower water uptake at the same relative humidity, as shown in . At 40% relative humidity, CuBTC, Ni-MOF-74, and 13X had water loadings of ~27, ~22, and ~11 mmol/g, respectively. Additionally, 13X has a smaller water capacity in the lower relative humidity regions compared to the other two materials. The water uptake of 13X at approximately 10% relative humidity is around 10 mmol/g, which is less than the 14 mmol/g adsorbed by CuBTC and the 20 mmol/g adsorbed by Ni-MOF-74. These results indicate that 13X has a lower water capacity than the other two MOFs. Based on the DeVault equation, f'(c) of 13X is smaller than that of CuBTC and Ni-MOF-74, and its wave velocity will be larger. Therefore, water molecules are allowed to travel a longer distance in the fixed bed with 13X. Subsequently, a greater bed length of 13X will be poisoned by water and lose the capability to separate C2H4 and C2H6. Although CuBTC has a higher water uptake than 13X (), the desorption isotherm demonstrates that there is a greater than 15 mmol/g difference between its water loadings at 5 and 20% relative humidity. This suggests that if ethylene is collected from CuBTC via pressure swing adsorption, a large amount of water will desorb with the ethylene. To remove the water from the high-purity ethylene, an additional drying step will be necessary.\n\nRecyclability and Stability\n\nThe humid breakthrough results demonstrate that C2H4 and C2H6 can still be separated under humid conditions due to the fixed-bed adsorption behavior of H2O. Additionally, as shown in , the recyclability and stability of these three materials were investigated to determine their feasibility for real applications.  shows that the adsorption capacities of C2H4 and C2H6 for CuBTC decreased after each humid breakthrough cycle (samples were heated and completely degassed before each cycle). The materials were also pre-exposed to 40% humidity for 24 h and then activated before humid breakthrough experiments. This time, the adsorption capacity of C2H4 and C2H6 decreased from 3.95 to 2.17 mmol/g and from 1.53 to 0.82 mmol/g, respectively, suggesting that CuBTC is not stable after exposure to water molecules. However, the selectivity of C2H4/C2H6 remained at approximately 2.6 even after the degradation of CuBTC. This may have occurred due to water now occupying the adsorption sites meant for C2H4 and C2H6, causing a reduction in the effective weight of the material. In contrast, Ni-MOF-74 and 13X showed much higher water vapor stability and recyclability than CuBTC. After 24 h of humid exposure and activation, the ethylene and ethane uptakes on Ni-MOF-74 only slightly decreased from 2.65 to 2.57 mmol/g and from 0.49 to 0.45 mmol/g, respectively. The high water vapor stability of Ni-MOF-74 aligns with previously reported results.
