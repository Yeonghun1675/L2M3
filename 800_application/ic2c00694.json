By comparison, MOF 2 was found to\nexhibit excellent storage capacity and obviously selective adsorption\nproperties. At 273 and 298 K under 1 atm, it takes up 49 and 33 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> of CO<sub>2</sub>, 14 and 4 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> of CH<sub>4</sub>, 108 and 78 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, 53 and\n39 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, and 63 and 39 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, respectively. From the structural analysis, MOF 2\nwith a smaller pore and larger specific surface area has more adsorption\npotential than does MOF 1. Compared to those of MOF 1, the high adsorption\nperformances of MOF 2 are attributed to the existence of \u03bc<sub>2</sub>-OH<sup>\u2013</sup> groups in the channel of the infinite\nextended {In-OH-In}<sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">n</italic>\n</sub> chain, so they are\nconducive to the formation of guest\u2013host or guest\u2013guest\ninteractions between sorbent and gas molecules. More importantly, a 5.6 \u00c5 square hole of MOF 2 may offer the\npotential to provide more suitable pore confinement effects, while\nMOF 1 has a large one-dimensional pore space (pore sizes of \u223c18.1\n\u00c5 \u00d7 \u223c16.6 \u00c5 and \u223c13.9 \u00c5 \u00d7 \u223c8.2\n\u00c5) that is not good for gas separation. Such a systematic difference\nin uptake capacity illustrates the potential of MOF 2 in the separation\nof flue gas and hydrocarbon mixtures under ambient conditions.

In this work, a plausible strategy involving solvent-induced effects and using the flexibility of the ligand conformation to make two In(III) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is developed, showing topological diversity and different stability. The X-shaped tetracarboxylic ligand H4TPTA ([1,1':3',1\"-terphenyl]-4,4',4\",6'-tetracarboxylic acid) was selected to construct two new heteroid In MOFs, namely, {[CH3NH3][In(TPTA)]\u22c52(NMF)} (MOF 1) and {[In2(TPTA)(OH)2]\u22c52(H2O)\u22c5(DMF)} (MOF 2). MOF 1 is a (4, 4)-connected net showing a pts topology with a large channel that is not conducive to fine gas separation. By contrast, with the reduction of SBU from uninucleated In to an {In-OH-In} n  chain, MOF 2 has a (4, 6)-connected net with the fsc topology with an ~5 \u00c5 suitable micropore to confine matching small gas. The permanent porosity of MOF 2 leads to the preferential adsorption of C2H2 over CO2 with superior C2H2/CH4 (332.3) and CO2/CH4 (31.2) separation selectivities. Meanwhile, the cycling dynamic breakthrough experiments showed that the high-purity C2H2 (>99.8%) capture capacities of MOF 2 were >1.92 mmol g-1 from a binary C2H2/CH4 mixture, and its separation factor reached 10.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nStructural Descriptions of MOF 1 and MOF 2\n\nSingle-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that MOF 1 and MOF 2 belong to totally different crystal systems and space groups: MOF 1 in the tetragonal crystal system in the I41/amd space group and MOF 2 in the orthorhombic crystal system in the Pbcm space group (Table S1). Different crystal building systems were attributed to different coordination models and configurational differences in their ligands. For MOF 1, its asymmetric unit contained one indium atom, one H4TPTA ligand, and one [CH3NH3]+ equilibrium charge ion (). Each deprotonated ligand coordinated with four mononuclear indiums in a bimonodentate fashion, which simplified to quadrilateral. Each mononuclear indium linked to six carboxylic acid O atoms from four ligands to form a tetrahedral geometry. Overall, the periodic connection created in the manner described above created a pts network structure with the maximal hexagon channel with a large pore window size of 18.1 \u00c5 \u00d7 16.6 \u00c5 viewed along the y axis (Figure S3). The Schlafli symbol is {42.84} in this (4, 4)-connected network. According to the calculation of PLATON software, the volume void rate reached 74.5% and the theoretical pore volume is 1.2 cm3 g-1.\n\nCharacterization of MOF 1 and MOF 2\n\nThe consistency of the experiment and analogous PXRD patterns indicated crystal products MOF 1 and MOF 2 with phase purity. The related basic characterization of MOF 1 was described previously. MOF 1 can retain its original structure in some organic solvents, but it is destroyed in water (Figure S1b). However, it has been confirmed by PXRD patterns that the crystallinity of MOF 2 can remain unchanged after immersion in aqueous HCl or NaOH solutions with pH values in the range of 3-12, showing high chemical stability (Figure S1d), which may be attributed to the stable indium cluster. Additionally, as shown in Figure S2, TGA of MOF 2 reveals that there are mainly two steps of weightlessness. The first step is ~14.4%, corresponding to the loss of solvent molecules (calculated as one DMF molecule and two water molecules). The second step is close to 36.7%, owing to the slow destruction of the skeleton when the temperature is >450 \u00b0C.\n\nGas Adsorption of MOF 1 and MOF 2\n\nConsidering the structural characteristics of MOF 1 and MOF 2 both with multiple channels, the pore properties and gas adsorption performance of these two MOFs were investigated. Unexpectedly, MOF 1 has negligible N2 adsorption at 77 K (uptake of approximately 28 cm3 g-1 and BET of just 55 m2 g-1). Moreover, at 195 K, the adsorption curves showed CO2 uptake of MOF 1 of only 20 cm3 g-1 at 100 kPa, corroborating weak interactions of CO2 (Figure S6a). As shown in Figure S6b, its crystallinity remains unchanged after the adsorption of CO2 at 195 K and N2 at 77 K, resulting in MOF 1 having low adsorption capacity that was not for structural collapse or shrinkage. This can also be demonstrated by other MOFs, such as [(CH3)2NH2][In(BDCPPI)]\u22c50.5DMF\u22c5H2O and JUC-210 with similar adsorption behaviors. By contrast, the N2 adsorption of MOF 2 at 77 K exhibited a typical reversible type I curve feature, with a maximum adsorption amount of N2 uptake of ~205 cm3 g-1 (). The relevant specific surface areas of BET and Langmuir are 631 and 658 m2 g-1, respectively. Furthermore, the pore size distributions of MOF 2 utilizing the DFT method reveal the presence of pore sizes centered at 5.6 and 7.8 \u00c5. In terms of the crystal structures of MOF 2, its pore volumes are calculated by PLATON to reach 0.35 cm3 g-1. This corresponded well with the pore volumes experimentally estimated on the basis of the N2 adsorption isotherms (0.3 cm3 g-1). Finally, the PXRD pattern of MOF 1 and MOF 2 after N2 gas adsorption retained the same crystallinity as the simulated form and their structures are still intact (Figure S6).\n\nTo further study the potential applications of MOF 1 and MOF 2 for gas capture and separation with different sizes or properties, the single-component gas adsorption isotherms of CO2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 were recorded (). For the case of MOF 1, the gas adsorption capacities of CO2 are only 21 and 15 cm3 g-1, those of CH4 9.9 and 6.0 cm3 g-1, those of C2H2 33 and 24 cm3 g-1, those of C2H4 21 and 15 cm3 g-1, and those of C2H6 17 and 11 cm3 g-1 at 273 and 298 K, respectively. By comparison, MOF 2 was found to exhibit excellent storage capacity and obviously selective adsorption properties. At 273 and 298 K under 1 atm, it takes up 49 and 33 cm3 g-1 of CO2, 14 and 4 cm3 g-1 of CH4, 108 and 78 cm3 g-1 of C2H2, 53 and 39 cm3 g-1 of C2H4, and 63 and 39 cm3 g-1 of C2H6, respectively. From the structural analysis, MOF 2 with a smaller pore and larger specific surface area has more adsorption potential than does MOF 1. Compared to those of MOF 1, the high adsorption performances of MOF 2 are attributed to the existence of \u03bc2-OH- groups in the channel of the infinite extended {In-OH-In} n  chain, so they are conducive to the formation of guest-host or guest-guest interactions between sorbent and gas molecules. More importantly, a 5.6 \u00c5 square hole of MOF 2 may offer the potential to provide more suitable pore confinement effects, while MOF 1 has a large one-dimensional pore space (pore sizes of ~18.1 \u00c5 \u00d7 ~16.6 \u00c5 and ~13.9 \u00c5 \u00d7 ~8.2 \u00c5) that is not good for gas separation. Such a systematic difference in uptake capacity illustrates the potential of MOF 2 in the separation of flue gas and hydrocarbon mixtures under ambient conditions. Furthermore, C2H2 adsorption on MOF 2 was carried out five times at 298 K, and their maximum uptakes are close to that of the pristine sample, which confirmed its stability and reproducibility (Figure S6c,d). It can be stable after gas cycling and can maintain the integrity of crystallinity in air.\n\nTo gauge the binding affinity of the framework-gas interaction, the Q st values were calculated using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation applied to the single-component gas adsorption isotherms (f and Figure S5). At zero coverage, the Q st values of C2H2, CO2, and CH4 for MOF 1 are determined to be 45.7, 33.4, and 10.6 kJ mol-1, respectively. For MOF 2, the Q st values of C2H2, CO2, and CH4 are 49.8, 33.0, and 17.0 kJ mol-1, respectively. Compared with MOF 1, active O sites and pore size matching regulated by a one-dimensional chain slightly increased Q st values for MOF 2, which are consistent with the higher adsorption at low pressure and higher selectivity, indicating a stronger affinity for MOF 2 and gas. Among the rest, the Q st of C2H2 for MOF 2 (49.8 kJ mol-1) is much higher than the other values reported for In-based MOFs, such as [In2(L)(OH)2]\u22c52DMF\u22c52H2O (32 kJ mol-1), BUT-70B (27 kJ mol-1), and ZJNU-115 (29 kJ mol-1). It manifests that the smaller pore size results in the reinforced overlapped potential for C2H2 adsorption. Notably, huge discrepancies between Q st values for C2H2 and CH4 suggest that MOF 2 will promise good performance for C2H2/CH4 separation.
