Therefore, bio-MOF-1&[Ru(phen)3]2+ possesses the highest efficiency of 1O2 generation among the three composites. Furthermore, the singlet oxygen quantum yields (\u03a6\u0394) from these bio-MOF-1&RCs, an important parameter for characterization of the efficiency of a triplet PS to produce 1O2 upon photoexcitation, were measured using DPBF as an 1O2 indicator. The \u03a6\u0394 values of bio-MOF-1&[Ru(bpy)3]2+, bio-MOF-1&[Ru(phen)3]2+, and bio-MOF-1&[Ru(phen)2hipp]2+ were determined to be 0.86, 0.34, and 0.32, respectively, using [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as the standard (Figure S6), whose \u03a6\u0394 was 0.81 in methanol. The singlet oxygen \u03a6\u0394 of bio-MOF-1&[Ru(bpy)3] is higher in comparison to those of some photosensitizers such as protoporphyrin IX (\u03a6\u0394 = 0.56), tetraphenylporphyrine (\u03a6\u0394 = 0.63), methylene blue (\u03a6\u0394 = 0.55), rose bengal (\u03a6\u0394 = 0.68), porphyrin derivatives (\u03a6\u0394 = 0.45), and quantum dot photosensitizers (\u03a6\u0394 = 0.43). By contrast, due to the low Ru content of bio-MOF-1&[Ru(phen)3]2+ and bio-MOF-1&[Ru(phen)2hipp]2+, the \u03a6\u0394 values of the two samples are relatively low. However, their \u03a6\u0394 values are still considerably higher compared to those of some newly designed photosensitizers classified to clinical trials such as motexafin lutetium (\u03a6\u0394 = 0.23). A more intuitive contrast of the 1O2 generation efficiency of the three composites is shown in e. These results show that bio-MOF-1&RCs can efficiently generate 1O2 via SPA. The bio-MOF-1 could serve as a \"cage\" to protect the RCs and block the aggregation of RC molecules. Moreover, the porous matrix structure increases the chance of an RC molecule being exposed to molecular oxygen (Figure S7), which is conducive to the energy transfer from the RCs to 3O2.
