The different morphologies of MOF-AgNC nanocomposites lead to different CO2 reduction products, which is due to the inconsistency of the CO2 reduction reaction environment on the AgNC surfaces. The difference in the AgNC reaction environment is caused by the different surface chemistry of AgNCs (core-shell MOF-AgNC: MOF and corner MOF-shell: MOF+MPA, which can be confirmed by observing the difference in the relative Raman signals intensity, as shown in D). The interaction of CO2 and the silver surface leads to the generation of different intermediates and final products during CO2 reduction, which has been demonstrated in pristine silver nanoparticles. Compared with pristine silver nanoparticles, the MOF-AgNC nanocomposite can not only improve the reaction rate (increasing CO2 adsorption) but also enhance the selectivity of products (the pristine AgNC: a mixture of CO and HCOOH; the core-shell MOF-AgNC nanocomposite is dominated by CO formation, and the corner MOF-AgNC nanocomposite is dominated by HCOOH formation).", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 16, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig5\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>5</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Corner MOF-AgNC\nnanocrystals acted as photocatalysts for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction\nunder the plasmon-induced electromagnetic field.\n(A) Extinction spectrum of core\u2013shell nanocrystals on the PS\nmatrix.

With irradiation assistance, the CO2 concentration decreased with the reaction time and was accompanied by an increase in the HCOO- concentration. The changes in CO2 and HCOO- concentrations became more obvious with the increase of irradiation intensity as shown in D and Supporting Information Figures S16-S20 and Table S5. Moreover, the HCOOH generated by the CO2 reduction reaction also exhibited a first-order reaction (ln(I'/I' t = 0) had a linear relationship with t), as shown in E. However, the reaction rate (rate constant K) of the CO2 reduction reaction on the corner MOF-AgNC nanocomposite was faster than that on core-shell MOF-AgNC, which should be due to the lower product diffusion resistance (uncoated AgNCs) on corner MOF-AgNC than that on core-shell MOF-AgNC.
