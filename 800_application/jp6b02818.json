Herein, molybdenum polysulfide (MoS x ) anchored on a porous Zr-metal organic framework (Zr-MOF, UiO-66-NH2) by chemical interactions is fabricated by a facile and one-pot solvothermal method for HER application. The distinctive design of the Zr-MOF stabilized MoS x  composite enables remarkable electrochemical HER activity with a Tafel slope of 59 mV\u22c5dec-1, a lower onset potential of nearly 125 mV, and a cathode current of 10 mA\u22c5cm-2 at an overpotential of 200 mV, which also exhibits excellent durability in an acid medium. The superior HER performance should ascribe to the fast electron transport from the less conducting MoS x  nanosheets to the electrode, high effective surface area, and number of active sites, as well as the favorable delivery for local protons in the porous Zr-MOF structure during the electrocatalytic reaction. Thus, this work paves a potential pathway for designing efficient Mo-based HER electrocatalysts by the combination of molybdenum polysulfide and versatile proton-conductive MOFs.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nStructural and Compositional Characterization\n\nThe crystallinity and phase purity of as-synthesized samples were examined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) (A). The UiO-66-NH2 exhibits a typical Fm3m symmetric space group. The peaks at 7.3\u00b0 and 8.5\u00b0 are attributed to the crystal planes (111) and (200) of UiO-66-NH2. Although the crystallinity decreases gradually with increasing Mo loading, all of the as-prepared UiO-66-NH2-Mo-x exhibit the characteristic diffraction peaks of UiO-66-NH2, indicating that the framework integrity of the parent MOFs is well preserved after anchoring MoS x . Notably, the crystallinity and structure on UiO-66-NH2-Mo-5 after a long treatment in ethanol at 60 \u00b0C are well preserved, suggesting no effects on the structure by ethanol washing (Figure S1, bottom), which agrees well with the results on UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2 treated with various solvents in the previous reports. Furthermore, no characteristic peaks of MoS x  are observed in UiO-66-NH2-Mo-x. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of the UiO-66-NH2 show a typical type I shape with characteristics of microporous materials in B. The UiO-66-NH2 possesses a Langmuir surface area of ca. 1339 m2/g (BET, 1021 m2/g) and pore volume of 0.422 cm3/g via the SF method with a micropore size of 1.34 nm. With the addition of (NH4)2MoS4, the as-prepared UiO-66-NH2-Mo-5 presents the mixed type of I and IV of adsorption isotherms with the Langmuir surface area of ca. 451 m2/g (BET surface, 335 m2/g) and a pore volume of 0.131 cm3/g with a micropore size of 1.25 nm. Notably, the UiO-66-NH2-Mo-5 also shows the narrow mesopore size distribution plots calculated by the BJH method with 3.3-4.2 nm (inset of B). The surface area and pore size distribution data support the occupation of the cages and the channel surface modification of UiO-66-NH2 by MoS x  nanoparticles, implying the incorporation of MoS x  into the UiO-66-NH2.\n\nThe Zr and Mo/Zr contents are evaluated through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in UiO-66-NH2 and UiO-66-NH2-Mo-5 (A), which shows two main weight-loss stages. For UiO-66-NH2, the weight loss of 8.9% in the first stage (~150 \u00b0C) is attributed to the release of H2O and DMF molecules, while the high weight loss of 20.8% for UiO-66-NH2-Mo-5 may be ascribed to the release of H2O and DMF molecules, as well as partial oxidation of MoS x  in the air. During the second stage (~800 \u00b0C), the weight losses of 49.9% and 47.3% are attributed to the decomposition of the ligands in the frameworks and total oxidation of MoS x . The remaining weights of 31.9% and 41.2% should be corresponding to the percentage of ZrO2 and the hybrids of ZrO2/MoO3 for UiO-66-NH2 and UiO-66-NH2-Mo-x, respectively. The Raman spectrum confirms the presence of bridging S2 2- ligands in the UiO-66-NH2-Mo-5 in B. No peak is observed over the UiO-66-NH2 in the range of 200-700 cm-1, whereas the UiO-66-NH2-Mo-5 displays broad bands at 330, 450, and 552 cm-1. The broad bands at 330 and 450 cm-1 should ascribe to Mo-S vibration with the presence of bridging S2 2- ligands, while the band at 552 cm-1 confirms the characteristic S-S vibration of bridging S2 2- ligands, further demonstrating the amorphous MoS x .\n\nElectrocatalytic Activity and Stability toward HER\n\nThe HER polarization curves of as-prepared samples and commercial Pt/C in 0.5 M H2SO4 are shown in A. As expected, Pt/C exhibits the highest HER electrocatalytic activity with near-zero onset potential. To investigate the effect of MoS2- and NH2-functionalized MOFs on the HER activity, control experiments of bulk MoS2 and pure UiO-66-NH2 were performed under the same conditions (A and Figure S6), which demonstrates the negligible HER activity in UiO-66-NH2 and bulk MoS2, respectively. After anchoring MoS x , the UiO-66-NH2-Mo-x are highly active toward HER. The UiO-66-NH2-Mo-5 exhibits the best performance with a lower onset potential of nearly 120 mV, beyond which cathodic current rises rapidly to 10 mA\u22c5cm-2 at 200 mV. In contrast, it needs an overpotential of 235, 223, and 213 mV to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for UiO-66-NH2-Mo-x with x = 0.1, 0.3, and 0.6, respectively. More importantly, the UiO-66-NH2-Mo-5 in an acidic medium shows comparable current density (10 mA\u22c5cm-2) at the overpotential of 200 mV with the most of nonprecious HER electrocatalysts reported up to date (Table S2), such as amorphous MoS x , MoS3/CNT, MoS2/3D-NPC, Ni-MoS2, NiMoN x /C, Co-NRCNTs, polymolybdate-based MOF, Ni-S/NU-1000, and Cu-MOF/8 wt % GO. We also investigate the HER performance on the UiO-66-Mo-5 as control sample (Figure S7), which shows inferior HER performance than that of UiO-66-NH2-Mo-5, exhibiting higher onset potential (~160 mV) and higher potential (~230 mV) to reach 10 mA\u22c5cm-2. Although we lack specific insight into about how the -NH2 group might assist MoS x  in catalyzing the HER by improving the electron and proton transfer, we reason that the -NH2 group in UiO-66-NH2 plays an important role in facilitating proton transport from bulk solution toward the edge active sites of MoS x  particles, which may significantly improve the HER activity. Cao et al. proposed that a large number of N-H moieties should be available to participate in the HER reaction mechanism. The Grotthuss mechanism should be followed during the proton transfer in NH2-functionalized UiO-66 by the protons hopping forward along the hydrogen bonding networks formed by the functional groups, adsorbed water molecules, and oxygen-rich Zr6O4(OH)4(CO2)12 clusters in aqueous acid solutions. \n\nStability is another significant criterion to evaluate an advanced electrocatalyst. The accelerated degradation measurements are performed by continuous cyclic voltammetry (CV) sweeps between -0.3 and +0.2 V vs RHE at 50 mV\u22c5s-1 in an acidic environment. As shown in B, a negligible difference can be observed between the curves measured at the initial cycle and after 5000 CV sweeps. The long-term stability of this electrode is also assessed by prolonged electrolysis at a constant overpotential of 200 mV (inset of B). The current density generally remains stable over 7 h with small degradation, corroborating the good stability in an acidic environment, which was also observed on NU-1000_Ni-S for HER in 0.5 M H2SO4. The UiO-66-NH2-Mo-5 also contains -COOH and -NH2 functional groups as NU-1000_Ni-S electrocatalysts, which could play the same roles as NU-1000_Ni-S in HER. The high stability of the present UiO-66-NH2-Mo-5 in the electrocatalyitc experiment could hint at no significant change of the electronic structure, although in the absence of the direct evidence of XPS and XRD, which are difficult to carry out because of the tiny amount of the catalyst after reaction. The morphology of the UiO-66-NH2-Mo-5 after the reaction is generally retained, as indicated by HRTEM measurement (Figure S9), which further confirms the superior stability. The excellent activity and high stability in acid solution make it a promising candidate for HER.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "molybdenum polysulfide (MoSx) anchored on a porous Zr-metal organic framework (Zr-MOF, UiO-66-NH2)", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "Tafel slope", "value": "59", "unit": "mV\u00b7dec-1", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "onset potential", "value": "125", "unit": "mV", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "cathode current", "value": "10", "unit": "mA\u00b7cm-2", "condition": "at an overpotential of 200 mV"}, {"property name": "crystallinity", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "phase purity", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "surface area", "value": "1339", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": "UiO-66-NH2"}, {"property name": "pore volume", "value": "0.422", "unit": "cm3/g", "condition": "UiO-66-NH2"}, {"property name": "micropore size", "value": "1.34", "unit": "nm", "condition": "UiO-66-NH2"}, {"property name": "surface area", "value": "451", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": "UiO-66-NH2-Mo-5"}, {"property name": "pore volume", "value": "0.131", "unit": "cm3/g", "condition": "UiO-66-NH2-Mo-5"}, {"property name": "micropore size", "value": "1.25", "unit": "nm", "condition": "UiO-66-NH2-Mo-5"}, {"property name": "Zr content", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "Mo/Zr content", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "weight loss", "value": "8.9", "unit": "%", "condition": "UiO-66-NH2"}, {"property name": "weight loss", "value": "20.8", "unit": "%", "condition": "UiO-66-NH2-Mo-5"}, {"property name": "weight loss", "value": "49.9", "unit": "%", "condition": "UiO-66-NH2"}, {"property name": "weight loss", "value": "47.3", "unit": "%", "condition": "UiO-66-NH2-Mo-x"}, {"property name": "Raman spectrum", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "HER polarization curves", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "HER electrocatalytic activity", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "HER performance", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "HER stability", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "morphology", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["etc"]}, {"idx": "23, 26, 28", "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<title>Mechanism of HER at the UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub>-Mo-<italic>x</italic> Composites</title><p>To get further insight\ninto the activity of as-synthesized UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub>-Mo-5 toward\nHER, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis is also\nperformed in A.
