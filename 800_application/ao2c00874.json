The enhanced fluorescence intensity displayed two linear relationships at two concentration areas from 1.0 to 10.0 ng mL-1 and from 20.0 to 80.0 ng mL-1 (inset of ). The fitted linear equations would be expressed as F/F 0 = 0.0352 [Cimetidine] + 0.9611 (r 2 = 0.9922), F/F 0 = 0.012 [Cimetidine] + 1.1794 (r 2 = 0.9912), and the results show a good linear relationship.\n\nLimit of detection (3Sd/K) was calculated based on the standard deviation (Sd) of 10 times measuring of F 0 and the slope (K) of the calibration graph. The limit of quantification (10Sd/K) was also evaluated by the above assumptions. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) is 0.31 and 1.05 ng mL-1. The precision is stated as the relative standard deviation (RSD) for two concentrations of cimetidine (7 and 60 ng mL-1). Their RSD were, respectively, obtained 4.1 and 3.2% for 10 replicate measurements.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn summary, a new zinc-tetracarboxylate MOF was synthesized via in situ ligand formation by the solvothermal reaction. The synthesized MOF reveals a three-dimensional structure with open rhomboidal channels. The channels were occupied by the guest solvent molecules. The compound acts as an effective room-temperature fluorescent sensor for selective and sensitive detection of cimetidine. The fluorescence response of the sensor was enhanced in the presence of various concentrations of cimetidine (on-mode). The phenomenon was investigated by FE-SEM, DLS, and EDX mapping analyses. Based on these findings, this luminescence turn-on sensor illustrates good sensitivity and selectivity over two linear ranges of 1.0-10.0 and 20.0-80.0 ng mL-1, respectively. The LOD and LOQ are calculated to be 0.31 and 1.05 ng mL-1, respectively. Further, the proposed sensor has been successfully conducted for cimetidine detection in the human plasma, urine, commercial ampule, and tablet. The applicability of the sensor was established using the obtained good recovery percentages. Considering the simplicity of the operation methodology, the current method is recommended to be applied for typical routine analysis. This work suggests a new strategy that may open a new level of interest in MOF-based sensors for on-site and real-time analytical detection of drugs in pharmaceutical factories and medical laboratories.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "Zn-MOF", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "320", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "departure of two coordinated
