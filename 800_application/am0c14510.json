For MOF 1 electrode, the XPS spectrum of S 2p for the pristine crystals is shown in a. The peaks of S 2p1/2 at 165.1 eV and S 2p3/2 at 163.9 and 161.9 eV correspond to the existence of S2-. Two peaks at 164.5 and 162.6 eV for the fully discharged state (b) and 164.3 and 162.8 eV for the fully charged state (c) indicate the presence of S2- state during the discharge/charge process. The new strong peak at 168.9 eV for the discharged state and charged state originates from positively charged sulfur species. Because the discharge/charge process is in the range of 0.01-3 V vs Li+/Li that is below the oxidation potential of the TTF moiety (3.7 V vs Li+/Li) and the cell is tightly sealed under inert condition, the TTF should not be oxidized. Considering that the electron cloud density of the S atom is high, the positive lithium ions could be accumulated around the S atom. Therefore, the new peak could be attributed to the electron-withdrawing effect of the lithium ions on the S atoms. For the fully charged state, some Li+ ions are reduced to metal Li and the intensity of the new peak is subsequently decreased, which is verified by the fact that the intensity of the new peak for the fully charged state (c) is weaker than that for the fully discharged state (b). The result illustrates that the sulfur atoms of the TTF moiety are the active centers for LIBs. The C 1s spectrum for the pristine crystals is shown in d. The peak at 285.8 eV is correlated with the C-S bond and it appears at 286.4 eV for the fully discharged state (e) and the charged state (f), which indicates the existence of the C-S bond during the discharge/charge process. The peak at ~290.4 eV is ascribed to the chemical bond of -C-F which comes from the binder of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF).

The twofold TTF pillar also plays a key role in the discharge/charge process. In addition, the performances of a full cell with the LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC 622) cathode and MOF 1 anode were also tested. The full cell delivered the capacity of 131.9 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 with the Coulombic efficiency of 99.45% after 70 cycles and exhibited a good rate performance with a specific capacity of 45.1 mA h g-1 at a high charge rate of 4 A g-1. Based on our knowledge, full cells with MOF-based electrodes have been scarcely reported. It is a new MOF system for LIBs with pristine MOF materials.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nSynthesis and Characterization of 1 and 2 \n\nCompounds 1 and 2 were synthesized by the solvothermal reactions at 120 \u00b0C. SEM images of crystals of 1 and 2 are shown in Figure S1. The yields of the crystals reached more than 40% through optimizing the ratios of the reactants and the solvents. The yields are high in comparison with those of the other TTF-metal complexes, which allow us to explore the electrochemical energy storage properties directly using crystal samples. By adjusting the volume and proportion of the mixed solvents, compounds 1 and 2 were obtained with the same two metal centers Zn(II) and two BDC ligands but with two py-TTF-py in 1 and one py-TTF-py in 2 (discussed below). The cocrystallized solvent molecules were determined using PLATON/SQUEEZE program, elemental analysis, and thermoanalytical measurements. The squeeze results are attached at the end of the cif files. Crystals of 1 and 2 are insoluble in common organic solvents. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the microcrystal samples for 1 and 2 agree with those simulated from the data of single-crystal analysis, revealing their crystalline phase purity (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves of 1 and 2 (Figure S3) reveal that the first step lost all lattice water molecules (for 1, 1.48%, calcd 1.34%, and for 2, 3.86%, calcd 3.88%), and the second step lost the cocrystallized DMF molecules (for 1, 10.62%, calcd 10.91%, and for 2, 8.06%, calcd 7.88%). Then, the third weight loss happen at 316 \u00b0C for 1 and at 350 \u00b0C for 2 because of the decomposition of organic ligands, which means that the frameworks of 1 and 2 begin to damage at this stage. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area measurement for N2 adsorption is presented in Figure S4 indicating that the most pore sizes of 1 and 2 are in the range of 2-10 nm.\n\nElectrochemical Performance\n\nTwo-electrode CR2032 coin-cell LIBs using the as-synthesized crystals of 1 and 2 as the active material of the anode were fabricated and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements were carried out. The voltage window of 0.01-3.0 V was selected as the operation condition. The electrochemical behaviors of 1 and 2 electrodes were first studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s-1 and the results for the first 3 cycles are illustrated in . For 1 electrode, a well-defined cathodic peak at about 0.75 V in the first cycle is observed and that is shifted to the positive direction (0.85 V) in the subsequent scans, which is associated with the formation of a solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) film and might be related to some activation processes for the Li-ion insertion during the first cycle. A broad peak is located at 1.12 V in the first anodic scan. The peaks after the initial scans are almost overlapped, indicating the occurrence of similar reactions during the charge/discharge processes and the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Electrode 2 exhibits an analogous redox behavior with 1.\n\nThe charge/discharge profiles of 1 anode for cycle numbers of 1, 2, 4, 40, and 150 at a current density of 0.2 C (1 C = 1000 mA g-1) are displayed in a. There is no plateau at around 2.5 V for the initial cycles, which is in accordance with the CV profiles. The plateau at around 2.5 V appears along with the cycling number. The first discharge and charge capacities of 1 were 1368.5 and 500.6 mA h g-1, which obtained an initial Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 36.6%. The low initial irreversible capacity is principally ascribed to the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and interfacial lithium storage. The conductive agent (Super P) is responsible for part of the irreversible capacity. The strong electrostatic interaction between the Li+ and the electron-rich conjugated TTF moiety formed during the first discharge also contribute to the irreversibly \"captured\" Li+. Therefore, less Li+ could be extracted out during initial charge. The discharge capacity of 1 decreased to 580.9 mA h g-1 in the second cycle and quickly increased from the third cycle. The capacity reached 909.2 mA h g-1 in the 40th cycle and then increased slowly to 1117.4 mA h g-1 in the 150th cycle. This increase is attributed to the capacitive behavior of the anode resulting in adsorption of a lot of ions when the electrolyte permeates into the bulk along with the cycling number. The capacitive and diffusive contribution can be calculated using equation 1 shown in the Supporting Information and the results (Figure S5) indicated that the charge storage is mainly capacitive. The porous materials are inclined to present this behavior. The initial discharge and charge capacities of 2 at a current density of 80 mA g-1 were 1469.4 and 480.5 mA h g-1, which obtained an initial Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 32.7%. The discharge capacity decreased to 620.1 mA h g-1 in the second cycle (b). Similar to MOF-1, the plateau at around 2.5 V does not appear for the initial cycles and gradually appears along with the cycling number.\n\nThe cycling performances of 1 and 2 anodes were investigated at a current density of 0.2 C. As shown in c, 1 anode presents a good cycling stability with high reversible capacity. Even after 150 cycles, 1 electrode still maintained the discharge and charge capacities of 1117.4 and 1096.6 mA h g-1 and the Coulombic efficiency maintained 98.7%. It should be noted that such a high reversible capacity and stability have never been previously reported for the MOFs-based anode materials (Table S1). Furthermore, after the first initial cycles, the average Coulombic efficiency maintained 99.60% for cycles from the 5th to 150th, and the nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency indicates that the SEI film is stable and side reactions are minimal. The cycling performance of 2 shown in d is tested after the electrode activation at 0.05 C for the first 5 cycles and at 0.1 C for the second 5 cycles. After the former 10th cycle activation at low current density, the discharge capacity of 2 at 0.2 C is 453.4 mA h g-1 and reached 765.7 mA h g-1 in the 35th cycle. The discharge and charge capacities of 2 maintained 621.3 and 613.0 mA h g-1 after repetitive discharging/charging to 70 cycles and the average Coulombic efficiency is about 100% for cycles from the 5th to 70th, indicating a reversible capacity.", "data": ["This model's maximum context length is 4097 tokens.
