Initially, the first step led\nto a steep increase in <italic>n</italic>-hexane uptake in the pressure\nrange of 0.00\u20131.61 mbar with an uptake of 33.0 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, accompanied by the observed second step with an uptake of 102.6\ncm<sup>3</sup>/g at 17.76 mbar. As the pressure further increased,\nrapid uptake of <italic>n</italic>-hexane occurred in the following\nnarrow pressure range. This phenomenon implies that, after the <italic>n</italic>-hexane molecules were adsorbed into the hexagonal mesopores\nduring the second step, the accommodated <italic>n</italic>-hexane\nmolecules led to the hexagonal mesopores in NU-1008 structure narrowing\ninto micropores, giving rise to a sharp filling that is characteristic\nof a micropore in the third step, resulting in the almost complete\noccupation of the NU-1008 framework with a final uptake of 140.7 cm<sup>3</sup>/g at 20.64 mbar.</p><title>Dynamic Adsorption of 2-Chloroethyl\nEthyl Sulfide under Dry\nand Humid Conditions</title><p>Due to the high toxicities of CWAs,\nMOFs have been designed as efficient adsorbents for high uptake of\nthese toxic compounds.

Only small desorbed percentages of\n5.0 and 4.3% were observed for NU-600 and NU-1008, respectively, attributed\nto strong adsorption in the MOFs.

A contributing factor of high loading of an analyte\nin MOFs is strong interactions between the analyte and the MOF framework,\nwhich can also lead to lower desorbed amounts due to the higher energy\ncosts of desorption.

Due to the\nweaker interactions of CEES\u2013CEES as compared to CEES\u2013MOF,\nit is easier to desorb more.

The permanent porosity of NU-500 was first evaluated by N2 sorption; however, almost no N2 uptake was observed at 77 K (Figure S31), likely due to the contraction of the framework after the desolvation by thermal activation. Based on the crystal structure, PLATON calculation revealed that the free volume of NU-500 was 13676 \u00c53 per unit cell (60% void space in the unit cell, compared with the unit cell volume of 22847 \u00c53). As a result, its theoretical pore volume was calculated to be 0.56 cm3/g. Due to the negligible N2 uptake of NU-500, the permanent porosity of NU-500 was attained by CO2 adsorption at 195 K (Figure S32), thanks to the enhanced molecular interactions arising from the quadrupole moment of CO2 and its smaller kinetic diameter compared to N2. The CO2 sorption isotherm showed a type I isotherm, indicating microporosity. The saturated uptake of CO2 at P/P 0 = 0.90 reached 53 cm3/g, and the surface area and pore volume were 140 m2/g and 0.03 cm3/g; the pore volume was much lower than the theoretical pore volume, meaning only a small amount of porosity was accessed. Water is a strong polar molecule, and its sorption isotherm was also collected to confirm the porosity of NU-500 (Figure S33). NU-500 showed a high water uptake of up to 200 cm3/g at P/P 0 = 0.92 and 298 K. Considering the theoretical porosity, neither CO2 nor water was able to completely reverse the structure of the closed phase. NU-600 and NU-1008 (a,c) both showed type IV isotherms, indicative of hierarchically porous structures with both micropores and mesopores, while a type I isotherm was observed for NU-906 (b), confirming its microporous structure. The calculated BET areas were 1190, 1120, and 1390 m2/g for NU-600, NU-906, and NU-1008, respectively. Pore size distributions based on DFT indicated micropores at 10.9 \u00c5 for NU-906 (e), hierarchically porous structures with micropores at 11.8 \u00c5 and mesopores at 20.0 \u00c5 for NU-600 (d), and micropores at 11.8 \u00c5 and mesopores at 29.5 \u00c5 for NU-1008 (f). The total pore volumes were 0.69, 0.45, and 0.92 cm3/g for NU-600, NU-906, and NU-1008, respectively.\n\nAdsorption of n-Hexane\n\nOwing to their high porosities, MOFs have been widely utilized as adsorbents for high gas uptakes. In this work, n-hexane was examined as the probe vapor to investigate the adsorption performance of the Zr-based MOFs with different pore volumes and sizes at 298 K. The structure of n-hexane resembles the linear alkyl chain of sulfur mustard (HD), a chemical warfare agent (CWA). Although n-hexane may have different adsorption behaviors, we utilized it as a simplified mimic of HD for understanding the adsorption of the more complex CWA. Since activated NU-500 had small pores, the saturated uptake of n-hexane was only 5.2 cm3/g at 180 mbar (P/P 0 = 1) (Figure S34); therefore, we excluded NU-500 from the comparison with the other three MOFs. As illustrated in a, the adsorption-desorption isotherms of n-hexane on NU-600, NU-906, and NU-1008 at 298 K exhibited different adsorption behaviors without hysteresis loops, indicating the robust nature of the frameworks. At 180 mbar, the saturated uptakes of n-hexane were 103.5, 79.7, and 167.7 cm3/g for NU-600, NU-906, and NU-1008, respectively. The isotherm of NU-906 showed a type I feature with steep uptake of n-hexane at a relatively low pressure (b), demonstrating strong guest--framework interactions between n-hexane and NU-906, due to van der Waals forces. Notably, NU-906 reached saturation at 2.50 mbar and adsorbed 55.6 cm3/g n-hexane, which was attributed to the presence of rhombic micropores in the NU-906 structure. The amount adsorbed of 79.7 cm3/g at 180 mbar gave a micropore volume of 0.44 cm3/g converted based on the Gurvich rule, which is close to the experimental pore volume (0.45 cm3/g) based on N2 adsorption at 77 K. In contrast, NU-600 and NU-1008 displayed distinct stepwise adsorption behaviors toward n-hexane (b). For NU-600, the isotherm of n-hexane clearly exhibited two steps. The first step up to 0.96 mbar adsorbed 19.9 cm3/g, due to the inclusion of n-hexane into the intrinsic micropores. The second step occurred with continuous increase of the pressure from 0.96 to 7.94 mbar, accompanied by further increase in n-hexane uptake, which was attributed to the continuous filling of n-hexane into the mesopore structure in NU-600. Although both NU-600 and NU-1008 are hierarchically porous structures with micropores and mesopores, NU-1008 has larger mesopores of 29.5 \u00c5 compared to those of NU-600 (20.0 \u00c5). As a result, NU-1008 displayed an interesting adsorption behavior toward n-hexane with three steps. Initially, the first step led to a steep increase in n-hexane uptake in the pressure range of 0.00-1.61 mbar with an uptake of 33.0 cm3/g, accompanied by the observed second step with an uptake of 102.6 cm3/g at 17.76 mbar. As the pressure further increased, rapid uptake of n-hexane occurred in the following narrow pressure range. This phenomenon implies that, after the n-hexane molecules were adsorbed into the hexagonal mesopores during the second step, the accommodated n-hexane molecules led to the hexagonal mesopores in NU-1008 structure narrowing into micropores, giving rise to a sharp filling that is characteristic of a micropore in the third step, resulting in the almost complete occupation of the NU-1008 framework with a final uptake of 140.7 cm3/g at 20.64 mbar.\n\nDynamic Adsorption of 2-Chloroethyl Ethyl Sulfide under Dry and Humid Conditions\n\nDue to the high toxicities of CWAs, MOFs have been designed as efficient adsorbents for high uptake of these toxic compounds. In this study, NU-600, NU-906, and NU-1008 differing in pore structures were evaluated for dynamic adsorption of 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), a sulfur mustard simulant, under both dry (0% RH) and humid (80% RH) conditions (Figure S36). Detailed procedures are provided in the Supporting Information. A CEES concentration of 4000 mg/m3 was used for breakthrough experiments herein. The loadings of CEES were compared among the investigated MOFs varying in pore size/volume and Zr6 node connectivity to confirm which factor mainly affected CEES uptake (). NU-906 with the smallest pore showed the highest uptake (13.3 mol/kg) of CEES under dry conditions among the three MOFs, due to the strong interaction between the analyte and the MOF framework. Considering that NU-906 and NU-1008 have the same 8-connected Zr6 nodes while the pore volume of NU-906 is much smaller than that of NU-1008, these results corroborated that pore size had an apparent effect on the CEES uptake under dry conditions. As demonstrated by the steep uptake of n-hexane at low pressures for NU-906 (), the microporous nature of this MOF may have facilitated the high adsorption under these breakthrough conditions.\n\nWe also analyzed the desorbed amounts of CEES to test the retained percent of the CWA simulant due to strong interactions with the MOFs (). Under dry conditions, the strong interaction between the CEES and the MOF nodes led to low desorption amounts. Only small desorbed percentages of 5.0 and 4.3% were observed for NU-600 and NU-1008, respectively, attributed to strong adsorption in the MOFs. In contrast, NU-906 had the highest percent desorbed of 10.5% while the retained loading was found to be 11.9 mol/kg CEES. A contributing factor of high loading of an analyte in MOFs is strong interactions between the analyte and the MOF framework, which can also lead to lower desorbed amounts due to the higher energy costs of desorption. For NU-906, the desorbed amount of the analyte was the highest, which may be explained by the reason that multilayer adsorption with higher loading of CEES occurs, leading to more guest-guest interactions rather than host-guest interactions. Due to the weaker interactions of CEES-CEES as compared to CEES-MOF, it is easier to desorb more. The desorption amounts were higher under humid conditions due to the competition with water for binding onto the active sites of the MOF, thereby weakening CEES-framework interactions under humid conditions. NU-600 had the highest percent desorbed of 77.3%, while NU-906 and NU-1008 had much lower percentages of analyte desorbed (13.9 and 20.7%, respectively). These results corroborated that decreasing the connectivity of the Zr6 node, thereby adding more aquo and hydroxyl moieties on the node, led to a higher percentage of the CWA simulant desorbed.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, a series of Zr-based MOFs were synthesized using the same tetratopic carboxylate linker H4TCPB-Br2, but resulting in four different topologies through tuning the synthetic solvents and modulators employed. In particular, NU-500 with a novel topology displays the first example of a 5-connected Zr6 node in MOFs. Compared to NU-600 with a she topology constructed by a 6-connected Zr6 node, both shp topology NU-906 and csq topology NU-1008 are constructed by 8-connected Zr6 nodes with different conformations of the flexible tetratopic carboxylate linker. H4TCPB-Br2 serves as a flexible building block capable of rotational deformations that adjust its geometrical characteristics between the inner phenyl ring and the outer phenyl ring allowing it to fit well into particular structures.
