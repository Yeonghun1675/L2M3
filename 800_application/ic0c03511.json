As shown in a,b, after ball milling, the diffraction peaks of 1-ball milling (1-BM), 1@PG, 2-ball milling (2-BM), and 2@PG are in agreement with the original ones, confirming their mechanical stability. The PXRD peaks of 1@PG are slightly weak with respect to those of 2@PG, indicating that 2 is more mechanically stable than 1. After calcination in air, the diffraction peaks of 1 and 2 still remained in 1-calcination (1-A), 1-BM-calcination (1-BM-A), 2-calcination (2-A), and 2-BM-calcination (2-BM-A). In addition, the diffraction peaks of 2@PG-A are consistent with those of 2, demonstrating that 2 possesses thermal stability. 1 and 2 show stability in the electrolyte (Figure S2). Furthermore, FT-IR spectra of the composites in various proportions correspond to the original ones, showing stability of the structure after ball milling and calcination (c,d). Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were measured to investigate the porosity of 1, 1@PG-A, 2, and 2@PG-A. 1@PG-A and 2@PG-A showed Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of 43.96 and 30.02 m2 g-1, respectively (e,g). The distributions of the pore sizes were calculated with the Density Functional Theory (DFT) method. The main pore sizes of 1@PG-A and 2@PG-A are ~1 nm (f,h). By comparison, 1 and 2 mainly exhibit the surface adsorption process, which may be attributed to the narrow pores in the structures (Figure S3). Obviously, 1@PG-A and 2@PG-A exhibited microporosities after ball milling and calcination, which accelerated the infusion of the electrolyte and provided a large amount of active sites during electrochemical processes, resulting in excellent storage capacity of Li+. \n\nElectrochemical Properties\n\nElectrochemical properties of 1, 2, 1@PG, and 2@PG were investigated with cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in a, two obvious reduction peaks at 0.72 and 1.4 V arose from the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer generation and irreversible side reaction, respectively.

In the reduction process, the peak at 0.01-0.2 V was caused by the Li+ insertion. The peak at 1.27 V was associated with the Li-extraction from the electrode material. Meanwhile, similar oxidation/reduction peaks (except the reduction peaks of 1.4 V) were observed in 2, 1@PG-A, and 2@PG-A, implying that these composites exhibited the similar electrochemical mechanism (b-d).\n\nAs shown in a, 1 showed a discharge capacity of 1133 mAh g-1 and a Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 40% in the first run. 2, 1@PG-A, and 2@PG-A showed the discharge capacities of 1134, 1481, and 1431 mAh g-1 with CE of 40%, 56%, and 63% in the first run, respectively (b-d). Obviously, 1@PG-A and 2@PG-A exhibited higher initial CEs than 1 and 2, demonstrating the enhancement of the cycling reversibility. Moreover, 2@PG-A exhibited higher initial CE value than 1@PG-A, and this may be due to the better structural stability of 2 (3D framework) than that of 1 (2D layer). As shown in e,f, the cycling behaviors of the materials were also determined at 100 mA g-1. Impressively, 1@PG-A exhibited higher reversible capacity (783 mAh g-1) than 2@PG-A (723 mAh g-1) after 100 runs. It is possible that 1 in 1@PG-A changed into the amorphous state during the electrochemical cycle, thus exposing more active sites. The capacity performances and rate performances of 1@PG-A and 2@PG-A were higher than those of the related electrode materials (1, 2, 1-BM, 2-BM, 1-A, 2-A, 1@PG, 2@PG, 1-BM-A, and 2-BM-A) (e-h and S7). 1@PG-A and 2@PG-A showed reversible capacities of 692/711, 588/594, 496/494, 375/377, 337/337, 257/253, 186/180, and 163/158 mAh g-1 at 0.1-5 A g-1, respectively. The reversible rate capacity returned to 697/692 mAh g-1 after 100 runs at 0.1 A g-1, suggesting a remarkable rate performance. Apparently, the promising electrochemical properties of 1@PG-A and 2@PG-A were probably ascribed to their nanosizes, microporosities, and enhanced conductivities. Moreover, 1@PG-A and 2@PG-A displayed better reversible capacities than some of the previously reported POMs-based anode materials (Table S1).\n\nTo further explore the electrochemical performance of 1@PG-A and 2@PG-A, the reaction dynamics were studied by the CV determinations at various sweep rates. The shapes of the CV curves do not change significantly with the enhanced scan rates, demonstrating their excellent reversibility (). As illustrated in b, the b value based on the literature equation is 0.82 for the cathodic peak of 1@PG-A, and they are 0.9 and 0.64 for the anodic peaks. Similarly, the b values of 2@PG-A are 0.85, 0.9, and 0.67 (f), indicating that the electrochemical reactions of 1@PG-A and 2@PG-A were dominated by both the capacitive performances and the diffusion behaviors. When the voltage was enhanced, the b values decreased from 0.9 to 0.64 and 0.67 for the anodic peaks, implying an increased diffusion-limited process of 1@PG-A and 2@PG-A at the high voltage.
