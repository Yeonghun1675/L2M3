XPS was conducted to identify the elemental composition of 3DSC-700. The XPS spectrum of 3DSC-700 shows that the sample contains C, S, N, Co, and Zn elements (Figure S2a). N, Co, and Zn come from the ZIF-8/ZIF-67 precursor. There are four fitted peaks located at 286.4, 284.9, 284.5, and 284.1 eV in the C 1s spectrum (Figure S2b), which are ascribed to C-N groups, C-S, C-C, and C\ue5fbC respectively. The two fitted peaks at 165.0 and 163.8 eV in the S 2p spectrum (d) corresponds to S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 for the thiophene-type -C-S-C- bond. The S content in the 3DSC-700 is as high as 20.1 wt % (Table S1) according to the elemental analysis results. The absorption peak at 1119 cm-1 in the 3DSC-700 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum corresponds to the band of C-S-C (Figure S2c). The XPS and FTIR (Figure S2c) results confirm that the S exits in the form of covalent bonds in the carbon lattice, that's why the S has not been seen in the XRD pattern.\n\nSodium storage performances of the 3DSC-700, MDC-700, and SC-700 electrodes were evaluated in half coin cells. a, S4a, and S5a display the CV curves of the 3DSC-700, MDC-700, and SC-700. All of them present a broad peak located at 1.0-1.3 V during the first scan, which can be attributed to the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formation and irreversible reactions on the electrode surface. The reduction peak close to 0 V is attributed to the insertion of Na+ into the layer of carbon. For the MDC-700 electrode, the reduction peaks located at 1.2, 0.6, 0.28, and 0 V in the initial scan can be ascribed to the irreversible reactions on the MDC-700 surface, the SEI formation, and the insertion of Na+ in the MDC-700 interlayer, respectively (Figure S4a). The oxidation peak at 0.85 V in the MDC-700 electrode is mostly related to the reversible reaction between N functional groups and Na+. Compared with MDC-700, both 3DSC-700 and SC-700 electrodes exhibit other two pairs of redox peaks centered at 1.15/1.80 and 1.75/2.15 V, which are similar to room-temperature Na-S batteries, and these two pairs of redox peaks are attributed to the Faradaic reactions between covalent sulfur and Na+. The two pairs of peaks still exist after three cycles, suggesting the electrochemical activity of the covalent sulfur and the highly reversible reaction between S and Na. Additionally, the CV profiles of the subsequent cycles are nearly overlapping (a), illustrating the superior cycling stability of the 3DSC-700 electrode.\n\nThere are two apparent sloping platforms at ~1.25 and ~1.75 V during the charge/discharge processes of the 3DSC-700 electrode except for the initial cycle (b), which is ascribed to Na+ insertion into the 3DSC-700 structure to react with covalent sulfur and consistent with the CV curves. The 3DSC-700 (b), MDC-700 (Figure S4b), and SC-700 (Figure S5b) present initial charge/discharge capacities of 526.1/1087.7, 58.7/227.1, and 282.1/686.3 mAh/g, respectively. Cycling stabilities of the prepared 3DSC-700, MDC-700, and SC-700 were tested at different current densities. When tested at 100 mA/g, after 100 cycles, the 3DSC-700 can retain a reversible capacity of ~ 450 mAh/g, but the capacities of MDC-700 and SC-700 after 100 cycles are 36.4 and 216.9 mAh/g, respectively (Figure S6). Even at 5000 mA/g, the 3DSC-700 electrode still possesses outstanding extra-long cycling stability (c) and presents a highly reversible capacity of 225 mAh/g after 3000 cycles. Rate performances of the 3DSC-700, MDC-700, and SC-700 electrodes are tested at 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 5000 mA/g. Reversible capacities of 343.6, 307.2, 287.4, 275.1, and 264.6 mAh/g are reached respectively for the 3DSC-700 electrode at each current density (d). Notably, when the current density decreases to 1000 mA/g, the capacity can be restored to 354.9 mAh/g, illustrating that the 3DSC-700 electrode has a high ability to endure high current changes. Additionally, compared to 8/SC-700 and 67/SC-700, the 3DSC-700 electrode also exhibits higher capacities (Figure S7). Table S2 lists the comparison of electrochemical performance between the 3DSC-700 electrode and those reported in the literature, where the 3DSC-700 presents the highest capacity among the reported carbon-based material for SIBs whether tested at low or high current density. To explore the impressive high-rate performance of the 3DSC-700 electrode, EIS was adopted to study the electrical conductivities of the electrodes. e displays Nyquist plots of the 3DSC-700, MDC-700, and SC-700 electrodes. As shown, all of the three plots consist of a semicircle and an inclined straight line. The semicircle relates to the double-layer capacitance, the charge transfer resistance (R ct), and the electrolyte and electrode resistance. The straight line arises from the Warburg impedance (Z w) and corresponds to the Na+ diffusion in electrodes. The R ct values of the 3DSC-700, MDC-700, and SC-700 electrodes are 215, 965, and 628 \u03a9, respectively. The lower R ct value of the 3DSC-700 electrode is attributed to the co-effects of sulfur doping, the special structure, and metal particle decoration.\n\nPseudocapacitive contributions, Na adsorption energies, theoretical capacities, and Na diffusion energy barriers were further adopted to investigate the excellent high-rate performance of the 3DSC-700 electrode. CV profiles at different scan rates are tested, and the results are displayed in a. All relevant calculation equations are presented in the Supporting Information. The calculated b values of peak1 and peak2 are 0.84 and 0.96, respectively. These results manifest that the performance of sodium storage in the 3DSC-700 electrode is related to both diffusion-controlled reaction and surface capacitive-controlled behavior. The 3DSC-700 electrode delivers a capacitive contribution of 88% at 0.6 mV/s (b). Moreover, the pseudocapacitive contributions are 81, 85, 88, 89, and 90% at 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 mV/s for the 3DSC-700 electrode, respectively (c). These results exhibit that the capacitive contribution is augmented gradually with the increasing sweep rate. The capacitive contribution in the 3DSC-700 electrode is higher than 80%, illustrating fast reaction kinetics characteristics in it. That may explain why the 3DSC-700 electrode has outstanding capacities at high current densities.", "data": ["(SyntaxError('invalid syntax', ('<unknown>', 10, 1, '[{\"meta\":{\"name\":\"MOF-B\", \"symbol\":\"\", \"chemical formula\":\"\"}, \"etc\": [\\n')), '[{\"meta\":{\"name\":\"MOF-A\", \"symbol\":\"\", \"chemical formula\":\"\"}, \"etc\": [\\n    {\\n        \"property name\": \"dielectric constant\",\\n        \"value\": \"4.5\",\\n        \"unit\": \"\",\\n        \"condition\": \"at 1 kHz\"\\n    }\\n]}]\\n\\n[{\"meta\":{\"name\":\"MOF-B\", \"symbol\":\"\", \"chemical formula\":\"\"}, \"etc\": [\\n    {\\n        \"property name\": \"electrical conductivity\",\\n        \"value\": \"0.01\",\\n        \"unit\": \"S/cm\",\\n        \"condition\": \"at room temperature\"\\n    }\\n]}]\\n\\n[{\"meta\":{\"name\":\"NOTT-202\", \"symbol\":\"\", \"chemical formula\":\"\"}, \"etc\": [\\n    {\\n        \"property name\": \"electrical resistance\",\\n        \"value\": \"10000000\",\\n        \"unit\": \"ohm\u00b7cm\",\\n        \"condition\": \"\"\\n    }\\n]}]')"], "include_properties": ["etc"]}, {"idx": "22, 23", "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<p>Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed\nto provide\nan in-depth understanding of S-doping effects on the performance of\nSIBs, including Na adsorption energies, theoretical capacities, and\nNa diffusion energy barriers, which determine the charge/discharge\nrate of SIBs.
