Moreover, the perfluoroalkyl chains on the MOF skeleton induce the electron transfer from Pd to MIL-101-F x , as clearly evidenced by the positive shifts in Pd XPS peaks and the red shifts in CO-DRIFTS adsorption peaks after hydrophobic modification (c,d). As a result, optimal Pd@MIL-101-F3, capable of enriching hydrophobic substrates, has a much higher efficiency than Pd@MIL-101-NH2 in the hydrogenation of various (hydrophobic) halogenated nitrobenzenes. More strikingly, electron-deficient Pd results in the preferable adsorption of -NO2 over the -Cl and -Br groups, as the former is more negatively charged, resulting in the highly selective hydrogenation of the -NO2 group over the dehalogenation of halogenated nitrobenzenes (e), far surpassing the traditional Pd-based catalysts.
