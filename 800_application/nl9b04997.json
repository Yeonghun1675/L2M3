Zn sites on the {110} facet are surrounded by three\nnegatively charged nitrogen atoms and an OH<sup>\u2013</sup> group\nthat hinder the approach of CTAB to Zn. On the other hand, CTAB has\nan open path to Zn on the {100} facets, where Zn is surrounded by\nonly two nitrogen atoms and one OH<sup>\u2013</sup> group. As a result, 25% of the Zn atoms on the {100}\nfacets in our model system were coordinated with a Br<sup>\u2013</sup> atom, and the change in surface energy of {100} facets upon Br<sup>\u2013</sup> attachment was estimated as {<italic>E</italic>\n<sub>{100}\u202fwith\u202fBr<sup>\u2013</sup>\n</sub> \u2013 <italic>E</italic>\n<sub>{100}\u202fwithout\u202fBr<sup>\u2013</sup>\n</sub>} = \u2212377.07 kcal/mol. The change in {100} surface energy suggests\nthat the presence of CTAB makes the ZIF-8 {100} facets more stable\nthan the {110} facets and that {100} growth occurs because Zn in the\n{100} facet becomes less reactive to binding additional imidazolate\nligands due to the barrier for Br<sup>\u2013</sup> detachment from\nZn. Consequently, the adsorption of CTAB favors growth in the [100]\ndirection. With this simulation in mind, we carried out X-ray photoelectron\nspectroscopy (XPS) to analyze the amount of CTAB adsorbed on the {100}\nand {111} surfaces. The surfaces of cubic and RD ZIF-8 nanocrystals\nwere first cleaned after synthesis, and no detectable amount of Br<sup>\u2013</sup> was observed (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b04997/suppl_file/nl9b04997_si_001.pdf\">Figure S4</ext-link>). After incubation in 1.3 mM CTAB solution for 10 min, XPS showed\na much higher Br<sup>\u2013</sup> content on the surface of the\nZIF-8 cube, further enforcing that CTAB much prefers to bind to ZIF-8\u2019s\n{100} facets rather than its {110} facets.</p>", "clean_text": "The energetics of this process were explored by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We studied the interaction energies between components of CTAB and of ZIF-8 facets. First, we aimed to determine if CTAB binds through CTA+ or Br-. The {100} and {110} facets of ZIF-8 were studied and modeled using MD within the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS; details are described in the Supporting Information). Interaction energies were estimated as E CTA+/ZIF-8 = E ZIF-8withCTA+  - (E ZIF-8 + E CTA+ ), where E ZIF-8withCTA+  is the potential energy of the ZIF-8 slab structure with CTA+ bound, E ZIF-8 is the potential energy of ZIF-8, and E CTA+  is the potential energy of CTA+. An analogous approach was used to find the energies associated with Br- binding. The resulting interaction energies (E CTA+/ZIF-8 or E Br-/ZIF-8) on the {100} and {110} facets are summarized in  and Figure S3. While E CTA+/ZIF-8 shows a similar distribution on the {100} and {110} facets, a distinct difference between the two facets was observed for E Br-/ZIF-8. As shown in a and c, most of the Br- molecules on the {100} and {110} facets exhibited interaction energies of around -10 kcal/mol, at which energy the attachment of these Br- molecules is weak and dynamically reversible. In contrast, a portion of the Br- molecules on the {100} facets exhibited a highly negative value of interaction energies at around -60 kcal/mol, which indicated a stronger attachment of Br- to the {100} facets of ZIF-8. The snapshot of the MD simulated system used to estimate E Br-/ZIF-8 on {100} facets revealed that a portion of the Br- molecules were coordinated to Zn, while no binding of Br- atoms to Zn was observed on {110} facets. This result is again attributed to the different coordination environment of the Zn site on the {100} and {110} and facets (, insets). Zn sites on the {110} facet are surrounded by three negatively charged nitrogen atoms and an OH- group that hinder the approach of CTAB to Zn. On the other hand, CTAB has an open path to Zn on the {100} facets, where Zn is surrounded by only two nitrogen atoms and one OH- group. As a result, 25% of the Zn atoms on the {100} facets in our model system were coordinated with a Br- atom, and the change in surface energy of {100} facets upon Br- attachment was estimated as {E {100}withBr-  - E {100}withoutBr- } = -377.07 kcal/mol. The change in {100} surface energy suggests that the presence of CTAB makes the ZIF-8 {100} facets more stable than the {110} facets and that {100} growth occurs because Zn in the {100} facet becomes less reactive to binding additional imidazolate ligands due to the barrier for Br- detachment from Zn. Consequently, the adsorption of CTAB favors growth in the [100] direction. With this simulation in mind, we carried out X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to analyze the amount of CTAB adsorbed on the {100} and {111} surfaces. The surfaces of cubic and RD ZIF-8 nanocrystals were first cleaned after synthesis, and no detectable amount of Br- was observed (Figure S4). After incubation in 1.3 mM CTAB solution for 10 min, XPS showed a much higher Br- content on the surface of the ZIF-8 cube, further enforcing that CTAB much prefers to bind to ZIF-8's {100} facets rather than its {110} facets.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 11, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig3\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulation results of the interaction between\nCTAB and ZIF-8 facets: (a and c) Distribution of interaction energies, <italic>E</italic>\n<sub>Br<sup>\u2013</sup>/ZIF\u20118</sub>, between\nthe bromide anion and the ZIF-8 surface on the {110} and {100} facets,\nrespectively.
