The oxidation current peak near 4.52 V is attributed to the decomposition of the PL/UiOLiTFSI electrolyte, which is consistent with LSV results. However, the electrochemical window of the intrinsic single ionic conductor electrolyte (P/UiOLiTFSI) without lithium salt is 4.08 V (Figure S12). The broad electrochemical window and high electrochemical stability is conducive to the matching of cathode materials with high-voltage lithium batteries.\n\nOther key parameters for electrolyte materials, lithium-ion transport number (t Li+ ) of PL/UiOLiTFSI and PL/UiOLi were measured using Li|SSEs|Li symmetric cells by the Evans method at room temperature and calculated by the current-time curve and the ac impedance spectra before and after polarization. The t Li+  of PL/UiOLiTFSI was 0.84, which is higher than that of PL/UiOLi (0.59) and other reported porous crystalline materials (g, S15, and Table S1). The high t Li+  value is ascribed to the restricted movement of large anion groups (Tf) grafted on the MOF skeleton as well as super single-ion conducting property, which can effectively overcome the polarization of batteries caused by the anionic motion. Meanwhile, the result was also confirmed by galvanostatic charge and discharge. In addition, the lithium ion transport number (0.87) under solvent-free conditions was measured, as shown in Figure S14.
