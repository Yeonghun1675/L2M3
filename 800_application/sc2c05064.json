In addition, the Coulombic\nefficiency of standard, C-paper, and MgO@C/C-paper after 200 cycles\nis 98.3, 98.7, and 99.0%, respectively. The high electrical conductivity\nand the large surface of the interlayers provide plenty of reaction\nsites for polysulfides, enhancing the polysulfide utilization.

Comparing\nstandard, C-paper, and MgO@C/C-paper cells, at the first cycle, the\ncapacity coming from the first plateau is 318, 346, and 359 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup>, respectively. The standard cell, without an interlayer,\nhas the smallest capacity due to a lack of electrical conductivity.\nA conductive interlayer on the top of the sulfur cathode surface,\nwhere the electrochemical reaction predominantly occurs, enhances\nthe utilization of nonconductive sulfur (S<sub>8</sub>) and lithium\nsulfides (Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub> and Li<sub>2</sub>S). The effect of the MgO@C/C-paper\ninterlayer is emphasized at the second plateau where higher capacity\nis extracted by reduction of polysulfides (Standard: 411 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup>, C-paper: 552 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup>, and MgO@C/C-paper:\n621 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup>). The voltage plateau at 2.1 V was extended\nfor the MgO@C/C-paper over the C-paper implying that the MgO@C layer\npromotes the reduction of low-order polysulfides (at 2.1 V) more than\nthe reduction of elemental sulfur to high-order polysulfides (at 2.3\nV), resulting in the higher specific capacity compared to the C-paper.</p><p>After 20 cycles, the first plateau for the standard cell dramatically\ndecreased having 192 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup> and moderately decreased\ncapacity of 347 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup> for the second plateau.\nRepeated polysulfide dissolution and S/Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/Li<sub>2</sub>S deposition result in the separation of sulfur and\ncarbon in the cathode. Insulating sulfur species at the interface\nbetween the electrolyte and cathode passivates the cathode. It has\nbeen reported that the low electrical conductivity of the sulfur species\nand the loss of the active material related to polysulfide dissolution\ndecreases the sulfur utilization. For C-paper and MgO@C/C-paper, the change in the\nfirst plateau is relatively moderate (C-paper: 271 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup>, MgO@C/C-paper: 285 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup>). However, an abrupt\nvoltage decay decreased the capacity derived from the second plateau\nof the C-paper 437 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup>, whereas MgO@C/C-paper\nmaintains the capacity of 529 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup>. The difference\nin the second plateau capacity after 20 cycles is expected to come\nfrom the passivation of active sites of the C-paper interlayer.</p><p>In order to separate the role of MgO, MgO particles are removed\nby using 2 M HCl acid leaching (<ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c05064/suppl_file/sc2c05064_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S5</ext-link>).

C/C-paper has an initial capacity\nof 891 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup>, which is very similar to that of\nthe C-paper (898 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup>). Also, it retained its\ncapacity of 680 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup> at 50 cycles showing a similar\ndecay curve when compared to the C-paper. Such a result confirms that\nthe presence of MgO nanoparticles can increase the capacity of the\nLi\u2013S cell.</p><p>One of the crucial challenges in the commercialization\nof Li\u2013S\nbatteries is the limitation of sulfur loading. With an increased sulfur\nloading of 3.3 mg cm<sup>\u20132</sup> (), the initial specific capacity of sulfur\ndramatically drops to approximately 300 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup> at\nthe first cycle at 0.05 C, whereas the interlayer-containing cells\nretain the cathode-specific capacities of approximately 1000 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup>. During 100 cycles at 0.2 C, the capacity only retained\nat approximately 200 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup> without an interlayer\n(b). The C-paper\ncell that initially had a high capacity (1st cycle: 987 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup>) underwent a rapid capacity fading, delivering the\nspecific capacity of 414 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup> at the 100th cycle\n(54.6% of the second cycle capacity, 759 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup>). On the other hand, the MgO@C/C-paper cell shows an excellent cycle\nretention, presenting a cathode capacity of 584 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup> at the 100th cycle (80.1% of the second cycle capacity, 729 mAh\ng<sup>\u20131</sup>). Compared to the MgO@C/C-paper cell, the rapid\ncapacity fading of the C-paper cell is related to the decay of the\nvoltage plateau at 2.1 V (a). These outcomes reflect that, with the higher sulfur\nloading, a greater amount of polysulfides is dissolved, accelerating\npassivation of the C-paper and capacity fading. In contrast, with\nthe MgO@C/C-paper, passivation of the C-paper is effectively suppressed,\nthereby enabling reduction of polysulfides.</p><p>There are different MOF and MOF-derived materials\nused in Li\u2013S\nbattery studies. For example, the HKUST-1 based MOF@GO separator shows\nan initial capacity of 1207 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup> and retains\n870 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup> at the 100th cycle at 0.5 C, and Y-FTZB-coated separator shows an initial\ncapacity of 1101 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup> and retains its capacity\nof 557 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup> after 300 cycles at 0.25 C. Although the overall capacity of this work is\nslightly lower than the previous results, considering the loading\nmass (0.6\u20131.0 mg cm<sup>\u20132</sup>) of previous results,\nthis result is comparable.</p><p>The charge\u2013discharge curves\nand rate performance of the\nthree Li\u2013S batteries are shown in <ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c05064/suppl_file/sc2c05064_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S7</ext-link>.

The unique structure of MOF-derived\nMgO@C provides polysulfides with numerous anchoring sites and short\ndiffusion pathways from MgO to carbon, enabling efficient utilization\nof dissolved polysulfides. In addition, passivation of the carbon\nsubstrate is prevented since the solid-state sulfur species (Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/Li<sub>2</sub>S) deposited on MgO@C is efficiently\noxidized to polysulfide during charging, increasing the utilization\nand the reversibility of the Li\u2013S cell.</p>", "clean_text": "Lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries represent a promising future battery technology.

The excellent cycle stability of the MgO@C/C-paper cell over the C-paper cell demonstrates that the unique structure of the MOF-derived MgO@C is highly effective in anchoring and reutilizing dissolved polysulfides.\n\nTo estimate the composition of MgO, MOF-derived amorphous carbon, and graphitic C-paper in the MgO@C/C-paper, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted for MgO@C powder and MgO@C/C-paper in an air condition to 900 \u00b0C. The MgO@C powder sample lost approximately 53.4% of its original weight at temperature around ~300 \u00b0C (Figure S3a), confirming the MOF-derived carbon has an amorphous structure, and retained 46.6% of its original weight up to 900 \u00b0C. Thus, the weight ratio of MgO to MOF-derived amorphous carbon in MgO@C is 46.6 to 53.4. The MgO@C/C-paper lost its weight slightly at a temperature around ~300 \u00b0C and mostly at temperatures above ~600 \u00b0C, where approximately 97.5% of graphitic carbon oxidized from its original weight (Figure S3b). Accordingly, MgO@C/C-paper is composed of 2.5 wt % MgO, 2.9 wt % MOF-derived amorphous carbon, and 94.6 wt % of graphitic C-paper. The free-standing C-paper and MgO@C/C-paper have a weight of 14.1 and 14.4 mg, respectively. A simple calculation shows that MgO@C/C-paper only has 0.16 mg of extra MgO added from the original C-paper.\n\nThe electrical conductivity of MgO@C/C-paper was measured to be 0.71 S cm-2, which was slightly lower than that of the C-paper (0.94 S cm-2) due to the presence of insulating MgO. The Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) measurement (Figure S4) exhibits that MOF-derived carbon has mesopores with an average pore size of 5.2 nm. Owing to the highly porous MOF-derived carbon, the MgO@C/C-paper has a substantially larger Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area (0.70 m2/g) than that of the C-paper (0.29 m2/g).\n\nWith a cathode sulfur loading of 1.7 mg cm-2, three types of Li-S coin cells were assembled: a standard cell without an interlayer and also C-paper and MgO@C/C-paper that employ C-paper and MgO@C/C-paper interlayer, respectively, between the cathode and the separator. The ratio between electrolyte and sulfur (E/S) was 20 \u03bcL/g. The cycle test was performed at the current density 0.2 C, with cutoff voltages of 1.7 and 2.8 V (a). The standard cell has an initial capacity of 729 and 543 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles with retention of 74.5%. On the other hand, the interlayer-containing cells, C-paper and MgO@C/C-paper, deliver substantially enhanced initial capacities of 898 and 980 mAh g-1, respectively. After 200 cycles, C-paper had a capacity of 687 mAh g-1 with retention 76.5%, and MgO@C/C-paper had a capacity of 767 mAh g-1 with retention 78.3%. In addition, the Coulombic efficiency of standard, C-paper, and MgO@C/C-paper after 200 cycles is 98.3, 98.7, and 99.0%, respectively. The high electrical conductivity and the large surface of the interlayers provide plenty of reaction sites for polysulfides, enhancing the polysulfide utilization. However, it is expected that the formation of Li2S2 and Li2S eventually passivates the surface of the C-paper, whereas the MgO@C layer prevents the passivation.\n\nIn b-d, the prepared coin cells demonstrate discharge voltage plateaus at approximately 2.3 and 2.1 V, corresponding to the reduction of elemental sulfur to high-order polysulfides (Li2S x , 6 \u2264 x \u2264 8) and a further reduction of these polysulfides to lower-order polysulfides (Li2S x , 4 \u2264 x \u2264 6) and lithium sulfide (Li2S), respectively. Comparing standard, C-paper, and MgO@C/C-paper cells, at the first cycle, the capacity coming from the first plateau is 318, 346, and 359 mAh g-1, respectively. The standard cell, without an interlayer, has the smallest capacity due to a lack of electrical conductivity. A conductive interlayer on the top of the sulfur cathode surface, where the electrochemical reaction predominantly occurs, enhances the utilization of nonconductive sulfur (S8) and lithium sulfides (Li2S2 and Li2S). The effect of the MgO@C/C-paper interlayer is emphasized at the second plateau where higher capacity is extracted by reduction of polysulfides (Standard: 411 mAh g-1, C-paper: 552 mAh g-1, and MgO@C/C-paper: 621 mAh g-1). The voltage plateau at 2.1 V was extended for the MgO@C/C-paper over the C-paper implying that the MgO@C layer promotes the reduction of low-order polysulfides (at 2.1 V) more than the reduction of elemental sulfur to high-order polysulfides (at 2.3 V), resulting in the higher specific capacity compared to the C-paper.\n\nAfter 20 cycles, the first plateau for the standard cell dramatically decreased having 192 mAh g-1 and moderately decreased capacity of 347 mAh g-1 for the second plateau. Repeated polysulfide dissolution and S/Li2S2/Li2S deposition result in the separation of sulfur and carbon in the cathode. Insulating sulfur species at the interface between the electrolyte and cathode passivates the cathode. It has been reported that the low electrical conductivity of the sulfur species and the loss of the active material related to polysulfide dissolution decreases the sulfur utilization. For C-paper and MgO@C/C-paper, the change in the first plateau is relatively moderate (C-paper: 271 mAh g-1, MgO@C/C-paper: 285 mAh g-1). However, an abrupt voltage decay decreased the capacity derived from the second plateau of the C-paper 437 mAh g-1, whereas MgO@C/C-paper maintains the capacity of 529 mAh g-1. The difference in the second plateau capacity after 20 cycles is expected to come from the passivation of active sites of the C-paper interlayer.\n\nIn order to separate the role of MgO, MgO particles are removed by using 2 M HCl acid leaching (Figure S5). TEM high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) images and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of heat-treated MOF powder show MgO nanoparticles and clear Mg peaks, whereas the acid-leached heat-treated MOF powder only demonstrates clear amorphous carbon matrix without any Mg peaks. MgO@C/C-paper after acid leaching, denoted as \"C/C-paper\", is assembled in a Li-S full cell to compare the electrochemical performance (Figure S6). C/C-paper has an initial capacity of 891 mAh g-1, which is very similar to that of the C-paper (898 mAh g-1). Also, it retained its capacity of 680 mAh g-1 at 50 cycles showing a similar decay curve when compared to the C-paper. Such a result confirms that the presence of MgO nanoparticles can increase the capacity of the Li-S cell.\n\nOne of the crucial challenges in the commercialization of Li-S batteries is the limitation of sulfur loading. With an increased sulfur loading of 3.3 mg cm-2 (), the initial specific capacity of sulfur dramatically drops to approximately 300 mAh g-1 at the first cycle at 0.05 C, whereas the interlayer-containing cells retain the cathode-specific capacities of approximately 1000 mAh g-1. During 100 cycles at 0.2 C, the capacity only retained at approximately 200 mAh g-1 without an interlayer (b). The C-paper cell that initially had a high capacity (1st cycle: 987 mAh g-1) underwent a rapid capacity fading, delivering the specific capacity of 414 mAh g-1 at the 100th cycle (54.6% of the second cycle capacity, 759 mAh g-1). On the other hand, the MgO@C/C-paper cell shows an excellent cycle retention, presenting a cathode capacity of 584 mAh g-1 at the 100th cycle (80.1% of the second cycle capacity, 729 mAh g-1). Compared to the MgO@C/C-paper cell, the rapid capacity fading of the C-paper cell is related to the decay of the voltage plateau at 2.1 V (a). These outcomes reflect that, with the higher sulfur loading, a greater amount of polysulfides is dissolved, accelerating passivation of the C-paper and capacity fading. In contrast, with the MgO@C/C-paper, passivation of the C-paper is effectively suppressed, thereby enabling reduction of polysulfides.\n\nThere are different MOF and MOF-derived materials used in Li-S battery studies. For example, the HKUST-1 based MOF@GO separator shows an initial capacity of 1207 mAh g-1 and retains 870 mAh g-1 at the 100th cycle at 0.5 C, and Y-FTZB-coated separator shows an initial capacity of 1101 mAh g-1 and retains its capacity of 557 mAh g-1 after 300 cycles at 0.25 C. Although the overall capacity of this work is slightly lower than the previous results, considering the loading mass (0.6-1.0 mg cm-2) of previous results, this result is comparable.\n\nThe charge-discharge curves and rate performance of the three Li-S batteries are shown in Figure S7. As C-rate increases, the voltage gap between charge and discharge plateaus increases due to the limited conductivity of the standard sulfur cathode. However, the cell with MgO@C/C-paper has flatter plateaus and reduced overpotential. MgO@C-paper has a capacity of 1237 mAh g-1 at 0.05 C and 651 mAh g-1 at 1 C having higher rate capability compared to other cells. Also, it recovers up to 1011 mAh g-1 when the C-rate returns to 0.05 C, suggesting superior rate performance of MgO@C/C-paper.\n\nConclusion\n\nMgO@C was synthesized on a free-standing carbon paper (MgO@C/C-paper) and presented as an interlayer between the cathode and the separator of a Li-S cell. By pyrolyzing a novel precursor for the MgO@C, highly porous carbon was obtained with uniformly distributed MgO nanoparticles. The Li-S cells assembled with C-paper and MgO@C/C-paper demonstrated initial discharge capacities (898 and 980 mAh g-1, respectively) much higher than that of the interlayer-free cell (729 mAh g-1), owing to the high electrical conductivity of the interlayers. The MgO@C/C-paper cell exhibited superior cycle stability of the C-paper cell; at the 200th cycle, capacity retention of MgO@C/C-paper and C-paper cell was 78.3% and 76.5%, respectively, with a sulfur loading of 1.7 mg cm-2. In the MgO@C, MgO nanoparticle anchors dissolved polysulfides that diffuse to carbon matrix for electrochemical reactions. The unique structure of MOF-derived MgO@C provides polysulfides with numerous anchoring sites and short diffusion pathways from MgO to carbon, enabling efficient utilization of dissolved polysulfides. In addition, passivation of the carbon substrate is prevented since the solid-state sulfur species (Li2S2/Li2S) deposited on MgO@C is efficiently oxidized to polysulfide during charging, increasing the utilization and the reversibility of the Li-S cell.", "data": ["This model's maximum context length is 4097 tokens.
