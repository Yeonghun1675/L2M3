Figure b shows the relative crystallinity of virgin MIL-101 and 10%\nGO/MIL-101 obtained from the XRD data with different times. An accelerated\nsynthesis of GO/MIL-101, compared to the virgin MOF, was observed,\nsimilar to the accelerated syntheses of rectangular MOFs such as Cu-BTC\nand MOF-5, by composite formation with suitable materials. According to Bandosz and co-workers, GO contains\nsome epoxy groups in their structure, which links with the metal sites\nof the MOF during composite formation. These epoxy groups act as H<sub>2</sub>O molecules, which usually\nmake coordination with the central metal ions of MOFs. Hydrogen boding\nbetween the H-atom from the hydroxyl groups of the GO sheets and the\nO-atom from the chromium oxide octahedra of the MIL-101 also occurs\nin parallel. Different functional groups,\nespecially epoxy groups, combine with the central metal ions by the\nremoval of H<sub>2</sub>O molecules which form a strong GO-MOF interaction. Other functional groups\ue5f8especially carboxylic\nor sulfonic groups\ue5f8are normally formed at the edge of the GO\nsheets, which also combine with the metal sites of MOFs. So far, it has been reported that spherical\nMOFs such as MIL-100 and MIL-101 are not easy to be composed with\na high concentration of GO, because of the attachment of the GO sheets\nin various orientations. However, in\nthis study, we confirmed the beneficial role of GO, even at high concentrations,\nin the rapid synthesis of MIL-101. The chemical affinity of GO and\nMOF might improve the synthesis kinetics of the MOF, compared to the\nvirgin MIL-101. Therefore, a shorter crystallization time may be observed\nthrough the clinging of the MOF nuclei to the GO sheets which propels\nfaster crystallization. As observed, at the very beginning, the crystallization\nof the GO/MOF composites was faster, compared with the virgin one,\nsuggesting rapid syntheses of various MOFs in the presence of suitable\nadditives such as GO.</p>", "clean_text": "Several methods have been tried to accelerate the synthesis of MOF materials, because rapid syntheses have various advantages; microwave- and ultrasound-assisted syntheses are the most prominent among them. Figure b shows the relative crystallinity of virgin MIL-101 and 10% GO/MIL-101 obtained from the XRD data with different times. An accelerated synthesis of GO/MIL-101, compared to the virgin MOF, was observed, similar to the accelerated syntheses of rectangular MOFs such as Cu-BTC and MOF-5, by composite formation with suitable materials. According to Bandosz and co-workers, GO contains some epoxy groups in their structure, which links with the metal sites of the MOF during composite formation. These epoxy groups act as H2O molecules, which usually make coordination with the central metal ions of MOFs. Hydrogen boding between the H-atom from the hydroxyl groups of the GO sheets and the O-atom from the chromium oxide octahedra of the MIL-101 also occurs in parallel. Different functional groups, especially epoxy groups, combine with the central metal ions by the removal of H2O molecules which form a strong GO-MOF interaction. Other functional groups\ue5f8especially carboxylic or sulfonic groups\ue5f8are normally formed at the edge of the GO sheets, which also combine with the metal sites of MOFs. So far, it has been reported that spherical MOFs such as MIL-100 and MIL-101 are not easy to be composed with a high concentration of GO, because of the attachment of the GO sheets in various orientations. However, in this study, we confirmed the beneficial role of GO, even at high concentrations, in the rapid synthesis of MIL-101. The chemical affinity of GO and MOF might improve the synthesis kinetics of the MOF, compared to the virgin MIL-101. Therefore, a shorter crystallization time may be observed through the clinging of the MOF nuclei to the GO sheets which propels faster crystallization. As observed, at the very beginning, the crystallization of the GO/MOF composites was faster, compared with the virgin one, suggesting rapid syntheses of various MOFs in the presence of suitable additives such as GO.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 18, "type": "text", "classification": ["property"], "content": "<title>Textural Properties and\nCharacteristics of\nthe GO/MIL-101 Composites</title><p>Figure a shows the BET surface areas, derived from the N<sub>2</sub> adsorption\nisotherms shown in , of the different composites with different amounts\nof GO in the syntheses of GO/MIL-101.
