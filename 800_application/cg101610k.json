As illustrated in Figure a, the asymmetric unit of 3 contains three crystallographic unique Zn(II) cations, one Na(I) ion, two BTC ligands, one 2.20 formate ion, three \u03bc 2 -H2O molecules, and two free water molecules. In the structure of 3, Zn(1) centers are six-coordinated by six oxygen atoms (O(1), O(2), O(6), O(7), O(11), and O(14)) to construct distorted octahedral geometries with the length of the Zn-O bonds ranging from 1.988 to 2.409 \u00c5 (Table S1 of the ). The O(1), O(2), O(6), and O(7) atoms come from four separate BTC ligands; the O(11) atom comes from a \u03bc 2 -H2O molecule, whereas the O(14) atom comes from a 2.20 formate ion. Both Zn(2) and Zn(3) atoms are five coordinated to form trigonal bipyramidal geometries with Zn-O bond distances in the range 1.946-2.332 \u00c5. Zn(2) atoms connect three BTC ligands (O(5), O(7), O(10)), one 2.20 formate ion (O(14)), as well as one \u03bc 2 -H2O molecule (O(3)). Besides connecting three BTC ligands (O(6), O(8), O(9)), Zn(3) is coordinated with two \u03bc 2 -H2O molecules (O(11), O(12)). Na(1) cation is six-coordinated by six oxygen atoms from four BTC (O(4), O(9), O(10), O(16)) and two \u03bc 2 -H2O molecules (O(3), O(12)) and constructs a distorted octahedron with the length of Na-O bonds ranging from 2.311 to 2.565 \u00c5.
