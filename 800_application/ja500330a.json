The presence of water molecules in site I seems to stabilize the presence of site IV molecules through the formation of hydrogen-bonding interactions. As such, the precise orientation of D2O bound at these two adsorption sites was determined, revealing a well-defined hydrogen-bonding network between sites I and IV of the T1 cavity and the \u03bc3-OD group of in the SBU (Figure S9 in ).

With that\nin mind, released heat can increase the temperature in adsorbent beds\nso that the uptake capacity can be drastically influenced by this\ntemperature change. Therefore, we have measured the water isotherms\nfor the best performers, MOF-801-P and MOF-841, at various temperatures\nbetween 15 to 55 \u00b0C (Figure S52, S54 in ).

For comparison, we first studied the water uptake properties of the prototypical Zr-MOF, UiO-66 (Figure a, black squares), and compared it to data reported by other researchers. The water isotherm of UiO-66 (group 1) has a sigmoidal shape with a moderate hysteresis loop at P/P 0 = 0.3-0.4. Maximum water uptake at 25 \u00b0C reaches 535 cm3 g-1 (43 wt %) at P/P 0 = 0.9 (Table ). These results, recorded on a volumetric instrument (uptake vs P/P 0), show the same trend as those previously reported and measured on a gravimetric system (uptake vs relative humidity, RH%). \n\nThe water isotherm of MOF-801-SC measured at 25 \u00b0C is shown in Figure a, blue squares. The adsorbed amount of water gradually increases with increasing pressure up to P/P 0 = 0.05, followed by abrupt water uptake in the pressure range from P/P 0 = 0.05 to 0.1, and the maximum uptake is 350 cm3 g-1 (28 wt %) at P/P 0 = 0.9. The step pressure is much lower than that of UiO-66, indicating a higher water affinity for this material. A similar trend is observed by MOF-801-P (Figure a, red squares), while the maximum water uptake is now 1.3 times greater than MOF-801-SC [450 cm3 g-1 (36 wt %) at P/P 0 = 0.9]. This difference in maximum uptake between the two forms of MOF-801 was also observed in the N2 sorption measurements, and we attribute this to the possibility of a large amount of missing linker defects in MOF-801-P. MOF-802 shows a type I isotherm (Figure a, green squares). Although this compound does not show significant N2 and Ar uptake, the total water uptake is 100 cm3 g-1 (8.0 wt %) at P/P 0 = 0.9, indicating that the pore is large enough to allow inclusion water molecules due to its smaller kinetic diameter (2.6 \u00c5).\n\nThe water isotherms for group 2 MOFs display significant steps with a hysteresis loop (Figure b). The limited water uptake at lower pressure from these steps indicates that the affinity of water to the MOF surface is low. This is related to the hydrophobicity of the organic linker; therefore, higher water vapor pressure is required to induce the pore filling. This is clearly illustrated by the behavior of PIZOF-2, which has a large pore diameter and does not take up water up to P/P 0 = 0.7. Once the uptake starts, it reaches a total water storage capacity of 850 cm3 g-1 (68 wt %) at P/P 0 = 0.9. This high uptake capacity at high relative pressure indicates a strong correlation between porosity and total water uptake (Figure S50 in ). The maximum uptake of DUT-67 and MOF-808 is 625 cm3 g-1 (50 wt %) and 735 cm3 g-1 (59 wt %), respectively. DUT-67 shows several steps in its isotherm, which can be correlated to the filling of the variously sized cavities that are present in this structure. MOF-841 shows an isotherm with a steep adsorption commencing at P/P 0 = 0.2 and reaching 550 cm3 g-1 at P/P 0 = 0.3 (640 cm3 g-1 at P/P 0 = 0.9).\n\nIn the case of group 3 MOFs, MOF-804 shows a type I isotherm profile (Figure c, red circles), while sigmoid isotherms are observed for the larger pore materials MOF-805 and MOF-806 (Figure c, blue and green circles, respectively). All three MOFs in this group show relatively low maximum uptakes, compared to the other studied MOFs: MOF-804 has a maximum uptake of 295 cm3 g-1 (24 wt %) at P/P 0 = 0.9, while MOF-805 and MOF-806 have a maximum uptake of 415 cm3 g-1 (33 wt %) and 425 cm3 g-1 (34 wt %), respectively. \n\nAt P/P 0 = 0.1, the water uptakes of MOF-801-P and Co-MOF-74 are higher than 20 wt %, which outperform any of the other MOFs. More importantly, after the first cycle these capacities are still 3 times greater than that of zeolite 13X, which is commonly used for water adsorption chillers. The water uptake capacity increases for all materials at P/P 0 = 0.3. However, the order is slightly different from the one observed at relative pressure of 0.1: here, MOF-841 outperforms other materials. The isotherm profile of this material (Figure b), which shows a significant step in the pressure range from P/P 0 = 0.2 to 0.3, indicates that water rapidly condenses in the pore of this MOF at this pressure range. In addition, the uptake is nearly constant throughout the five cycles. After the fifth cycle, the uptake is still greater than 40 wt %. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest value of water uptake at P/P 0 = 0.3 for any porous solid.\n\nTemperature Dependency of Water Uptake\n\nSince water adsorption is an exothermic process, a large amount of heat can be utilized if the adsorption enthalpy is large. With that in mind, released heat can increase the temperature in adsorbent beds so that the uptake capacity can be drastically influenced by this temperature change. Therefore, we have measured the water isotherms for the best performers, MOF-801-P and MOF-841, at various temperatures between 15 to 55 \u00b0C (Figure S52, S54 in ). These isotherms show that the maximum uptake capacity is not significantly influenced by the temperature, indicating that water molecules are easily condensed within the MOF pores. We have estimated the isosteric heat of adsorption (Q st) of water from the isotherms measured at various temperatures (Figures S53, S55 in ). The Q st value in the low water coverage range for MOF-841 is around 50 kJ mol-1, which remains nearly constant throughout the entire adsorption process, and represent 25% greater energy than the latent energy of water (40.7 kJ mol-1). The Q st value for MOF-801-P is even greater than for MOF-841, approximately 60 kJ mol-1.\n\nApplications to Thermal Battery and Water Delivery in Remote Desert Regions\n\nWith these values, we can estimate how much heat can be stored in 15 kg of MOF-801-P. Assuming that the storage capacity and Q st of MOF-801-P are 20 wt % (at P/P 0 = 0.1) and 60 kJ mol-1, respectively, the total heat expected to be released is 10 MJ. If such a system is operated for 1 h with 65% efficiency, the power capability is equivalent to 1.8 kW: a value approaching the 2.5 kW power target for typical thermal batteries as set by DOE.
