In this system, the closest distance between the surface O atoms of adjacent clusters is 6.00 \u00c5, which matches the distance of 3.35 \u00c5 between the two terminal H atoms within one acetylene molecule.

Among them, we have paid particular attention\nto the change of the \u2220CHC bond angles (inside each acetylene\nmolecule) because this degree of freedom is closely related to the\nactivation of acetylene molecules. In a, we show the statistical distribution of\nthe \u2220CHC bond angle of acetylene at 473 K (blue line).

To explore the effect of the POMOF microenvironment\non the acetylene activation, we constructed a reference system and\ncompared the statistical distribution of the \u2220CHC angles. The\nreference system has the same lattice parameters as POMOF but exists\nas an unconstrained open space, i.e., does not contain MOF or POM\nclusters (<ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.2c23072/suppl_file/am2c23072_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S3</ext-link>). Because the main\ndifference in the number of molecules between those accommodated in\nthe confined nanoregions and those in the unconstrained open space\ncomes from the area originally occupied by the four POM clusters in\nPOMOF, the number of acetylene molecules is also increased from 60\nto 104, so that the two systems could have similar acetylene molecular\ndensities. The red line in a shows the difference in the \u2220CHC angular distribution\nbetween the two systems, where a positive value means that acetylene\nwithin a POMOF exhibits a larger proportion of the distribution at\na specific angle. The result shows that, relative to the reference\nopen system, acetylene molecules adsorbed in the POMOF system have\nlower distributions at small angles from 0\u00b0 to 15\u00b0, while\nthey exhibit higher proportions at large angles from 15\u00b0 to 30\u00b0.\nIt is worth noting that the above results are both obtained at 473\nK. This means that, at the same external temperature, the acetylene\nmolecules adsorbed within the POMOF system can be better activated\nthan those located in an open system, and without exploration of the\ndynamic process of the molecular motions, this feature would not be\ncaptured. This reflects how important it is to study the dynamic evolution\nof the molecules\u2019 configurations. Nevertheless, the reason\nfor the above phenomenon could still be understood from a static perspective.\nIn b, we show\nthe energy variation of an acetylene molecule when one of its \u2220CHC\nangles is rotated to a series of specific angles in three different\nsituations. Here, the black line corresponds to the case of an isolated\nfree acetylene molecule without forming any hydrogen bond, while the\nblue and green lines represent the cases of acetylene at the hydrogen-bond\nnetwork (forming two hydrogen bonds) and inside an MOF cavity (forming\none hydrogen bond), respectively. It can be seen that when an acetylene\nmolecule forms one hydrogen bond with a surface O atom inside the\nPOMOF cavity, the potential energy surface for the bond angle rotation\nis always lower than the corresponding result of an isolated free\nmolecule. This means that, under the same external stimuli, the acetylene\nmolecule located in the cavity can rotate out a larger angle, corresponding\nto the higher statistical distribution at the large angle range in a.

Among them, we have paid particular attention to the change of the \u2220CHC bond angles (inside each acetylene molecule) because this degree of freedom is closely related to the activation of acetylene molecules. In a, we show the statistical distribution of the \u2220CHC bond angle of acetylene at 473 K (blue line). One can see that the \u2220CHC angle is mainly distributed in the range of 0-35\u00b0 and reaches the peak of distribution around 10\u00b0, in sharp contrast to a value of close to 0\u00b0, as in the structure of the local minimum at 0 K. To explore the effect of the POMOF microenvironment on the acetylene activation, we constructed a reference system and compared the statistical distribution of the \u2220CHC angles. The reference system has the same lattice parameters as POMOF but exists as an unconstrained open space, i.e., does not contain MOF or POM clusters (Figure S3). Because the main difference in the number of molecules between those accommodated in the confined nanoregions and those in the unconstrained open space comes from the area originally occupied by the four POM clusters in POMOF, the number of acetylene molecules is also increased from 60 to 104, so that the two systems could have similar acetylene molecular densities. The red line in a shows the difference in the \u2220CHC angular distribution between the two systems, where a positive value means that acetylene within a POMOF exhibits a larger proportion of the distribution at a specific angle. The result shows that, relative to the reference open system, acetylene molecules adsorbed in the POMOF system have lower distributions at small angles from 0\u00b0 to 15\u00b0, while they exhibit higher proportions at large angles from 15\u00b0 to 30\u00b0. It is worth noting that the above results are both obtained at 473 K. This means that, at the same external temperature, the acetylene molecules adsorbed within the POMOF system can be better activated than those located in an open system, and without exploration of the dynamic process of the molecular motions, this feature would not be captured. This reflects how important it is to study the dynamic evolution of the molecules' configurations. Nevertheless, the reason for the above phenomenon could still be understood from a static perspective. In b, we show the energy variation of an acetylene molecule when one of its \u2220CHC angles is rotated to a series of specific angles in three different situations. Here, the black line corresponds to the case of an isolated free acetylene molecule without forming any hydrogen bond, while the blue and green lines represent the cases of acetylene at the hydrogen-bond network (forming two hydrogen bonds) and inside an MOF cavity (forming one hydrogen bond), respectively. It can be seen that when an acetylene molecule forms one hydrogen bond with a surface O atom inside the POMOF cavity, the potential energy surface for the bond angle rotation is always lower than the corresponding result of an isolated free molecule. This means that, under the same external stimuli, the acetylene molecule located in the cavity can rotate out a larger angle, corresponding to the higher statistical distribution at the large angle range in a. The differential charge density distribution also shows that, upon formation of the C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bond, the C-H bond will be polarized by the negatively charged O atom, which may be the reason why the \u2220CHC angle can be rotated by a larger angle. We note in passing that hydrogen-bond interactions within some MOFs are very critical to the adsorption of molecules, and previous works have also demonstrated the promotion of chemical bond activation due to the participation of hydrogen bonds.

For comparison, the extrapolated values based on the results of single ethylene adsorption have also been obtained. These results are shown in b. It can be seen that, although the absolute value of the interaction energy also decreases with an increase of the number of molecules, a comparison between the calculated and extrapolated values for ethylene adsorption is remarkably different from the corresponding contrast for the adsorption of acetylene. For ethylene adsorption, the absolute values of the calculated interaction energies are all lower than those of the extrapolated ones. From a comparison between the calculated and extrapolated interaction energies of 16 ethylene molecules, it can be seen that the hydrogen-bond network constructed by ethylene is not as stable as that made up by acetylene. For acetylene, the difference between the two types of interaction energies is 13 meV/molecule, while the corresponding value for ethylene is as high as 37 meV. This reflects that, in the hydrogen-bond network composed of ethylene, deviation of the molecular adsorption configurations from the ideal pattern of an adsorbed single molecule is more significant than the case of acetylene. This also means that, in practice, it is more favorable that the hydrogen-bond network is constructed by acetylene rather than ethylene.
