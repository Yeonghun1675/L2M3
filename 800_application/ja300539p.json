We believe that the enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activities of Pt@MOFs are due to more efficient electron transfer from the unstable [IrIII(ppy)2(bpy\u22c5-)] species to Pt NPs which not only increased hydrogen reduction rates but also slowed down the decomposition of the Ir complexes. ICP-MS of the supernatant solution of the Pt@2-catalyzed reaction after 48 h showed that 25.6% of the Ir leached into the solution, indicating the decomposition of the Ir-complex during the 48 h reaction. The photochemical quantum yield of the Pt@2-catalyzed reaction driven with 440 nm light was determined to be (5.6 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10-4, much higher than that of the homogeneous control [(3.0 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10-4, ].", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "diameter", "value": "2\u20133", "unit": "nm", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "diameter", "value": "5\u20136", "unit": "nm", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "2", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "lifetime of the 3MLCT state", "value": "110.3", "unit": "ns", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["etc"]}, {"idx": 15, "type": "table", "classification": null, "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Pt@MOFs as Photocatalyst for Hydrogen\nEvolution<xref rid=\"t1fn1\"></xref>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"4\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">entry</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">catalyst</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">Ir-TON<xref rid=\"t1fn2\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">Pt-TON</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>1</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>Pt@<bold>1</bold> (1st run)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>730</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>39.2</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>2</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>Pt@<bold>1</bold> (2nd\nrun)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>633</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>34.0</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>3</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>Pt@<bold>1</bold> (3rd run)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>624</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>33.5</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>4</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>Pt@<bold>1</bold> (4th run)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>740</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>39.8</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>5</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>Pt@<bold>2</bold> (1st run)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1620</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>90.9</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>6</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>Pt@<bold>2</bold> (2nd run)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1500</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>84.1</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>7</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>Pt@<bold>2</bold> (3rd run)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>990</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>55.6</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>8</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>Pt@<bold>2</bold> (4th run)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1380</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>77.5</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n<table-wrap-foot>\n<fn id=\"t1fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>Hydrogen evolution reactions were\ncarried out for 6 h using a 450 W Xe-lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter.</p>\n</fn>\n<fn id=\"t1fn2\">\n<label>b</label>\n<p>Ir-based turnover number (Ir-TON)\nis defined as <italic toggle=\"yes\">n</italic>(1/2H<sub>2</sub>)/<italic toggle=\"yes\">n</italic>(Ir).</p>\n</fn>\n</table-wrap-foot>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "", "data": ["substring not found"], "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 4, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Synthesis of Phosphorescent Zr-Carboxylate\nMOFs (<bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>) of the <bold>fcu</bold> Topology\nand Subsequent Loading\nof Pt NPs inside MOF Cavities via MOF-Mediated Photoreduction of K<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>4</sub> to Form the Pt@<bold>1</bold> and Pt@<bold>2</bold> Assemblies</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ja-2012-00539p_0005.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Synthesis of Phosphorescent Zr-Carboxylate MOFs (1 and 2) of the fcu Topology and Subsequent Loading of Pt NPs inside MOF Cavities via MOF-Mediated Photoreduction of K2PtCl4 to Form the Pt@1 and Pt@2 Assemblies   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 6, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Stick-polyhedron\nmodel of the crystal structure of <bold>2</bold>, as viewed along\nthe [100] direction (a) and showing an octahedral\ncavity (b), represented by a red ball with a diameter of 1 nm;
