Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) as well as linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were conducted in an 80 mM borate buffer at pH 8, at which both the MOF and POM components are stable. CVs were measured between 0.65 and 1.85 V vs RHE. The CVs displayed a characteristic wave assigned to CoII/CoIII redox processes of the Co centers of the POM (Figure S7). Half-wave potential is similar for both the POM in solution over a bare ITO electrode and the thin films, measured at 1.35 V. Furthermore, Figure S8 displays CVs of P  2  W  18  Co  4  @MOF-545-DC as a function of the scan rate, whereby the linear dependence of the peak current intensity with respect to the scan rate is consistent with a surface-controlled redox process.\n\nFor both EP and DC deposition methods, the LSVs show similar electrochemical trends going from bare ITO to MOF-545 thin films to P2W18Co4@MOF-545 (c). On the bare ITO electrode, water-oxidation reaction starts at a potential of 1.88 V. For both MOF-545-EP and MOF-545-DC, the MOF coating has an insulator effect that lowers the current density and does not show any catalytic effect. By contrast, thin films of the full POM@MOF composite show a catalytic wave starting at +1.62 V for both P  2  W  18  Co  4  @MOF-545-EP and P  2  W  18  Co  4  @MOF-545-DC, in agreement with literature and LSVs conducted on a 5 mM P2W18Co4  solution (Figure S9), thus showing an overpotential for OER of 390 mV. To confirm the electrocatalytic OER of the thin films, controlled-potential electrolysis (CPE) experiments were conducted at 1.88 V vs RHE in an 80 mM borate buffer solution at pH 8 (d). A stable current density was obtained for 2 h and reproduced after two more cycles (same charge passed; see  for details). Blank experiments conducted on either bare ITO electrode or MOF-545 thin films (Figure S10) led to negligible current intensities when compared to those of POM@MOF thin films. The higher current densities observed for P  2  W  18  Co  4  @MOF-545-EP (~350 \u03bcA cm-2) with respect to P  2  W  18  Co  4  @MOF-545-DC (~200 \u03bcA cm-2) may be explained by the larger quantities of POM@MOF catalyst deposited on EP films when compared to DC ones (1 order of magnitude difference). The first evidence for the production of O2 is the formation of bubbles at the electrode surface triggered by the application of the potential. O2 production was measured over the experiments by gas chromatography (a and S11) and was shown to occur linearly over time, consistent with the stable current observed during catalysis. Faradic yields calculated after 2 h of reaction are close to 100% for both P  2  W  18  Co  4  @MOF-545-EP and P  2  W  18  Co  4  @MOF-545-DC. The comparison of electrocatalytic performances of P  2  W  18  Co  4  @MOF-545-DC and P  2  W  18  Co  4  @MOF-545-EP points toward the better activity of DC thin films: turnover numbers (TONs) and turnover frequencies (TOFs) calculated over 2 h amount, respectively, to 527 and 73 \u00d7 10-3 s-1 for P  2  W  18  Co  4  @MOF-545-EP and 2250 and 310 \u00d7 10-3 s-1 for P  2  W  18  Co  4  @MOF-545-DC. The remarkably higher performances of P  2  W  18  Co  4  @MOF-545-DC with respect to P  2  W  18  Co  4  @MOF-545-EP may be attributed to the larger thickness of EP films (~20 \u03bcm) when compared to that of DC films (crystallite size of ~1 \u03bcm). Consequently, an important proportion of POM@MOF crystallites on top of the film, i.e., far from the conductive ITO support, may not participate in the electrocatalysis as part of an insulating layer of materials in P  2  W  18  Co  4  @MOF-545-EP. For P  2  W  18  Co  4  @MOF-545-DC, a higher amount of active sites of the catalytic POM are available owing to a higher dispersion of the sample.\n\nThe two types of thin films exhibit significantly different photocatalytic activities during OER, pointing toward a much higher performance of DC-type thin films. For P  2  W  18  Co  4  @MOF-545-EP, the TON after 2 h amounts to 403 and the TOF over the first 30 min to 134 10-3 s-1. The corresponding values for P  2  W  18  Co  4  @MOF-545-DC are much higher and amount to 1600 (TON) and 467 10-3 s-1 (TOF). Here, we interpret such differences as a result of the efficient illumination of the POM@MOF photosystem in DC thin films, whereby all particles deposited on ITO are exposed to light, while in the thicker (multiple-layered) EP films, only the sublayer of POM@MOF particles indeed exposed to light is functional. Remarkably, both types of films exhibit higher photocatalytic activities than P2W18Co4@MOF-545 illuminated in suspension (b). This may be again explained not only by the lower quantities of catalyst deposited on films with respect to that in suspension\ue5f8which tends to increase the calculated TON\ue5f8but also by a less efficient exposure of crystallites to light when in suspension (random orientation of crystallites, light diffusion by the suspension).
