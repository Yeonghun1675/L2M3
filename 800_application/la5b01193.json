As expected from our DFT calculations, the simulated heat of adsorption for C2-C4 hydrocarbons is the lowest for PBE-D2 FF. The VDW-DF2 FF and DREIDING values are comparable to each other and are within 2 kJ/mol of the experimental measurement. It is encouraging that the slope of the line for VDW-DF2 FF (8.6 mol per -CH2) is similar to the experimental result (8.25 kJ/mol per -CH2).", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "MIL-47\u00ad(V)", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": {"type": "", "probe": "", "value": "1200", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}}]], "include_properties": ["surface_area"]}, {"idx": 36, "type": "table", "classification": ["Property"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Comparison of \u03b5 Force Field\nParameters for Modeling the Adsorption of Ethane in MIL-47 (V) Using\nDREIDING, PBE-D2 FF, and VDW-DF2 FF</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"6\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col6\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">adsorbate<break></break>atom type</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">MOF<break></break>atom<break></break>type</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">DREIDING<break></break>(\u03b5,\u00a0K)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">PBE-D2\nFF<break></break>(\u03b5,\u00a0K)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">VDW-DF2 FF<break></break>(\u03b5,\u00a0K)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">all FFs<break></break>(\u03c3,\u00a0\u00c5)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>CH3_sp3_UA</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>C1</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>68.49</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>54.23</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>64.80</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>3.61</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>CH3_sp3_UA</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>C2</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>68.49</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>54.23</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>64.80</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>3.61</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>CH3_sp3_UA</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>C2</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>68.49</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>54.23</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>64.80</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>3.61</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>CH3_sp3_UA</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>O1</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>68.72</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>106.86</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>96.59</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>3.39</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>CH3_sp3_UA</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>O2</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>68.72</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>106.86</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>96.59</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>3.39</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>CH3_sp3_UA</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>V<xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"t1fn1\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>28.09</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.00</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.00</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>n/a</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>CH3_sp3_UA</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>H</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>27.38</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>6.13</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>14.08</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>3.30</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n<table-wrap-foot>\n<fn id=\"t1fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>Note that the \u03b5 value for\nthe V-CH3_sp3_UA interaction has been set to zero.</p>\n</fn>\n</table-wrap-foot>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "Table 1.
