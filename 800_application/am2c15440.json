The grinding process may destroy the stable structure and cause a change in fluorescence location. Molecular level changes of F3 discoloration in the grinding process are analyzed by infrared spectroscopy (c). The out-of-plane aromatic C-H frequencies in F3 are blueshifted from 860.1 and 836.9 cm-1 to 858.1 and 835.0 cm-1 in F3Y, indicating the change in symmetry and the weakening of intermolecular interactions, such as C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0. In addition, the redshift of the stretching vibration of COO- in F3 from 1681.6 to 1687.4 cm-1 in F3Y indicates that certain changes have occurred in the functional group (d). Infrared analysis shows that the degree of intermolecular interaction is greatly disturbed during grinding, and the weakening of intermolecular interaction in the solid state will lead to the loss of crystallinity and long-range order, which will also be reflected in the PXRD patterns of F3Y. Furthermore, we collected the PXRD pattern of F3Y.

Here, we designed a novel lead-based anion 2D metal-organic framework (MOF){[(CH3)2NH2]2[Pb(TCBPE)(H2O)2]} n  (F3) with interlocking structures, in which TCBPE stands for 1,1,2,2-tetra(4-carboxylbiphenyl)ethylene. Powder X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis revealed that F3 has excellent chemical and solvent stability. It is worth noting that F3 has a grinding discoloration effect. The solvent-protected grinding approach achieved F3B with a high quantum yield (QY = 73.77%) and blue fluorescence, while the direct grinding method produced F3Y with a high quantum yield (QY = 37.27%) and yellow-green fluorescence. Importantly, F3B can detect NFAs in water rapidly and sensitively while remaining unaffected by other antibiotics. F3Y can identify DCN in water quickly and selectively while remaining unchanged by other pesticides. F3B demonstrated high selectivity and rapid response to NFAs at a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 0.26 \u03bcM, while F3Y indicated high selectivity and responded quickly to DCN in water at an LOD as low as 0.14 \u03bcM. The method was successfully applied to detect NFAs in actual water samples of the fish tanks and ponds as well as the pesticide DCN in soil samples. The recovery rates were 97.0-105.15% and 102.2-106.48%, and the relative standard deviations were 0.63-1.45% and 0.29-1.69%, respectively. In addition, F3B and F3Y can be made into fluorescent test papers for the visual detection of NFAs and DCN, respectively. Combined with experiments and density functional theory calculations, the mechanism of fluorescence quenching of MOFs by target analytes was also revealed.\n\nIn this paper, a novel two-dimensional anionic framework{[(CH3)2NH2]2[Pb (TCBPE) (H2O)2]} n  (F3) with superior fluorescence properties was constructed by using the H4TCBPE ligand and lead nitrate. Due to the vertical interlocking structure of F3, it exhibits excellent solvent and fluorescence stability in water and other organic solvents. As a result, it is suitable for fluorescence analysis. The blue luminescent crystal powder (F3B) (PLQY = 73.77%) was obtained by the solvent protection grinding method, and the yellow-green luminescent crystal powder (F3Y) (PLQY = 37.27%) was attained by direct grinding. Based on the fluorescence response characteristics, a dual-color luminescent Pb-TCBPE sensing platform in water was constructed, realizing the detection of NFAs by F3B and the detection of DCN by F3Y. The linear range of NFAs was 0.86-29.91 \u03bcM with a detection limit of 0.26 \u03bcM, whereas the linear range of DCN was 0.46-59.64 \u03bcM with a detection limit of 0.14 \u03bcM. The method was successfully applied to detect NFAs in actual water samples of fish tanks and ponds and the pesticide DCN in soil samples. The recovery rates were 97.0-105.15% and 102.2-106.48%, and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were 0.63-1.45% and 0.29-1.69%, respectively. Finally, we prepared a portable fluorescent test paper to visualize and rapidly detect NFAs and pesticide DCN. In addition, the quenching mechanism was investigated by experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Notably, this work is the first to propose a variety of solvent-protected strategies for the preparation of TCBPE-MOFs. This is also the first time that Pb-TCBPE has been synthesized and used to detect antibiotics and pesticides in water, which contributes to the development of multifunctional fluorescent MOF sensors.\n\nStructural Characterization of Compound F3 \n\nUnder the optical microscope, F3 was shown as a regularly shaped pale-yellow square (Figure S8a). The surface of F3 was observed by SEM (Figure S8b), suggesting that F3 was smooth and free of impurities, and the surface roughness (Rq) of F3 measured by AFM was only 0.00146 \u03bcm (Figure S8c). The above results show that F3 has a good morphology and smooth surface. PXRD was carried out to confirm the phase purity of compound F3. The positions of the prominent diffraction peaks of the PXRD patterns measured in the experiment are consistent with the simulated ones, proving that F3 is a pure phase (Figure S9). Then, after soaking in aqueous solutions with different pH values for 12 h, the prominent diffraction peaks of the PXRD patterns are still consistent with the simulated peaks, indicating that F3 can remain stable in the pH range of 2-12 (Figure S10a). As depicted in Figure S10b, F3 maintained excellent crystallinity, and the PXRD patterns are in agreement with the simulated patterns after soaking in water and different organic solvents for 12 h, indicating that compound F3 has superb solvent stability. The stability of the solvent lays the foundation for fluorescence sensing in the liquid phase.\n\nXPS spectra were used to determine the elemental composition and valence state of F3. As seen from Figure S11a, elements in complex F3 include Pb, C, N, and O. The high-resolution spectrum of Pb 4f shows that the binding energies are 138.88 eV (Pb 4f7/2) and 143.78 eV (Pb 4f5/2), which prove the existence of Pb(II) ions (Figure S11b). Figure S11c shows that the high-resolution XPS spectrum of C 1s is convolved into two peaks, with binding energies of 284.80 and 288.27 eV corresponding to the C-C bond and the O-C\ue5fbO bond, respectively, which correspond to carboxylic acid ligands. Figure S11d shows the N 1s high-resolution XPS spectrum with one convolution peak at 402.82 eV attributable to C-NH2, further proving the existence of the dimethylamine cation. Figure S11e shows O 1s high-resolution XPS with two convolution peaks at 531.67 and 533.44 eV attributable to the Pb-O bond and the C\ue5fbO bond.\n\nTGA data were collected in the range of 30 to 800 \u00b0C at a rate of 20 \u00b0C min-1 under a nitrogen atmosphere to investigate F3's thermal stability. As shown in Figure S13, the weight loss rate of the TGA curve is approximately 3.12% (calculated to be 3.15%) from 30-138 \u00b0C, proving the loss of two coordinated water molecules in F3. When the temperature was increased to 430 \u00b0C, the mass of F3 decreased sharply, which was attributed to the collapse of the framework. The above result showed that F3 has excellent thermal stability.\n\nFluorescence Spectroscopy Analysis\n\nCPs of main-group metals such as Pb(II) have interesting photochemical and photophysical properties, but there have been few studies on their PL compared with transition metals and lanthanide metals. a shows that F3B and F3Y have broad excitation spectra ranging from 300 to 400 nm. As a practical application, the UV lamp can be used for visual detection, so we all use 365 nm as the wavelength for excitation. As shown in b, the maximum emission wavelengths of F3B, F3Y, and the ligand H4TCBPE are 461, 507, and 484 nm, respectively. The luminescence of F3B and F3Y can be attributed to the charge transfer from ligand-to-metal (LMCT) between the delocalized \u03c0-bond of the carboxylic group and the p-orbital of the Pb(II) center. As shown in c, the fluorescence lifetime of F3Y is 2.08 ns, the fluorescence lifetime of F3B is 1.05 ns, and the fluorescence lifetime of the ligand H4TCBPE is 1.89 ns. Interestingly, the order of life span is in line with the trend of luminous centers, which is consistent with a previous report. The Commission International de I'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates of H4TCBPE, F3B, and F3Y are (0.1914, 0.3339), (0.1563, 0.1818), and (0.2672, 0.4273), respectively (d). In addition, both crystal suspensions maintained good dispersibility in water under daylight lamps (e). Moreover, under irradiation with UV light, both crystal suspensions exhibited dazzling fluorescence (f). The quantum yield of F3B in water is as high as 73.77%, and the quantum yield of F3Y powder in water is as high as 37.27%.\n\nTo prove the application value of F3B in realistic environments, the fluorescence response characteristics of F3B under different pH values were investigated. Figure S15a shows that the fluorescence intensity of F3B did not change much in the pH range from 2 to 12, indicating that the probe could maintain fluorescence stability over a wide pH range. In addition, the effect of different kinds of ions on the fluorescence intensity of F3B was also investigated. As shown in Figure S15b, the effect of these cations and anions on the luminescence intensity is negligible. F3B was immersed in 10 kinds of common organic solvents (Figure S15c) and a pH range from 2 to 12 for 12 h, and PXRD patterns were collected (Figure S15d). The PXRD pattern showed that F3B maintained good crystallinity after soaking. This means that F3B is stable in different solvents and over a wide range of pH values. To explore the sensing ability of F3B to trace antibiotics in aqueous solutions, the stability of F3B in water was analyzed by time-dependent luminescence intensity. As shown in Figure S16, F3B exhibited a characteristic emission peak at 461 nm, which is close to the emission peak of the ligand (485 nm), indicating that the luminescence of F3B is mainly attributed to the emission of the organic ligand. After 5 h of immersion in water, the fluorescence intensity of F3B did not change.

It can be observed that with the addition of NFZ or NFT, the fluorescence intensity of F3B gradually decreases (Figures S18a and S19a). Furthermore, when the NFZ or NFT concentration was increased to 196.078 \u03bcM, the fluorescence intensity was almost completely quenched, and the quenching efficiency of NFZ and NFT was 92.6 and 90.4%, respectively (Figures S18b and S19b). The quenching effect can be quantitatively calculated by the Stern-Volmer expression: I 0/I - 1 = K sv [C] (I 0 and I are the luminescence intensities of F3B before and after adding the analyte, respectively); [C] = the analyte concentration; K sv is the quenching constant (M-1). As shown in Figures S18c and S19c, the fluorescence intensity of the I 0/I ratio has a good linear relationship with the NFZ or NFT concentration in the range of 1.15-29.91 \u03bcM and 1.09-29.91 \u03bcM, respectively. The K sv value is calculated as 1.934 \u00d7 104 for NFZ and 2.01 \u00d7 104 for NFT, revealing a strong quenching effect on the luminescence emission intensity of F3B.

The fluorescence intensity of F3B decreased gradually with increasing concentrations (0-196.078 \u03bcM) of NFAs (a). As shown in b,c, in the range of low concentrations (0.86-29.91 \u03bcM), the relationship between the concentration of NFAs and the fluorescence intensity of F3B agrees with the S-V equation, showing a good linear relationship. With a further increase in the concentration, the S-V plot deviated from linearity and bent upward, and the linear relationship agrees with the first-order exponential fitting equation, which may be attributed to the existence of static or dynamic quenching processes or energy transfer processes.

The K sv value of NFAs was 20340 M-1, and the LOD was calculated to be 0.26 \u03bcM.\n\nWe accidently discovered that F3Y could detect the pesticide of DCN, so we investigated the quenching process of F3Y by DCN. Figure S23a shows that F3Y has good fluorescence stability in the pH range of 5-9. The addition of common ions to the environment has almost no effect on the fluorescence intensity of F3Y (Figure S23b).

The results showed that the shape of the diffraction peak and position of F3Y were unchanged in the pH range of 5-9 and water (Figure S23d). In the pH range of 2-4, 10-12 and organic solvents (Figure S23c,e,f), F3Y appeared at a new diffraction peak, resulting from the interaction between the crystal and organic solvent, strong acid, and alkali solution. In this work, F3Y is applied in water, so we consider that F3Y has good stability in water and a pH range of 5-9. The fluorescence stability of F3Y in water was analyzed by time-dependent luminescence intensity. F3Y exhibited a characteristic emission peak at 507 nm. In addition, the position and intensity of the fluorescence peak of F3Y in water for 5 h were unchanged, while the fluorescence intensity decreased after extending the time for 24 h. However, the position of the fluorescence peak remained unchanged (Figure S24). The above results showed that F3Y has good fluorescence stability in water.\n\nIn addition, the sensitivity of the probe was studied by dripping DCN solution into an F3Y suspension, and the changes in the fluorescence spectra were recorded (a). The fluorescence intensity of F3Y decreased with increasing DCN concentration, and the fluorescence quenching rate reached 79.59% when the concentration reached 176.82 \u03bcM. In the low concentration range of 0.46-59.64 \u03bcM, the concentration of DCN and the fluorescence intensity of F3Y complied with the Stern-Volmer equation, showing a good linear relationship (R 2 = 0.999). With increasing DCN concentration, the S-V equation gradually shifts and bends downward, which may be attributed to the static or dynamic quenching relationship or energy transfer processes between F3Y and DCN (b). The K sv value of DCN was calculated as 37340 M-1, and the LOD was calculated to be 0.14 \u03bcM based on 3\u03c3/k (c). In addition, the optical images of F3Y before and after the addition of 176.82 \u03bcM DCN in water showed obvious changes, indicating that F3Y may become a portable sensor based on the naked eye (d). The LODs of other DCN detection methods are shown in Table S6. The results show that F3Y has good sensitivity for DCN detection compared with other materials.\n\nConsidering that lead ions are toxic, to verify whether F3B and F3Y cause secondary contamination after detecting the target analytes, the lead ion concentration in the filtrate was measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results showed that the concentrations of lead ions in F3B and F3Y filtrates were 4 ng/mL and 6 ng/mL, respectively, which were lower than the standards recommended by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and World Health Organization (WHO).
