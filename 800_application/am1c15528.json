The SEM images (a~c) show that the three PCNs had different crystal morphologies, which were rod-shaped, shuttle-shaped, and cubic-shaped for PCN-222, PCN-223, and PCN-224, respectively. The observed morphologies of the PCNs are consistent with those reported in earlier studies. d-f displays the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized PCNs, which are in good agreement with their simulated ones. The BET surface area was measured to be 2080, 1827, and 1826 m2/g for PCN-222, PCN-223, and PCN-224, respectively, coinciding with the reported values (e.g., 2223 m2/g for PCN-222, 1809 m2/g for PCN-223, and 1413 m2/g for PCN-224). The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of the three PCNs are shown in Figure S1 in Supporting Information. The pore size distributions, as estimated by the DFT simulation (see the inset of Figure S1), suggested that all three PCNs possessed ordered pore structures.

These results demonstrate the successful synthesis of PCNs. We also investigated the spectroscopic properties of the three PCNs. The UV-vis absorption spectrum of each PCN showed a strong Soret peak around 430 nm and four Q-bands in the range of 500-700 nm (Figure S2), which are the characteristic absorption peaks of the porphyrin linker (i.e., TCPP).

Thus, a wavelength pair of \u03bbex 430 nm/\u03bbem 660 nm was selected to examine the sensing performance of the PCN sensor array. Figure S3d-f displays the fluorescence emission spectra of the PCN suspensions at \u03bbex 430 nm. The three PCNs exhibited different emission spectra due to the difference in ligand-to-metal charge transfer resulting from their distinct zirconium node connectivity (i.e., number of the coordinated linker).

For the preparation of PCN-222, 75 mg of ZrCl4, 50 mg of TCPP, and 2.7 g of benzoic acid were dissolved in 8 mL of DEF by sonication for 30 min. The mixture was then loaded in a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 120 \u00b0C for 48 h. After cooling to room temperature, the solid sample was collected by centrifugation and was washed using DMF and acetone, followed by drying at 80 \u00b0C under vacuum for 12 h. To remove the unreacted ligands, metal salts, and/or the trapped benzoic acid, the abovementioned resulted materials were further treated by immersion in DMF/HCl (8 mol/L HCl in 40 mL DMF) solution at 120 \u00b0C for 12 h. Then, the materials were washed with DMF and acetone, followed by immersion in acetone for 24 h to exchange the nonvolatile DMF. After drying under vacuum for 6 h, the obtained materials were collected as PCN-222.\n\nTo prepare PCN-223, 21 mg of ZrCl4 and 30 mg of TCPP were dissolved in 30 mL of DMF by sonication for 10 min. Then, 6 mL of propionic acid was added to the mixture, which was further sonicated. The mixture was then loaded in a Teflon-lined high pressure autoclave and heated at 120 \u00b0C for 16 h. As for the preparation of PCN-224, 60 mg of ZrOCl2\u22c58H2O and 32 mg of TCPP were dissolved in 8 mL of DMF, followed by the addition of formic acid (1380 \u03bcL) and 3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid (1620 \u03bcL). After sonication for 10 min, the mixture was heated in a high-pressure autoclave at 120 \u00b0C for 12 h.

These results demonstrate the successful synthesis of PCNs. We also investigated the spectroscopic properties of the three PCNs. The UV-vis absorption spectrum of each PCN showed a strong Soret peak around 430 nm and four Q-bands in the range of 500-700 nm (Figure S2), which are the characteristic absorption peaks of the porphyrin linker (i.e., TCPP). The fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectra of all three PCNs exhibited a broad fluorescence area (\u03bbex ranging from 350-450 nm and \u03bbem ranging from 640-760 nm) with the peak located at around \u03bbex of 430 nm and \u03bbem of 660 nm (Figure S3a-c). Thus, a wavelength pair of \u03bbex 430 nm/\u03bbem 660 nm was selected to examine the sensing performance of the PCN sensor array. Figure S3d-f displays the fluorescence emission spectra of the PCN suspensions at \u03bbex 430 nm.

Within the environmentally relevant pH range (i.e., pH 5.0-8.0), the fluorescence emission intensities of the PCNs were stable. We then monitored the fluorescence intensity of PCNs at \u03bbex 430 nm/\u03bbem 660 nm as a function of the irradiation time. The fluctuation of the fluorescence intensity was less than 5% within the examined 60 min of irradiation (Figure S3g-i), suggesting good water and fluorescence stabilities of PCNs.\n\nThe discrimination ability of the PCN array against individual PFASs with varying concentrations was examined to verify their quantification function.

Similar good linear relationships (R 2 > 0.98) were also found for other tested PFASs except for PFHxA that had the lowest quenching efficiency (Figure S7). The linear ranges were 0.1-2 \u03bcg/mL for PFHpA and PFNA and 0.1-1 \u03bcg/mL for PFDA and PFOS. The good linear correlation between factor 1 and PFAS concentration indicated that quantitative analysis of an individual PFAS can be realized by the PCN sensor array. On the basis of the abovementioned linear correlations, limits of detection (LOD) of the proposed array for PFASs were subsequently determined using the IUPAC criteria (3\u03c3/slope, where \u03c3 is the standard deviation of the factor 1 value without the presence of PFASs).

Because there is no spectrum overlap between the PFAS UV-vis absorbance and PCN fluorescence emission (a), the inner filter effect cannot occur in the PCN/PFAS systems. We speculated that the fluorescence quenching response of the PCNs to PFASs was due to the static quenching upon their adsorptive interactions. To explore the mechanism, we characterized the PCNs before and after the addition of PFASs. As shown in b and S9, the UV-vis absorption intensity of the PCNs declined gradually with the addition of all tested PFASs, indicating the formation of ground-state PCN-PFAS complexes upon the adsorption process. Moreover, the fluorescence decay curves of the PCNs in the absence or presence of PFASs almost overlapped (c and S10), and the measured fluorescence lifetimes were essentially constant (see Table S3). These observations confirmed that the quenching was mainly caused by the static quenching originating from the formation of PCN-PFAS complexes rather than by dynamic collision. The quenching constant (k q) can also be regarded as a reference to infer the quenching mechanism. The k q values determined from the Stern-Volmer equation were in the range of 0.38-4.36 \u00d71014 M-1 S-1 for PCNs by the six PFASs (see details in Figure S11), much larger than the limiting diffusion rate constant (2.0 \u00d7 1010 M-1 S-1 ), which are also consistent with the static quenching mechanism. \n\nThe adsorption of the PFASs on PCNs was confirmed by the results of batch adsorption experiments. At an initial concentration of 2 \u03bcg/mL, approximately 8-17% of PFHxA, 14-25% of PFHpA, 28-40% of PFOA, 50-75% of PFNA, 80-95% of PFDA, and 65-95% of PFOS were adsorbed by the three PCNs (10 \u03bcg/mL) (d). We further characterized the PCNs after PFAS adsorption. e and S12 show the EDS mappings of PCNs after adsorption of PFOA. The F element was uniformly distributed on the crystals of PCNs, consistent with their adsorption toward PFOA. The EDS mapping result also revealed the structure integrity of PCNs after adsorption, in line with their good water stability. FTIR spectroscopy analysis provided consistent results. After adsorption, the FTIR spectra of PCNs exhibited no significant change in shape and position of the absorption bands except for the appearance of a new band characteristic of PFOA molecules (the C-F stretching vibration band at around 1240 cm-1, Figure S13).
