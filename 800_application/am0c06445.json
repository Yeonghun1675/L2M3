The whole self-assembly\nbehavior involves two parallel processes in the first 12 h, while\nthe last 12 h of the hydrothermal reaction is the time for surface\nself-assembly.</p>", "clean_text": "Results and Discussion\n\nSynthetic Insight: Parallel Assembly and Ligand Linkage\n\nIn order to gain an accurate insight into the MOF-induced impact on the surface trap distribution, we followed a bottom-up analysis strategy, starting with microstructures and effectively wrapping up subsequent investigations over traps from the inside out. On the basis of hydrothermally prepared hematite, a one-step reaction of MOF and subsequent calcination were used to synchronously generate a double-layer modification of M-Fe2O3 and M-TiO2 on the hematite surface, forming a sandwich-like photoanode material of Fe2O3/M-Fe2O3/M-TiO2. At first, we tracked the trace of the hydrothermal process at different reaction times. a-e shows the SEM images of the as-grown uncalcined photoelectrode from 0 to 24 h. As shown in a, the individual vertically erected FeOOH NRs are approximately 100 nm in diameter, decreasing to about 50 nm with extended hydrothermal reaction time from 0 to 8 h (b,c). This apparent surface chemical corrosion is possibly caused by the excess BDC (1,4-BDC) which could react with iron-oxo clusters to form MIL-53(Fe). The TEM image (Figure S2) shows that a porous layer of about 5 nm is formed on the surface, which is probably the result of the corrosion by 1,4-BDC. Coupled with f, it can be seen that MIL-53(Fe) was successfully synthesized, but most of it fell out of the precursor solution (Figure S1). At the same time, additional 1,4-BDC reacts with Isopropyl titanate (Ti(OiPr)4) under high-temperature hydrothermal conditions to form MIL-125(Ti) in the precursor solution. At this moment, the self-assembled materials (MIL-125(Ti)) and connection sites (terminal carboxyl of residual MIL-53(Fe)) are ready. Once enough carboxyl sites are exposed on the surface, a large amount of MIL-125(Ti) in the precursor solution can easily grow on the corroded FeOOH surface. The gradual growth of MIL-125(Ti) with the duration of the hydrothermal reaction can be seen in Figure S3a-c. As-formed MIL-125(Ti) thus can be assembled at the terminal carboxyl of MIL-53(Fe) from 12 to 24 h (d,e) because the NRs in c-e become thicker and many tree-like structures grow on the surface of a single nanorod. Further TEM images of hydrothermally treated photoanodes before and after calcination are shown in Figure S3. As shown in Figure S3a-c, the porous flocs on the surface of FeOOH NRs gradually increase with the duration of the hydrothermal reaction, indicating that the surface self-assembly process is continuing. Combining the element distribution of the Ti element in d and the characteristic peak of MIL-125(Ti) in f can further prove the successful self-assembly process of MIL-125(Ti) on the FeOOH surface. In addition, the XRD patterns of samples with different hydrothermal times confirmed our speculation that the 8 h sample had a significant characteristic peak of MIL-53(Fe) at 12.2\u00b0, indicating that the surface BDC corrosion process was successfully carried out (f, green line, CCDC: 690315). The characteristic peaks of MIL-125(Ti) at 6.9 and 9.9\u00b0 for the following 24 h sample confirmed the realization of the surface self-assembly (f, red line, CCDC: 751157). Therefore, we proposed a brand-new self-assembly mechanism of the hydrothermal reaction process illustrated in g (the structures of MIL-125(Ti) and MIL-53(Fe) are shown in Figure S4).

It has been proved by multiple hydrothermal experiments that the self-assembly process goes through two stages: the first stage consists of 1,4-BDC that reacts with isopropyl titanate or FeOOH NRs to form corresponding MOF (0-12 h) and the second stage is the self-assembly stage (12-24 h). SEM and TEM images indicate the important bridging role of ligand 1,4-BDC, suggesting that excessive 1,4-BDC is quite essential. CV and Nyquist plots show that the surface corrosion caused by 1,4-BDC significantly eliminates the high-potential trap near the valence band. PEIS fitting and transient current demonstrated that MOF-derived TiO2 significantly improves the intrinsic properties of the surface, facilitating electron-hole transport. Unlike compact TiO2 films, porous permeable TiO2 introduces an appropriate amount of superior surface defects, which further enhances the surface catalytic activity in the photoresponse stage. The resulting precision structure will have the following original characteristics: (i) the organic acid ligand erodes hematite form, labeled [MIL-53(Fe), M-Fe2O3] while tightly bonding iron and titanium avoiding the secondary structural defects; (ii) after heat treatment, the high-quality surface state is reconstructed by the porous TiO2, further passivating the deep traps directly; (iii) the surface MOF-derived TiO2 forms a remarkable porous permeable morphology, which greatly enhances the surface oxygen evolution kinetics. All of these advantages for Fe2O3/M-Fe2O3/M-TiO2 result in a photocurrent density of 3.08 mA cm-2 without any oxygen evolution catalyst, increased by 570% compared to pristine hematite.

M-Fe2O3 modification increased the photocurrent density of pristine hematite at 1.23 VRHE from 0.46 to 0.96 mA\u22c5cm-2, which was more than doubled. The combination of M-Fe2O3 and M-TiO2 further increased the photocurrent to 3.08 mA\u22c5cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE, 5.7 times higher than that of pristine hematite. We found that the MOF-induced photoactivity is extremely sensitive to the concentration fluctuations, especially 1,4-BDC.

The tight connection of the M-TiO2 and M-Fe2O3 would function as an electron transport channel, thereby accelerating the charge transfer of hematite. The IMPS plot was thus applied to measure the charge transit time (\u03c4) in the hematite films, followed by the following equation: \u03c4 = (2\u03c0f)-1, where f is the value of minimal frequency in the IMPS plots. As shown in a, the obtained values of f corresponding to Fe2O3, Fe2O3/M-Fe2O3, and Fe2O3/M-Fe2O3/M-TiO2 are 5.123, 4.364, and 6.975 Hz, and thus, \u03c4 values were calculated to be 31.1, 36.5, and 22.8 ms, respectively. The largest \u03c4 for Fe2O3/M-Fe2O3 demonstrated that photogenerated electrons more hardly reach the back contact, which may be caused by reintroduced surface traps in M-Fe2O3. The introduction of M-TiO2 not only constructs a well-interconnected interface but also greatly reduces the transmission resistance, thus accelerating the electron transfer, confirmed by the minimum value of \u03c4 for Fe2O3/M-Fe2O3/M-TiO2.\n\nIn addition, the chopped LSV curve of the optimal Fe2O3/M-Fe2O3/M-TiO2 in e exhibits indiscernible transient current spikes, indicating the minimum amount of hole accumulation, viz., the holes trapped by the surface shallow traps are rapidly involved in water oxidation.
