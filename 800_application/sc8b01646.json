Although peak overlap complicates the assignment of IR bands of the framework, the >C\ue5fbO (carbonyl) band of the included solvents could be easily detected in the FT-IR spectrum. The carbonyl peak of the guest solvent arises at 1683 cm-1 for 1, 1653 cm-1 for 2, 1615 cm-1 for 3, and 1680 cm-1 for 4 (Figures S8 and S9). Thermogravimetric analyses of 1-4 display (Figures S10 and S11) an initial weight loss up to 150 \u00b0C, probably due to the expulsion of included solvent molecules. The plateaus ranging from 150-290 \u00b0C indicate thermally stable frameworks. The desolvated frameworks were achieved by replacing the included DMF guests with dichloromethane (DCM) for 3 days, followed by heating at 100 \u00b0C for 6 h under vacuum. The TGA curves, recorded for the individual desolvated frameworks, show no weight loss up to 300 \u00b0C. Alongside, variable-temperature powder X-ray diffraction (VT-PXRD) experiments for 1 and 2 exhibit retention of structural integrity until 300 \u00b0C (Figure S12). Both of the experiments equally corroborate the high thermal robustness of the structures.\n\nGas Adsorption Studies\n\nThe high thermal stability along with the presence of a 1D porous channel in the isoskeletal frameworks prompted us to pursue gas adsorption studies in the activated state. The activation was accomplished as specified in the preceding section, to afford the solvent free form 1'. At the onset, N2 adsorption for 1' was conducted at 77 K, which results in only surface adsorption (Figure S13) up to 1.0 relative pressure (P/P 0). To our knowledge, the lack of N2 adsorption could be a consequence of the 1D channel existing along the c axis, with no substantial opening in other direction. This possibly prevents the N2 molecules, having a kinetic diameter of 3.6 \u00c5, from entering the unidirectional pore. The accessible N-donor sites from free nitrogen atoms of triazole ring are properly oriented toward the pore, and expected to enhance interactions between CO2 and framework. We therefore next performed CO2 sorption studies in 1' at different temperatures. As opposed to N2 gas, the CO2 (kinetic diameter = 3.3 \u00c5) adsorption revealed a typical type-I isotherm at 273 K (), displaying the framework nature to be microporous. Noticeably, no hysteresis could be found between adsorption and desorption, and a maximum of 27.8 cm3/g (1.24 mmol/g, 5.5 wt %) CO2 uptake was achieved. The uptake value at 295 K under similar measurement conditions () approximates to 18.66 cm3/g (0.83 mmol/g, 3.7 wt %). Although the uptake value for 1' is not exceptional, as compared to famous nitrogen-rich MOFs, it does fairly equivalent to or better than MOFs such as SNU-110 (23.6 cm3/g, 1.05 mmol/g, 4.6 wt %), [Cd(ipa)(L(NH2)2)] (24.3 cm3/g, 1.08 mmol/g, 4.8 wt %), [Zn2(HDDCBA)] (26.1 cm3/g, 1.17 mmol/g, 5.1 wt %), Pcp (29.1 cm3/g, 1.30 mmol/g, 5.7 wt %), UCY-1 (31.4 cm3/g, 1.40 mmol/g, 6.2 wt %), and ZIF-100 (32.6 cm3/g, 1.46 mmol/g, 6.4 wt %). The CO2 adsorption capacity of 1' is ascribed to the nitrogen-rich pore environment. Further insight on the interaction of the framework with the adsorbate was gained from the isosteric heat of adsorption (Q st), assessed by employing the Clausius-Clayperon equation, using the CO2 isotherms at 273 and 295 K. \n\nAs shown in , the Q st value at zero loading is 29.05 kJ mol-1, which increases afterward due to enhanced interaction between the polar CO2 molecules (polarizability = 26.3 \u00d7 10-25 cm3; quadrupole moment = 13.4 \u00d7 10-40 C m2) and the basic N atoms in the framework. Thereafter, the value drops as the sites for maximum affinity become saturated, and the curve maintains the steady nature even until the full coverage. The Q st value is lower than those for other known MOFs containing -NH2 groups such as bio-MOF-11 (45 kJ/mol), CAU-1 (48 kJ/mol), NH2-MIL-53(Al) (35 kJ/mol), and USO-1-Al-A (50 kJ/mol), but higher than those of PCN-88 (27 kJ/mol), MAF-26 (23 kJ/mol), NOTT-140 (25 kJ/mol), CuBTTri (21 kJ/mol), MIL-53-Al (20.1 kJ/mol), IRMOF-3 (19 kJ/mol), MOF-5 (17 kJ/mol), and UMCM-1 (12 kJ/mol). Evidently, the adsorption enthalpy is moderate that benefits not only good CO2 adsorption, but also implies the easy regeneration of the adsorbent, which is a crucial and important standard to evaluate an adsorption material. In this regard, the regenerative feature of 1' was also investigated. To our delight, five cycles of CO2 uptake at 273 K show almost equal capacities with minimal loss (), revealing sorption recurrence. Moreover, the PXRD profile of 1' after the fifth adsorption-desorption cycle shows excellent correspondence of peaks to that of the as-synthesized structure, demonstrating uptake and release are nondestructive (Figure S15). The sorption behaviors of 1' with respect to CH4 and N2 were also studied at 273 and 295 K. The result shows () a maximum CH4 uptake of 8.3 cm3/g (0.37 mmol/g, 0.59 wt %) and 5.7 cm3/g (0.25 mmol/g, 0.41 wt %) at 273 and 295 K, respectively. However, the adsorption values for N2 are only negligible. The results clearly demonstrate that the cavity of 1' is mainly reachable to CO2.\n\nEncouraged by relatively high CO2 uptake as compared to other gases, we investigated the selective CO2 adsorption capacity of 1' over N2 and CH4. The selectivity (S) of CO2 over other gases was determined on the basis of single-component adsorption isotherms, by using the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) (a,b). At 273 K, the CO2/N2 selectivity is calculated as 116.6, while CO2/CH4 selectivity is found to be 12.9 (Figure S14). Although the kinetic diameter of CH4 (3.8 \u00c5) is larger than that of N2 (3.64 \u00c5), the greater polarizability of the former (26 \u00d7 10-25 cm3) over N2 (17.6 \u00d7 10-25 cm3) attributes the favorable CH4 adsorption, and not to any consequence of size exclusion. Thus, the \u03c0-electron availability in the framework facilitates the CH4 molecules to interact with the structure and get adsorbed. The moderate enthalpy of CO2 adsorption as well as good CO2 selectivity over CH4 and N2 may be reasonable considering the ample uncoordinated N-heteroatom on the inner surface of the narrow cavities (vide supra). This benefits the interaction with CO2 that has greater polarizability and a larger quadrupole moment than CH4 and N2.\n\nAt the onset, the apohost 1' was dispersed in a series of organic solvents (1 mg in 20 mL of each solvent), and individual suspensions were excited at the excitation wavelength to determine the best suited solvent for fluorescence experiment. As evidenced in Figure S16, both DMF and THF dispersions show maximum emission intensity upon excitation at 271 and 258 nm, respectively. Nevertheless, the DMF dispersion of 1' displays humps at 334 and 400 nm due to the n-\u03c0* or \u03c0-\u03c0* transitions, which correlate the presence of free nitrogen atom and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction between the ligands in the framework. The THF dispersion, however, does not comprise any such features. Furthermore, the UV-vis spectrum of 1' in DMF shows a blue shift of 20 nm to that of free ligand (Figure S18a) due to the strong interaction of Cd(II) ions with bifunctional ligands.

Noticeably, the addition of 200 \u03bcL (a) of TNP significantly quenches the luminescent intensity with a high 85.6% quenching efficiency (Figure S19), without showing any significant spectral changes (such as shifts in \u03bbmax). We used the equation (I 0 - I)/I 0 \u00d7 100% to calculate the quenching efficiency of 1', where I and I 0 stand for the emission intensities after and before the addition of nitro compounds, respectively. In the case of nitro phenols, quenching competence was found in the order TNP > 2,4-DNP > NP (Figure S20) that is in line with the increasing number of nitro groups in the analysts. However, other nitro analytes show moderate to poor quenching effects (Figures S21-S27), demonstrating high sensitivity of 1' toward phenolic nitroaromatics over potentially interfering nonphenolic nitro compounds. We speculate that such selective sensing of phenolic nitroaromatics might stem from strong intermolecular interactions between the -OH group and free Lewis basic N atoms of the triazole moieties.\n\nWith the aim of gaining insight about quenching phenomena, the gradual decrease in fluorescence intensity of 1' by the addition of every nitro analyte at different concentrations was measured. We examined the quantitative fluorescent quenching efficiency of 1' to TNP by using the Stern-Vo\u0308lmer (S-V) equation (I 0/I) = 1 + K SV[Q], where I is the fluorescence intensity at TNP concentration of [Q], and I 0 signifies the initial fluorescence intensity of the MOF.

The observed nonlinearity for TNP can be credited to the concurrent existence of static and dynamic quenching phenomena as well as energy relocation between TNP and 1'. A linear fit of the plot between 0 and 0.04 mM produced a remarkable quenching constant of 9.3 \u00d7 104 M-1 (Figure S28), which is many times higher than those for the rest of the analytes.

Initially, a 10-2 (M) solution was prepared by dissolving diverse sets of metal-chloride (MCl2/MCl3) (M = Zn2+, Cu2+, Co2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, Hg2+, Ni2+, Fe3+, Pb2+, La3+) salts in DMF. The photoluminescence behavior of a well-dispersed solution of 1' (1 mg in 2 mL of DMF) was observed by the incremental addition of 200 \u03bcL of the individual metal solution in chronological manner. Interestingly, among all other metal ions (Figures S32-S40), only Cu2+ shows drastic quenching of emission intensity of the framework upon addition of 200 \u03bcL of the CuCl2 solution (a).

The trend in quenching follows the order: Cu2+ > Fe3+ > Ni2+ > Pb2+ > Co2+ > Ca2+ > Hg2+ > Zn2+ > La3+ > Mn2+.\n\nFurthermore, to quantify the quenching constant (K SV), S-V plots were obtained by plotting relative fluorescence intensity [(I 0/I)] against molar concentration [Q] of Cu2+ ion. A linear curve was obtained in a lower concentration range (0-0.5 mM). On the basis of the linear fitting, the K SV value of 1' for Cu2+ was found to be 4.4 \u00d7 103 M-1 (Figure S42), which is considerably larger than the value for other metal ions. However, the curve deviates from linearity at higher concentration range (b), indicating the synchronous presence of static and dynamic quenching mechanisms. Furthermore, the limit of detection (LOD) of 1' toward Cu2+ was calculated to be 3.9 ppm (16.9 \u03bcM), following the equation: LOD = 3\u03c3/K (Table S4), where each term bears its own significance (vide supra).
