The relatively rigid MOFs have difficulty absorbing more water through expansion, as Nafion does. When MOFs are added to a Nafion matrix, the overall flexibility of the formed composite membranes is slightly impaired. Therefore, water uptake capacity and area swelling capacity are not as good as those of the pure Nafion membrane.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 33, "type": "text", "classification": ["property"], "content": "<p>Proton\nconductivity is an important parameter for evaluating the\nperformance of the proton exchange membrane; in particular, the conductivity\nat low humidity has a higher reference value.

The proton-conducting paths will be more diverse,\nthereby increasing the proton conductivity of MOFs.</p><p>Water vapor\nadsorption isotherms are used to study the relationship\nbetween the relative humidity and adsorbed water molecules (). The as-synthesized samples are\nimmersed in acetone for 2 days to exchange the solvent molecules inside\nthe frameworks and then dried in vacuum at 60 \u00b0C for 24 h. The\nsolution is then replaced with fresh acetone three times a day while\nsoaking. This activation pretreatment is to remove lattice H<sub>2</sub>O as much as possible, to make room for the absorption of water molecules\nfrom the environment. With the increase in relative pressure (relative\nhumidity), the adsorption capacity of water molecules increases gradually.\nWhen <italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>/<italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>\n<sub>0</sub> is 0.99 (close\nto 100% RH), the adsorption capacities of MOF-azo, MOF-bpy, and MOF-bpe\nreach the maximum values of 378.5, 264.5, and 215.4 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, respectively, which means the higher the relative humidity, the\nmore water molecules are adsorbed by these MOFs. For MOF-azo and MOF-bpy,\ntheir water vapor adsorption isotherms show type IV characteristics. When <italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>/<italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>\n<sub>0</sub> is &lt;0.2,\nthe isotherm is relatively flat. The rapid adsorption begins from\na <italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>/<italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>\n<sub>0</sub> of 0.3 because\nthe capillary condensation of water vapor occurs.

The notable hysteresis before a <italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>/<italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>\n<sub>0</sub> of 0.8 may also account for the fact\nthat each [Ni<sub>1.5</sub>(L)\u00ad(4,4\u2032-azobpy)\u00ad(H<sub>2</sub>O)]\nunit and each [Ni<sub>1.5</sub>(L)\u00ad(4,4\u2032-bpy)\u00ad(H<sub>2</sub>O)]\nunit adsorb more free water molecules than the initial unactivated\nsamples. The adsorbed\nwater molecules can combine with each other to form rich hydrogen\nbond networks, which can be expanded by other hydrogen bonds formed\nbetween lattice water in 1D hydrophilic channels and carboxyl oxygen\natoms. The strong affinity maintained by hydrogen bonding interaction\nmakes the release of water molecules extremely slow, thus showing\na distinct hysteresis. MOF-bpe exhibits a type I isotherm. In the low-pressure region (<italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>/<italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>\n<sub>0</sub> = 0\u20130.3), the adsorption capacity increases sharply,\nindicating that the cavity is filled as much as possible by adsorbed\nwater vapor. Then, the isotherm shows a platform with a slow rising\ntrend, which stemmed from the condensation of water vapor on the external\nsurface of MOF-bpe, which is deeply inspired by the previous report. There are two  fewer adsorbed water molecules\nin each [Ni<sub>1.5</sub>(L)\u00ad(bpe)\u00ad(H<sub>2</sub>O)] unit than in the\nunactivated sample, which is ascribed to incomplete removal of lattice\nwater molecules during the activation process.</p><p>N<sub>2</sub> adsorption isotherms\n(<ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.1c01107/suppl_file/ic1c01107_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S3</ext-link>) collected at 77 K are used to evaluate their intrinsic\nporosity.

Explorations of the method of preparation of proton conductive MOFs and the proton transfer mechanism have enabled them to attract widespread attention, and tremendous efforts have been made to improve the proton conductivity of MOFs. On the basis of our previous work, we explicitly propose that ligand exchange can upgrade the proton conduction performance of MOFs. Using MOF-azo as the precursor, the proton conductivities of exchange products MOF-bpy and MOF-bpe increase by 3.5- and 2.8-fold, respectively. After the MOFs had been doped into the Nafion matrix to prepare composite membranes, the proton conduction performance of composite membranes filled with subproducts (2.6 \u00d7 10-2 and 1.95 \u00d7 10-2 S cm-1) is significantly better than that of a composite membrane filled with a parent product (1.12 \u00d7 10-2 S cm-1) under ambient conditions (without heating or humidifying). The ligand exchange strategy presented herein demonstrates great promise for the development of high-proton conductivity MOFs and MOF composites with expanded future applications.\n\nThe proton conduction performance of Ni-MOFs and Nafion/Ni-MOF composite membranes is significantly improved by a ligand exchange strategy. Under ambient conditions, the proton conductivities of Nafion/MOF-bpy and Nafion/MOF-bpe reach ultrahigh values of 2.6 \u00d7 10-2 and 1.95 \u00d7 10-2 S cm-1, respectively, which are 2.3- and 1.7-fold higher than that of Nafion/MOF-azo, respectively.\n\nIn this work, MOF-bpy and MOF-bpe were obtained by ligand exchange using MOF-azo as the precursor. An alternating current impedance test shows the proton conductivities of MOF-bpy and MOF-bpe are 1.27 \u00d7 10-3 and 1.01 \u00d7 10-3 S cm-1, respectively, at 100% relative humidity (RH) and 95 \u00b0C, which are 3.5- and 2.8-fold higher than that of the original MOF-azo, respectively. These MOFs are doped into the Nafion matrix to yield composite membranes. The proton conductivities of Nafion/MOF-bpy and Nafion/MOF-bpe are calculated to be 2.6 \u00d7 10-2 and 1.95 \u00d7 10-2 S cm-1, respectively, being 2.3- and 1.7-fold higher than that of Nafion/MOF-azo (1.12 \u00d7 10-2 S cm-1), respectively.\n\nThe humidity dependence of proton conduction is shown in Tables S1-S3. At 58% RH and 90 \u00b0C, the observed proton conductivities of MOF-azo, MOF-bpy, and MOF-bpe are 3.61 \u00d7 10-6, 6.09 \u00d7 10-6, and 5.54 \u00d7 10-6 S cm-1, respectively. With the RH improving to 87%, the conductivity values increase to 3.85 \u00d7 10-5, 5.61 \u00d7 10-5, and 5.83 \u00d7 10-5 S cm-1, respectively. When the humidity reaches 100%, the conductivities increase to 3.15 \u00d7 10-4, 7.29 \u00d7 10-4, and 8.31 \u00d7 10-4 S cm-1, respectively. The proton conductivity increases with relative humidity, clearly demonstrating the water-mediated proton conduction process. In the closed system, a higher humidity can contribute more water, which is adsorbed by MOFs and enters the crystal lattices. The adsorbed water is connected together with the lattice water through hydrogen bonds to form a proton conductive network. More water is adsorbed, and a larger and denser proton conductive network is generated. The proton-conducting paths will be more diverse, thereby increasing the proton conductivity of MOFs.\n\nWater vapor adsorption isotherms are used to study the relationship between the relative humidity and adsorbed water molecules (). The as-synthesized samples are immersed in acetone for 2 days to exchange the solvent molecules inside the frameworks and then dried in vacuum at 60 \u00b0C for 24 h. The solution is then replaced with fresh acetone three times a day while soaking. This activation pretreatment is to remove lattice H2O as much as possible, to make room for the absorption of water molecules from the environment. With the increase in relative pressure (relative humidity), the adsorption capacity of water molecules increases gradually. When P/P 0 is 0.99 (close to 100% RH), the adsorption capacities of MOF-azo, MOF-bpy, and MOF-bpe reach the maximum values of 378.5, 264.5, and 215.4 cm3/g, respectively, which means the higher the relative humidity, the more water molecules are adsorbed by these MOFs. For MOF-azo and MOF-bpy, their water vapor adsorption isotherms show type IV characteristics. When P/P 0 is <0.2, the isotherm is relatively flat. The rapid adsorption begins from a P/P 0 of 0.3 because the capillary condensation of water vapor occurs. After a P/P 0 of 0.7, vapor adsorption occurs only on the MOFs' outer surface whose area is much smaller than the inner surface area, so the isotherms tend to be stable. The notable hysteresis before a P/P 0 of 0.8 may also account for the fact that each [Ni1.5(L)(4,4'-azobpy)(H2O)] unit and each [Ni1.5(L)(4,4'-bpy)(H2O)] unit adsorb more free water molecules than the initial unactivated samples. The adsorbed water molecules can combine with each other to form rich hydrogen bond networks, which can be expanded by other hydrogen bonds formed between lattice water in 1D hydrophilic channels and carboxyl oxygen atoms. The strong affinity maintained by hydrogen bonding interaction makes the release of water molecules extremely slow, thus showing a distinct hysteresis. MOF-bpe exhibits a type I isotherm. In the low-pressure region (P/P 0 = 0-0.3), the adsorption capacity increases sharply, indicating that the cavity is filled as much as possible by adsorbed water vapor. Then, the isotherm shows a platform with a slow rising trend, which stemmed from the condensation of water vapor on the external surface of MOF-bpe, which is deeply inspired by the previous report. There are two  fewer adsorbed water molecules in each [Ni1.5(L)(bpe)(H2O)] unit than in the unactivated sample, which is ascribed to incomplete removal of lattice water molecules during the activation process.\n\nN2 adsorption isotherms (Figure S3) collected at 77 K are used to evaluate their intrinsic porosity. MOF-azo, MOF-bpy, and MOF-bpe have adsorption capacities of 11, 10, and 12 cm3/g, respectively, and their BET surface areas are calculated to be 2.3, 1.6, and 2.3 m2/g, respectively. The lack of adsorption sites in their frameworks and the larger kinetic diameter of N2 molecules may be the reasons for the low nitrogen adsorption capacity. The kinetic diameter of a H2O molecule (2.6 \u00c5) is 1 \u00c5 smaller than that of a N2 molecule (3.6 \u00c5). In this sense, MOFs can adsorb as many H2O molecules as possible instead of N2. As adsorption sites of water molecules, the 1D water chain in the c axis channel can form hydrogen bonds with the adsorbed H2O, which further enhances the water vapor adsorption capacity of MOFs. This explains the difference between nitrogen adsorption capacity and water vapor adsorption capacity.\n\nThe temperature-dependent proton conducting behavior of MOF-azo, MOF-bpy, and MOF-bpe can be observed at every humidity (Figures S4-S6). For example, at 93% RH and 40 \u00b0C, their proton conductivities are found to be 4.18 \u00d7 10-5, 5.07 \u00d7 10-5, and 5.15 \u00d7 10-5 S cm-1, then increase to 5.29 \u00d7 10-5, 6.72 \u00d7 10-5, and 6.83 \u00d7 10-5 S cm-1 at 60 \u00b0C, and then increase to 9.04 \u00d7 10-5, 1.40 \u00d7 10-4, and 1.33 \u00d7 10-4 S cm-1 at 90 \u00b0C, respectively. At 100% RH and 30 \u00b0C, the conductivity values of MOF-azo, MOF-bpy, and MOF-bpe are calculated to be 1.60 \u00d7 10-4, 2.45 \u00d7 10-4, and 3.06 \u00d7 10-4 S cm-1, then increase to 2.50 \u00d7 10-4, 4.22 \u00d7 10-4, and 5.78 \u00d7 10-4 S cm-1 at 70 \u00b0C, and finally reach maximum values of 3.63 \u00d7 10-4, 1.27 \u00d7 10-3, and 1.07 \u00d7 10-3 S cm-1 at 95 \u00b0C, respectively. Obviously, their proton conductivities gradually increase with temperature. This is mainly due to the boost in the internal energy of the electrolyte system caused by the increasing temperature, which accelerates the rate of mobility of proton carriers and facilitates the proton transfer through a path separated by a smaller energy barrier.\n\nThe water uptake capacity of Nafion/MOF composite membranes at room temperature is germane to proton conduction performance under ambient conditions. The water uptake and area swelling were calculated to be 37% and 21% for Nafion/MOF-azo, 36% and 19% for Nafion/MOF-bpy, 33% and 18% for Nafion/MOF-bpe, and 43% and 29% for pure Nafion, respectively.
