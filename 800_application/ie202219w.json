IAST is based upon three assumptions: (i) that the same surface area is available to all adsorbates, (ii) that the adsorbent is inert, and (iii) that the multicomponent mixture behaves as an ideal solution (such that the mean strength of interaction is equal between all molecules of the solution) at constant spreading pressure and temperature. For a given component, i, in an ideal adsorbed phase 1    f\u0305   i   =   f   i   0    ( \u03c0 )    x   i    where f\u0305  i  is the fugacity of pure component i in the bulk gas phase, f  i  0 is the fugacity for component i at the solution temperature, T, and the spreading pressure, \u03c0, of the binary mixture when the adsorbed and bulk gas phases are in equilibrium, and x  i  is the mole fraction of component i in the adsorbed phase. For each component, f  i  0 and \u03c0 are related via the integrated Gibbs isotherm: 2    \u03c0 A   R T   =   \u222b   0     f   i   0        n   i   \u2061 d \u2061 ln \u2061   f   i     where n  i  is the amount adsorbed of component i (obtained from the single-component adsorption isotherm) at pressure, P, which, in this work, was related to the component fugacity, f  i , using the Peng-Robinson equation of state. A is the surface area of the adsorbent, and R is the ideal gas constant. At equilibrium, each component has the same spreading pressure: 3  \u03c0 =   \u03c0   i   =   \u03c0   j   \u2063 i \u2260 j  Since the sum of the mole fractions of all components in the adsorbed phase is equal to 1, eq  can be rearranged to give the following identity: 4    \u2211   i        f\u0305   i       f   i   0    ( \u03c0 )    - 1 = 0   which can be solved for a given f\u0305  i  for each component to obtain the value of f  i  0 for each component. Thus, the adsorbed phase composition, x  i , can be calculated from eq  and the number of moles, n  i  0, of component i that would be adsorbed from the pure gas at f  i  0(\u03c0) can be found from the single-component isotherm for each component. The total amount adsorbed of the mixture, n t, is determined using the expression 5    1     n   t     = \u2211      x   i       n   i   0       The actual number of moles adsorbed of each component is then 6    n   i   =   x   i     n   t    To calculate the spreading pressure using eq , the functional forms of the single-component isotherms must be specified by fitting a continuous function to a discrete set of adsorption data obtained over a finite range of pressures. Therefore, in this work, IAST was applied to single-component adsorption isotherms fitted using an isotherm equation proposed by Jensen and Seaton:  7  n  ( P )  = K P    { 1 +   (   K P   \u03b1  ( 1 + \u03ba P )    )   c   }    - 1 / c    where n(P) is the adsorbed amount, K is the Henry's law constant, \u03b1 is a measure of capacity, c determines the radius of curvature of the isotherm, and \u03ba accounts for the compressibility of the adsorbed phase. An inherent feature of IAST is that prediction of multicomponent adsorption requires extrapolation of the single-component isotherms outside the range of pressures over which the data were collected and to which the form of the isotherm was fitted and specified. This is a consequence of the equality of component spreading pressures at equilibrium and because, as shown in eq , the spreading pressure is related to the amount adsorbed, data for the less strongly adsorbed component are extrapolated to a greater extent. Extrapolation of single-component adsorption data can introduce a degree of uncertainty in IAST predictions. Therefore, the use of an equation which accounts for the compressibility of the adsorbed phase and, in so doing, provides an accurate description of adsorption behavior at high pressures is advantageous when assessing the applicability of IAST.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 7, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Departures from IAST may be attributed\nto the dissimilarity of\nthe adsorbate molecules and to the heterogeneity of the adsorbent.
