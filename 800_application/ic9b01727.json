As the sweep speed increases from 0.2 to 1.2 mV s-1, the shapes of the CV curves remain analogous. Notably, the intrinsic relationship between the capacitance and diffusion can be qualitatively considered by the measured current (i) and scanning rate (v) with the equation i = av  b , where a is an adjustable constant and the power coefficient b is an indicator of stored charge kinetics in the electrode. The electrochemical reaction is dominated by Li+ diffusion when b is approaches 0.5, while the reaction is controlled by both diffusion-controlled and surface-induced capacitive processes if the value of b is between 0.5 and 1.0. b displays log i versus logv plots of peaks 1 and 2, whose slopes (b value) are 0.685 and 0.644, demonstrating that the behavior of LiCoO2/CNTs@AlF3 is primarily controlled by the surface process, achieving better rate capability and extended cycle stability than merely diffusion-controlled reactions. By separation of the current response i at the fixed potential into a capacitive effect (k 2 v) and diffusion control (k 1 v 1/2), the contribution of the capacitance and diffusion can be further quantified with the equation i (V) = k 1 v 1/2 + k 2 v. Thus, we distinguished the contribution by plotting i (V)/v 1/2 versus v 1/2 to define k 1 and k 2. On the basis of the results, the total voltage profile of the CV curve at 0.8 mV s-1 (c) has been divided into a diffusion area (blue-shaded region) and a dominated capacitance area (red-shaded region; the calculated capacitive contribution of 57.21%). Meanwhile, data of the two contributions are summarized in d, which shows an ascendant tendency of the pseudocapacitive contribution as the scan rate increases.
