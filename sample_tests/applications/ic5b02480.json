To our best knowledge, NBU-3 is the first example\nof a MOF material containing both photochromic and electrochromic\nfeatures. These results provide a useful contribution to the design\nand construction of photochromic MOF materials based on photoinduced\nelectron-transfer chemical processes. These materials can be used\nas potential electro-optical switches and memory devices in molecular\nelectronics.", "data": [{}], "include_properties": ["photochromic", "electrochromic"]}, {"idx": 15, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information\nis available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5b02480\">10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5b02480</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Experimental preparation,\ncrystal structure, UV/vis\nand emission spectra, and cyclic voltammograms.
