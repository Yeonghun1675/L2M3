Furthermore, it was confirmed by the dynamic NMR,\nNOE differential, and CD spectroscopies that during the shuttling\nprocess in DMSO, the \u03b1-CD ring moved to the azobenzene moiety\nat temperatures below 100 \u00b0C, while after the temperatures reached\nabove 100 \u00b0C, it was displaced between the azobenzene moiety\nand the propylene moieties. Thus, the shuttling distance could be\ncontrolled by temperature.
