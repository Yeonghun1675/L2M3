Figure S4a, b show the cross-sectional SEM view\nof the FTO/TiO2-bl/TiO2-mp electrode before\nand after sensitization of TiO2-mp film with Co-DAPV. The\ncross-section shown in Figure S4b reveals\nthe deposition of Co-DAPV sensitizer throughout the TiO2-mp film. After deposition of approximately 100 nm-thick Au film,\nand illuminating under 1 sun radiation, the device demonstrated the\ncharacteristic photovoltaic J\u2013V curve, as\nshown in Figure S4c. From this J\u2013V curve, the flowing values of photovoltaic parameters\nwere obtained: V\noc = 0.62 V, J\nsc = 3.51 mA cm\u20132, FF = 0.41, Eff =\n0.78%. The poor device performance observed in this case could be\ndue to the relatively thick TiO2-mp film (i.e., \u223c4\n\u03bcm) that critically influences the interfacial recombination\nin solid-state devices, limiting the maximum power conversion efficiency.\nHence, optimization on thickness of TiO2-mp film was performed\nby depositing the film using spin coating method at various revolution\nper minute (rpm) of the spin speed. Figure S5 shows the characteristic J\u2013V curves of the\ndevices with TiO2-mp film deposited at various rpm and\nsensitized with Co-DAPV for 20 LbL cycles. The values of photovoltaic\nparameters obtained from the J\u2013V curves are\ntabulated in Table S1. Thus, the device\nwith TiO2-mp film deposited at 2000 rpm demonstrated the\nhighest power conversion efficiency of 1.12%. Further, keeping the\n2000 rpm spin speed for deposition of TiO2-mp film, optimization\non number of LbL cycle for deposition of Co-DAPV sensitizer was performed.\nWith increasing the number of LbL cycles, the degree of visible light\nabsorption increased, as shown by UV/Visible absorption spectra in Figure S6, suggesting that amount of sensitizer\nincreased with increasing the number of LbL cycles. a shows the characteristic J\u2013V curves of the devices with TiO2-mp\nfilm deposited at 2000 rpm and sensitized with Co-DAPV using various\nnumber of LbL cycles. The values of photovoltaic parameters obtained\nfrom the J\u2013V curves are tabulated in . Hence, after optimizing\nthe TiO2-mp film thickness and LbL cycles for sensitization,\nthe cell demonstrated the best photovoltaic performance with V\noc = 0.67 V, J\nsc = 4.92 mA cm\u20132, FF = 0.57, and Eff = 2.10%. This\nis the maximum power conversion efficiency achieved among five device\nreplicas, while the power conversion efficiency of as low as 1.80%\nwas observed in this preliminary study.
