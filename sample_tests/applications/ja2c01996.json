It can be convincingly concluded\nthat the huge differences in cycling performance of the less Li||LFP\nfull batteries can be ascribed to the significant differences in surface\nmorphology of various less Li anodes.

After the current density was reduced to 3.0, 2.0, and 1.0 C again,\na substantially fluctuating CE and a continuously attenuated discharge\ncapacity could be observed, indicating the failure of batteries under\nhigh current densities. The superior rate performance of Li@Ni-TAA/Cu\nand Li@Ni-TAP/Cu anodes originated from the lower polarization and\nbetter reaction kinetics than the Li@Bare Cu anode, which was confirmed\nby the smaller potential differences between the charge/discharge\nplateaus corresponding to Li@Ni-TAA/Cu and Li@Ni-TAP/Cu anodes (c\u2013f).</p>", "clean_text": "Symmetric and\nFull Cell Cycling Performance\nTo further\ndemonstrate the crucial role of the coated Ni-TAA and Ni-TAP in regulating\nuniform Li deposition and inhibiting Li dendrite growth, well-designed\nless Li||less Li symmetric batteries and less Li||LFP full batteries\nwere assembled and tested by employing special less Li anodes.

Cu electrodes plated with\nLi were subsequently retrieved from the cycled batteries, regarded\nas the less Li anodes, which finally were assembled into symmetric\nbatteries or paired with LFP cathodes to fabricate less Li||LFP full\nbatteries. The rate performance and cycling stability of symmetric\nbatteries using Li@Ni-TAA/Cu, Li@Ni-TAP/Cu, and Li@Bare Cu electrodes\nwere first examined at various current densities from 1.0 to 5.0 mA\ncm\u20132 with a fixed capacity of 1.0 mA h cm\u20132 (Figure S37). With the increase of current\ndensity, the Li@bare Cu electrodes showed sharply increased overpotentials,\nand irregular and asymmetric voltage curves could be observed at high\ncurrent densities (Figure S37a), indicating\nthe cycling instability of symmetric batteries with Li@bare Cu electrodes.\nIn contrast, stable Li plating/stripping processes with significantly\ndecreased voltage hysteresis at various current densities could be\nachieved when employing Li@Ni-TAA/Cu and Li@Ni-TAP/Cu electrodes (Figure S37b\u2013f). Especially, at the high\ncurrent of 5.0 mA cm\u20132, the symmetric batteries\nwith Li@Ni-TAA/Cu and Li@Ni-TAP/Cu electrodes delivered markedly reduced\noverpotentials of 136 and 151 mV, respectively, suggesting the excellent\nmass-transfer kinetics (Figure S37f). Moreover,\nelectrochemical resistances and exchange current densities of various\nsymmetric batteries were also tested based on the Nyquist plots and\nTafel curves, respectively (Figure S38).\nBoth electrolyte resistances and interfacial resistances of the symmetric\nbatteries with Li@Bare Cu were much higher than those with Li@Ni-TAA/Cu\nand Li@Ni-TAP/Cu (Figure S38a), indicating\nthat the formed solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Li@Ni-TAA/Cu\nand Li@Ni-TAP/Cu possessed outstanding mass-transfer kinetics, which\ncould also explain why Ni-TAA/Cu and Ni-TAP/Cu exhibited lower mass-transfer\noverpotentials during Li plating processes. The same conclusion was\nalso drawn by calculating the exchange current densities. The batteries\nassembled with Li@Ni-TAA/Cu and Li@Ni-TAP/Cu delivered significantly\nenhanced exchange current densities of 1.055 and 0.849 mA cm\u20132, respectively, much higher than that of batteries with Li@Bare Cu\n(i\n0 = 0.475 mA cm\u20132)\n(Figure S38b), which further suggested\nthat the Ni-TAA and Ni-TAP guiding layers possessed ultrahigh ionic\nconductivity and enabled fast Li plating/stripping kinetics. The assembly\nand testing of full batteries proved the practical application potential\nof Li@Ni-TAA/Cu and Li@Ni-TAP/Cu. As shown in a, significant differences in long-term cycling\nstability could be observed. The batteries based on Li@Ni-TAA/Cu and\nLi@Ni-TAP/Cu anodes exhibited markedly extended cycling lifespans\nand improved CEs, delivering considerable discharge capacities of\n140.3 and 122.3 mA h g\u20131, respectively, even after\n400 cycles at 1.0 C. The higher capacity of Ni-TAA@Cu than Ni-TAP@Cu\nshould be attributed to its higher porosity and larger surface area.\nIn sharp contrast, the batteries based on bare Cu with deposited Li\nanodes experienced rapid capacity decay and suffered from an obvious\nfailure only after 138 cycles, displaying a CE attenuated to zero\nand an ultralow discharge capacity. It can be convincingly concluded\nthat the huge differences in cycling performance of the less Li||LFP\nfull batteries can be ascribed to the significant differences in surface\nmorphology of various less Li anodes. Benefiting from the superior\nlithiophilicity and Li-electrodeposition regulating effect of Ni-TAA\nand Ni-TAP, a uniform and dense surface without any visible dendrites\nof Li@Ni-TAA/Cu and Li@Ni-TAP/Cu anodes can be achieved (Figure S30), which is greatly conducive to enhancing\nLi utilization, accelerating Li-ion transfer, and finally ensuring\noutstanding cycling stability. Furthermore, the rate performance of\nLi||LFP full batteries assembled with the various anodes was also\nexamined under different current densities from 1.0 to 5.0 C (b). When employing\nLi@Ni-TAA/Cu and Li@Ni-TAP/Cu as anodes, the batteries showed a boosted\nrate capability, especially at the high rate of 5.0 C, delivering\nwell-maintained reversible capacities of 126.2 mA h g\u20131 for Li@Ni-TAA/Cu and 108.5 mA h g\u20131 for Li@Ni-TAP/Cu.\nAfter the current density returned to 1.0 C, the batteries based on\nLi@Ni-TAP/Cu and Li@Ni-TAP/Cu were still capable of maintaining superior\ncycling stability, delivering recovered average discharge capacities\nof 150.1 and 140.8 mA h g\u20131, respectively. However,\nfor the batteries with Li@Bare Cu, a significant discharge capacity\ndecrease was exhibited with increasing current density, especially\nat 5.0 C; the discharge capacity decayed to 59.8 mA h g\u20131. After the current density was reduced to 3.0, 2.0, and 1.0 C again,\na substantially fluctuating CE and a continuously attenuated discharge\ncapacity could be observed, indicating the failure of batteries under\nhigh current densities. The superior rate performance of Li@Ni-TAA/Cu\nand Li@Ni-TAP/Cu anodes originated from the lower polarization and\nbetter reaction kinetics than the Li@Bare Cu anode, which was confirmed\nby the smaller potential differences between the charge/discharge\nplateaus corresponding to Li@Ni-TAA/Cu and Li@Ni-TAP/Cu anodes (c\u2013f).", "data": [{"thermal_conductivity": {"thermal conductivity": []}, "thermal_expansion_coefficient": {"thermal expansion coefficient": []}}], "include_properties": ["thermal_conductivity", "thermal_expansion_coefficient"]}, {"idx": 18, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig4\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Electrochemical\nperformances of less Li||LFP full batteries assembled\nwith Li@Ni-TAA/Cu, Li@Ni-TAP/Cu, and Li@Bare Cu anodes.
