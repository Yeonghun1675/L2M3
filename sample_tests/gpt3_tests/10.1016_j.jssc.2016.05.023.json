The emission peaks of 2 are close to free H4L ligand, so the emission bands of 2 can probably be attributed to the intra-ligand charge transfer (ILCT). Experimental results show that compound 3 is non-emissive under similar conditions, indicating the emissions of organic ligands may be quenched completely in the compound, which may be due to the emission quencher of Co (\u2161) in the structure. In term of the structures and emission spectra of compound 1 and 2, it is inferred that different ligands co-ligands may be an important factor on influencing different luminescent properties of compounds .", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 34, "type": "text", "classification": ["synthesis condition", "property"], "content": "<ce:section-title id=\"sect0100\">Conclusions</ce:section-title><ce:para id=\"p0095\" view=\"all\">In summary, we successfully designed and synthesized three coordination polymers based on flexible multicarboxylic acid 5,5\u2032-(butane-1,4-diyl)-bis(oxy)-diisophthalic acid (H<ce:inf loc=\"post\">4</ce:inf>L), and one rigid ancillary bridging pyridine linkers 4,4\u2032 -bipyridine (4,4\u2032-bpy) for <ce:bold>1</ce:bold>, one flexible ancillary imidazole linkers 1,4-bis (1H-imidazol-1-yl)-butane (bib) for <ce:bold>2</ce:bold> and <ce:bold>3</ce:bold>.
