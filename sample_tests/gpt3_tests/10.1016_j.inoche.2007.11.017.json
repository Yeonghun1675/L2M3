The non-zero \u201cground\u201d state of 1 can be explained by considering carefully the structural details of the complex. There are two different superexchange pathways, both provided by the ligand L2\u2212, and thus two different kinds of J values (\na; from now onwards the numbering scheme that will be used is the same with that used in the real structure of 1, see ). The magnetic data, which are indicative of the presence of one unpaired electron for each CuII triad, suggest that one of the pathways is not magnetically operative. Taking into account that (i) J\n2 propagates the antiferromagnetic interaction in the three dimensions, and (ii) the quinoxaline bridge is a weak to moderate, but effective mediator of magnetic exchange interactions , we decided to fit the data assuming a negligible value of J\n2. Since the J\n1 interaction creates pseudo isolated Cu(2)\u22efCu(1)\u22efCu(2) subunits of the type shown in b (see also ), we used the Hamiltonian of Eq. , including a \u0398 term in an attempt to adjust the low temperature data. Best-fit parameters are J\n1\n=\u221210.4(3)cm\u22121, g\n=2.057(6) and \u0398\n=+1.1(1)K.\n\n(1)\n\nH\n=\n-\n\n\nJ\n\n\n1\n\n\n(\n\n\nS\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nS\n\n\n1\n\n\n+\n\n\nS\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nS\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2033\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\nThe obtained J value is in good agreement with reported values involving the exchange interaction between CuII ions through the quinoxaline bridging ligand, which is always weakly to moderately antiferromagnetic . The minimum in the \u03c7\nM\nT vs. T plot at 6K () indicates that J\n2 (see a) is not strictly zero.
