Complexes 1\u20133 have the 3D network structure. The central metals, reaction solvents and temperatures play crucial roles in the formation of complexes 1\u20133. The X-ray powder diffraction (PXRD) of the complexes 1\u20133 demonstrate that they have high phase purity. In addition, we studied thermal stabilities and fluorescent properties of complexes 1\u20133.
