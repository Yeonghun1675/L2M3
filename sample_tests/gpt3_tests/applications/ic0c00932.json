Temperature-dependent structural\npolymorphism was observed in the case of 2. We have showed\nselective adsorption of C2H2 by 2 and 2IR among other gases such as C2H4, C2H6, and CH4 under ambient\nconditions. This selectivity for C2H2 has been\nfurther exploited by a breakthrough measurement of the gas mixture\nC2H2/C2H4 (1/99 v/v).\nSuch a high selectivity and separation capacity can be attributed\nto the perfect window size of the 1D pore in compound 2, where C2H2 molecules can easily diffuse and\nstrongly interact with pores decorated with an aromatic \u03c0 cloud.\nIn contrast, the other small molecules with kinetic diameter relatively\nhigher than that of C2H2 cannot enter into the\n1D channel. This work may initiate more extensive studies on the size-\nand shape-controlled selective separation of small hydrocarbons which\nwill essentially pave the way for the synthesis of future novel high-performance\nadsorption base separating materials.", "data": [{"Mof name": "compound 2", "symbol": 2, "processes": [{"synthesis method": "chemical synthesis", "precursor1 name": "succinate", "precursor1 amount": "Not mentioned", "precursor2 name": "bpee", "precursor2 amount": "Not mentioned", "solution": "Not mentioned", "pressure": "Not mentioned", "temperature": "Not mentioned", "time": "Not mentioned"}], "yield": "Not mentioned", "chemical formula": "Not mentioned"}, {"Mof name": "compound 1", "symbol": 1, "processes": [{"synthesis method": "chemical synthesis", "precursor1 name": "p-phenylenediacetate", "precursor1 amount": "Not mentioned", "precursor2 name": "Not mentioned", "precursor2 amount": "Not mentioned", "solution": "Not mentioned", "pressure": "Not mentioned", "temperature": "Not mentioned", "time": "Not mentioned"}], "yield": "Not mentioned", "chemical formula": "Not mentioned"}, {"selectivity": {"selectivity": [{"value": "", "unit": "", "substrate": "C2H2", "catalyst": "", "pressure": "", "temperature": "", "solvent": "", "time": ""}]}}], "include_properties": ["chemical_synthesis", "selectivity"]}, {"idx": 35, "type": "text", "classification": ["synthesis condition"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information is\navailable free of charge at <ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c00932?goto=supporting-info\">https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c00932</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Crystallographic\ndata, IR and NMR spectra, TGA, PXRD,\nand adsorption plots and their detailed analysis (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c00932/suppl_file/ic0c00932_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is\navailable free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c00932.\n\nCrystallographic\ndata, IR and NMR spectra, TGA, PXRD,\nand adsorption plots and their detailed analysis (PDF)\n\n\n", "data": ["I do not know."], "include_properties": ["chemical_synthesis"]}, {"idx": 36, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Crystallographic\ndata, IR and NMR spectra, TGA, PXRD,\nand adsorption plots and their detailed analysis (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c00932/suppl_file/ic0c00932_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p><p>CCDC <ext-link ext-link-type=\"ccdc\" xlink:href=\"1972374\">1972374</ext-link>\u2013<ext-link ext-link-type=\"ccdc\" xlink:href=\"1972379\">1972379</ext-link> contain the supplementary crystallographic data\nfor this paper.
