Amorphous\nstructures and particles with crystalline size below 2 nm do not produce\ndiscernible diffraction patterns in conventional XRD, especially when the signals from the MOF are overwhelmingly\nintense. Thus, if only the surface region of an MOF is transformed\ninto amorphous phases with the thickness of a few nanometers while\nthe bulk MOF structure remains (partially degraded MOFs), the XRD\nresults before and after electrocatalysis would not show distinguishable\ndifferences, as many have pointed out.
