We attributed this high conductivity\nto the elevated number of sulfonic acid groups located at the outer\nsurface of SO\n\n3\n\nH-RhMOP\n\n\na\n\n and the resulting high\nwater adsorption capacity for both SO\n\n3\n\nH-RhMOP\n\n\na\n\n and SO\n\n3\n\nH-RhMOF\n\n\na\n\n. Thus, previously reported\nsulfonate-functionalized Zr-based MOP with six groups on its surface showed lower water adsorption capacity of \u223c240\ncm3 g\u20131 at 90% RH, exhibiting high conductivity\n(2.8 \u00d7 10\u20133 S cm\u20131) but one\norder of magnitude lower than SO\n\n3\n\nH-RhMOP\n\n\na\n\n. Likewise,\nthe difference between SO\n\n3\n\nH-RhMOP\n\n\na\n\n and SO\n\n3\n\nH-RhMOF\n\n\na\n\n conductivities can be ascribed to the\npresence of coordinated sulfonic acid groups in SO\n\n3\n\nH-RhMOF\n\n\na\n\n, which involves a smaller number of sulfonic acid\ngroups available for conduction (16 per cage) compared to SO\n\n3\n\nH-RhMOP\n\n\na\n\n (24 per cage).", "data": [{"Mof name": "SO3H-RhMOPa", "symbol": "Not mentioned", "processes": [{"synthesis method": "Not mentioned", "precursor": "Not mentioned", "solution": "Not mentioned", "pressure": "Not mentioned", "temperature": "Not mentioned", "time": "Not mentioned"}, {"synthesis method": "Not mentioned", "washing solution": "Not mentioned", "amount": "Not mentioned"}]}, {"Mof name": "SO3H-RhMOFa", "symbol": "Not mentioned", "processes": [{"synthesis method": "Not mentioned", "precursor": "Not mentioned", "solution": "Not mentioned", "pressure": "Not mentioned", "temperature": "Not mentioned", "time": "Not mentioned"}, {"synthesis method": "Not mentioned", "washing solution": "Not mentioned", "amount": "Not mentioned"}]}, {"etc": [{"material": "SO3-H-RhMOPa", "property name": "proton conductivity", "value": "3.2e-5", "unit": "S cm-1", "condition": "25 \u00b0C and 60% RH"}, {"material": "SO3-H-RhMOPa", "property name": "proton conductivity", "value": "1.2e-3", "unit": "S cm-1", "condition": "25 \u00b0C and 90% RH"}, {"material": "SO3-H-RhMOPa", "property name": "proton conductivity", "value": "2.5e-2", "unit": "S cm-1", "condition": "95 \u00b0C"}, {"material": "SO3-H-RhMOFa", "property name": "proton conductivity", "value": "4.4e-3", "unit": "S cm-1", "condition": "95 \u00b0C"}], "gas_adsorption": {"gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "water", "adsorbed amount": "high", "unit": "wt%", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "0.1 MPa"}]}}], "include_properties": ["chemical_synthesis", "washing", "etc", "gas_adsorption"]}, {"idx": 30, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig7\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>7</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Temperature dependence of the Nyquist\nplot for (a) <bold>SO</bold>\n<sub>\n<bold>3</bold>\n</sub>\n<bold>H-RhMOP</bold>\n<sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">\n<bold>a</bold>\n</italic>\n</sub> and (b) <bold>SO</bold>\n<sub>\n<bold>3</bold>\n</sub>\n<bold>H-RhMOF</bold>\n<sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">\n<bold>a</bold>\n</italic>\n</sub> at RH =\n90%.
