The corresponding point charges and Lennard-Jones\n(L-J) parameters are summarized in  and , respectively.\nFor some of these models, massless sites are required in order to\nachieve a better representation of the ESP surrounding the molecule\n(e.g., CO, COS, N2, and SO2 possess one massless\nsite and H2S two massless sites). We note that the location\nof massless sites and the charge assignment for H2S are\nadopted from our prior study directly (i.e., 5S-a model, see ref ), but with the L-J parameters\nbeing reparametrized.

Furthermore, with ESP-MMs, the predicted\nadsorption isotherms of CO and SO2 in Cu-BTC or all-silica\nMFI are also in decent agreement with experimental measurements. Furthermore,\nwe demonstrated that the accurate ESP representations described with\nESP-MMs remain the same when the molecules are in dimer configurations.\nOverall, our results demonstrate the key role of including ESP during\nthe development of molecular models. We anticipate that these proposed\nESP-MMs can be utilized to facilitate the future computational discovery\nand design of nanoporous materials for various applications.", "data": ["I do not know."], "include_properties": ["chemical_synthesis"]}, {"idx": 34, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting\nInformation\nis available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b00653\">10.1021/acs.jctc.9b00653</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Computational\ndetails, Lennard-Jones parameters of the\nCO\u00ad(COM), CO\u00ad(U), and CO\u00ad(M-C) models referred to in the main article,\nvapor\u2013liquid equilibrium figures computed with CO\u00ad(COM) model,\nCO<sub>2</sub>, COS, H<sub>2</sub>S, N<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O,\nand SO<sub>2</sub> ESP-MMs, and CO\u00ad(U) and CO\u00ad(M-C) models, binding\ngeometry of CO adsorbed in MOF-74 and Cu-BTC predicted with the CO\nESP-MM, binding energy of CO using ESP-MMs and previously developed\nmodels in MOF-74, adsorption isotherms of CO and SO<sub>2</sub> in\nMFI at 258 and 323 K, respectively, and dimer structures of H<sub>2</sub>S, SO<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O predicted\nusing DFT calculations (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b00653/suppl_file/ct9b00653_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting\nInformation\nis available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.9b00653.\n\nComputational\ndetails, Lennard-Jones parameters of the\nCO\u00ad(COM), CO\u00ad(U), and CO\u00ad(M-C) models referred to in the main article,\nvapor\u2013liquid equilibrium figures computed with CO\u00ad(COM) model,\nCO2, COS, H2S, N2, N2O,\nand SO2 ESP-MMs, and CO\u00ad(U) and CO\u00ad(M-C) models, binding\ngeometry of CO adsorbed in MOF-74 and Cu-BTC predicted with the CO\nESP-MM, binding energy of CO using ESP-MMs and previously developed\nmodels in MOF-74, adsorption isotherms of CO and SO2 in\nMFI at 258 and 323 K, respectively, and dimer structures of H2S, SO2, CO2, and H2O predicted\nusing DFT calculations (PDF)\n\n\n", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 35, "type": "text", "classification": ["synthesis condition"], "content": "<p>Computational\ndetails, Lennard-Jones parameters of the\nCO\u00ad(COM), CO\u00ad(U), and CO\u00ad(M-C) models referred to in the main article,\nvapor\u2013liquid equilibrium figures computed with CO\u00ad(COM) model,\nCO<sub>2</sub>, COS, H<sub>2</sub>S, N<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O,\nand SO<sub>2</sub> ESP-MMs, and CO\u00ad(U) and CO\u00ad(M-C) models, binding\ngeometry of CO adsorbed in MOF-74 and Cu-BTC predicted with the CO\nESP-MM, binding energy of CO using ESP-MMs and previously developed\nmodels in MOF-74, adsorption isotherms of CO and SO<sub>2</sub> in\nMFI at 258 and 323 K, respectively, and dimer structures of H<sub>2</sub>S, SO<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O predicted\nusing DFT calculations (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b00653/suppl_file/ct9b00653_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>", "clean_text": "Computational\ndetails, Lennard-Jones parameters of the\nCO\u00ad(COM), CO\u00ad(U), and CO\u00ad(M-C) models referred to in the main article,\nvapor\u2013liquid equilibrium figures computed with CO\u00ad(COM) model,\nCO2, COS, H2S, N2, N2O,\nand SO2 ESP-MMs, and CO\u00ad(U) and CO\u00ad(M-C) models, binding\ngeometry of CO adsorbed in MOF-74 and Cu-BTC predicted with the CO\nESP-MM, binding energy of CO using ESP-MMs and previously developed\nmodels in MOF-74, adsorption isotherms of CO and SO2 in\nMFI at 258 and 323 K, respectively, and dimer structures of H2S, SO2, CO2, and H2O predicted\nusing DFT calculations (PDF)", "data": [{"Mof name": "Not mentioned", "symbol": "Not mentioned", "processes": [], "yield": "Not mentioned", "chemical formula": "Not mentioned", "other properties": ["Computational", "vapor\u2013liquid_equilibrium_computation", "binding_geometry_prediction", "adsorption_isotherm_measurement", "dimer_structure_prediction"]}], "include_properties": ["computational", "vapor\u2013liquid_equilibrium_computation", "binding_geometry_prediction", "adsorption_isotherm_measurement", "dimer_structure_prediction"]}, {"idx": 36, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The manuscript\nwas written through contributions of all authors.
