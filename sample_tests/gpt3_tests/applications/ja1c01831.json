This result indicated\na gate-opening effect accompanied by a structural transformation during\nthe adsorption of water vapor. The desorption isotherm showed a small\nhysteresis with steep desorption at a RH of \u223c5%. This result\nindicated that the adsorbed water molecules could be easily and completely\nremoved from the pores (a). Moreover, we also tested the uptake quantities and speed\nof water vapor by ZPF-2-Co-\u03b2 under dynamic flow\nconditions at 298 K using the gravimetric method. For this experiment,\nN2 gas carrying water vapor (RH = 30%), the watershed to\nevaluate if adsorbents are suitable for water harvesting from the\nair, was passed over the activated MOF\nsample (activation detailed in Supporting Information). As shown in b, ZPF-2-Co-\u03b2 not only can capture water vapor\nfrom the gaseous stream (RH = 30%) in less than 10 min until 15 wt\n% but also can be regenerated in less than 20 min once the RH is decreased\nto approach 0%. This excellent performance allowed harvesting of an\nextrapolated amount of 7.20 L of water per kilogram of MOF per day.\nThis remarkable performance surpasses most of the benchmark MOF desiccants\nsuch as MOF-801\n and Co\n\n2\n\nCl\n\n2\n\nBTDD\n and even some\ncommercial sorbents such as Basolite A520, zeolite SAPO-34, and zeolite 13X for the arid environment,\nonly being lower than MOF-303 (thin layer) (c). In order to evaluate the reusability and stability of ZPF-2-Co-\u03b2, recycling the adsorption and desorption of water vapor for 50 cycles\nwas further checked. Impressively, we found that ZPF-2-Co-\u03b2 could complete the whole process in less than 40 min for each cycle\nwithout significant loss of the working capacities within the total\nspan of measurements (d). In addition, we found that the characteristic PXRD peaks\nof ZPF-2-Co-\u03b2 and ZPF-2-Co-\u03b1 alternately appeared during the recycling tests, indicative of the\nhigh durability of the ZPF-2-Co platform (Figure S7).", "data": [{"Mof name": "ZPF-2-Co-\u03b2", "symbol": "Not mentioned", "processes": [{"synthesis method": "activation", "heat treatment method": "degassing", "atmosphere": "dynamic vacuum", "heat treatment temperature": "373K", "heat treatment time": "12 h", "heating rate": "Not mentioned", "cooling rate": "Not mentioned"}], "yield": "Not mentioned", "chemical formula": "Not mentioned"}, {"Mof name": "ZPF-2-Co-\u03b2", "symbol": "Not mentioned", "processes": [{"synthesis method": "vacuum dynamic vapor sorption", "washing solution": "Not mentioned", "amount": "Not mentioned"}], "yield": "Not mentioned", "chemical formula": "Not mentioned"}, {"Mof name": "ZPF-2-Co-\u03b2", "symbol": "Not mentioned", "processes": [{"synthesis method": "dynamic flow conditions", "washing solution": "N2 gas carrying water vapor (RH = 30%)", "amount": "Not mentioned"}], "yield": "Not mentioned", "chemical formula": "Not mentioned"}, {"Mof name": "ZPF-2-Co-\u03b2", "symbol": "Not mentioned", "processes": [{"synthesis method": "recycling", "washing solution": "Not mentioned", "amount": "Not mentioned"}], "yield": "Not mentioned", "chemical formula": "Not mentioned"}, {}], "include_properties": ["heat_treatment", "washing", "water_sorption"]}, {"idx": 9, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Vacuum DVS isotherms of <bold>ZPF-2-Co</bold>.
