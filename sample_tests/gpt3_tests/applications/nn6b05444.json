The first stage\nof structural evolution (corresponding to a time scale of roughly\nthe first \u223c10 ns) involves the initial aggregation of Zn ions\nand carboxylate ligands leading to formation of 1-D chain-like structural\nfragments. The 1-D chain-like fragments evolve further to form generally\nlarger and more complex (2-D or 3-D) assemblies, composed of various\ntopological elements during the second stage of structural evolution\n(occurring between \u223c10 and 100 ns). The vertices within these\ntopological elements consist of different Zn-ion clusters or SBUs.\nDuring subsequent structural evolution, interconversion between different\ntopological elements occurs within the assemblies as a third stage\nof the self-assembly. As the system size increases (e.g, in S72 and S200 systems), this third stage\nstructure is manifested as a more complex and evolving conglomerate\ncomposed of different interconnected topological elements linked together\nin manners reminiscent of the structures observed in smaller S8 and S18 systems. The third stage is a slow rearrangement\nprocess that is captured by the slowly decaying region of the PE with\na relaxation time of hundreds of nanoseconds.
