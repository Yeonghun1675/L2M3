Changes in the line\nshape occurred at 403 K and higher, in good agreement with the disappearance\nof the SHG activity. Fitting of the experimental spectra showed agreement\nwith a 180\u00b0 flipping of D in the amino group with a flipping rate constant k of \u223c50\nkHz at 423 K. Such an exchange rate is an order of magnitude lower\nthan the 180\u00b0 flipping rate of aromatics in analogous nonfunctionalized\nMIL-53 analogues and that of freely rotating amino groups on aromatics\nat comparable temperatures. The low rate is thus consistent\nwith hindered rotational motion of the aromatic ring in the NH2-MIL-53(Al)\nvnp\n form ascribed to\nstrong hydrogen-bonding interactions.\n", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 11, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig3\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Experimental\nand (inset) calculated static <sup>2</sup>H NMR spectra\nof ND<sub>2</sub>-MIL-53(Al)<sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">vpn</italic>\n</sub>.
