As reported, alanine, proline, and arginine metabolism can predict proteinuria\nprogression, which is closely related to the degree of renal damage,\nindicating the high-confidence level of these nine <italic toggle=\"yes\">m</italic>/<italic toggle=\"yes\">z</italic> signals. Also, the reactive oxygen species play\nan important role in the induction of proteinuria in nephrotic syndrome, and the aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis pathway\nis related to oxidative stress. Additionally,\nthe presence of nitric oxide in the kidney has been implicated in\nthe pathogenesis of human glomerulonephritis. As known, arginine is directly related to the production of nitric\noxide in the body and participates in the regulation of end-stage\nrenal degeneration. More specifically, uric acid\nas the end product of purine metabolism has been normally known to\nimpact the kidneys through causing nephrolithiasis and acute kidney\ninjury. A recent research shows that\nthe risk of MCD progression increases by 29% for every 1 mg dL<sup>\u20131</sup> increase of the uric acid level in the baseline. Valine is one of the three branched-chain amino\nacids that is essential for animal health and important in metabolism, the urinary level of which is found to decrease\nin PNS, which is consistent with our\nresults ().\nNotably, it is inevitable that all these nine metabolites participate\nin various renal activities. For example, valine was reported to hold\npotential in assessing the risk of diabetic nephropathy development, and a high urine uric acid-to-creatinine ratio\nwas identified as an independent risk factor for contrast-induced\nnephropathy. As such, a combination of\nthem still can be used for the accurate diagnosis of PNS. All these\nresults verified the credibility of the high-confidence marker panel\nin PNS diagnosis.</p>", "clean_text": "In addition, we tried\nto identify these nine m/z signals\nfrom the Human Metabolome database (http://www.hmdb.ca/) and compared\ntheir differential expression levels in HC, MCD, and MNWT. The detailed\ninformation of these signals is listed in Table S3. From , all these nine metabolites are obviously downregulated in both\nMCD and MNWT compared with HC, while they present similar expression\nlevels in MCD and MNWT. This result suggests that the obvious discrepancy\nof nine metabolites exists between HC and PNS instead of MCD and MNWT,\nwhich will be discussed later. To further confirm the biological significance\nof these m/z signals, we explored\nthe metabolic pathways in which they may be involved. As shown in Figure S12, the pathways of nine high-confidence\nmetabolites mainly include aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, arginine biosynthesis,\nalanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, arginine and proline\nmetabolism, glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, and glyoxylate\nand dicarboxylate metabolism. As reported, alanine, proline, and arginine metabolism can predict proteinuria\nprogression, which is closely related to the degree of renal damage,\nindicating the high-confidence level of these nine m/z signals. Also, the reactive oxygen species play\nan important role in the induction of proteinuria in nephrotic syndrome, and the aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis pathway\nis related to oxidative stress. Additionally,\nthe presence of nitric oxide in the kidney has been implicated in\nthe pathogenesis of human glomerulonephritis. As known, arginine is directly related to the production of nitric\noxide in the body and participates in the regulation of end-stage\nrenal degeneration. More specifically, uric acid\nas the end product of purine metabolism has been normally known to\nimpact the kidneys through causing nephrolithiasis and acute kidney\ninjury. A recent research shows that\nthe risk of MCD progression increases by 29% for every 1 mg dL\u20131 increase of the uric acid level in the baseline. Valine is one of the three branched-chain amino\nacids that is essential for animal health and important in metabolism, the urinary level of which is found to decrease\nin PNS, which is consistent with our\nresults ().\nNotably, it is inevitable that all these nine metabolites participate\nin various renal activities. For example, valine was reported to hold\npotential in assessing the risk of diabetic nephropathy development, and a high urine uric acid-to-creatinine ratio\nwas identified as an independent risk factor for contrast-induced\nnephropathy.
