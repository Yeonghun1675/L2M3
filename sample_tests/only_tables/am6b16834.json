Prior to the onset potential\nat \u223c0.55 V, the Nyquist plots consist of a single large semicircle\nand are essentially the same. This signal is tentatively attributed\nto the diffusion of the electrolyte (a Warburg component of the impedance)\nsince the polythiophene is in its insulating state and should not\ncontribute to the charge transfer resistance (R\nct). As the potential becomes more positive than 0.5 V (and\nconsequently more oxidizing toward the MOF-installed polythiophene),\na charge transfer resistance semicircle starts to appear and the Nyquist\nplot eventually splits into a semicircle (R\nct) and a linear portion (Warburg component), indicating decreased\ncharge transfer resistance (higher conductivity); see , panels a and b. Fits of the\nEIS data to a simple Randles-type RC circuit yielded R\nct values. As outlined in SI section S7, potential-dependent conductivities of the thin film were\nderived from R\nct values by considering\nfilm dimensions. The results are summarized in d. Briefly, (a) conductivity increases with\nincreasing electrochemical doping (panel d). (b) Starting from a bias\nof 0.55 V, where the R\nct contribution\nstarts to appear, the measured values of the conductivity of Epoly\nincrease from \u223c10\u20139 to 1.3 \u00d7 10\u20137 S\u00b7cm\u20131 at 1 V (d). The latter value is comparable\nto what has been reported with various other electronically conductive\nMOFs. In contrast, over the same DC potentials\nwindow, the EIS spectrum of unmodified NU-1000 film remains almost\nunchanged (c) due to the lack of a path for electron or hole conduction. (At\nthe most positive potentials, an R\nct-like\ncontribution starts to appear, and it may be due to the onset of conductivity\nvia pyrene linker-based redox hopping.)", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 15, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig3\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Nyquist plot of the Epoly with applied bias from 0.5 to 1.0 V\n(frequency range from 300 kHz to 0.03 Hz).
