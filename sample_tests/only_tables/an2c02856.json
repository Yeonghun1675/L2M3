As shown in A, the mortality rates of the three \u03b2-CYP formulations\nfor termites were dose-dependent. Although the mortality of termites\ntreated with \u03b2-CYP/ZIF-8 was lower than that of the other two\ncommercial formulations after day 1, there was no significant difference\namong the above three. As time went on, the mortality rates of termites\ntreated with \u03b2-CYP/ZIF-8 from 3 to 14 days after spraying were\nhigher than those of commercial WP and EC at the same concentration.\nEven after 14 days, the mortality rate for the high concentration\nof \u03b2-CYP/ZIF-8 treatment (8 mg a.i./L) was still over 70%, unlike\nthat of commercial WP and EC, which decreased to 41.7 and 45.0%, respectively.\nThe median lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>) values also showed\nthat the toxicity of \u03b2-CYP/ZIF-8 for termites began to be higher\nthan that of the other two commercial formulations after 3 days (). At 14 days, the\nLC<sub>50</sub> of \u03b2-CYP/ZIF-8 treatment was more than 2 times\nhigher than that of the two commercial formulations. Meanwhile, the\nresults of the bioactivity assay corresponding to the blank carrier\nZIF-8 against termites (B) showed that ZIF-8 had almost no killing effect on the termites,\nindicating that the lethal effect of \u03b2-CYP/ZIF-8 on the termites\nwas primarily due to the loaded active ingredient, \u03b2-CYP. The\ninsecticidal activity differences between \u03b2-CYP/ZIF-8 and the\ntwo commercial formulations can be explained as follows: in the early\nstage, \u03b2-CYP/ZIF-8 had just started contact with termites, and\nthe amount of drug released was low, which resulted in low insecticidal\nactivity. However, as time went on, the continuous activity of the\ntermites increased the acidity of the environment, leading to the disintegration of the ZIF-8 framework and the consequent\nrelease of the large amounts of the loaded pesticide on demand, hence\nthe high insecticidal activity was observed later.

As shown in A, the mortality rates of the three \u03b2-CYP formulations\nfor termites were dose-dependent. Although the mortality of termites\ntreated with \u03b2-CYP/ZIF-8 was lower than that of the other two\ncommercial formulations after day 1, there was no significant difference\namong the above three. As time went on, the mortality rates of termites\ntreated with \u03b2-CYP/ZIF-8 from 3 to 14 days after spraying were\nhigher than those of commercial WP and EC at the same concentration.\nEven after 14 days, the mortality rate for the high concentration\nof \u03b2-CYP/ZIF-8 treatment (8 mg a.i./L) was still over 70%, unlike\nthat of commercial WP and EC, which decreased to 41.7 and 45.0%, respectively.\nThe median lethal concentration (LC50) values also showed\nthat the toxicity of \u03b2-CYP/ZIF-8 for termites began to be higher\nthan that of the other two commercial formulations after 3 days (). At 14 days, the\nLC50 of \u03b2-CYP/ZIF-8 treatment was more than 2 times\nhigher than that of the two commercial formulations. Meanwhile, the\nresults of the bioactivity assay corresponding to the blank carrier\nZIF-8 against termites (B) showed that ZIF-8 had almost no killing effect on the termites,\nindicating that the lethal effect of \u03b2-CYP/ZIF-8 on the termites\nwas primarily due to the loaded active ingredient, \u03b2-CYP.
