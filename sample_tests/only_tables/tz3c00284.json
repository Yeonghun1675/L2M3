Additionally,\nMott\u2013Schottky diagrams can be used to determine the conduction\nband (CB) potential and conductivity type of the semiconductors. We tested the Mott\u2013Schottky curves of GXNU-1\u20133 under the conditions of 500, 1000, and 1500\nHz, respectively, and obtained their CBs as \u22120.31, \u22120.30,\nand \u22120.29 V, respectively, after fitting (d\u2013f). The results showed\nthat the Mott\u2013Schottky curves of GXNU-1\u20133 presented positive slopes, which reflected that all three had n-type\nsemiconductor characteristics. Therefore, the valence bands (VB) of GXNU-1\u20133 are located at 2.48, 2.45, and\n2.49 eV, respectively (g). The energy level diagrams of GXNU-1\u20133 were further drawn, and the results showed that they all\nhad the ability to produce 1O2. All in all,\nthe above results indicate that GXNU-1\u20133 can effectively promote oxygen to produce 1O2 under light irradiation conditions, and this evidence is also consistent\nwith the EPR results. To further evaluate the photoinduced electron\u2013hole\nseparation, the fluorescence emission spectra of GXNU-1\u20133 in aqueous solution were measured at different\nexcitation wavelengths of 340, 360, 380, 400, and 420 nm. As shown in Figure S10, at the excitation wavelength of 380 nm, GXNU-1 and -2 exhibit strong fluorescence intensity (\u03bbem = 433 nm); at the excitation wavelength of 380 nm, GXNU-3 exhibits strong fluorescence intensity (\u03bbem = 422\nnm). Notably, almost no fluorescence signal was detected when the\nexcitation wavelength was greater than 400 nm, which indicates that\nthe recombination of charge carriers in aqueous solution was significantly\ninhibited when GXNU-1\u20133 was irradiated\nwith visible light.

The combined\neffects of the aforementioned factors have led to the excellent 1O2 generation ability of GXNU-1\u20133, which was verified by the EPR results of TEMP-1O2 and the degradation of the DPBF indicator. Compared\nwith H2L, the formation of MOF structures can enhance their\nability to produce 1O2, and their energy level\nstructure also verifies this. Under low-power Xe lamp irradiation, GXNU-1 showed degradation abilities against high-concentration\nCV, MB, OII, and RhB, with degradation amounts reaching 97.4%, 95.2%,\n76.5%, and 93%, respectively, within 30 min. Compared with the light-only\ncontrol group, the degradation rates \u03ba of CV, MB, OII, and RhB\nby GXNU-1 increased by factors of 475, 20, 75, and 150,\nrespectively. In addition, GXNU-1 almost completely degraded\nCV and MB in the mixed dye within 30 min, thereby showing excellent\nphotocatalytic complex dye sewage purification performance. Similarly, GXNU-2/3 had excellent degradation performance for high concentrations\nof CV and MB under the same light irradiation conditions. GXNU-1\u20133 can be quickly removed from the aqueous solution\nby centrifugation and filtration, thus avoiding secondary pollution.\nThe abovementioned excellent colored sewage purification ability is\nmainly derived from the efficient ROS generation of GXNU-1\u20133, which also promotes the potential application\nof GXNU-1\u20133 in the field of sterilization. GXNU-1 showed excellent sterilizing effects against S. aureus and E. coli after irradiation\nfor 4 min under a 60 mW\u00b7cm\u20132 Xe lamp. In addition,\nprotective masks and experimental clothes soaked in an aqueous GXNU-1 solution for 15 s effectively resisted bacterial contamination\nunder light irradiation. This work has developed a high-efficiency,\nlow-energy, and environment-friendly photocatalytic system for dye\nwastewater purification, which opens new horizons for precise structural\ndesigns, optimized crystal engineering strategies, and improved catalyst\nstructure designs. In addition, this work provides an example of a\nhigh-efficiency sterilant that can prevent secondary bacterial contamination,\nthus providing a new method of designing and developing medical
