In addition, the K\nq values\nwere far greater than 2.0 \u00d7 1010 L mol\u20131 s\u20131, which was the maximum dynamic quenching constant. So, UiO-PSM detected UA by static quenching.\nTo further verify the mechanism, the fluorescence lifetime of the\nsensor was investigated and is illustrated in D.
