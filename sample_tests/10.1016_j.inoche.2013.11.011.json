Single-crystal X-ray structural analysis indicates that 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group of C2/c, and all the cadmium atoms adopt distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry constructed by two sulfur atoms (S1 and S2) and two nitrogen atoms (N5 and N11) from two dpmtz ligands (a). The coordination bond lengths and angles around the Cd(II) atom are in the range of 2.276(4)\u20132.328(4)\u00c5 and 87.97(10)\u2013124.20(5)\u00b0, respectively, as listed in Table S2. Each dpmtz ligand connects two Cd(II) atoms, generating a 3D double interpenetrated framework with 1D pore (Fig. S2), and making the effective pore diameter with 6.2\u00c5 (after considering van der Waals radii). PLATON  analysis reveals that the 3D porous structure of 2 is composed of voids of 708\u00c53, which accounts for 22.9% per unit cell volume. To clearly understand the topological structure of the framework, it is necessary to simplify the building units. The Cd atom can be regarded as one node in 2. As each Cd is surrounded by two pyridine groups and two mercapto groups, each Cd atom is a 4-connected node. At the same time, the dpmtz ligand can be considered as a linker since it links two Cd atoms. Consequently, according to the calculation of TOPOS , the framework of 1 belongs to a 4-connected dia type of topology net, with Schl\u00e4fli symbol of 66. Two such nets interpenetrate each other to form a 2-fold interpenetrating framework (b).

The data processing was accomplished with the PROCESS-AUTO processing program. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data for 2 was collected on a Bruker SMART CCD diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator. The SMART software was used for data collection, for indexing the reflections, and for determining the unit cell parameters; the collected data were integrated by using the SAINT software. All data were collected at a temperature of 20\u00b12\u00b0C. Direct methods were used to solve the structure using the SHELXL crystallographic software package. All non-hydrogen atoms were easily found from the difference Fourier map. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically.
