The mean peak potentials E1/\n2\n=(Epc\n+Epa)/2 are 349.5, 199.5, and \u221235.5mV, respectively, which should be ascribed to three consecutive two-electron processes of MoVI ion . As shown in (b), the peak potentials change gradually following the scan rate from 20 to 200mV\u00b7s\u22121: the cathodic peak potentials shift to the negative direction and the corresponding anodic peak potentials to the positive direction. The peak-to-peak separation between the corresponding cathodic and anodic peaks increases with the scan rate increasing, but the mean peak potentials does not change on the whole.
