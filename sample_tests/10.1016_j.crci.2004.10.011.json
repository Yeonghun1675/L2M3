The aluminum cation (on special position 4a) is octahedrally coordinated to four oxygen atoms from the carboxylic function and two hydroxyl groups located in trans position. The Al\u2013O distances are 1.845(8) and 1.994(9)\u00a0\u00c5, and Al\u2013OH one is 1.780(4)\u00a0\u00c5 (\n). Bond valence calculations  give values of 1.41 and confirm the occurrence of a \u03bc2-hydroxide anion for the bridging oxygen O1. The resulting AlO4(OH)2 units are linked to each other through the two opposite hydroxyl groups and this generates an infinite chain of corner-sharing octahedra running along the c axis. The files of octahedra are connected to each other through the naphthalenedicarboxylate molecules. The carboxylate ion, R-CO2\n\u2013, acts as a bridging bidentate ligand adopting an usual syn\u2013syn configuration ; the oxygen atoms of each carboxylic acid function are linked to two consecutive aluminum atoms (\n). This particular connection mode gives rise to the formation of a three-dimensional organic-inorganic network with flat channels running along the c axis, parallel to the AlO4(OH)2 chains. The accessible pore size of this one-dimensional tunnel is approximately 2.7 \u00d7 19.4\u00a0\u00c5 (it was taken into account the oxygen radius of 1.35\u00a0\u00c5) and does not include significant void.
