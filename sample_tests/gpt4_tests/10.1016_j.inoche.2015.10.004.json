As depicted in a, three Cd atoms all exhibit distorted octahedral configuration generated by six oxygen atoms from different NDC ligands. The Cd\u2013O bond lengths are in the range of 2.187(7)\u20132.528(7) \u00c5 and the O\u2013Cd\u2013O bond angles range from 52.6(3) to 179.4(4)\u00b0. Three independent Cd atoms are bridged by six carboxylate groups from six different NDC ligands to form a linear trinuclear cluster with Cd3 as the symmetrical center. Cd1 and Cd2 further coordinate to one terminal chelating carboxlate group from another NDC. Overall, three Cd atoms link eight carbloxlate groups to give a [Cd3(COO)8]2\u2212 SBU. The Cd1\u2013Cd3 and Cd2\u2013Cd3 separations are of 3.4831(9) \u00c5 and 3.4658(10) \u00c5, respectively. The trinuclear cluster and NDC ligands link each other to form the 3D porous framework of MOF 2 (b). 1D irregular small channel is observed along the c-axis direction and occupied by the charge-balanced [(CH3)2NH2]+. Furthermore, the [Cd3(COO)8]2\u2212 SBU and NDC ligands can be regarded as 8-connected node and linker as depicted in c, which led an 8-connected net with a point symbol of {424\u00b764}. However, it should be pointed out that the 8-connected net of MOF 2 is different from the common bcu net, which exhibits a self-penetration as shown in d. To the best of our knowledge, this kind of self-penetrating bcu net is rarely reported up to date. The only example reported by Wang  had a 424\u00b75\u00b763 topology with the four-membered ring is penetrated, but in the network of 2, it is the six-membered ring. Clearly, the utilization of longer NDC linker effectively led to the transformation of mononuclear [Cd(COO)4] to trinuclear [Cd3(COO)8]2\u2212 SBU, which further introduced the formation of 8-connected bcu net of MOF 2 instead of 4-connected qtz net of MOF 1.", "data": [{"Mof name": "MOF 2", "symbol": 2, "processes": [{"synthesis method": "Not mentioned", "precursor1 name": "NDC", "precursor1 amount": "Not mentioned", "precursor2 name": "Cd(II)", "precursor2 amount": "Not mentioned", "solution": "Not mentioned", "pressure": "Not mentioned", "temperature": "Not mentioned", "time": "Not mentioned"}], "yield": "Not mentioned", "chemical formula": "Not mentioned"}], "include_properties": []}, {"idx": 15, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<ce:para id=\"p0060\" view=\"all\">Powder X-ray diffraction study indicates that MOFs <ce:bold>1</ce:bold> and <ce:bold>2</ce:bold> both are phase-pure (Fig. S1).

The small pore size introduced by interpenetration and charged frameworks contribute a dramatically selective CO2 uptake. In particular, Cd-NDC MOF shows the highest water vapor uptake performance among all the interpenetrated MOFs. Further exploration of interpenetrated porous frameworks with selective adsorption ability is ongoing.", "data": ["\"I do not know\"", {}], "include_properties": [""]}, {"idx": 21, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<ce:section-title id=\"st0030\">Supplementary material</ce:section-title><ce:para id=\"p0095\" view=\"all\">\n<ce:display>\n<ce:e-component id=\"ec0005\">\n<ce:caption id=\"ca0020\">\n<ce:simple-para id=\"sp0035\" view=\"all\">Supplementary material 1</ce:simple-para>\n</ce:caption>\n<ce:link id=\"lk0025\" locator=\"mmc1\"></ce:link>\n</ce:e-component>\n</ce:display>\n<ce:display>\n<ce:e-component id=\"ec0010\">\n<ce:caption id=\"ca0025\">\n<ce:simple-para id=\"sp0040\" view=\"all\">Supplementary material 2</ce:simple-para>\n</ce:caption>\n<ce:link id=\"lk0030\" locator=\"mmc2\"></ce:link>\n</ce:e-component>\n</ce:display>\n<ce:display>\n<ce:e-component id=\"ec0015\">\n<ce:caption id=\"ca0030\">\n<ce:simple-para id=\"sp0045\" view=\"all\">Supplementary material 3</ce:simple-para>\n</ce:caption>\n<ce:link id=\"lk0035\" locator=\"mmc3\"></ce:link>\n</ce:e-component>\n</ce:display>\n<ce:display>\n<ce:e-component id=\"ec0020\">\n<ce:caption id=\"ca0035\">\n<ce:simple-para id=\"sp0050\" view=\"all\">Supplementary material 4</ce:simple-para>\n</ce:caption>\n<ce:link id=\"lk0040\" locator=\"mmc4\"></ce:link>\n</ce:e-component>\n</ce:display>\n</ce:para><ce:section-title id=\"st0035\">Supplementary material</ce:section-title><ce:para id=\"p0100\" view=\"all\">Detailed experimental and crystallographic data, figures showing structural details, FT-IR spectra, XRD patterns and TGA curve have been included (CCDC 1054770 and 1054768).
