All isotherms\nrevealed almost the same amount of uptake (\u223c1 molecule per\none iron) with the bulk (Figure S8 in the SI) in the low-pressure region and exhibited type I sorption profiles\n(typical for microporous materials) in IUPAC classification with wide hysteresis, which may be due to adsorption\nto the domain boundary. Lattice changes upon guest adsorption were\nalso investigated by in situ out-of-plane synchrotron XRD measurements.\nThe lattice constant c of Pdpz changed\nunder several vapor pressures of MeCN and EtOH at RT (b). These lattice changes exhibited\nreversible interlayer spacing expansions (\u0394c = \u223c0.14 \u00c5 for MeCN and \u0394c = \u223c0.12\n\u00c5 for EtOH; Table S1 in the SI), which\nis quite different from the almost unchanged lattice in the bulk sample\n(\u0394c = \u223c0.005 \u00c5 for MeCN and \u0394c = \u223c0.001 \u00c5 for EtOH; Table S2 in the SI). The lattice constant c at P/P\n0 = 0.95 [c = 7.270(5) \u00c5 for MeCN and c = 7.25(2) \u00c5\nfor EtOH; Table S1 in the SI] is near that\nof bulk [guest-free; c = 7.2293(2) \u00c5]. Thus,\nlarge expansion of the interlayer spacing should be due to lattice\nshrinkage. Similar sorption behavior was also observed for Nipz (Figures S9 and S11 in the SI).", "data": ["\"I do not know\""], "include_properties": []}, {"idx": 9, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig3\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>MeCN and EtOH\nadsorption/desorption behavior of <bold>Pdpz</bold>: (a) Sorption\nisotherms obtained from QCM measurements at RT.
