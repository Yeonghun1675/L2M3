The associated powder X-ray diffraction\n(XRD) patterns for the FeNi3\u2013Fe3O4 NPs/MOF and FeNi3\u2013Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT are shown in a, where the bimetallic MOF (NiFe0.5-MOF)\nand its CNT composite (NiFe0.5-MOF/CNT) prepared display\nsimilar XRD patterns with Fe-MIL-88B (CCDC no. 1415803; Figure S1a), demonstrating the successful construction\nof a MIL-type architecture via a solvothermal process. The corresponding characteristic diffraction peaks of the annealed\nsamples at 400 \u00b0C confirmed the presence of two different phases,\ni.e., FeNi3 alloy and Fe3O4 nanoparticles\nin NiFe0.5-MOF and its CNT composite. The XRD patterns of FeNi3\u2013Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT match with cubic FeNi3 (44.27\u00b0\n(111), 51.53\u00b0 (200), and 75.86\u00b0 (220), JCPDS PDF# 38-0419)\nwith a highly symmetric space group Pm3\u0305m (221), and the remaining diffraction peaks are indexed to cubic Fe3O4 (30.09\u00b0 (220), 35.42\u00b0 (311), 43.05\u00b0\n(400), 56.94\u00b0 (511), and 62.51\u00b0 (440), JCPDS PDF# 19-0629)\nwith a highly symmetric space group Fd3\u0305m (227). As shown in a, the XRD diffraction peaks belonging to the pristine MOF or the\nMOF/CNT composite still remain in the annealed samples, demonstrating\nthe persistence of the crystalline bimetallic MOF structure even after\nannealing treatment as we intended (evidenced by the (100) plane at\n9.09\u00b0). Attempts to prepare nanoparticles\nwithin the MOF architecture at higher temperatures, such as at 500\n\u00b0C, for 1 h under a N2 atmosphere led to the complete\ndecomposition of the MOF skeleton and produced Fe3O4 and FeNi3 heterostructural nanoparticles (Figure S1b). Particularly, the diffraction peaks\nassigned to Fe3O4 were not clearly noticed in\nthe XRD pattern compared to FeNi3, which may be due to\nthe small grain size and concise diffraction peak intensity of Fe3O4. Similarly, NiFe0.5-MOF after annealing displayed the XRD patterns of FeNi3 and Fe3O4 heterogeneous particles within\nthe MOF skeleton (FeNi3\u2013Fe3O4 NPs/MOF).
