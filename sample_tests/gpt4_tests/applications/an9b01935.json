The internal standard, dimethylsulfoxide, and phenol\nwere used as references for quantitative calculation (Figure S13). To verify the electrocatalytic performance\nof carbon dioxide electroreduction, we unified the electrolysis potential\nfrom \u22120.57 to \u22121.07 V vs RHE (Figure S14a). The FE (c,d and S11a) reflected that the\nmaximum FEethanol of Cu GNC-VL reached 70.52% at \u22120.87\nV vs RHE and FEmethanol of 19.13% at \u22120.77 V vs\nRHE. However, the FEethanol decreased to 8.64 and 40.18%\nfor pyrolyzed ZIF-L and Cu ZIF-L@GO, respectively. To prove the stability\nof the catalyst, the electrolysis experiment was carried out at \u22120.87\nand \u22120.77 V vs RHE for 12 h on Cu GNC-VL and Cu ZIF-L@GO, respectively\n(Figure S14). The negligible decay of current\ndensities indicated the stability of Cu GNC-VL in the test duration.\nIt is not difficult to find that Cu GNC-VL showed the best physicochemical\nproperties. Good conductivity and a uniformly dispersed active center\nwere the advantages of CO2RR to produce ethanol efficiently.\nThe added two-dimensional semiconductor, GO, not only enhanced the\nconductivity of the catalyst but also provided chelating sites with\nZn2+ for the vertical growth of ZIF-L. However, it is clear\nthat the Cu/Cu2O composite crystal supported on N-doped\nporous carbon derived from the vertical ZIF-L@GO was essential for\nCu GNC-VL to show excellent electrocatalytic performance compared\nto that of Cu ZIF-L@GO with similar content of Cu. The amorphous Cu/Cu2O inside the Cu GNC-VL catalyst obtained by calcination, on\nthe one hand, achieved reasonable regulation of the distribution of\nnanoparticles. On the other hand, the loaded nanoparticles also affected\nthe geometric structure of porous carbon, improving the conductive\nperformance of the catalyst.
