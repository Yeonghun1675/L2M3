Generally,\nthe intensity of the D band can be assigned to the disordered defective\nin graphite, while the intensity of the G band is related to the ordered\ncrystal graphite. The D/G intensity ratio\n(I\nD/I\nG) value\nof TiO2@NC, (TiO2)9\u2013Co1@NC\u2013NCNTs, (TiO2)7\u2013Co3@NC\u2013NCNTs, and (TiO2)5\u2013Co5@NC\u2013NCNTs are 1.14, 1.33, 1.29, and 1.24, respectively.\nIn addition, a broad 2D and 2G band centered at around 2660 and 2900\ncm\u20131 are obviously observed in Raman spectra of\nTiO2@NC and (TiO2)\nx\n\u2013Co\ny\n@NC\u2013NCNTs, indicating\nthe existence of graphitic carbon materials in all samples, and intensity\nof these two peaks gradually become stronger and more distinct with\nthe increase of Co content in the MOF precursor. Typical Raman bands\nappeared at 140, 251, 426, and 610 cm\u20131 ascribe\nto the B1g, two-phonon scattering, Eg, and A1g modes of the rutile phase, respectively (Figure S2) and the peaks detected at about\n187, 465, and 667 cm\u20131 correspond to F2g, Eg, and A1g modes of Co3O4, respectively. Raman reflects the\nvibration behavior of molecular bonds. Metal, as an elementary substance,\nhas no molecular bonds. Therefore, there are weak diffraction peaks\nof Co3O4 but no diffraction peak of the Co metal\nin Figure S2. Based on the above results,\nmetallic cobalt under high-temperature reduction can act as the catalytic\ncenter to produce more content of graphic carbon, improvement of overall\nelectroconductibility of materials, while it can also introduce more\namount of defect in carbon, leading to smaller Pt NPs as well as strengthening\nthe interaction between carbon and metal NPs.

The full scale of XPS spectra\nindicate that C, N, O, Ti, and Pt elements exist in all catalysts\n(Figure S7). The Pt 4f core level XPS spectra\nof the Pt/TiO2@NC, Pt/TiO2@NC\u2013NCNTs-9,\nPt/TiO2@NC\u2013NCNTs-7, and Pt/TiO2@NC\u2013NCNTs-5\nmainly exhibit two peaks, which are assigned to Pt 4f5/2 and Pt 4f7/2, respectively (a). In contrast to Pt/TiO2@NC,\nthe Pt 4f peaks of the other three electrocatalysts expressively negative\nshift, ascribing to the electronic interaction between defects on\nNCNTs (NC) and Pt NPs. The negative shift\nof binding energy of the Pt 4f means that the Pt NPs can get electrons\nfrom the support, leading to a decrease in the d-band vacancy of Pt,\naccording to the d-band center theory, the CO adsorption would be\nweakened as the d-band center decreases. Thus, the negative shift is facilitating the removal of the adsorbed\npoisoning intermediates such as COads for MOR. Obviously, the Pt 4f peaks of Pt/TiO2@NC\u2013NCNTs-7 and Pt/TiO2@NC\u2013NCNTs-5 were\nshifted positively compared with that of Pt/TiO2@NC\u2013NCNTs-9,\nwhich can be attributed to the decreasing size of Pt NPs on the support. Owing to the fact that Pt0 in the\nnanocatalyst plays a fatal role in catalytic process, the concentration\nratio between the metallic platinum (Pt0) and divalent\nplatinum (Pt2+) are thoroughly considered and evaluated\nby the corresponding two sets of Pt 4f deconvolution. The percentage\nof metallic platinum (Pt0) in Pt/TiO2@NC\u2013NCNTs-7\nis 76%, presenting the highest level of Pt0 in the nanocatalyst\n(68% for Pt/TiO2@NC, 70% for Pt/TiO2@NC\u2013NCNTs-9,\n72% for Pt/TiO2@NC\u2013NCNTs-5). The higher content\nof Pt0 in the nanocatalyst usually represent higher catalytic\nperformance. The high-resolution N 1s XPS spectrum of Pt/TiO2@NC and Pt/TiO2@NC\u2013NCNTs-X (b) can be divided\ninto three peaks, which are corresponding to the representative peaks\nof pyridinic N (398.1 eV), pyrrolic N (399.5 eV), and graphitic N\n(401.1 eV). The excellent catalytic activities are mainly attributed\nto electroneutrality break and electron transfer induced by N doping\n(especially pyridinic-N), which alter the charge and spin distribution\nin the carbon materials. Compared with\nPt/TiO2@NC, the negative shift of pyridinic N in Pt/TiO2@NC\u2013NCNTs-9, Pt/TiO2@NC\u2013NCNTs-7,\nand Pt/TiO2@NC\u2013NCNTs-5 is attributed to strong metal\u2013support\ninteraction and electron transfer. The pyridinic-N species considered\nthe effective active sites of Pt/TiO2@NC, Pt/TiO2@NC\u2013NCNTs-9, Pt/TiO2@NC\u2013NCNTs-7, and Pt/TiO2@NC\u2013NCNTs-5 are 38.44, 39.17, 48.64, and 45.81%, respectively,\nwhich can facilitate the electron transfer and decrease the overpotential\nfor MOR and ORR. The two peaks located at 464.5 and 458.8 eV in Ti\n2p XPS spectra (c) can be associated to the Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 spectra of the Ti4+ oxidation state in TiO2 and a negative shift of Ti 2p ascribe that Ti4+ is partially\nreduced into Ti3+. The deconvoluted XPS spectra for O 1s\n(Figure S5) display three types of oxygen\nspecies, corresponding to Ti\u2013O\u2013Ti, Ti\u2013OH, and\nadsorb water molecules. As shown in d, the high-resolution\nC 1s spectra can be decomposed into four peaks centered at 284.6 eV\n(sp2\u2013sp2 C), 285.5 eV (N\u2013sp2 C), 286.2 eV (N\u2013sp3 C), and 288.6 eV (\u03c0\u2013\u03c0*).\n", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 15, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig5\" position=\"float\">\n<label>5</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Pt 4f (a), N 1s (b), Ti 2p (c), and C 1s (d) XPS spectra\nof Pt/TiO<sub>2</sub>@NC, Pt/TiO<sub>2</sub>@NC\u2013NCNTs-9, Pt/TiO<sub>2</sub>@NC\u2013NCNTs-7, and Pt/TiO<sub>2</sub>@NC\u2013NCNTs-5.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr5\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"sc9b06329_0005.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": "\n5\n\nPt 4f (a), N 1s (b), Ti 2p (c), and C 1s (d) XPS spectra\nof Pt/TiO2@NC, Pt/TiO2@NC\u2013NCNTs-9, Pt/TiO2@NC\u2013NCNTs-7, and Pt/TiO2@NC\u2013NCNTs-5.\n\n\n", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 16, "type": "text", "classification": ["property", "synthesis condition"], "content": "<p>\na,b shows\nthe cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of prepared nanocatalysts and commercial\nPt/C in N<sub>2</sub>-saturated acid (0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and alkali medium (1 M KOH), respectively.

In alkali medium (b), the onset electrooxidation\npotential of CO for Pt/TiO2@NC\u2013NCNTs-7 is also more\nnegative (\u22120.518 V vs Hg/HgO) than other catalysts. It is demonstrated\nthat the Pt/TiO2@NC\u2013NCNTs-7 facilitate the removal\nof COads species from the surface of the nanocatalyst and\nhas the famous capability of antipoisoning, which is attributed to\nstronger OH\u2013 adsorption on the Pt/TiO2@NC\u2013NCNTs-7 support. Notably, Pt/TiO2@NC\u2013NCNTs-9,\nPt/TiO2@NC\u2013NCNTs-7, and Pt/TiO2@NC\u2013NCNTs-5\ncatalysts emerge a new broad peak at a more negative potential of\n\u22120.47 to \u22120.37 V, implying the presence of different\nactive sites with diverse CO adsorption energy. Water is easy to be\npolarized by the Ti\u2013O bond in TiO2 to form the abundant\nhydroxyl group, which can assist oxidization and detach adjacent COads species from the Pt NPs.
