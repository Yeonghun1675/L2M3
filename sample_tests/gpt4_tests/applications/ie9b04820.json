Conversely, the C-PSM approach resulted in reactions\non the MOF surface and in the internal MOF pores as a result of using\nacetic anhydride and pyridine. The internal reactions reduced sorption\nand diffusion and led to a decrease in permeability with an increase\nin selectivity in the corresponding MMMs. Furthermore, compared to\nthe T-PSM approach, the C-PSM approach resulted in a rougher MOF surface\ndue to reduced oligomer coverage and a decrease in crystallinity due\nto the required reaction conditions. This study illustrates the importance\nof selecting PSM conditions that preserve the MOF structure of interest.\nDoing so enables the formation of MMMs that can be prepared for the\nsuccessful application of predictive models needed to assess separation\nperformance of the fillers.", "data": ["\"I do not know\""], "include_properties": []}, {"idx": 22, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information is\navailable free of charge on the\u00a0<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at\nDOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.iecr.9b04820\">10.1021/acs.iecr.9b04820</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Experimental and\ncharacterization procedure, TEM images\nof PSM-MOFs, FTIR analysis for pure-MOF and PSM-MOF, tabulated permeability\ndata, CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> sorption isotherms at 308\nK\u00a0and MMM weight percentage calculation.
