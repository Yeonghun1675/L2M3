The results verified that Co-MOF, CoFe-MOF, and Fe-MOF samples\nhave a similar structure, consistent with the simulated phase of diaqua-bis\u00ad(5-carboxy-1H-imidazole-4-carboxylate)\u00adcobalt\u00ad(II) (CCDC no. 998828).\nIt should be pointed out that the diffraction peaks become weaker\nand broader for the CoFe-MOF, indicating the formation of defects\nafter  introduction of iron. The FT-IR\nspectrum of CoFe-MOF is shown in b, consistent with the data reported previously. The absorption band at 3322 cm\u20131 indicated the\nstretching vibrations of N\u2013H from the imidazole ring. The appearance\nof a band around 1752 cm\u20131 showed the unprotonated\ncarboxylic groups vibrations in the structure. The stretching vibrations\nof C\ue5fbC from the imidazole ring were observed at 1502 and 1443\ncm\u20131. The bands at 1556 and 1398 cm\u20131 were assigned to COO\u2013 groups for the asymmetric\nand symmetric vibrational. The strong band at 1246 cm\u20131 was caused by the C\u2013O stretching frequency from the deprotonated\ncarboxylic groups. A stretching vibrational frequency was observed\nat 1136 cm\u20131 derived from the C\u2013OH groups of COOH. In addition, the absorption bands at 647 and 528\ncm\u20131 were mainly due to M\u2013OW and\nM\u2013OL stretching vibrations, respectively. The absorption bands at 456 cm\u20131 represent the central metal ion with the N (M\u2013N) stretching\nvibrations. After expedited electrochemical\nactivation, the crystallinity of CoFe-MOF-OH became much poorer, meaning\nmore surface defects and lattice distortion to expose more open metal\nsites. Also, the absorption band of N\u2013H on the imidazole ring,\nunprotonated COOH, and C\u2013OH group of carboxylate\ndisappeared attribued to their chemical instability in the alkaline\nsolution. The M\u2013OW vibrations for CoFe-MOF-OH were\ndramatically reduced, demonstrating  removal of the coordinated solvent\nmolecules to expose available sites. Meanwhile,\nthe newly generated peak at 1620 cm\u20131 is  characteristic\nof the metal\u2013oxygen double bond in the structure of oxyhydroxide. It is worth  pointing out that the potential\nlimiting step was determined by the formation of O* intermediate based\non the DFT results;  generation of a metal\u2013oxygen double bond\nfurther reflected the declining energy barrier for  deprotonation\nof HO* to O* (d). Therefore, it can be concluded that the expedited electrochemical\nactivation experienced a hydroxide transformation with a degradation\nof some organic ligands under  electrochemical activation in 1 M KOH\nelectrolyte (Model C in b), corresponding to the results\nof ICP measurement (Table S1).", "data": ["I do not know."], "include_properties": []}, {"idx": 11, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig3\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Powder\nXRD patterns of Co-MOF, Fe-MOF, CoFe-MOF, and CoFe-MOF-OH.\n(b) FT-IR spectra of CoFe-MOF and CoFe-MOF-OH.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr3\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cs-2019-00072f_0003.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": "\n3\n\n(a) Powder\nXRD patterns of Co-MOF, Fe-MOF, CoFe-MOF, and CoFe-MOF-OH.\n(b) FT-IR spectra of CoFe-MOF and CoFe-MOF-OH.\n\n\n", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 12, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The morphology was confirmed by TEM as shown in .
