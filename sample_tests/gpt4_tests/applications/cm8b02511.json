Considering\nthe coordination number of Zn\u00ad(II) in MOF-508b being 5, which is supported\nby the single-crystal X-ray diffraction, an average coordination number\nof less than 5 for Zn\u00ad(II) in FDM-22V seems reasonable. In addition, in the EXAFS in R space (d),\nFDM-22V exhibits a prominent peak at 1.52 \u00c5 from Zn\u2013N/O\nshell with a coordination number of 4.7 \u00b1 0.3 (Figure S16 and ), compared to MOF-508b with a coordination number of 5 (Figure S17), in agreement with the results from\nXPS. With each radial distribution function fitting well with their\nrespective models (), the results confirm that partial Zn\u2013N bond dissociations\nhappen after solvent removal in FDM-22, resulting in FDM-22V with\nhigh concentration of local defects.", "data": ["(SyntaxError(\"unmatched ']'\", ('<unknown>', 1, 604, '{\"Mof name\": \"FDM-22V\", \"symbol\": \"a\", \"processes\": [{\"synthesis method\": \"Not mentioned\", \"precursor\": \"Not mentioned\", \"solution\": \"Not mentioned\", \"pressure\": \"Not mentioned\", \"temperature\": \"Not mentioned\", \"time\": \"Not mentioned\"}], \"yield\": \"Not mentioned\", \"chemical formula\": \"Not mentioned\"}, {\"Mof name\": \"MOF-508b\", \"symbol\": \"b\", \"processes\": [{\"synthesis method\": \"Not mentioned\", \"precursor\": \"Not mentioned\", \"solution\": \"Not mentioned\", \"pressure\": \"Not mentioned\", \"temperature\": \"Not mentioned\", \"time\": \"Not mentioned\"}], \"yield\": \"Not mentioned\", \"chemical formula\": \"Not mentioned\"}]')), '{\"Mof name\": \"FDM-22V\", \"symbol\": \"a\", \"processes\": [{\"synthesis method\": \"Not mentioned\", \"precursor\": \"Not mentioned\", \"solution\": \"Not mentioned\", \"pressure\": \"Not mentioned\", \"temperature\": \"Not mentioned\", \"time\": \"Not mentioned\"}], \"yield\": \"Not mentioned\", \"chemical formula\": \"Not mentioned\"}, {\"Mof name\": \"MOF-508b\", \"symbol\": \"b\", \"processes\": [{\"synthesis method\": \"Not mentioned\", \"precursor\": \"Not mentioned\", \"solution\": \"Not mentioned\", \"pressure\": \"Not mentioned\", \"temperature\": \"Not mentioned\", \"time\": \"Not mentioned\"}], \"yield\": \"Not mentioned\", \"chemical formula\": \"Not mentioned\"}]')"], "include_properties": []}, {"idx": 18, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig5\" position=\"float\">\n<label>5</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Structure of FDM-22V.
