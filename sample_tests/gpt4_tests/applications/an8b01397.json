Increasing the concentration of ethylene did not impact\nthe amount of C4 products, indicating that these byproducts\nare primarily the result of acetylene dimerization rather than deleterious\nreactions involving ethylene. In fact, under conditions that simulate\nthe industrially relevant removal of acetylene from ethylene (97%\nethylene and 3% acetylene reactant stream), we observed the complete\nconsumption of acetylene while maintaining a very high purity of ethylene\n(>99.5%). Ethane and C4 byproducts together comprise\n<0.5\nmol % of the product stream under these conditions, illustrating the\ntremendous selectivity of the CuNPs@NU-1000 catalyst.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 13, "type": "text", "classification": ["synthesis condition"], "content": "<p>This propensity\nfor semihydrogenation can be rationalized by computational\nwork on the hydrogenation of acetylene and ethylene over graphene-supported\nCu clusters, which are structurally similar\nto the subnanometer Cu particles surrounded by pyrene-based linkers\nin CuNPs@NU-1000.
