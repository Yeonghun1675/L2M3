Moreover, a high areal specific capacitance of 2.33 F cm\u20132 was also achieved in the three-electrode system.\nIn terms of the practical supercapacitor application, the flexible\nsupercapacitor device based on ZIF\u2013PPy-2 exhibits stable performance\nbetween 0 and 0.6 V and a high areal specific capacitance of 225.8\nmF cm\u20132. To the best of our knowledge, this value\nis far above those achieved for previously reported MOF-based flexible\nsupercapacitors. With the benefits of its high flexibility, environmental\nfriendliness, and ease of connection in series and parallel, the ZIF\u2013PPy-2\nflexible supercapacitor device has high potential for applications\nin flexible/wearable electronics.", "data": [{"surface_area": [], "etc": [{"material": "ZIF-67", "property name": "gravimetric specific capacitance", "value": "554.4", "unit": "F g\u20131", "condition": "at a current density of 0.5 A g\u20131"}, {"material": "ZIF-67", "property name": "areal specific capacitance", "value": "2.33", "unit": "F cm\u20132", "condition": "in the three-electrode system"}, {"material": "ZIF\u2013PPy-2", "property name": "areal specific capacitance", "value": "225.8", "unit": "mF cm\u20132", "condition": "between 0 and 0.6 V"}]}], "include_properties": ["surface_area", "etc"]}, {"idx": 34, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information\nis\navailable free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsami.7b09944\">10.1021/acsami.7b09944</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>FESEM images,\nFTIR spectrum, and N<sub>2</sub> adsorption\u2013desorption\nisotherms of PPy tubes; the specific surface areas of ZIF-67 and ZIF\u2013PPy\nhybrids; FESEM images of the ZIF\u2013PPy-2 electrode through 10\u2009000\ncycles; the electrochemical performance of ZIF\u2013PPy hybrids;\nthe electrochemical performance of a ZIF\u2013PPy-2-based flexible\nsupercapacitor; and comparisons of capacitance for ZIF\u2013PPy-2\nand other MOF-based electrodes (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.7b09944/suppl_file/am7b09944_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information\nis\navailable free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acsami.7b09944.\n\nFESEM images,\nFTIR spectrum, and N2 adsorption\u2013desorption\nisotherms of PPy tubes; the specific surface areas of ZIF-67 and ZIF\u2013PPy\nhybrids; FESEM images of the ZIF\u2013PPy-2 electrode through 10\u2009000\ncycles; the electrochemical performance of ZIF\u2013PPy hybrids;\nthe electrochemical performance of a ZIF\u2013PPy-2-based flexible\nsupercapacitor; and comparisons of capacitance for ZIF\u2013PPy-2\nand other MOF-based electrodes (PDF)\n\n\n", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 35, "type": "text", "classification": ["property", "synthesis condition"], "content": "<p>FESEM images,\nFTIR spectrum, and N<sub>2</sub> adsorption\u2013desorption\nisotherms of PPy tubes; the specific surface areas of ZIF-67 and ZIF\u2013PPy\nhybrids; FESEM images of the ZIF\u2013PPy-2 electrode through 10\u2009000\ncycles; the electrochemical performance of ZIF\u2013PPy hybrids;\nthe electrochemical performance of a ZIF\u2013PPy-2-based flexible\nsupercapacitor; and comparisons of capacitance for ZIF\u2013PPy-2\nand other MOF-based electrodes (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.7b09944/suppl_file/am7b09944_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>", "clean_text": "FESEM images,\nFTIR spectrum, and N2 adsorption\u2013desorption\nisotherms of PPy tubes; the specific surface areas of ZIF-67 and ZIF\u2013PPy\nhybrids; FESEM images of the ZIF\u2013PPy-2 electrode through 10\u2009000\ncycles; the electrochemical performance of ZIF\u2013PPy hybrids;\nthe electrochemical performance of a ZIF\u2013PPy-2-based flexible\nsupercapacitor; and comparisons of capacitance for ZIF\u2013PPy-2\nand other MOF-based electrodes (PDF)", "data": ["\"I do not know\"", {"surface_area": ["\"I do not know\""]}], "include_properties": ["surface_area"]}, {"idx": 36, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The authors\ndeclare no competing financial interest.</p>", "clean_text": "The authors\ndeclare no competing financial interest.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}], "metadata": {"doi": "10.1021/acsami.7b09944", "title": "\nThree-Dimensional\nNetworked Metal\u2013Organic Frameworks\nwith Conductive Polypyrrole Tubes for Flexible Supercapacitors\n", "journal": "American\nChemical Society", "date": "2017.10", "author_list": ["Xu\nXingtao", "Tang\nJing", "Qian\nHuayu", "Hou\nShujin", "Bando\nYoshio", "Hossain\nMd.
