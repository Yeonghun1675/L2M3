A sharp photocurrent was generated when the cluster/ITO electrode was subjected to excitation with UV and visible light. The irradiation process was repeated 20 times over 400\u00a0s, and the UV light was cut at 380\u00a0nm or 400\u00a0nm. The reproducible photocurrent responses without noticeable decrease in their relative intensities, despite of the dissimilar base curves, demonstrate the repeatabilities of the photoelectrode responses and hence the mechanical and photophysical stabilities of the electrodes. It should be noted that the current intensity is related to the wavelength of the light and the type of the clusters. The results are summarized as following. (1) The current intensity using a 380\u00a0nm UV filter (, the left) is larger than that using a 400\u00a0nm UV filter (, the right), about 1.7 times.
