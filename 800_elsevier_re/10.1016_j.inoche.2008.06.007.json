The structure of 1 is a one-dimensional infinite chain polymer, while the magnetic investigations demonstrate that 1 exhibits intrachain Cu(II)-Cu(II) antiferromagnetic interaction with J =-2.276cm-1.\n\nAbstract\n\nUsing chiral bidentate ligand containing N-donors LRR (-)-4,5 pinene bipyridine, a 1D chain single-\u03bc-chloro bridged Cu(II) complex (CuLRRCl2) n  (1) was synthesized in methanol and characterized by X-ray crystallography and magnetic measurements. X-ray analysis shows that 1 crystallizes in space group Pbca of orthorhombic. The structure of 1 is a neutral, one-dimensional infinite chain polymer. The magnetic investigations demonstrate that complex 1 exhibits intrachain Cu(II)-Cu(II) antiferromagnetic coupling with J =-2.276cm-1.\n\nX-ray crystal structure analysis of 1  reveals that the crystallographic unit of 1 consists of a Cu(II) ion, a chiral bidentate ligand containing N-donors and two Cl anions. As shown in  , the five-coordinated Cu(II) exhibits distorted square-pyramidal geometry. The bridging Cl1 atom occupies the apical site, while the N1-N2-Cl1A-Cl2 atoms make up the basal plane with mean deviation of 0.2816\u00c5 from this plane (symmetric code, A: 0.5+ x, y, 0.5- z). The Cl1A, Cl2, N1 and N2 atoms deviate from the least-squares plane are 0.2427, -0.2416, -0.3215 and 0.3204\u00c5, respectively. The central Cu1 lies 0.2407\u00c5 away from the least-squares plane, on the other side of the apical atom Cl1. The average Cu1-N bond length is 2.004\u00c5, which is comparable to the reported complex containing bipy (bipy=2,2'-bipyridine) .

Cl1 atom bridges between adjacent Cu(II) ions to form the uniform chain ( ). The Cu-Cu distance in the chain is 4.264(2)\u00c5, which is longer than the similar compound with dichloro-bridging  and single chloro-bridging .

The reason is that complex 1 crystallize in centrosymmetric space group Pbca of orthorhombic, which leads to the molecule belonging to mesomer and does not retain chirality.\n\nThe magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed on SQUID magnetometer based on polycrystalline samples of complex 1 over the temperature range 1.8-300K under the field of 2kOe. As shown in  , above 100K \u03c7 m T is nearly constant with a value of 0.43cm3 Kmol-1 that is closed to the expected value (0.42cm3 Kmol-1) for isolated S =1/2 Cu(II) ion assuming g =2.1. Below 100K this value drastically drops to 0.046cm3 Kmol-1 at 1.8K. Additionally, with the temperature cooling, the susceptibility (\u03c7 m) increases and reach a maximum of 0.038cm3 mol-1 at 4K.
