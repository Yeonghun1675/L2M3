As shown in Fig. S4, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) studies reveal that 1 gradually loses the free DEF and coordinated water molecules (obsd. 32.8%, calcd. 33.2%) in the temperature range 25-250\u00b0C to form the desolvated framework 1a. Typically, the free solvent molecules were lost first followed by the coordinated solvent molecules. However, because DEF has much higher boiling point (153\u00b0C) than water, DEF and coordinated water molecules might be released simultaneously from 1, so we cannot specifically assign the weight loss steps for these two types of solvent molecules from the TGA data. The temperature dependent PXRD patterns further confirm that desolvated framework keeps crystalline nature until 250\u00b0C, though the diffraction peaks were slightly broaden and shifted. After gas sorption, 1a still exhibits a moderately high crystalline nature, indicating that 1a displays a permanent porous structure.\n\nTo check the selective adsorption properties of 1a, hydrogen and nitrogen adsorptions were carried out at 77K; carbon dioxide, methane, and acetylene adsorptions were carried out at 273K and 296K, respectively. As shown in  , 1a can take up a relatively significant amount of hydrogen (24.4cm3/g) but a negligible amount of nitrogen (2.3cm3/g) at 77K and 1atm, underlying a good capacity of 1a for H2/N2 separation . 1a can also absorb 23.3cm3/g acetylene and 23.0cm3/g carbon dioxide, but a very limited amount of methane (7.3cm3/g) at 273K and 1atm ( ). Their adsorption isotherms at 296K (Fig. S6) further confirmed the different gas uptakes of 1a for these examined gas molecules, underlining the potential of these new MOFs for the selective gas separation of C2H2/CH4, CO2/CH4.\n\nThe coverage-dependent adsorption enthalpies of 1a to carbon dioxide, acetylene, and methane were calculated based on the virial method, a well-established and reliable methodology from fits of their adsorption isotherms at 273K and 296K (Fig. S7) . The enthalpies at zero coverage of gas were calculated to give the values of 38.3, 34.7, and 28.6kJ/mol for C2H2, CO2, and CH4 respectively. The adsorption enthalpies for C2H2, CO2, and CH4 in 1a are moderately higher than those reported values . The relatively high Qst  of this compound may be due to the pore size and open metal sites in the activated framework, which favors the selective gas separation for these large gas molecules. Henry's law selectivities (Sij ) for C2H2/CH4, CO2/CH4 calculated respectively based on the equation Sij  = KHi /KHj , are also shown in Table S1, which are moderately high .\n\nThe X-ray diffraction data was collected using synchrotron radiation, \u03bb=0.40663\u00c5, at Advanced Photon Source on beamline 15ID-C.
