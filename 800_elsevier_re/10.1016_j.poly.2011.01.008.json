On lowering the temperature from 300.0K to 2.0K, the \u03c7 M T value gradually increases to reach a maximum value of 20.78cm3 Kmol-1 at 6.0K, and then slightly decreases to 19.05cm3 Kmol-1 at 2.0K. The increase of the \u03c7 M T value in the higher temperature region indicates the operation of a ferromagnetic interaction between CuII and GdIII ions, while the slight decrease in the lower temperature region can be ascribed to a weak intermolecular antiferromagnetic interaction, probably related to the hydrogen bond between two tetrameric units.

As the complex crystallizes into the centrosymmetric space group, the crystal involves two enantiomers of [NaCuLdpen(1R,2S)(DMF)] and [NaCuLdpen(1S,2R)(DMF)].   shows the molecular structures of [NaCuLdpen(1R,2S)(DMF)] and [NaCuLdpen(1S,2R)(DMF)] with the selected atom numbering scheme, showing how two complex anions are related by a mirror. The CuII ion has a square-planar coordination geometry with N2O2 donor atoms of a trinegative tetradentate ligand (Ldpen(  meso )3-. The coordination bond distances are Cu-O(1)=1.910(2), Cu-O(2)=1.881(2), Cu-N(1)=1.940(2), and Cu-N(2)=1.901(2)\u00c5, in which the Cu-O(1) and Cu-N(1) bond distances at the 3-ethoxysalicylaldehyde moiety are longer than their corresponding values of Cu-O(2) and Cu-N(2) at the 2-hydroxybenzamido moiety, respectively, demonstrating that the NO donors of the 2-hydroxy-3-ethoxybenzylidene group give a weaker ligand field than that of 2-hydroxybenzamido.\n\nAs shown in , the Na+ cation is coordinated by two phenoxo and one ethoxy oxygen atoms of a CuII complex. The Na+ ion is coordinated in total by five oxygen atoms consisting of two phenoxo oxygen atoms O(1), O(2) and one ethoxy oxygen atom O(3), one oxygen atom O(5) of DMF molecule, and an amido oxygen atom O(4)\u2217 of an adjacent anion-complex [CuLdpen(  meso  )]-. These distances are Na-O(1)=2.302(3), Na-O(2)=2.356(3), Na-O(3)=2.598(3), Na-O(4)\u2217 =2.243(3), and Na-O(5)=2.320(3)\u00c5. Among the five Na-O distances, the distance of Na-O(4)\u2217 =2.243(3)\u00c5 between an Na+ ion and the amido oxygen atom O(4)\u2217 of the adjacent molecule is the shortest. As a result of the Na-O(4)\u2217 bond, the CuII complex forms a one-dimensional (1D) chain structure as shown in  . The compound is best described as [NaCuLdpen(  meso  )(DMF)], which represents the repeating unit of the 1D chain.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "[CuIILdpen(meso)GdIII(thd)2(H2O)]2", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "C104H130Cu2Gd2N4O18"}, "chemical formula weight": [{"value": "2165.70", "unit": "g/mol", "condition": ""}], "crystal system": [{"value": "triclinic", "condition": ""}], "space group": [{"value": "P1", "condition": ""}], "lattice parameters": [{"value": {"a": "14.2599", "b": "20.9551", "c": "22.345", "alpha": "61.074", "beta": "70.064", "gamma": "81.138"}, "condition": ""}], "density": [{"value": "1.309", "unit": "g/cm^3", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "[NaCuIILdpen(meso)(DMF)]", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "crystal system": [{"value": "monoclinic", "condition": ""}], "space group": [{"value": "P21/c", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["chemical_formula_weight", "crystal_system", "space_group", "lattice_parameters", "density"]}, {"idx": "32, 33", "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<ce:section-title>Crystal structure of [Cu<ce:sup loc=\"post\">II</ce:sup>L<ce:sup loc=\"post\">dpen(</ce:sup>\n<ce:italic>\n<ce:sup loc=\"post\">meso</ce:sup>\n</ce:italic>\n<ce:sup loc=\"post\">)</ce:sup>Gd<ce:sup loc=\"post\">III</ce:sup>(thd)<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>(H<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>O)]<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>\n</ce:section-title><ce:para id=\"p0090\" view=\"all\">This complex was obtained as thin-plate crystals.
