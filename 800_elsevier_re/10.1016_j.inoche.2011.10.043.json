"clean_text": "There is one remaining issue that needs to be resolved: where and how H3BO3 molecules and CO3 2- anions come from when considering the starting reagents only containing Ag2O, bpp and Na2B4O5(OH)4\u22c58H2O. The formation of boric acid molecules are unambiguously related to the hydrolysis of borax in alkaline conditions (25% NH3 aqueous solution used) . Attempts to run the reactions in the absence of CO2 could not lead to the isolation of 1. On the other hand, the yield of 1 could be improved from 22.8% to 58.2% by running the experiment in a CO2 rich atmosphere. All the experimental results clearly suggest that the CO3 2- anions derive from the absorption and hydration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The hydration of aerial CO2 gives H2CO3, which in turn undergoes deprotonation in alkaline conditions. The existence of the CO3 2- anions in 1 was further confirmed by FT-IR spectrum measured in the solid state. Strong carbonate-related vibrations are observed at 1422cm-1 . It should be noteworthy that NH3\u22c5H2O proved to be vital for the formation of the title compound, although it was not incorporated in the final products. As a base, NH3\u22c5H2O firstly favours the transformation of CO2 to CO3 2- ions via hydration . On the other hand, it may also react with AgI to form unstable species [Ag(NH3)2](OH) , which facilitates the growth of single crystals of 1. In sum, the main reaction process for the formaion of 1 in aqueous solution could be summarized as follows:  (1)   C  O 2  +  H 2  O \u21cc  H 2  C  O 3  \u21cc  H +  + H C  O 3    -  \u21cc 2  H +  + C  O 3     2 -         (2)       B 4   O 5     O H   4     2 -   + 7  H 2  O \u21cc 4  H 3  B  O 3  + 2 O  H -        (3)     A  g +  + b p p +  H 3  B  O 3  + C  O 3     2 -   +  H 2  O    \u2192  N  H 3  \u22c5  H 2  O             A  g 2     b p p   2      H 2  O   2    \u22c5       H 3  B  O 3    3    C  O 3    \u22c5 2  H 2  O           ", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 13, "type": "text", "classification": ["property"], "content": "<ce:para id=\"p0040\" view=\"all\">Excitation of solid powder sample <ce:bold>1</ce:bold> at 330<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>nm produces an emission with a maximum at <ce:italic>ca.</ce:italic> 460<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>nm .
