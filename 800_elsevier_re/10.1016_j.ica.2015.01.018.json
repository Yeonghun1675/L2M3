The 1/\u03c7m  versus T plot for 2 displays Curie-Weiss behavior from 300 to 50K, the best linear fit of \u03c7m  -1(T) data above 50K yields C =3.04cm3 Kmol-1 and \u03b8 =1.18K. This positive Weiss constant indicates the presence of an ferromagnetic interaction between Co(II) centers through the intermolecular interactions. The \u03c7mT value at 300K is 2.78cm3 Kmol-1. Upon cooling the \u03c7mT value exhibits a slight increase until 160K; this may be indicative of the occurrence of ferromagnetic interactions between the Co(II) centers of one-dimensional molecular chains. At low temperature starting from 160K, the \u03c7mT value sharply decreases to a minimum value of 1.85cm3 Kmol-1 at 2K. The magnetic behaviors of complexes 5 and 6 are similar to that of complex 2. The 1/\u03c7m  versus T plots for 5 and 6 display Curie-Weiss behaviors from 300 to 50K, the best linear fit of \u03c7m  -1(T) data above 50K yields C =3.04cm3 Kmol-1, \u03b8 =3.29K for 5 and C =3.04 cm3 Kmol-1, \u03b8 =1.18K for 6. This positive Weiss constant indicates the presence of a ferromagnetic interaction between Co(II) centres.\n\nFor complexes 3 and 4, however, upon cooling the \u03c7mT value exhibits a rapid increase until 10K and 45K; this may be indicative of the occurrence of weak ferromagnetic interactions between Cu(II) and Mn(II) centers through the intermolecular interactions. As shown in  and , the inverse molar susceptibility above 50K fits well with the Curie-Weiss law with a Curie constant C =0.5874cm3 Kmol-1 and a Weiss temperature \u03b8 =42.37K for 3 and C =4.03cm3 Kmol-1, \u03b8 =6.93K for 4. The positive Weiss constant indicated ferromagnetic coupling between the Cu(II) and Mn(II) ions.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "complex 2", "symbol": "2", "chemical formula": "Co(II)"}, "magnetic
