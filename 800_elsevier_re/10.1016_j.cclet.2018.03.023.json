BUT-29 can be used as an efficient adsorbent for the selective removal of organic cationic dyes in N,N'-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution. The adsorption capacities of BUT-29 toward methylene blue and crystal violet at 298K can reach 1119mg/g and 832mg/g, respectively.

The In-O distances are in the range of 2.2617(1) \u00c5 to 2.2905(1) \u00c5, being comparable to those of reported indium complexes . As shown in c, the carboxylate groups in PBPTTBA4- ligand exhibit chelating coordination mode, with each one coordinates to one InIII ion. Thus, one InIII connect to four PBPTTBA4- ligands and one PBPTTBA4- ligand connect to four InIII atoms to form a 3D framework with one dimensional (1D) rhombic channel, the edge length of which is 16.8\u00c5 (atom to atom distance). Furthermore, two such frameworks are mutually interpenetrated (d). After removal of free solvent molecules, the total solvent-accessible volume of BUT-29 is estimated to be 71.3% by PLATON. From the topological viewpoint, each In(COO)4 node and PBPTTBA4- ligand can be viewed as 4-connected nodes, the 3D structure of BUT-29 can thus be simplified as a 4,4-c net with the point symbol of (42 \u00d784), corresponding to a Pts-type topology. It should be noted that in the framework of BUT-29, every InIII atom connect with four carboxylic groups, thus, in its pore, there should exist counter-cations to balance the charge of the framework. However, due to the disordered nature, these counter-cations could not be identified through single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. We speculate that these counter-cations should be (CH3)2NH2+, which is a common by-product in the solvothermal reaction when DMF was used as solvent. EA analysis was then carried out, which showed extra N content inside the pore, which implied the presence of (CH3)2NH2+. Furthermore, in the TGA curve of the as-synthesized BUT-29, there exist a 7.1% weight loss between 200\u00b0C and 340\u00b0C, which is well corresponding to the presence of one (CH3)2NH2+ ion per formula (Fig. S1).\n\nBased on the large rhombic channels and cationic framework of BUT-29, we sought to explore its application in the removal of organic dyes. Fifteen dyes including AH, AR, SO, MB, CV, R6G, CR, orange G, NYS, orange II, AF, MO, MY, Tartrazine, and Isatin were checked. Freshly prepared BUT-29 was well activated and then immersed in DMF solutions of these dyes at room temperature. The adsorption abilities of BUT-29 toward these dyes were determined by UV-vis spectroscopy. As shown in  a-d and Figs. S4 (Supporting information), nearly all the cationic dyes can be removed within 15min, while the anionic and neutral dyes could not be absorbed. To future demonstrate the selective adsorption of BUT-29 toward cationic dyes, the MOF samples were soaked in the binary mixtures of MB/MO, MB/RB with the concentration ratio is 50/50, respectively. The results were as expected: only the MB was absorbed by the BUT-29 in the solution mixture and the solutions exhibited the color of MO or RB at last and the color of the BUT-29 changed from yellow to blue (inset photograph of e and f). Moreover, compared to other absorbents using a few days, the absorption rate of cationic dyes by BUT-29 was really fast, and nearly 100% of dye molecules can be absorbed within 10min. The high adsorption rate is attributed to the large size of the cage windows (12.4\u00d77.1\u00c5) and negative charged framework.\n\nIn the above experiments, it was showed that MB and CV can be completely adsorbed within 6min and 4min in BUT-29, respectively (a and c). Thus, we further explored the adsorption isotherms of MB and CV in BUT-29 at 298K. As shown in  a, the maximum adsorption amounts of MB and CV in BUT-29 are 1119 and 832mg/g, respectively. These values are comparable and even higher than those in other porous materials reported so far (Table S2 in Supporting information). In addition, we further measured the of FT-IR spectra of MB loaded BUT-29 and found the appearance of an extra characteristic peak in the wavenumber of 1323cm-1, which should be the stretching vibration peak of C-N bond of MB molecules, indicating that MB molecules are indeed adsorbed into the pores of BUT-29 (Fig. S5 in Supporting information). The superior performances of BUT-29 in MB and CV adsorptions could be ascribed to their large specific surface areas, suitable pore size, as well as the ionic interactions between the cationic dye and anionic framework structure of BUT-29. Moreover, Langmuir  and Freundlich  models were used to fit and examine above adsorption isotherms respectively. The related parameters are given in Figs. S6 and S7 in Supporting information. Obviously, the data are well fitted by the Langmuir model, indicating a homogeneous and monolayer adsorption occurring in BUT-29 with a finite number of identical sites.\n\nIn summary, a new In(III)-based MOF, BUT-29, has been designed, synthesized, and used in the selective adsorption of organic cationic dyes in DMF solution. BUT-29 has a 3D framework with one dimensional (1D) rhombic channel, which is occupied by (CH3)2NH2 2+ counter ions. BUT-29 can be used as an excellent candidate for the selective adsorption of organic cationic dyes and its maximum adsorption amounts toward MB and CV are 1119mg/g and 832mg/g, respectively, comparable or higher than those in other porous materials reported so far. The adsorption isotherms of BUT-29 toward MB and CV can be fitted by the Langmuir model, indicating a homogeneous and monolayer adsorption process. In addition, BUT-29 can be fully reused after washing with DMF solution of LiNO3 several times.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "BUT-29", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "cationic dyes", "adsorbed amount": "1119 mg/g", "unit": "", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "", "condition": "in DMF solution"}, {"adsorbate": "cationic dyes", "adsorbed amount": "832 mg/g", "unit": "", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "", "condition": "in DMF solution"}]}]], "include_properties": ["gas_adsorption"]}, {"idx": 1, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<ce:figure id=\"fig0005\">\n<ce:label>Fig. 1</ce:label>\n<ce:caption id=\"cap0005\">\n<ce:simple-para id=\"spar0005\" view=\"all\">(a) View of the [In(CO<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>)<ce:inf loc=\"post\">4</ce:inf>] node; (b) View of the single open framework in <ce:bold>BUT-29</ce:bold> along c axis, showing large rhombic channels (c) coordination mode of the PBPTTBA<ce:sup loc=\"post\">4\u2212</ce:sup> ligand; (d) View of the 3D framework of <ce:bold>BUT-29</ce:bold> along c axis, showing two-fold interpenetration of the network.</ce:simple-para>\n</ce:caption>\n<ce:alt-text id=\"at0530\" role=\"short\">Fig. 1</ce:alt-text>\n<ce:link locator=\"gr1\" xlink:href=\"pii:S100184171830127X/gr1\" xlink:role=\"http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4\" xlink:type=\"simple\"></ce:link>\n</ce:figure>", "clean_text": " Fig. 1  (a) View of the [In(CO2)4] node; (b) View of the single open framework in BUT-29 along c axis, showing large rhombic channels (c) coordination mode of the PBPTTBA4- ligand; (d) View of the 3D framework of BUT-29 along c axis, showing two-fold interpenetration of the network.
