Their in vitro anticancer activities against T-24, MGC-80-3, HeLa, Hep-G2, A549 and SK-OV-3 were evaluated. Compared with their corresponding ligands, most of these complexes exhibited enhanced anticancer activities in contrast to their corresponding ligands and copper salt. Among them, complexes 1 and 3 displayed selective cytotoxicity to HeLa cells comparing with normal liver cell HL-7702, with IC50 values of 5.03\u00b11.20\u03bcM and 10.05\u00b10.52\u03bcM, respectively. Complexes 1 and 3 inhibited telomerase activity by interacting with c-myc promoter elements, and therefore exerted their antitumor activity. Furthermore, complexes 1 and 3 could trigger cell apoptosis via disruption of mitochondrial pathway through notably increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03c8m), increase of the cytochrome c and apaf-1, decrease of bcl-2, and activation of caspases 3/9. Complexes 1 and 3 exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity, presenting synergetic effect after the ligands coordinated to copper(II) center.\n\nThe crystal structures of complexes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are shown in (B), (C), (D), (E), (F) and (G), respectively. Selected bond angle and bond length data are listed in Table S4. The copper centers in complexes 2 to 7 all are tetra-coordinated with one bidentate chelating L  1 /L  2 /L  3  (via N1, N2 atoms) and two monodentate anions (Cl-/Br-/NO3 -), forming a nearly square-planar geometry. In complexes 2-7, all bond lengths of CuN, CuO, CuCl and CuBr are in the ranges of 1.969-2.048, 1.960-1.981, 2.014-2.2385 and 2.340-2.369\u00c5, respectively, which are within the normal range [,,,].\n\nStability and solubility studies of Cu(II) complexes 1-7\n\nThe stability of L  1 -L  3  and complexes 1-7 (1.0\u00d710-5M) in 10mM Tris-HCl buffer solution (, pH=7.35, containing 1.0% DMSO) were measured by following the changes in the UV-visible spectroscopy as shown in Fig. S27. The time-dependent (0h, 24h and 48h) UV-Vis spectra of the tested compounds revealed slight hypochromicity but no remarkable shift over time, indicating that these complexes were stable in Tris-HCl buffer solution for 48h at room temperature. In addition, their stabilities were further investigated by HPLC. As depicted in Fig. S28, the retention time for all compounds remained unchanged under the same conditions (mobile phase: 90:10 or 80:20 methanol/H2O), which showed that complexes 1-7 were stable for 48h in  stock solution. The results suggested that complexes 1-7 were stable in TBS and DMSO solution. Further confirmed by ESI-MS, complex 1 was existed as mononuclear species because it was dissociated in solution (Fig. S10).\n\nIn addition, the water solubility of complexes 1-7 was determined gravimetrically by UV spectroscopy (containing 2.0% DMSO), as shown in Fig. S29 [,].

Among them, complexes 1 and 3, especially complex 1, exhibited higher anticancer activity against most of the tested human tumor cell lines, with lower IC50 values (IC50=5.03-15.86\u03bcM).

As depicted in A, complex 1 (5\u03bcM) was significantly accumulated ((5.26\u00b10.05nmol Cu)/106 cells) in the HeLa cells, whereas cisplatin (15.0\u03bcM) and complex 3 (10.0\u03bcM) showed much less accumulation, with contents of (3.92\u00b10.08nmol Pt)/106 cells and (4.35\u00b10.12nmol Cu)/106 cells, respectively. The cell uptake of Cu in HeLa cells in complex 1 was higher than that in complex 3, probably benefit to improve its cytotoxicity.\n\nEffects of complexes 1 and 3 on the expression of c-myc and hTERT genes and proteins\n\nRecent studies have revealed that the expressions of c-myc and hTERT genes may be vital for the telomerase activity [,].

Recently, an increasing number of studies have indicated that telomerase could be an appealing target for drug design and anticancer therapy [,,,,,]. Hence, TRAP-silver staining assay was carried out for complexes 1 and 3.   revealed that complexes 1 (5.0\u03bcM) and 3 (10.0\u03bcM) could significantly inhibit telomerase activity in HeLa cells with the order of complex 1>complex 3. The inhibitory rates of telomerase expression of complexes 1 and 3 reached 44.06% and 40.70%, respectively.\n\nMeasurement of mitochondrial membrane potential ()\n\nRecent studies show that mitochondria play a crucial role in the regulation of various apoptosis pathways [,]. Cellular uptake study indicated that complexes 1 (5.0\u03bcM) and 3 (10.0\u03bcM) were more effectively accumulated to mitochondrial fraction and nuclear fraction. To establish whether the apoptotic mechanisms induced by complexes 1 and 3 are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, the alteration in \u0394\u03c8m was measured through the examination of complexes 1 (5.0\u03bcM) and 3 (10.0\u03bcM) treated HeLa cells by flow cytometry after staining with 5,5',6,6'-tetra-chloro-1,1'3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine () cationic dye. As shown in  , the treatment of HeLa cells with complexes 1 (5.0\u03bcM) and 3 (10.0\u03bcM) for 24h caused obvious \u0394\u03c8m loss comparing with the control (24.3% and 22.70%, respectively), suggesting that the mitochondrial membrane was significantly damaged. The results indicated that the cell apoptosis induced by complexes 1 (5.0\u03bcM) and 3 (10.0\u03bcM) was related to the mitochondrial pathway.\n\nEffect on intracellular ROS generation\n\nAn increasing number of anticancer drugs induce the production of reactive oxygen species () in tumor cells, ultimately inducing cancer cell death and/or apoptosis [,,]. Herein, we investigated the effects of complexes 1 (5.0, 10.0\u03bcM), 3 (10.0\u03bcM) and Cisplatin (15.0\u03bcM) on inducing the production of ROS that could potentially lead to the cytotoxic effect in HeLa cells. The ROS levels were examined by using an oxidant-sensitive fluorescent probe, 2',7'-dichlorofluorescindiacetate (DCFH-DA). As illustrated in  , upon treatment of HeLa cells with complexes 1 (5.0, 10.0\u03bcM), 3 (10.0\u03bcM) and cisplatin (15.0\u03bcM) for 24h, the levels of ROS (strong green fluorescence observed under a Nikon Te2000 deconvolution microscope) were significantly increased in HeLa cells, which agreed well with the flow cytometric analysis results for ROS generation in HeLa cells (  and Fig. S30). Taken together, these results suggested that complexes 1 (5.0\u03bcM, 10.0\u03bcM) and 3 (10.0\u03bcM) (compared with cisplatin) have induced oxidative imbalance, enhanced the generation of ROS in HeLa cells, and ultimately caused cell apoptosis via mitochondrial pathway [,]. The above outcomes are in good agreement with the results of MTT assay, cell uptake assay, telomerase inhibition and mitochondrial membrane potential assay.\n\nDetermination of cell apoptosis by flow cytometry\n\nTherefore, the apoptotic effects of complexes Cisplatin(15.0\u03bcM)\uff0c1 (5.0\u03bcM) and 3 (10.0\u03bcM) were further evaluated by Annexin V FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate)/PI (propidium iodide) double staining assay [,]. After exposure to Cisplatin(15.0\u03bcM)\uff0c1 (5.0\u03bcM) and 3 (10.0\u03bcM) for 24h, significant apoptosis of HeLa cells was effectively induced, and the population of apoptic cells (Q2+Q3) were 13.09%, 43.70% and 37.65%, respectively ( ). Furthermore, the cell apoptotic effect of complex 1 (5.0\u03bcM) was stronger than that of complex 3 (10.0\u03bcM) and cisplatin (15.0\u03bcM).\n\nActivation of caspase-3 and caspase-9\n\nThe activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 plays a critical role in the process of programmed cell death or/and apoptosis [,,,]. To better understand the apoptotic pathway induced by complexes 1 (5.0\u03bcM) and 3 (10.0\u03bcM) in HeLa cells, the expressions of caspase-3/9 were assessed by flow cytometry. As shown in  , after treated with complexes 1, 3 and cisplatin for 24h, the caspase-3 expression levels were increased from 3.60% to 17.50%, 12.90% and 11.10%, respectively. And the expression of caspase-9 was increased from 2.60% to 9.87%, 7.09% and 5.62%, compared to untreated control, respectively, which confirmed that complexes 1 and 3 induced HeLa cells apoptosis [,,]. These results suggested that complexes 1 and 3 could induce the expression of caspase-3/-9 and cause apoptosis.\n\n Data for L  1 : 1H NMR (500MHz, CDCl3):\u03b4 8.77 (s, 1H, H-8), 8.69 (d, J=5.8Hz, 1H, H-3), 8.37-8.34 (m, 1H, H-6'), 8.29 (d, J=5.7Hz, 1H, H-4), 8.06 (d, J=7.7Hz, 1H, H-3'), 7.96-7.90 (m, 1H, H-4'), 7.46-7.43 (m, 1H, H-5'), 6.33 (s, 2H, H-9). 13C NMR (125MHz, CDCl3) \u03b4 157.82 (C-1), 155.90 (C-6), 148.62 (C-7), 148.46 (C-6'), 147.33 (C-2'), 144.08 (C-3), 137.34 (C-4'), 128.18 (C-4a), 126.36 (C-5), 125.47 (C-3'), 123.61 (C-5'), 122.90 (C-8a), 115.76 (C-8), 109.12 (C-4), 104.02 (C-9).
