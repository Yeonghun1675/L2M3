To this end, the 51V MAS NMR spectra of 1-3 were obtained, with NaVO3 as the reference (-514.4ppm). Positive chemical shift values (\u03b4) are taken to correspond to lower shielding in comparison to the reference. The spectra of 1-3 exhibit resonances in a broad range (-300 to -1000ppm), with the main signals bearing multiple spinning sidebands due to both quadrupolar coupling and chemical shift anisotropy. The identity of the central resonances was confirmed by running experiments with different spinning frequencies. The resonance, the chemical shift of which did not change with frequency, was the one attributed to the main resonance. The spectrum of 1 exhibits one central resonance at -535.7ppm (A), with the spectrum of 2 showing one central resonance at -541.3ppm (B) and that of 3 displaying one central resonance at -536.5ppm (C).

The results show that V(V) affects cell survival in a concentration-dependent manner (p<0.05). Specifically, reduction in cell survival is not affected at low concentrations (1, 10\u03bc\u039c) compared to the control, whereas reduction in cell survival amounts to 40% at 100\u03bc\u039c and almost 50% at 200\u03bc\u039c (p<0.05). Sodium deoxycholate has been used as a positive control, exhibiting full reduction of cell survival under the employed experimental conditions.\n\nLigand toxicity in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes\n\nTo investigate the cytotoxic potential of the organic ligands-substrates LiH (i=1-3) on 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes, the cells were treated with 1, 10, 100, 200\u03bc\u039c of L1H, L2H and L3H, respectively, for 24h ( B-1 through B-3). The results show that L3H affects cell survival in a concentration-dependent manner (p<0.05). \u0399n particular, L3H causes reduction in cell survival amounting to 28% at 1\u03bc\u039c, 35% at 10\u03bc\u039c, 70% at 100\u03bc\u039c and >90% at 200\u03bc\u039c (p<0.05). Ligand L1H reduces cell survival only at the highest concentration (200\u03bc\u039c). Ligand L2H is not cytotoxic at all concentrations tested (p>0.05).\n\nV(V)-induced differentiation\n\nIn an effort to investigate the insulin-mimetic activity, the title complexes were used to induce differentiation of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes into mature adipocytes according to standard protocol. All employed compounds induced differentiation of pre-adipocytes into mature adipocytes as assessed by oil Red O staining (1-20\u03bc\u039c). Differentiation was clearly evident at 1\u03bcM. The maximal effect was observed at 20\u03bc\u039c, when cells were treated with 1 and 2. Compound 3 appears to exert its maximal effect at 1\u03bc\u039c. The effect of the three compounds tested was comparable to the differentiation effect induced by insulin (10ng/mL) ( ). In addition, all three compounds were used at 20\u03bc\u039c in combination with insulin, in an effort to probe potential synergistic interactions involving insulin and the title vanadium compounds. Of the three compounds, only 3 showed evidence of differentiation exemplified through oil red O staining results. To further substantiate the differentiation of pre-adipocytes treated with V(V), RT-PCR was employed to assess the relative expression of GLUT 4 in mature adipocytes. To this end, differentiated mature adipocytes showed a 6.4-fold increase of GLUT 4 compared to undifferentiated pre-adipocytes (p<0.01), when treated with 20\u03bc\u039c of 1 ( ). In the case of 2, there was a 10.4-fold increase when cells were treated with the same vanadium concentration. Interestingly, in the case of 3, the maximum effect was observed at 1\u03bc\u039c (~11 fold). When insulin was used in the differentiation medium of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes in combination with one of 1-3, mRNA expression grew limited in the case of 1 and 2 (compared to insulin), whereas in 3 the relative concentration of GLUT 4 mRNA was similar to that of insulin and the compound itself at 20\u03bc\u039c.\n\nVanadium-potentiated biological activity\n\nVanadium has been shown to mimic insulin action in several ways (e.g. increase of lipogenesis, blood glucose lowering, inhibition of lipolysis). In this regard, the insulin-like effect of the well-defined and characterized synthetic binary V(V) compounds 1-3 was investigated with respect to the induction of pre-adipocyte cell differentiation. Of primary importance, to this end, was the atoxicity of the candidate V(V) compounds toward the 3T3-L1 (pre)adipocyte in the concentration range 1-100\u03bcM. The results, clearly demonstrate the adipogenic potential of vanadium compounds. Initially, the simple KVO3 salt was employed to evaluate toxicity in a concentration-dependent fashion. The results suggest that V(V) alone (in the form of VO3 -) reduces cell viability. Experimentation with the ligands alone and the complexed vanadoforms, bearing variably structured aminoalcoholic moieties, ensued to probe the influence of the organic substrate on the bioactivity of the complex binary species. The cytotoxic profile of each ligand alone (L1H-L3H) in the concentration range (1-100\u03bc\u039c) clearly shows dependence on the nature and number of alcohol arms in the molecule(s). To this end, ligands L1H and L2H are atoxic in the 1-100\u03bc\u039c range, with L3H being clearly toxic in the same range. Interestingly, the binary complex V(V)-[L3H-1] does not appear to be toxic in the same concentration range (vide infra). Examination of the three vanadoforms in in vitro cultures took place in a concentration dependent fashion (1-100\u03bc\u039c) over a period of 24 h. The results suggest that the cytotoxic effects of V(V) ion are significantly reduced through complexation. In fact, all three V(V) compounds appear to be atoxic in the concentration range of 1-100\u03bc\u039c for 24 h and the concentration range 1-50\u03bc\u039c for 48h. Thus, it follows that the nature of substrates L1H-L3H bound to V(V) is crucial to the biological role that it exerts and pre-adipocyte survival. Based on the aforementioned cytotoxicity profile of the title compounds in pre-adipocytes over a period of 48h, work on mature adipocytes post-differentiation (with insulin) ensued over a period of 48h. Treatment with the title compounds showed that cytotoxicity starts settling in at 50\u03bc\u039c for 2 and 3.
