Although it is still difficult to prepare fully predictable entangled structures based on the rational design, recent rapid developments in coordination and organic chemistry provide more and more knowledge and possibilities for the creative synthesis of desired entangled frameworks . Especially in recent years, entangled frameworks have been well developed and systematically discussed in comprehensive reviews by Batten, Robson and Carlucci. In general, the entangled frameworks should possess at least two important structural factors: one is that their independent chain-, layer- or framework-units should contain meshes or pores which are large enough for interpenetration. The other, which is necessary, is that these individual building units should possess the undulating structural feature . Undoubtedly, various long chain-like N-donor ligands with diverse flexibility such as bipyridine- and biimidazole-containing ligands are good candidates for the assembly of versatile entangled structures, mainly because of their propensity to form large voids or corrugation . At this point, the bitetrazolate-containing ligands are also one kind of suitable building blocks since the tetra-N-donor property of the tetrazolate group can provide more coordination sites for metal centers to form complicated frameworks. Generally, the tetrazolate-containing ligands can be obtained from the classical Sharpless [2+3] cycloaddition reactions between cyano precursor and azide group, following by a series of complicated separation and purification steps .

Although it is still difficult to prepare fully predictable entangled structures based on the rational design, recent rapid developments in coordination and organic chemistry provide more and more knowledge and possibilities for the creative synthesis of desired entangled frameworks . Especially in recent years, entangled frameworks have been well developed and systematically discussed in comprehensive reviews by Batten, Robson and Carlucci. In general, the entangled frameworks should possess at least two important structural factors: one is that their independent chain-, layer- or framework-units should contain meshes or pores which are large enough for interpenetration. The other, which is necessary, is that these individual building units should possess the undulating structural feature . Undoubtedly, various long chain-like N-donor ligands with diverse flexibility such as bipyridine- and biimidazole-containing ligands are good candidates for the assembly of versatile entangled structures, mainly because of their propensity to form large voids or corrugation . At this point, the bitetrazolate-containing ligands are also one kind of suitable building blocks since the tetra-N-donor property of the tetrazolate group can provide more coordination sites for metal centers to form complicated frameworks.

Although the Zn<ce:sup loc=\"post\">2+</ce:sup> ions in <ce:bold>2</ce:bold> exhibit a similar coordination mode to <ce:bold>1</ce:bold>, the bpp ligand endows itself an undulated TT (trans\u2013trans) conformation (see \n<ce:float-anchor refid=\"sch2\"></ce:float-anchor>(b)) , looking like the letter \u201cM\u201d, which partly inhibits the formation of large channels and thus decreases the possibility of multiple interpenetration.

Such 2D layers also possess narrow pores, whereas the adjacent layers cannot interpenetrate with each other because of the relative small meshes in the layers and the large steric hindrance from 2,2\u2032-bipy ligands. It is worth mentioning that a little more azide ligand was used by accident during the synthesis of compound <ce:bold>3</ce:bold>, which has been subsequently proved a very important step to isolate the final compound because the azide ligand also acted as linkers to connect the Zn<ce:sup loc=\"post\">2+</ce:sup> ions in compound <ce:bold>3</ce:bold>.

During the present hydrothermal synthesis, various secondary N-donor ligands (4,4'-bipy, bpp and 2,2'-bipy) with different flexibility and coordination modes were introduced into the Zn-ditetrazolate system in order to modulate the structural topologies. As shown in , the use of rigid bridging-ligand 4,4'-bipy led to the isolation of compound 1, which exhibits a fivefold interpenetrated 3D framework based on a diamondoid topology. In 1, both 4,4'-bipy and pdtz2- are rigid linear ligands, resulting in an individual framework with very large pores for further interpenetration (see Fig. S1). When the flexible bpp ligand was employed as the auxiliary ligand, compound 2 was isolated and displays a twofold parallel interpenetrating framework based on undulated layers. Although the Zn2+ ions in 2 exhibit a similar coordination mode to 1, the bpp ligand endows itself an undulated TT (trans-trans) conformation (see  (b)) , looking like the letter \"M\", which partly inhibits the formation of large channels and thus decreases the possibility of multiple interpenetration. The successful preparation of 1 and 2 prompted us to try other auxiliary N-donor ligands. 2,2'-bipy, as one typical chelate ligand, usually plays important roles in \"cutting\" or \"clipping\" high-dimensional frameworks by occupying parts of the coordination sites on metal centers ((c)) and inducing low-dimensional wavelike networks or chains. The introduction of 2,2'-bipy into this Zn-ditetrazolate system led to the isolation of a puckered 2D networks of compound 3. Such 2D layers also possess narrow pores, whereas the adjacent layers cannot interpenetrate with each other because of the relative small meshes in the layers and the large steric hindrance from 2,2'-bipy ligands. It is worth mentioning that a little more azide ligand was used by accident during the synthesis of compound 3, which has been subsequently proved a very important step to isolate the final compound because the azide ligand also acted as linkers to connect the Zn2+ ions in compound 3. Furthermore, 2,2'-bipy plays a \u2018passivating' role in providing steric constrains which can prevent large pdtz2- ligands from coordinating to the metal centers. If the same amount of azide was used as in the preparation of compound 1, compound 3 could not be isolated.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 22, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<ce:para view=\"all\">In addition, a series of parallel experiments demonstrated that some factors such as the pH value, reaction temperature, the molar ratio and the concentration of the initial reagents were important to the isolation of the final crystalline products.
