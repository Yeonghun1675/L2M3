The bond angles of O-Dy-O are in the range of 50.1(2)-155.2(6)\u00b0 comparable to those in other Ln carboxylate complexes observed in our previous papers . In present case, the 3,4-H2qldc was completely deprotonated and each 3,4-qldc2- ligand via \u03bc 3-\u03b7 1:\u03b7 1:\u03b7 1:\u03b7 2 coordination manner links two Dy(III) centers ( ) to generate a 14-membered ring. On the basis of the coordination mode I and conformation of ligand 3,4-qldc2-, two neighboring rings are connected in parrallel into a 1-D zigzag chain along a axis via two \u03bc 2-O3 bridges (a). And then by means of the coordination mode \u03bc 2-\u03ba 4-O of ox2- ligand (viewing as pillars), these one-dimensional chains are constructed to form two-dimensional layers as depicted in b. In order to identify the connectivity in the ligands and metals, the topology of the whole framework is investigated. While considering the dinuclear motif [Dy2(\u03bc 2-O)2] constructed by two \u03bc 2-O3 from two 3,4-qldc2- ligands of two adjacent 14-membered rings as a node (a), the C2O4 2- (b) and 3,4-qldc2- (c) as linkers, the simplified topological representation of the compound 1 is described in , which exhibits a 4-connected 44 topology (d). Moreover, through interlayer \u03c0...\u03c0 stacking interactions, a 3-D network is assembled as shown in Figure S2.\n\nThe XPRD pattern of compound 1 reveals that the title compound is pure single phase and is also of completely identical molecular structures, corresponding to the simulated results from the single-crystal X-ray data (Figure S3). The thermal stability of the title compound was examined and its TGA curve was shown in Figure S4. The experiment was performed on samples consisting of numerous single crystals of the compound under N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10\u00b0C/min. The crystals of 1 showed the first endothermic weight loss of 7.97% around 260\u00b0C, corresponding to the removal of two coordinated water molecules (calcd 7.87%) from one formula unit. And then the weight loss of 8.94% (calc. 9.5%) between 254 and 355\u00b0C ascribes to the loss of half oxalate ligand from one formula unit, and the residue weight corresponds to Dy(3,4-qldc). Another major weight loss occurred in the range of 350-800\u00b0C, Dy2O3 was assumed to be the residual product in 40.91%, supported by the expected value of 40.71%.\n\nThe solid-state luminescence property of this compound was investigated at room temperature. The emission spectra of the compound 1 (Figure S5), obtained with excitation wavelength of 365nm, are composed of emission lines typical for Dysprosium (III). The emission at 479, 577, and 658nm is attributed to the characteristic emission of 4F9/2, and 6HJ (J =15/2, 13/2 and 11/2) transitions of the Dy3+ ion. The relative intensity ratio for the emission lines at 479 and 573nm is indicative of the larger probability for the 4F9/2 \u2192 6HJ (J =15/2, 13/2 and 11/2) transition of the Dy3+ ion.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "1", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "Dy2(3,4-qldc)2(H2O)4"}, "crystal system": [{"value": "triclinic", "condition": ""}], "space group": [{"value": "P-1", "condition": ""}], "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "260", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "removal of two coordinated water molecules", "condition": ""}, {"value": "254 to 355", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "loss of half oxalate ligand", "condition": ""}, {"value": "350 to 800", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "major weight loss", "condition": ""}], "spectrum": [{"value": "479, 577, 658", "unit": "nm", "condition": "emission lines typical for Dysprosium (III)"}]}]], "include_properties": ["crystal_system", "space_group", "decomposition_temperature", "spectrum"]}, {"idx": 1, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<ce:figure id=\"f0010\">\n<ce:label>Fig.\u00a01</ce:label>\n<ce:caption>\n<ce:simple-para id=\"sp0035\" view=\"all\">The coordination environment of the Dy<ce:sup loc=\"post\">III</ce:sup> ion in <ce:bold>1</ce:bold>.
