This method uses a wavelength-sorted white neutron beam combined with large area position-sensitive detectors to allow a large volume of reciprocal space to be measured in a single crystal setting, or frame. The SXD instrument has 11 position-sensitive detectors giving a solid-angle coverage of over 2\u03c0 Sr . The full data collection process consists of a series of frames collected with a stationary crystal-detector arrangement. To aid with data collection times and allow data to be accumulated at several temperatures from the rather small crystals available, a multiple crystal sample technique was employed , allowing a full data set to be collected in fewer frames (crystal orientations).

This method uses a wavelength-sorted white neutron beam combined with large area position-sensitive detectors to allow a large volume of reciprocal space to be measured in a single crystal setting, or frame. The SXD instrument has 11 position-sensitive detectors giving a solid-angle coverage of over 2\u03c0 Sr . The full data collection process consists of a series of frames collected with a stationary crystal-detector arrangement. To aid with data collection times and allow data to be accumulated at several temperatures from the rather small crystals available, a multiple crystal sample technique was employed , allowing a full data set to be collected in fewer frames (crystal orientations). In this example four single crystals, each of approximate dimension 1\u00d71\u00d71mm3, were used; reflections from three of the four crystals were found to be reliably indexed throughout the data collection and were used in the structure determination.
