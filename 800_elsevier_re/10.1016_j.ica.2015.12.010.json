The asymmetric unit contains one Co(II), one AcAIP and one p-BIMB. As shown in  a, Co1 is in a distorted octahedral geometry, and is coordinated by one \u03bc 2,\u03b7 2-carboxylate oxygen atom and one imidazolyl nitrogen atom at the axial positions with the O4B-Co1-N2 bond angle being 176.13(11)\u00b0. One imidazolyl nitrogen atom from p-BIMB (N5C), two chelating carboxylate oxygen atoms (O2A and O3A) and one \u03bc 2,\u03b7 2-carboxylate oxygen atom (O5) from different AcAIP comprise the equatorial plane. Co1 and one symmetry-related Co(II) are bridged by two \u03bc 2,\u03b7 2-carboxylate groups from different AIP to form a dinuclear Co(II)-carboxylate unit, the Co1\u22efCo1A distance in the dinuclear unit is 4.619\u00c5. In AcAIP, acetamido is not involved in coordination, two carboxylate groups function in \u03bc 2,\u03b7 2-bridging and chelating modes, respectively, to bridge three Co(II) ions (c). AcAIP links the dinuclear Co(II) units into a charge-neutral [Co2(AcAIP)2] n  chain (b), the Co\u22efCo separation across AcAIP is 7.982\u00c5. Acetamido lies on two sides of the chain. p-BIMB adopts a gauche configuration, which is much different p-BIMB in 6. As shown in c, p-BIMB links the adjacent chains into a 3-D open framework containing large cavities. The absence of large guest molecules in the void space results in the formation of a twofold interpenetrating network (d), acetamido groups reside in the cavities to further fill with void space of the cavities. The hydrogen bonds between acetamido from different 3-D networks [N1-H1\u22efO1i 3.038(4)\u00c5, symmetry code: (i) x +1/2, y, -z +3/2] further consolidate the whole framework, the closest Co\u22efCo separation between the adjacent interpenetrating 3-D networks is 7.428\u00c5, which is much shorter than Co\u22efCo separation of 13.514\u00c5 across p-BIMB. To gain a better insight into the 3-D structure, topological analysis was undertaken. Taking the dinuclear Co(II) unit as one node, each dinuclear unit becomes an six-connected node, AcAIP and p-BIMB can be regarded as independent two-connected vertices that link two adjacent nodes. The interlinkage of six dinuclear units with two AcAIP and four p-BIMB generates a six-connected topology (e).
