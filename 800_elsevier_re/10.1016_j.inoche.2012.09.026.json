Notably, the strategy for introducing structure-directing species has ever been adopted in the preparations of triazole- and 1-H-benzimidazole-5-carboxylate-containing metal complexes . The decreased amount of the atr ligand weakens the coordination capacity of the exocyclic amino group. The choice of the differently organic solvents depends on the solubility of the reactants and structure-directing agents. In the IR spectra, strong and broad bands centered at 3414cm-1 are resulting from the N-H stretching vibration, indicating the presence of the amino group. A strong peak at 1384cm-1 together with a weak one at 822cm-1 in both 1 and 2 reveals the presence of nitrate anion. In particular, the characteristic absorption at 1384cm-1 for nitrate anion in 2 is split into quadruple peaks located at 1455, 1384, 1353, and 1294cm -1, suggesting the different binding modes of the nitrate anion . The thermogravimetric experiments were also investigated to explore the compositional stability of the two complexes (Fig. S1). As a result, the both coordination polymers can be thermally stable up to 248\u00b0C. Upon further heating, the weight of 1 and 2 begins to abruptly lost, suggesting a completely or partially explosive due to the high nitrogen content . The phase purity and the structural consistency of the bulk samples were further identified by the comparisons of the theoretical and experimental powder X-ray diffraction patterns (Fig. S2).\n\nSynthesis of 1 and 2: An ethanol solution (8.0 mL) of Cu(NO3)2 \u22c5 3H2O (24.2 mg, 0.1 mmol) was layered carefully onto a buffer layer of ethyl acetate (3.0 mL) in a test tube, below which an aqueous solution (4.0 mL, pH=6 adjusted by triethylamine) containing atr (16.8 mg, 0.2 mmol) and L-glutamic acid (15.0 mg, 0.1 mmol) was placed.
