Then the fluorescent properties of compound 1 dispersed in different solvents like DMF, N,N'-dimethylacetamide (DMA), acetone, acetonitrile, dioxane and ethanol were investigated. It was found that the fluorescent emissions have largely solvent dependence. Compound 1 exhibits excellent fluorescence intensity in DMF. However, a certain degree of fluorescent quenching was observed in other solvents (Fig. S4). Therefore, we select DMF as the solvent for the following fluorescence detecting tests. Considering the excellent fluorescence intensity and the large hexagonal channel of compound 1, compound 1 has been investigated as a potential fluorescence sensor for metal cations. Seven kinds of metal cations (Li+, Zn2+, Mg2+, In3+, Al3+, Cu2+, Fe3+) were selected to evaluate the detecting performance of compound 1. As shown in b, the luminescence intensity of compound 1 in Al3+ slightly enhance, those in Cu2+ and Fe3+ decrease obviously, especially in Fe3+, while the other metal cations shown negligible quenching effect. Furthermore, the quenching efficiency was calculated by using the Stern-Volmer (SV) equation (I 0/I)=K SV[Q]+1, where I 0 and I are the fluorescence intensities before and after the addition of the analytes, Q is the molar concentration of the analytes and K SV is the quenching constant (M-1). As shown in c, d and Fig. S5, the Stern-Volmer plots for Fe3+ are nearly linear at low concentration (R2=0.994), while upon the plots subsequently diverge from linearity which might be ascribed to self-absorption or energy-transfer process []. The K SV value of compound 1 towards Fe3+ and Cu2+ is 3.5\u00d7104M-1 and 3.9\u00d7103M-1, respectively (Figs. S5 and S6). It is worth mentioning that the K SV value of compound 1 towards Fe3+ surpass some MOFs materials (Table S3). [] Moreover, the regenerative performance is very important for a luminescence sensor when the cost of synthesis material is considered, so the recyclability of compound 1 was further studied. After five cycles of luminescence detecting experiments, compound 1 still maintains the high luminescence intensity and detecting performance, which indicates the recyclability of the material ( ). The PXRD patterns of the samples after detecting tests further demonstrate the commendable practicability of compound 1 (Fig. S7). These results indicate that compound 1 is a recyclable luminescent sensor for Fe3+ ions with high selectivity and sensitivity.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 15, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<ce:para id=\"p0055\" view=\"all\">In summary, a Cd-based metal-organic framework with helical metal chains SBUs has been successfully synthesized.
