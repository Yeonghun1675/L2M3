The lengths of CoO and CoN bonds are in the ranges of 2.0677(14)-2.1601(14) \u00c5 and 2.1215(16)-2.1386(18) \u00c5, respectively, comparable to the lengths of regular CoO and CoN bonds . The C, O and O atoms of the carboxylate group and the coordinated Co atom are almost in the same plane with the dihedral angles <1\u00b0. Compared with their corresponding phenyl rings, the two carboxylate groups in the same dpa2- molecule are distorted with the dihedral angles of 35.696\u00b0 and 35.992\u00b0, respectively. The two phenyl rings in the same dpa2- molecule are distorted dramatically with a dihedral angle of 81.769\u00b0, approximately perpendicular, consistent to the reported value of 81.9\u00b0 .

Multiple 1D chains stacked on each other to generate a 3D framework via the weak CH\u22ef \u03c0 interaction. Co(dpa)(2,2'-bipy)(H2O)2 exhibited an efficient catalytic performance for solvent-free allylic oxidation of cyclohexene by oxygen. The highest turn-over frequency (TOF) of 979h-1 was obtained at the molar ratio of Co(dpa)(2,2'-bipy)(H2O)2 to cyclohexene of 1:16000.\n\nHighlights\n\n   \u22c5 A novel Co(dpa)(2,2'-bipy)(H2O)2 was synthesized and characterized.   \u22c5 Co(dpa)(2,2'-bipy)(H2O)2 catalyzed allylic oxidation of cyclohexene by O2.   \u22c5 The efficient catalytic performance with a TOF up to 979h-1    \n\nTGA analysis was conducted to determine the thermal stability of Co(dpa)(2,2'-bipy)(H2O)2 (Fig. S6). A weight loss of 6.57% occurred in the temperature range from 130\u00b0C to 190\u00b0C due to the loss of the coordinated water (calcd. 7.33%). The anhydrous complex remained stable up to 250\u00b0C. It was collapsed and its organic ligands were completely decomposed between 250\u00b0C and 420\u00b0C, leading to a high weight loss of 70.34%. The residues weighted 23.09wt% of Co(dpa)(2,2'-bipy)(H2O)2 was presumed to be the cobalt dicarbonyl compound Co(CO)2 (calcd. 23.39wt%). A further weight loss of 9.15% was observed above 510\u00b0C, and the residue weighted 14.05wt% of Co(dpa)(2,2'-bipy)(H2O)2 might be attributed to the metal oxide, such as Co2O3 (calcd. 16.87wt%).\n\nThe catalytic performance of Co-CP was tested for solvent-free allylic oxidation of cyclohexene by oxygen. The oxidation mainly produced Cy-ol, Cy-one, intermediate 2-cyclohexene-1-hydroperoxide (Cy-HP) and cyclohexene oxide (Cy-oxide) (Fig. S9). The conversion of cyclohexene in the absence of Co-CP was 1.4% (  entry 1). The cyclohexene conversion increased from 7.5% to 36.7%, and TOF increased from 200h-1 to 979h-1 as the reaction temperature increased from 331K to 343K ( entries 2-4). The selectivity towards Cy-HP decreased from 61.0% to 30.5%, whereas those towards Cy-ol, Cy-one and Cy-oxide increased to different values, indicating the rapid transformation of Cy-HP to Cy-ol, Cy-one and Cy-oxide at high reaction temperatures. The cyclohexene conversions increased from 2.1% to 36.7%, and TOF increased from 56h-1 to 979h-1 as the reaction time prolonged from 2h to 6h ( entries 4-6). The selectivity towards Cy-HP reached the maximum of 64.3% at 4h and sharply decreased to 40.7% at 6h, while the conversion increased from 7.8% at 4h to 36.7% at 6h evidently. Cy-HP was the major product at the initial reaction stage. It was dissociated into cyclohexenyl peroxyl radical (Cy-OO\u22c5) via the homolysis of OH that acted as the main chain propagator. As the reaction proceeded, the free radicals (Cy-OO\u22c5) was gradually accumulated, which instantaneously promoted the chain transfer, the dissociation of Cy-HP and the formations of Cy-ol, Cy-one and Cy-oxide.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn summary, a novel Co(II) coordination polymer Co(dpa)(2,2'-bipy)(H2O)2 was synthesized via the hydrothermal assembly of Co2+ with 2,2'-diphenic acid and 2,2'-bipyridine. The flexible 2,2'-diphenic acid ligand played an important role in constructing 1D chains and the rigid 2,2'-bipyridine ligand provided a weak CH\u22ef \u03c0 interaction to form a 3D framework. The Co(dpa)(2,2'-bipy)(H2O)2 crystal exhibited a rod-like shape with a high crystallinity and low thermal stability. The pulverized Co(dpa)(2,2'-bipy)(H2O)2 powder was used as a novel catalyst for the solvent-free allylic oxidation of cyclohexene by oxygen. It showed an efficient catalytic performance for the cyclohexene oxidation with a TOF up to 979h-1, which might be attributed to the exposure of the Co (II) coordinatively unsaturated sites during the reactions.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "400", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "lattice collapse", "condition":
