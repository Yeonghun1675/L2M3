The tube was subsequently flame-sealed and kept in a furnace at 115\u00b0C for 6 h, and then cooled down to room temperature (r.t.) at 6\u00b0 h-1. Colorless prismatic crystals of 2 were isolated in good yield (>50%). Anal. Found: C, 17.02; H, 0.77; N, 1.15. Calc. for C32H19N2O21.5F27Ag9: C, 17.01; H, 0.85; N, 1.24%.\n\nSynthesis of Ag2C2\u22c55CF3SO3Ag\u22c52MeCN\u22c52H2O (3)\n\nCompound 3 was prepared by adding Ag2C2 to 1 ml of a concentrated aqueous solution of 1.5 g CF3SO3Ag in a plastic beaker with stirring until saturated. The excess amount of Ag2C2 was filtered off, and a few drops of MeCN were added to the filtrate. (Note: excess MeCN would lead to deposition of Ag2C2 as a white precipitate.) The resulting solution was placed in a desiccator charged with P2O5. Colorless block-like crystals of 3 were obtained in ca. 20% yield after several days.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "Ag2C2\u00b76CHF2CO2Ag", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "Unknown"},
