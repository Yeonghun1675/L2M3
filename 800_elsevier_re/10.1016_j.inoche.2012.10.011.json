As shown in  , the repeating asymmetric unit consists of a bimetallic CoIICoIII(\u03bc2-O)2 core and one water molecular and one methanol molecular. Two individual Schiff base ligands are partially deprotonated and both adopt \u03bc2-\u03b7 1:\u03b7 1:\u03b7 2:\u03b7 1 fashions. Co(1) atom adopts a slightly distorted octahedral CoO4N2 geometry, in which two imine nitrogen atoms [N(1) and N(2)], naphthol oxygen atom O(1) and alkoxo oxygen atom O(2) of two HL2- ligands occupy the equatorial plane and O(4) and O(6) atoms define the axial directions; whereas Co(2) presents an [O6] donor set achieved through two undeprotonated alkoxo oxygen atoms [O(3) and O(5)] occupying its axial positions and the equatorial plane is defined by two acetate atoms [O(7) and O(8)] and two alkoxo oxygen [O(2) and O(6)] donors, which act as \u03bc2-bridging species towards the adjacent metals. The angles between trans atoms are in the range 175.69(17)-177.70(17)\u00b0 for Co(1) and 162.15(14)-176.29(14)\u00b0 for Co(2).

The Co(1)O and Co(1)N distances are in the range 1.873(4)-1.910(4) and 1.889(4)-1.892(5)\u00c5, while Co(2)O distances vary from 2.035(4) to 2.124(4)\u00c5 ( Table S1), which are typical for those of low-spin Co(III) and high-spin Co(II) ions, respectively . As a result, the oxidation states of Co(1) and Co(2) could be identified as +3 and +2, respectively (, right), which are consistent with the overall charge balance of the system and the magnetic measurements. The Co atom deviates from the least-squares planes of the basal donor atoms by 0.0346(29)\u00c5 and -0.0783(27)\u00c5, respectively.

The intra-chain Co(2)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Co(2) separation across the triatomic OCO bridge is 5.221\u00c5, close to the value of 5.515(2)\u00c5 reported for the 1-D polymeric structure, [CoII(L1OO)(H2O)](ClO4)\u22c52H2O . Interestingly, the cis orientation of the carboxylate groups leads to right-helicity in the chain with a pitch of 15.19(7)\u00c5 around the crystallographic 41-helical axis in the c direction (see the Supporting Information, Fig. S1a). Each chain is further stabilized by intermolecular strong OH\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bonding interaction among undeprotonated alkoxo O(5), the acetate oxygen atom O(7) and alkoxo oxygen atom O(6) in the lattice (Table S2). In the packing arrangement of 1, each right-helical chain is linked to four identical parallel chains in opposite orientations (the reverse is equally true) by a weak CH\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interaction involving C(7)H(7)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cg(1) ( 2.77\u00c5, 168.4\u00b0; where Cg(1) is the centroid of ring constituted by C18-23; symmetry code: -x+1/2, -y+3/2, -z+1/2) (Table S2) into a complicated 3-D network (Fig. S1b). As a result, the whole crystal is optically mesomeric and does not exhibit chirality.\n\nInfrared spectrum was recorded between 4000 and 400 cm-1 with pressed KBr pellets. The characteristic vibration absorption bands of the azomethine group \u03bd(C=N) occurs at 1644cm-1 in the free  H    3    L  ligand. However, this absorption is obviously shifted to 1618cm-1 in the complex, indicating the involvement of the azomethine nitrogen in chelate formation. The ArO stretching frequency occurs at 1252cm-1 for  H    3    L , and shifts to 1187cm-1 in complex 1, indicating that the MO bond is formed between the metal atom and oxygen of phenolic group. The absorption of the carboxylate group appears at 1540cm-1 for \u03bdasym (CO2) and 1436cm-1 for \u03bdsym (CO2). The \u0394\u03bd value is 104cm-1 and reflects that the carboxylate group acts as bidentate bridging coordination mode , which is well consistent with the single-crystal structural analyses. The UV spectrum of the ligand, the bands at 231, 248, 305, 398nm may arise from the conjugated system, the n-\u03c0* transition of the azomethine chromophore and the \u03c0-\u03c0* transition of the naphthalene rings. Complex 1, however, shows intense peaks at 361 and 269nm, assigned to LMCT and intra-ligand charge transfer transitions , respectively.\n\nVariable-temperature magnetic susceptibility data of 1 was collected in the temperature range 1.8-300K under a 1kOe applied field. The magnetic data were corrected for the sample holder and the diamagnetic contributions. The \u03c7 M T vs. T plot is shown in  . The magnetic properties of {[CoIICoIII(HL)2(OAc)]\u22c5CH3OH\u22c5H2O}n are attributed to the octahedrally coordinated Co(II) ions, which are arranged in {CoOCOCo} chain fashion (Fig. S2). At 300K, the experimental \u03c7 M T value is 2.44cm3 Kmol-1, which is considerably larger than the spin-only value calculated for an isolated high-spin Co(II) ions (1.875cm3 Kmol-1 with g =2.0 ) due to the orbital contribution from single octahedral Co(II) ions . Upon cooling, the \u03c7 M T value smoothly decreases to a minimum of 1.62cm3 Kmol-1 at 8.9K, and then increases to reach a maximum of 1.81cm3 Kmol-1 at 2K. This behavior is indicative of the occurrence of a very weak ferromagnetic coupling between the Co(II) ions. The decrease of the \u03c7 M T value in the 300-8.9 K temperature range is dominated by single-ion properties of an uncoupled Co(II) ions. It accounts for the splitting of the energy levels arising from the 4T1g term that finally stabilizes a doublet ground state; the slight increase between 8.9 and 1.8K is due to inter-chain weak ferromagnetic interactions between Co(II) centers/the zero-field splitting (ZFS) effect .\n\nThe anticancer activity of complex 1 in vitro against A-549 (human lung adenocarcinoma) has been examined using MTT assay . A concentration range was selected for testing cell viability. The results of cytotoxic activity in vitro are expressed as IC50-the concentration of a compound that inhibits a proliferation rate of the tumor cells by 50% as compared to control untreated cells. The complex 1 shows a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability with an IC50 value of 0.70\u03bcg/mL, which is more effective than the chemotherapeutic drug cis-platin and carboplatin with an IC50 value of 1.0 and 16.4\u03bcg/mL, respectively  (Table S3). This special anticancer activity may be related with the fact that the metal Co3+ ion could permeate through the liquid layer of the cell membrane and disrupt the respiration process of the cell and cause apoptosis .
