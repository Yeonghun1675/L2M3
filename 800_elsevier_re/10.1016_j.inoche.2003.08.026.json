The N2O molecules inside the crystal at 293 K, which could not be located by single crystal X-ray analysis, cause crystal transformation from C2/m to C2/c crystals during N2O adsorption at approximately room temperature. Considering the very similar structure of N2O and CO2, the remarkable difference in the nature of these molecules is the strong intermolecular interaction ability of N2O due to the highly polarized NN+ O- structure, which may cause the intermediate phase at 293 K.\n\nCrystallographic analyses of 1 under CO2 atmosphere show the crystals in the monoclinic space group C2/m at 293 K: in inert oil (a, b, c=17.821(9), 9.605(5), 12.362(8) \u00c5, \u03b2=127.53(4), V=1678(1) \u00c53, Z=2); in CO2 gas (a, b, c=17.85(1), 9.465(5), 14.113(9) \u00c5, \u03b2=137.20(2), V=1620(1) \u00c53, Z=2), and then crystal 1 transforms to P 1 \u0304   inclusion crystal at 93 K (a, b, c=9.556(3), 10.318(4), 11.079(5) \u00c5, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3=70.18(3), 66.12(3), 63.02(3)\u00b0, V=873.7(6) \u00c53, Z=1).
