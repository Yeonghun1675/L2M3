id=\"Sec1\" sec-type=\"introduction\"><title>Introduction</title><p>During the past several years, there has been considerable interest in the metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed by metals and 1,2,4-triazoles (3-R<sup>1</sup>,5-R<sup>2</sup>-tzH, R<sup>1</sup> and R<sup>2</sup> denotes 3,5-substituents) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR1\">1</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>]. We and others have observed a prominent \u201cstructure effect\u201d of 3,5-substituents even if they are only non-coordinative hydrocarbons; the structures of metal\u2014triazole complexes are, more or less, dictated by the shape/size of the 3,5-substituents [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR4\">4</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>]. In the study of the silver(I) adducts with 4-amino-3,5-disubstituted-4<italic>H</italic>-1,2,4-triazoles, we were able to distinguish two types of tetranuclear Ag<sub>4</sub>tz<sub>6</sub> clusters (Ag<sub>4</sub>tz<sub>6</sub>-a and Ag<sub>4</sub>tz<sub>6</sub>-b) based on their crystal structure data. We found the shape/size of the 3,5-substituents is the key factor to determine which type of cluster can be formed [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR4\">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref>]. For a series of binary silver(I) triazolates\u2013Ag(3,5-R<sub>2</sub>tz), the structural diversity shown has been suggested to be associated with the shape/size of the 3,5-substituents, which might act as \u201ctemplates\u201d to organize the silver\u2014triazole skeletons [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>]. Chen et al. observed that the 3,5-substituents have influence on the dihedral angles between adjacent Cu<sub>2</sub>tz<sub>2</sub> secondary building units (SBUs), which in turn determine the structures of Cu(3,5-R<sub>2</sub>tz) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR11\">11</xref>].</p><p>As far as we know, triazoles carrying 3,5-alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl have been used to prepare metal complexes. However, little has been known on the metal complexes with triazoles bearing even bulkier 3,5-alkyls. In view of the \u201cstructure effect\u201d of 3,5-substituents, we extended our research to cover the pentyl group as 3,5-substituents on the triazole ring, as one part of our systematic investigation of the coordination chemistry of 1,2,4-triazoles. As far as we know, 3,5-dipentyl-1<italic>H</italic>-1,2,4-triazole was once briefly mentioned in a patent as intermediate in preparation of an antagonist [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR12\">12</xref>]. In this paper, we report the synthesis of 4-amino-3,5-dipentyl-4<italic>H</italic>-1,2,4-triazole (4-NH<sub>2</sub>-3,5-(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>)<sub>2</sub>tz) and 3,5-dipentyl-1<italic>H</italic>-1,2,4-triazole (3,5-(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>)<sub>2</sub>tzH), as well as the structures of three metal complexes, namely {Ag<sub>4</sub>[4-NH<sub>2</sub>-3,5-(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>)<sub>2</sub>tz]<sub>6</sub>}(BF<sub>4</sub>)<sub>4</sub> (<bold>1</bold>), {Ag[3,5-(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>)<sub>2</sub>tz]}<sub>n</sub> (<bold>2</bold>) and {Cu<sub>2</sub>[3,5-(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>)<sub>2</sub>tz]Br}<sub>n</sub> (<bold>3</bold>).</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec2\"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id=\"Sec3\"><title>Synthesis and Characterization</title><p>4-NH<sub>2</sub>-3,5-(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>)<sub>2</sub>tz was prepared according to a literature method [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref>]. 3,5-(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>)<sub>2</sub>tzH was obtained by deamination of the corresponding 4-amino-triazoles. Hypophosphorous acid was used, instead of hydrochloric acid, in the deamination step to improve the yield [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>]. The identities of these two compounds have been verified by the elemental analysis and their <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra (Figs. S1 and S2). The synthetic route is shown in Scheme\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Sch1\">1</xref>.</p><p>The complexes <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> were prepared in a straightforward way by mixing the appropriate silver salts with triazoles; ammonia is needed to deprotonate triazole for preparation of <bold>2</bold>. On the other hand, the complex <bold>3</bold> was obtained hydrothermally from 3,5-(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>)<sub>2</sub>tzH and CuBr<sub>2</sub>. Under the hydrothermal conditions, Cu<sup>II</sup> was reduced to Cu<sup>I</sup> and triazole deprotonated although no base was added to the reaction system; similar phenomenon has also been observed by Zubieta and his coworkers [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>].</p><p>The characteristic peak of BF<sub>4</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> shows itself at 1,083\u00a0cm<sup>\u22121</sup> in the IR spectrum of <bold>1</bold>.

It is noteworthy that the vibrational peaks of N\u2013H stretch (3,143\u00a0cm<sup>\u22121</sup>) and N\u2013H bend (1,571\u00a0cm<sup>\u22121</sup>) in the IR spectrum of 3,5-(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>)<sub>2</sub>tzH are absent in the IR spectra of its metal complexes <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold>, indicating the ligand is present in the deprotonated triazolate form. (Figs. S4, S5, S6, S7, S8).</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec4\"><title>Crystal Structures</title><p>{Ag<sub>4</sub>[4-NH<sub>2</sub>-3,5-(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>)<sub>2</sub>tz]<sub>6</sub>}(BF<sub>4</sub>)<sub>4</sub> (<bold>1</bold>) is a tetranuclear complex, featuring the Ag<sub>4</sub>tz<sub>6</sub>-a cluster (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig1\">1</xref>). In our previous papers, we have been able to recognize two types of Ag<sub>4</sub>tz<sub>6</sub> cluster motifs\u2013Ag<sub>4</sub>tz<sub>6</sub>-a and Ag<sub>4</sub>tz<sub>6</sub>-b, based on the crystal structures of the silver-triazole complexes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR4\">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref>]. The Ag<sub>4</sub>tz<sub>6</sub>-a cluster can be derived from an Ag<sub>4</sub>tz<sub>4</sub> metallacyle, further associated by two additional triazoles upper and down the Ag<sub>4</sub> plane. This structural motif has been observed previously in some silver(I) adducts with 4-amino-3,5-disubstitued-1,2,4-4<italic>H</italic>-triazoles such as [Ag<sub>4</sub>(4-NH<sub>2</sub>-3,5-<italic>i</italic>Pr<sub>2</sub>tz)<sub>6</sub>]X<sub>4</sub> (4-NH<sub>2</sub>-3,5-<italic>i</italic>Pr<sub>2</sub>-tz\u00a0=\u00a04-amino-3,5-diisopropyl-4<italic>H</italic>-1,2,4-triazole; X\u00a0=\u00a0ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> or BF<sub>4</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>) and [Ag<sub>4</sub>(4-NH<sub>2</sub>-3,5-Et<sub>2</sub>tz)<sub>6</sub>]X<sub>4</sub> (4-NH<sub>2</sub>-3,5-Et<sub>2</sub>tz\u00a0=\u00a04-amino-3,5-diethyl-4<italic>H</italic>-1,2,4-triazole; X\u00a0=\u00a0ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> or CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>), as well as in silver(I) 3,5-diphenyl-1,2,4-triazolate (Ag(3,5-Ph<sub>2</sub>tz)) as the secondary building unit (SBU) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR4\">4</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>]. We have noticed that in cases where anions do not participate in the coordination, the sizes/shapes of 3,5-substituents would impart a substantial influence on which type of Ag<sub>4</sub>tz<sub>6</sub> motif can be adopted. Usually larger substituents such as ethyl, isopropyl and pentyl (in this work) would favor an Ag<sub>4</sub>tz<sub>6</sub>-a motif in order to minimize the steric repulsion. The present structure thus provides a further example to show the structure effect of 3,5-substituents.</p><p>{Ag[3,5-(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>)<sub>2</sub>tz]}<sub>n</sub> (<bold>2</bold>) crystallizes in the tetragonal space group <italic>I</italic>4<sub>1</sub>/<italic>a</italic> and exhibits a 3D structure. The asymmetric unit consists of one Ag(I) atom and one 3,5-dipentyl triazole molecule. The Ag(I) atom is roughly triangular three-coordinated and the triazolato anion adopts a <italic>\u03bc</italic><sub><italic>3</italic></sub>-<italic>N</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup><italic>,N</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup><italic>,N</italic><sup><italic>4</italic></sup> bridging mode (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig2\">2</xref>a).</p><p>Two Ag atoms and two triazolato anions form an Ag<sub>2</sub>tz<sub>2</sub> subunit featuring an (Ag\u2013N\u2013N)<sub>2</sub> ring. The Ag<sub>2</sub>tz<sub>2</sub> subunit is linked with four adjacent Ag<sub>2</sub>tz<sub>2</sub>-SBUs from two Ag atoms and two N<sup>4</sup> atoms of triazoles to give rise to the 3D structure (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig2\">2</xref>b). If we take the Ag<sub>2</sub>tz<sub>2</sub>-SBU as a square planar 4-connected node, then the net underlying the crystal structure of {Ag[3,5-(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>)<sub>2</sub>tz]}<sub>n</sub> is the <bold>lvt</bold> net [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR17\">17</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR20\">20</xref>].</p><p>The 3D structure of <bold>2</bold> can also be derived from the 4<sub>1</sub> infinite helices formed by Ag atoms, N<sup>1</sup> (N<sup>2</sup>) and N<sup>4</sup> of triazoles. The 4<sub>1</sub> infinite helix extends along the <italic>c</italic>-axis and each is of the opposite handedness than its four nearest neighbors. Further connection of the helices via Ag\u2013N<sup>2</sup> (N<sup>1</sup>) bonds affords the 3D structure of {Ag[3,5-(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>)<sub>2</sub>tz]}<sub>n</sub> (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig2\">2</xref>b). If both the Ag atom and the triazolato ligand are regarded as the topologically equivalent three-connected nodes, the structure of {Ag[3,5-(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>)<sub>2</sub>tz]}<sub>n</sub> can also be simplified as the <bold>lvt-a</bold> net [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR17\">17</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR20\">20</xref>].</p><p>PLATON analysis shows the porosity of {Ag[3,5-(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>)<sub>2</sub>tz]}<sub>n</sub> is only 1.6%; the voids in Ag-tz skeleton are actually occupied by the pentyl groups. This observation again supports our hypothesis that 3,5-substituents might act as \u201ctemplates\u201d to organize the Ag-tz skeleton during the formation of the MOF structure [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>]. It is not surprising to note that {Ag[3,5-(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>)<sub>2</sub>tz]}<sub>n</sub> is isostructural to our recently reported [Cu(3,5-Bu<sub>2</sub>tz)]<sub>n</sub>, because of the similarity in the coordination chemistry between Cu(I) and Ag(I) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR11\">11</xref>]. Checking the M\u2013N distances, we found that the Ag\u2013N distances are longer than those of Cu\u2013N (2.18\u20132.25\u00a0\u00c5 vs<italic>.</italic> 1.95\u20132.00\u00a0\u00c5). Therefore the voids in Ag-tz skeleton should be larger than those in Cu-tz skeleton if both take the same or similar structure, that is to say, the Ag-tz skeleton can accommodate larger substituents compared with the substituents dwelled in the Cu-tz skeleton (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>\u2013 for Agtz vs C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>\u2013 for Cutz).</p><p>TG/DSC measurement shows that {Ag[3,5-(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>)<sub>2</sub>tz]}<sub>n</sub> is stable up to ca 268\u00a0\u00b0C under air (Fig. S9). Before the decomposition of the complexes, DSC curve shows one endothermic peak at 235\u00a0\u00b0C, which may be indicative of possible phase transition or structural modification occurring during the measurement. Above 268\u00a0\u00b0C, this complex experiences successive weight losses, corresponding to the decomposition of triazolato ligands. The final residue accounts for 34.5% of the total mass, suggesting the residue might be Ag, based on the calculated residual percentage (34.1%).</p><p>{Cu<sub>2</sub>[3,5-(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>)<sub>2</sub>tz]Br}<sub>n</sub> (<bold>3</bold>) crystallizes in the tetragonal space group <italic>I</italic>4<sub>1</sub>/<italic>a</italic> and exhibits a 3D metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) structure. The asymmetric unit consists of two crystallographically independent copper(I) atoms (Cu1 and Cu2), one Br atom and one triazolato ligand. The triazolato ligand adopts <italic>\u03bc</italic><sub>3</sub>-<italic>N</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup><italic>, N</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup><italic>, N</italic><sup><italic>4</italic></sup> bridging mode and the bromide ion acts as the <italic>\u03bc</italic><sub>4</sub> mono-atomic ligand to connect four Cu atoms (one Cu1 and three Cu2 atoms) to form an irregular polyhedron (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig3\">3</xref>). Cu1 atom is three-coordinated by a N<sup>2</sup> atom, N<sup>4</sup> atom of triazoles and a Br atom with the coordination geometry being nearly T-shaped. The Cu1-Br distance is 2.851(1) \u00c5, which is much longer than that observed for usual Cu-Br bond (ca 2.4\u00a0\u00c5), however, still less than the sum of the van der Waals radii for the Cu and Br atoms (3.25\u00a0\u00c5) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>]. On the other hand, Cu2 atom is tetrahedrally four-coordinated by three Br atoms and a N<sup>1</sup> atom of triazole, with the Cu2-Br distances being 2.393(1), 2.577(1), and 2.702(1) \u00c5, respectively.</p><p>The most interesting feature for <bold>3</bold> is the presence of a Cu<sub arrange=\"stack\">4</sub><sup arrange=\"stack\">I</sup>Br<sub>4</sub> cluster, formed by four Cu2 atoms and four Br atoms (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig3\">3</xref>a). This cluster can be described as a distorted cubane, with two types of atoms being located alternatively on the vertices of the cubane. The distortion of the cubane can be imaginarily achieved by pulling the Br vertices a little bit out of the body of a suppositional regular Cu<sub>4</sub>Br<sub>4</sub> cubane. The Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu distances within the cubane are 2.994(1) and 3.022(1) \u00c5, which are longer than the sum of the van der Waals radii for the Cu atoms (2.80\u00a0\u00c5) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>], indicative of no or very weak Cu<sup>I</sup>\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu<sup>I</sup> interaction.

In this way, each Cu<sub>4</sub>Br<sub>4</sub> cluster is linked to its four nearest Cu<sub>4</sub>Br<sub>4</sub> clusters to form the 3D structure (Fig. S10).

We and others have observed a prominent \"structure effect\" of 3,5-substituents even if they are only non-coordinative hydrocarbons; the structures of metal-triazole complexes are, more or less, dictated by the shape/size of the 3,5-substituents [4-10]. In the study of the silver(I) adducts with 4-amino-3,5-disubstituted-4H-1,2,4-triazoles, we were able to distinguish two types of tetranuclear Ag4tz6 clusters (Ag4tz6-a and Ag4tz6-b) based on their crystal structure data. We found the shape/size of the 3,5-substituents is the key factor to determine which type of cluster can be formed [4, 5]. For a series of binary silver(I) triazolates-Ag(3,5-R2tz), the structural diversity shown has been suggested to be associated with the shape/size of the 3,5-substituents, which might act as \"templates\" to organize the silver-triazole skeletons [6]. Chen et al. observed that the 3,5-substituents have influence on the dihedral angles between adjacent Cu2tz2 secondary building units (SBUs), which in turn determine the structures of Cu(3,5-R2tz) [7, 11].As far as we know, triazoles carrying 3,5-alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl have been used to prepare metal complexes. However, little has been known on the metal complexes with triazoles bearing even bulkier 3,5-alkyls. In view of the \"structure effect\" of 3,5-substituents, we extended our research to cover the pentyl group as 3,5-substituents on the triazole ring, as one part of our systematic investigation of the coordination chemistry of 1,2,4-triazoles. As far as we know, 3,5-dipentyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole was once briefly mentioned in a patent as intermediate in preparation of an antagonist [12]. In this paper, we report the synthesis of 4-amino-3,5-dipentyl-4H-1,2,4-triazole (4-NH2-3,5-(C5H11)2tz) and 3,5-dipentyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole (3,5-(C5H11)2tzH), as well as the structures of three metal complexes, namely {Ag4[4-NH2-3,5-(C5H11)2tz]6}(BF4)4 (1), {Ag[3,5-(C5H11)2tz]}n (2) and {Cu2[3,5-(C5H11)2tz]Br}n (3).Results and DiscussionSynthesis and Characterization4-NH2-3,5-(C5H11)2tz was prepared according to a literature method [13]. 3,5-(C5H11)2tzH was obtained by deamination of the corresponding 4-amino-triazoles. Hypophosphorous acid was used, instead of hydrochloric acid, in the deamination step to improve the yield [14]. The identities of these two compounds have been verified by the elemental analysis and their 1H NMR spectra (Figs. S1 and S2). The synthetic route is shown in Scheme 1.The complexes 1 and 2 were prepared in a straightforward way by mixing the appropriate silver salts with triazoles; ammonia is needed to deprotonate triazole for preparation of 2. On the other hand, the complex 3 was obtained hydrothermally from 3,5-(C5H11)2tzH and CuBr2. Under the hydrothermal conditions, CuII was reduced to CuI and triazole deprotonated although no base was added to the reaction system; similar phenomenon has also been observed by Zubieta and his coworkers [15].The characteristic peak of BF4- shows itself at 1,083 cm-1 in the IR spectrum of 1. The molar conductivity of 1 was measured to be 476 S cm2 mol-1 in MeCN at 20 \u00b0C, indicative of a 1:4 type of electrolyte [16], which coincides with its crystal structure. It is noteworthy that the vibrational peaks of N-H stretch (3,143 cm-1) and N-H bend (1,571 cm-1) in the IR spectrum of 3,5-(C5H11)2tzH are absent in the IR spectra of its metal complexes 2 and 3, indicating the ligand is present in the deprotonated triazolate form. (Figs. S4, S5, S6, S7, S8).Crystal Structures{Ag4[4-NH2-3,5-(C5H11)2tz]6}(BF4)4 (1) is a tetranuclear complex, featuring the Ag4tz6-a cluster (Fig. 1). In our previous papers, we have been able to recognize two types of Ag4tz6 cluster motifs-Ag4tz6-a and Ag4tz6-b, based on the crystal structures of the silver-triazole complexes [4, 5]. The Ag4tz6-a cluster can be derived from an Ag4tz4 metallacyle, further associated by two additional triazoles upper and down the Ag4 plane. This structural motif has been observed previously in some silver(I) adducts with 4-amino-3,5-disubstitued-1,2,4-4H-triazoles such as [Ag4(4-NH2-3,5-iPr2tz)6]X4 (4-NH2-3,5-iPr2-tz = 4-amino-3,5-diisopropyl-4H-1,2,4-triazole; X = ClO4- or BF4-) and [Ag4(4-NH2-3,5-Et2tz)6]X4 (4-NH2-3,5-Et2tz = 4-amino-3,5-diethyl-4H-1,2,4-triazole; X = ClO4- or CF3SO3-), as well as in silver(I) 3,5-diphenyl-1,2,4-triazolate (Ag(3,5-Ph2tz)) as the secondary building unit (SBU) [4-6]. We have noticed that in cases where anions do not participate in the coordination, the sizes/shapes of 3,5-substituents would impart a substantial influence on which type of Ag4tz6 motif can be adopted. Usually larger substituents such as ethyl, isopropyl and pentyl (in this work) would favor an Ag4tz6-a motif in order to minimize the steric repulsion. The present structure thus provides a further example to show the structure effect of 3,5-substituents.{Ag[3,5-(C5H11)2tz]}n (2) crystallizes in the tetragonal space group I41/a and exhibits a 3D structure. The asymmetric unit consists of one Ag(I) atom and one 3,5-dipentyl triazole molecule. The Ag(I) atom is roughly triangular three-coordinated and the triazolato anion adopts a \u03bc3-N1,N2,N4 bridging mode (Fig. 2a).Two Ag atoms and two triazolato anions form an Ag2tz2 subunit featuring an (Ag-N-N)2 ring. The Ag2tz2 subunit is linked with four adjacent Ag2tz2-SBUs from two Ag atoms and two N4 atoms of triazoles to give rise to the 3D structure (Fig. 2b). If we take the Ag2tz2-SBU as a square planar 4-connected node, then the net underlying the crystal structure of {Ag[3,5-(C5H11)2tz]}n is the lvt net [17-20].The 3D structure of 2 can also be derived from the 41 infinite helices formed by Ag atoms, N1 (N2) and N4 of triazoles. The 41 infinite helix extends along the c-axis and each is of the opposite handedness than its four nearest neighbors. Further connection of the helices via Ag-N2 (N1) bonds affords the 3D structure of {Ag[3,5-(C5H11)2tz]}n (Fig. 2b). If both the Ag atom and the triazolato ligand are regarded as the topologically equivalent three-connected nodes, the structure of {Ag[3,5-(C5H11)2tz]}n can also be simplified as the lvt-a net [17-20].PLATON analysis shows the porosity of {Ag[3,5-(C5H11)2tz]}n is only 1.6%; the voids in Ag-tz skeleton are actually occupied by the pentyl groups. This observation again supports our hypothesis that 3,5-substituents might act as \"templates\" to organize the Ag-tz skeleton during the formation of the MOF structure [6]. It is not surprising to note that {Ag[3,5-(C5H11)2tz]}n is isostructural to our recently reported [Cu(3,5-Bu2tz)]n, because of the similarity in the coordination chemistry between Cu(I) and Ag(I) [11]. Checking the M-N distances, we found that the Ag-N distances are longer than those of Cu-N (2.18-2.25 \u00c5 vs. 1.95-2.00 \u00c5). Therefore the voids in Ag-tz skeleton should be larger than those in Cu-tz skeleton if both take the same or similar structure, that is to say, the Ag-tz skeleton can accommodate larger substituents compared with the substituents dwelled in the Cu-tz skeleton (C5H11- for Agtz vs C4H9- for Cutz).TG/DSC measurement shows that {Ag[3,5-(C5H11)2tz]}n is stable up to ca 268 \u00b0C under air (Fig. S9). Before the decomposition of the complexes, DSC curve shows one endothermic peak at 235 \u00b0C, which may be indicative of possible phase transition or structural modification occurring during the measurement. Above 268 \u00b0C, this complex experiences successive weight losses, corresponding to the decomposition of triazolato ligands. The final residue accounts for 34.5% of the total mass, suggesting the residue might be Ag, based on the calculated residual percentage (34.1%).{Cu2[3,5-(C5H11)2tz]Br}n (3) crystallizes in the tetragonal space group I41/a and exhibits a 3D metal-organic framework (MOF) structure. The asymmetric unit consists of two crystallographically independent copper(I) atoms (Cu1 and Cu2), one Br atom and one triazolato ligand. The triazolato ligand adopts \u03bc3-N1, N2, N4 bridging mode and the bromide ion acts as the \u03bc4 mono-atomic ligand to connect four Cu atoms (one Cu1 and three Cu2 atoms) to form an irregular polyhedron (Fig. 3). Cu1 atom is three-coordinated by a N2 atom, N4 atom of triazoles and a Br atom with the coordination geometry being nearly T-shaped. The Cu1-Br distance is 2.851(1) \u00c5, which is much longer than that observed for usual Cu-Br bond (ca 2.4 \u00c5), however, still less than the sum of the van der Waals radii for the Cu and Br atoms (3.25 \u00c5) [21]. On the other hand, Cu2 atom is tetrahedrally four-coordinated by three Br atoms and a N1 atom of triazole, with the Cu2-Br distances being 2.393(1), 2.577(1), and 2.702(1) \u00c5, respectively.The most interesting feature for 3 is the presence of a Cu4IBr4 cluster, formed by four Cu2 atoms and four Br atoms (Fig. 3a). This cluster can be described as a distorted cubane, with two types of atoms being located alternatively on the vertices of the cubane. The distortion of the cubane can be imaginarily achieved by pulling the Br vertices a little bit out of the body of a suppositional regular Cu4Br4 cubane. The Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu distances within the cubane are 2.994(1) and 3.022(1) \u00c5, which are longer than the sum of the van der Waals radii for the Cu atoms (2.80 \u00c5) [21], indicative of no or very weak CuI\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5CuI interaction. The structural chemistry of Cu4X4 cluster (X = Cl-, Br-, I-) and some other types of copper(I) halide cluster has been recently reviewed by Li et al. [22].Each pair of Cu4Br4 clusters are doubly bridged by two Cu1 atoms and two triazolates, as shown in Fig. 3b. In this way, each Cu4Br4 cluster is linked to its four nearest Cu4Br4 clusters to form the 3D structure (Fig. S10). Topologically, we can regard the Cu4Br4 cluster as tetrahedrally four-connected node and the double bridges between two neighboring Cu4Br4 clusters as a single linker, then, the structure of 3 can be simplified to the dia net [17-20].Experimental SectionThe CHN microanalyses were carried out with a Flash EA 1112 elemental analyzer.

All non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters; hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically.Owing to the poor quality of crystal data of 1, only a preliminary structure analysis was carried out. However, the stoichiometry and heavy atom positions were unequivocally determined. For 1: C72H144N24Ag4B4F16, Orthorhombic, Pna21, a = 26.492(5), b = 21.231(4), c = 53.854(1) \u00c5, V = 30290(10) \u00c53, S = 1.460, R1 = 0.2254 for 64297 reflections with I > 2\u03c3(I) and 1361 parameters. The crystallographic data of 2 and 3 are listed in Table 1.CCDC 849696 and 849697 contain the supplementary crystallographic data for 2 and 3.
