id=\"Sec1\"><title>Introduction</title><p id=\"Par2\">There is currently considerable interest in the rational design, preparation and characterization of coordination polymers (CPs) due to their intriguing architectures as well as promising functional applications in gas storage, chemical sensor, magnetism, catalysis, separation and so on [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR1\">1</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref>]. Particular attention has been given to the judicious selection of multifunctional organic ligands, which is a crucial factor on the construction of novel CPs. Among them, 1<italic>H</italic>-imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid (H<sub>3</sub>IDC), a typical <italic>N</italic>-heterocyclic carboxylic acid ligand containing both the imidazole and carboxylic functionalities, has been widely used in the preparation of various CPs with different structures and interesting properties due to its outstanding features of versatile coordination fashions under hydro(solvo)thermal conditions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>]. These productive findings on H<sub>3</sub>IDC lead to increasing interest in functionalized H<sub>3</sub>IDC ligands with diverse substituent groups at the 2-position of the imidazole ring, including aliphatic groups such as methyl [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR11\">11</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref>], ethyl [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>], propyl [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR17\">17</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR19\">19</xref>], hydroxymethyl [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR20\">20</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR22\">22</xref>] or trifluoromethyl [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>], as well as aromatic groups such as pyridyl [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR25\">25</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>], phenyl [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR31\">31</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR33\">33</xref>], 3,4-dimethylphenyl [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR34\">34</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR36\">36</xref>] or carboxyphenyl [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR37\">37</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>]. Therefore, a variety of new CPs possessing 1D chains, 2D grids and layers, 3D interpenetrated and helical networks have been successfully constructed based on these multidentate ligands.</p><p id=\"Par3\">Recently, our group have focused on the coordination chemistry of a functionalized H<sub>3</sub>IDC ligand, 2-(trifluoromethyl)-1<italic>H</italic>-imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid (H<sub>3</sub>TFMIDC), and found that this type of ligand is also an excellent candidate for the construction of new CPs. For example, reactions of H<sub>3</sub>TFMIDC with Pb(II) and Ba(II) ions produce two interesting achiral/chiral CPs containing 1D helical chains [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. Additionally, two unusual 3D CPs with 4-connected diamondoid and (6,16)-connected net topologies based on planar tetranuclear squares as secondary building units have been successfully obtained by the solvothermal reactions of H<sub>3</sub>TFMIDC with Co(II) and Mn(II) salts, respectively [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>]. The previous works mainly focus on the preparation of new CPs built by H<sub>3</sub>TFMIDC with main group metal or transition metal ions; nevertheless, as far as we know, lanthanide(III) CPs constructed from H<sub>3</sub>TFMIDC have never been reported.</p><p id=\"Par4\">Herein, as an continuous exploration, a series of new 2D lanthanide(III) CPs with two types of structures, namely {[Ln<sub>2</sub>(<italic>\u03bc</italic><sub>2</sub>-HTFMIDC)<sub>3</sub>(DMA)<sub>4</sub>]\u00a0\u00b7\u00a02H<sub>2</sub>O}<sub><italic>n</italic></sub> [Ln\u00a0=\u00a0Pr (<bold>1</bold>); Nd (<bold>2</bold>); Sm (<bold>3</bold>); Eu (<bold>4</bold>)] for type <bold>I</bold> and {[Ln<sub>2</sub>(<italic>\u03bc</italic><sub>2</sub>-HTFMIDC)<sub>3</sub>(DMA)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]\u00b7DMA}<sub><italic>n</italic></sub> [Ln\u00a0=\u00a0Eu (<bold>5</bold>); Gd (<bold>6</bold>)] for type <bold>II</bold>, have been fortunately obtained by the assembly of H<sub>3</sub>TFMIDC with the corresponding lanthanide oxides. All the compounds have been structurally characterized by elemental analysis, infrared spectra and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (except <bold>6</bold>). Their structural diversity may be assigned to the effect of lanthanide contraction, which has been discussed in the text. Moreover, the thermal stabilities of compounds <bold>3</bold> and <bold>5</bold>, as well as the luminescence properties of compounds <bold>4</bold> and <bold>5</bold>, were also investigated.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec2\"><title>Experimental</title><sec id=\"Sec3\" sec-type=\"materials|methods\"><title>Materials and methods</title><p id=\"Par5\">The ligand 2-(trifluoromethyl)-1<italic>H</italic>-4,5-imidazole dicarboxylic acid (H<sub>3</sub>TFMIDC) was synthesized according to the literature method [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>]. All the other materials were reagent grade obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification. Infrared (IR) spectra were carried out on a Nicolet FT-IR-170SX spectrophotometer with KBr pellets in the range of 4000\u00a0\u2212\u00a0400\u00a0cm<sup>\u22121</sup>. Elemental analyses (C, H and N) were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 240C analytical instrument. Thermogravimetric analyses were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer TGA7 analyzer with a heating rate of 10\u00b0C/min in flowing air atmosphere. The solid-state photoluminescent spectra were performed on a Hitachi F-2500 spectrophotometer with a xenon arc lamp as the light source at room temperature. In the measurements of emission and excitation spectra, the pass width is 5.0\u00a0nm. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements were measured by using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer at 40\u00a0kV, 40\u00a0mA with a Cu-target tube and a graphite monochromator.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec4\"><title>Syntheses of {[Ln<sub>2</sub>(<italic>\u03bc</italic><sub>2</sub>-HTFMIDC)<sub>3</sub>(DMA)<sub>4</sub>]\u00a0\u00b7\u00a02H<sub>2</sub>O}<sub><italic>n</italic></sub> [Ln\u00a0=\u00a0Pr (1); Nd (2); Sm (3); Eu (4)]</title><p id=\"Par6\">Lanthanide oxide (0.20\u00a0mmol), H<sub>3</sub>TFMIDC (0.20\u00a0mmol, 44.8\u00a0mg) and DMA (4\u00a0mL) were placed in a 10-mL glass vial.

The Sm\u2013N bond lengths vary from 2.667(7) to 2.725(6)\u00a0\u00c5, whereas Sm\u2013O distances are in the range of 2.329(6)\u20132.389(6)\u00a0\u00c5, all of which are comparable to those observed for other related imidazole-based dicarboxylate Sm(III) coordination polymers [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR17\">17</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR26\">26</xref>].

Such changes mainly can be attributed to the effect of lanthanide contraction.</p><p id=\"Par15\">In compound <bold>3</bold>, each HTFMIDC<sup>2\u2212</sup> anion adopts a <italic>\u03bc</italic><sub>2</sub>-<italic>k</italic>N,O:<italic>k</italic>N<italic>\u2032,</italic>O<italic>\u2032</italic> coordination fashion to bridge two Sm(III) ions in a bis-N,O-chelating mode. Six <italic>\u03bc</italic><sub>2</sub>-HTFMIDC<sup>2\u2212</sup> ligands alternately connect six Sm(III) ions to produce a distorted hexagonal 24-membered ring. In such a hexagonal ring, the neighboring Sm\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Sm distances are 7.6570(11) and 7.6610(16)\u00a0\u00c5, while the Sm\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Sm\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Sm angles are equal to 77.778(6) and 127.084(7)\u00b0, indicating that the resulting hexagonal ring is observably distorted. These hexagonal rings are edge-sharing to each other to give rise to the formation of a 2D honeycomb-like network along the <italic>ab</italic> plane (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig1\">1</xref>b), which can be defined as a hexagonal honeycomb (6, 3) topology with Sm(III) ions serving as 3-connected nodes. The coordinated DMA molecules hang on both sides of the 2D layer (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig1\">1</xref>b), and this feature allows the formation of weak nonclassical C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonds between DMA molecules and carboxylate O atoms from the adjacent 2D layers, thus generating a 3D supramolecular framework, as illustrated in Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig1\">1</xref>c.</p><p id=\"Par16\">It is noteworthy to mention that the neighboring 2D layers of <bold>3</bold> are stacked along the <italic>c</italic> axis in an ABAB sequence (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig1\">1</xref>d, e). As presented in Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig1\">1</xref>f, the distance between two adjacent layers B is 22.894(4) \u00c5, suggesting that the vertical distance between layer A and layer B is 11.447(2)\u00a0\u00c5. On the other hand, the shortest Sm\u2026Sm distance between layer A and layer B is 11.5167(21)\u00a0\u00c5.

With this characteristic, strong O\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonds that formed between the coordinated water molecules and the carboxylate O atoms of the HTFMIDC<sup>2\u2212</sup> ligands further connect the 2D honeycomb-like layers into a 3D supramolecular framework, as depicted in Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig2\">2</xref>c.

Compounds <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>3</bold> can be successfully obtained by employing DMA or DMA/CH<sub>3</sub>CN (1:1) as solvents (with lower yields when DMA/CH<sub>3</sub>CN mixed solvents were used), while compounds <bold>4</bold> and <bold>5</bold> only can be prepared by using DMA and DMA/CH<sub>3</sub>CN (1:1) as solvents, respectively. Unfortunately, attempts to synthesize more CPs with suitable single crystals by using other smaller-radius lanthanide centers such as Gd, Tb and Dy under similar reaction conditions are unsuccessful. Specifically, reactions of H<sub>3</sub>TFMIDC with Gd(III) oxide by using DMA and DMA/CH<sub>3</sub>CN as solvents only provide noncrystalline powders and a few small crystalline powders, respectively. The resulting crystalline product (compound <bold>6</bold>) cannot be structurally determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction due to its small and low-quality single crystals, but may be characterized to be a coordination compound, as evidenced by the FTIR measurement (Fig. S6). Additionally, reactions of terbium or dysprosium oxides with H<sub>3</sub>TFMIDC by employing either DMA or DMA/CH<sub>3</sub>CN as solvents all lead to the formation of black/white solid powders, which may be identified to be their corresponding starting materials of lanthanide oxides (Figs. S7 and S8).</p><p id=\"Par21\">Considering that it is hard to tell the structure differences from the very similar FTIR spectra of all the prepared CPs, the representative samples of compounds <bold>2</bold> and <bold>4</bold>, as well as <bold>5</bold> and <bold>6</bold>, were further studied by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements. As illustrated in Figs. S9 and S10, although a few diffraction peaks in the experimental PXRD patterns are disappeared in comparison with those simulated on the basis of the single-crystal structures, most peak positions of the measured and simulated patterns are in good agreement with each other, indicating that the crystal samples are pure. Besides, PXRD patterns of type <bold>I</bold> (compounds <bold>2</bold> and <bold>4</bold>) and type <bold>II</bold> (compounds <bold>5</bold> and <bold>6</bold>) are different from each other, whereas the PXRD patterns within type <bold>I</bold> and type <bold>II</bold> are almost identical, further suggesting that the compounds within type <bold>I</bold> and type <bold>II</bold> are isomorphous.</p><p id=\"Par22\">On the basis of the above-mentioned PXRD results and single-crystal X-ray diffraction data, it can be concluded that compounds <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>4</bold> (type <bold>I</bold>), as well as compounds <bold>5</bold> and <bold>6</bold> (type <bold>II</bold>), exhibit two different kinds of structures. It is worth noting that the coordination number and geometry of Ln(III) in all the CPs are identical; however, one of the coordinated solvent molecules in type <bold>I</bold> and type <bold>II</bold> structures is different: One of the coordination sites in structure type <bold>II</bold> is occupied by a ligated water molecule, while a coordinated DMA molecule occupies the corresponding site in structure type <bold>I</bold>. As the ionic radius decreased, the coordinated ligands around the Ln(III) ions would become more crowed, and thus there is a tendency that the larger DMA within the coordination sphere is replaced by a smaller water molecule. In this case, we see that the lanthanide contraction causes steric hindrance effect, only resulting in slightly different coordination environments of Ln(III) ions in two types of structures [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR26\">26</xref>]. It is different from many other usual cases in which the lanthanide contraction often leads to different coordination numbers. Such a difference results in slightly different stacking modes and distinctly different hydrogen bonding interactions formed in crystal structures of type <bold>I</bold> and type <bold>II</bold>, respectively. The 2D layers in compounds <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>4</bold> are stacked in ABAB fashions with the slippage distances of 1.2596(8)\u20131.2680(2)\u00a0\u00c5 between the neighboring layer A and layer B, while compound <bold>5</bold> also presents an ABAB packing mode but with a longer slippage distance of 2.8658(17) \u00c5 between the adjacent layer A and layer B. The 2D honeycomb-like layers are further linked into different 3D supramolecular frameworks through weak C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O and strong O\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonds for type <bold>I</bold> and type <bold>II</bold> structures, respectively.</p><p id=\"Par23\">In the present work, the CPs based on Ln(III) ions with ionic radius larger than Eu(III) only display structure type <bold>I</bold>, while those based on Ln(III) ions with ionic radius smaller than Eu(III) only exhibit structure type <bold>II</bold>. However, the Eu(III) CPs show both types of structures, which can be selectively obtained under different solvent systems, indicating that the Eu(III) ions may be located at a turning point (Scheme\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Sch1\">1</xref>). Additionally, we have also compared the average Ln\u2013O distances among compounds <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>5</bold>. The average bond lengths between lanthanide and O atoms decrease continuously from 2.391 (<bold>1</bold>), 2.381 (<bold>2</bold>), 2.362 (<bold>3</bold>), to 2.347 (<bold>4</bold>) \u00c5, further indicating the effect of lanthanide contraction [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>]. Nevertheless, the average Ln\u2013O distance in <bold>5</bold> (2.365\u00a0\u00c5) slightly increases as compared to those in <bold>3</bold> and <bold>4</bold>, further suggesting that the Eu(III) ions probably are located at a turning point.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec11\"><title>Thermal stability analyses</title><p id=\"Par24\">To determine the thermal stabilities of the two types of CPs, thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of the\u00a0representative compounds <bold>3</bold> and <bold>5</bold> were measured under an air atmosphere in the temperature range of 30\u2013800\u00a0\u00b0C. As illustrated in Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig3\">3</xref>, compound <bold>3</bold> has two steps of weight loss. The first weight loss of 3.7\u00a0% from 30\u00a0\u00b0C to about 130\u00a0\u00b0C can be attributed to the loss of one guest water molecule (calculated 2.7\u00a0%) in the asymmetric unit, and then this compound is stable up to 200\u00a0\u00b0C. The major weight loss occurred in the next step above 200\u00a0\u00b0C is probably caused by the gradual decomposition of the coordinated DMA and HTFMIDC<sup>2\u2212</sup> ligands, leading to the collapse of the coordination framework. Seen from the TG curve of <bold>5</bold>, an initial weight loss of 5.6\u00a0% between 30 and 200\u00a0\u00b0C may correspond to the release of a half DMA guest molecule per formula unit (calculated 6.9\u00a0%). Further weight loss between 200 and 600\u00a0\u00b0C also can be ascribed to the decomposition of the whole coordination structure.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec12\"><title>Photoluminescent properties</title><p id=\"Par25\">Taking into account the excellent luminescent properties of the Eu(III) ions in the visible region, the photoluminescence of compounds <bold>4</bold> and <bold>5</bold> in the solid state was measured at room temperature. In order to well compare the luminescence intensity, all of the spectra are measured with the same voltage of 400\u00a0V and identical pass width of 5.0\u00a0nm. When the emission wavelengths were fixed at 614\u00a0nm for <bold>4</bold> and 615\u00a0nm for <bold>5</bold>, both the excitation spectra of <bold>4</bold> and <bold>5</bold> display a broadband roughly covering from 230 to 300\u00a0nm, as well as four sharp peaks in the range of 350\u2013420\u00a0nm, giving the maximum peaks at 394 and 395\u00a0nm for <bold>4</bold> and <bold>5</bold>, respectively (Figs.

Compound <bold>5</bold> emits red light upon excitation at 395\u00a0nm (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig4\">4</xref>), and it also exhibits a typical Eu(III) emission spectrum as compared to compound <bold>4</bold>. The characteristic peaks at 580, 593, 615, 655 and 704 can be assigned to the characteristic emissions of Eu(III) corresponding to electronic transitions from the excited state <sup>5</sup>D<sub>0</sub> to the multiplets <sup>7</sup>F<sub>J</sub> (<italic>J</italic>\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0\u2192\u00a04), respectively [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR45\">45</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR46\">46</xref>].

The slippage distances between the neighboring layer A and layer B in <bold>1\u20134</bold> are significantly shorter than the corresponding one in <bold>5</bold>. Such a difference leads to the formation of different 3D supramolecular frameworks: The 2D honeycomb-like layers of <bold>1\u20134</bold> are connected by weak C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonds, while those in <bold>5</bold> are linked by strong O\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonds. The structural diversity of <bold>1\u20135</bold> may be ascribed to the effect of lanthanide contraction. Our work can enrich the family of coordination chemistry of H<sub>3</sub>TFMIDC and demonstrates that this kind of ligand is appropriate for the construction of new lanthanide (III) coordination polymers.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec14\"><title>Supporting information</title><p id=\"Par27\">CCDC 1478917\u20131478921 contain the supplementary crystallographic data for the compounds <bold>1\u20135</bold>.

Both two types of structures exhibit similar 2D honeycomb-like networks, which are constructed by the linkages of \u03bc2-HTFMIDC2- bis-(bidentate) bridging ligands and Ln(III) metal centers. However, slightly different ABAB stacking fashions of the 2D layers and distinctly different hydrogen bonding interactions between the neighboring 2D layers are observed in crystal structures of type I and type II, which may be attributed to the lanthanide contraction effect. Meanwhile, the solid-state luminescent properties of 4 and 5 have been also investigated.KeywordsLanthanide coordination polymer1H-imidazole-45-Dicarboxylic acidLanthanide contraction effectCrystal structureNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinahttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/5011000018092147306221571070ZhengSheng-RunZhangWei-GuangNatural Science Foundation of Guangdong Provincehttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/5011000034532016A030310437CaiSong-LiangGuangdong Provincial Science and Technology Project2014A0101011452016B090921005FanJunFanJunSCNU Foundation for Fostering Young Teachers15KJ02CaiSong-LiangUndergraduates Innovating Experimentation Project of SCNUhx201602WangShapublisher-imprint-nameSpringervolume-issue-count6issue-article-count33issue-toc-levels0issue-pricelist-year2017issue-copyright-holderSpringer Science+Business Media New Yorkissue-copyright-year2017article-contains-esmYesarticle-numbering-styleUnnumberedarticle-registration-date-year2016article-registration-date-month8article-registration-date-day3article-toc-levels0toc-levels0volume-typeRegularjournal-productArchiveJournalnumbering-styleUnnumberedarticle-grants-typeRegularmetadata-grantOpenAccessabstract-grantOpenAccessbodypdf-grantRestrictedbodyhtml-grantRestrictedbibliography-grantRestrictedesm-grantOpenAccessonline-firstfalsepdf-file-referenceBodyRef/PDF/11224_2016_Article_817.pdftarget-typeOnlinePDFissue-online-date-year2017issue-online-date-month5issue-online-date-day3issue-print-date-year2017issue-print-date-month5issue-print-date-day3issue-typeRegulararticle-typeOriginalPaperjournal-subject-primaryChemistryjournal-subject-secondaryComputer Applications in Chemistryjournal-subject-secondaryPhysical Chemistryjournal-subject-secondaryTheoretical and Computational Chemistryjournal-subject-collectionSC5open-accessfalseElectronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s11224-016-0817-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.IntroductionThere is currently considerable interest in the rational design, preparation and characterization of coordination polymers (CPs) due to their intriguing architectures as well as promising functional applications in gas storage, chemical sensor, magnetism, catalysis, separation and so on [1-5]. Particular attention has been given to the judicious selection of multifunctional organic ligands, which is a crucial factor on the construction of novel CPs. Among them, 1H-imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid (H3IDC), a typical N-heterocyclic carboxylic acid ligand containing both the imidazole and carboxylic functionalities, has been widely used in the preparation of various CPs with different structures and interesting properties due to its outstanding features of versatile coordination fashions under hydro(solvo)thermal conditions [6-10]. These productive findings on H3IDC lead to increasing interest in functionalized H3IDC ligands with diverse substituent groups at the 2-position of the imidazole ring, including aliphatic groups such as methyl [11-13], ethyl [14-16], propyl [17-19], hydroxymethyl [20-22] or trifluoromethyl [23, 24], as well as aromatic groups such as pyridyl [25-30], phenyl [31-33], 3,4-dimethylphenyl [34-36] or carboxyphenyl [37-39]. Therefore, a variety of new CPs possessing 1D chains, 2D grids and layers, 3D interpenetrated and helical networks have been successfully constructed based on these multidentate ligands.Recently, our group have focused on the coordination chemistry of a functionalized H3IDC ligand, 2-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid (H3TFMIDC), and found that this type of ligand is also an excellent candidate for the construction of new CPs. For example, reactions of H3TFMIDC with Pb(II) and Ba(II) ions produce two interesting achiral/chiral CPs containing 1D helical chains [23]. Additionally, two unusual 3D CPs with 4-connected diamondoid and (6,16)-connected net topologies based on planar tetranuclear squares as secondary building units have been successfully obtained by the solvothermal reactions of H3TFMIDC with Co(II) and Mn(II) salts, respectively [24]. The previous works mainly focus on the preparation of new CPs built by H3TFMIDC with main group metal or transition metal ions; nevertheless, as far as we know, lanthanide(III) CPs constructed from H3TFMIDC have never been reported.Herein, as an continuous exploration, a series of new 2D lanthanide(III) CPs with two types of structures, namely {[Ln2(\u03bc2-HTFMIDC)3(DMA)4] \u22c5 2H2O}n [Ln = Pr (1); Nd (2); Sm (3); Eu (4)] for type I and {[Ln2(\u03bc2-HTFMIDC)3(DMA)2(H2O)2]\u22c5DMA}n [Ln = Eu (5); Gd (6)] for type II, have been fortunately obtained by the assembly of H3TFMIDC with the corresponding lanthanide oxides. All the compounds have been structurally characterized by elemental analysis, infrared spectra and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (except 6). Their structural diversity may be assigned to the effect of lanthanide contraction, which has been discussed in the text. Moreover, the thermal stabilities of compounds 3 and 5, as well as the luminescence properties of compounds 4 and 5, were also investigated.ExperimentalMaterials and methodsThe ligand 2-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-4,5-imidazole dicarboxylic acid (H3TFMIDC) was synthesized according to the literature method [24]. All the other materials were reagent grade obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification. Infrared (IR) spectra were carried out on a Nicolet FT-IR-170SX spectrophotometer with KBr pellets in the range of 4000 - 400 cm-1. Elemental analyses (C, H and N) were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 240C analytical instrument. Thermogravimetric analyses were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer TGA7 analyzer with a heating rate of 10\u00b0C/min in flowing air atmosphere. The solid-state photoluminescent spectra were performed on a Hitachi F-2500 spectrophotometer with a xenon arc lamp as the light source at room temperature. In the measurements of emission and excitation spectra, the pass width is 5.0 nm. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements were measured by using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer at 40 kV, 40 mA with a Cu-target tube and a graphite monochromator.Syntheses of {[Ln2(\u03bc2-HTFMIDC)3(DMA)4] \u22c5 2H2O}n [Ln = Pr (1); Nd (2); Sm (3); Eu (4)]Lanthanide oxide (0.20 mmol), H3TFMIDC (0.20 mmol, 44.8 mg) and DMA (4 mL) were placed in a 10-mL glass vial. The resulting mixture was heated under autogenous pressure at 100 \u00b0C for 48 h and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 1 \u00b0C/h. Colorless block crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis were collected by filtration, washed with the mother liquor several times and then dried in the air.Compound 1, Yield: 45 % (based on H3TFMIDC).

Colorless block crystals of 5 were collected by filtration and washed with the mother liquor several times. Yield: 42 % (based on H3TFMIDC). Anal.

However, no crystals suitable for single crystal X-ray diffraction can be prepared. Instead, only a few small crystalline powders of 6 were obtained. Yield: 25 % (based on H3TFMIDC). The structure of compound 6 was only determined by IR and PXRD measurements (discussed below).X-ray crystallographyCrystallographic data for 1-5 were collected on a Bruker Smart Apex II diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5) at 298 K. Absorption corrections were applied by using the multiscan program SADABS [40]. Structural solutions and full-matrix least squares refinements based on F2 were performed with the SHELXS-97 [41] and SHELXL-97 [41] program packages, respectively. All of the nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms for C-H, N-H were placed in idealized positions. The water hydrogen atoms in 1-4 were not added but were included in the molecular formula directly. The disordered trifluoromethyl groups of the HTFMIDC2- ligands in all the compounds were restrained using DFIX, ISOR and SIMU instructions to make the displacement parameters more reasonable. Moreover, since the unit cell of 5 included the severely disordered DMA molecule, PLATON/SQUEEZE was used to remove the diffraction contribution from the guest solvent to give a set of solvent-free diffraction intensities [42], thereby generating a more satisfactory refinement result. Details of the crystal parameters, data collections and refinements for compounds 1-5 are summarized in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and angles are given in Table S1. The CCDC reference numbers for compounds 1-5 are 1,478,917-1,478,921. Copy of the data can be obtained free of charge on application to CCDC, 12 Union Road, Cambridge CB2 1EZ, UK [fax: +44-1223-336-033; mail: deposit@ccdc.cam.ac.uk].Results and discussionCrystal structures of {[Ln2(\u03bc2-HTFMIDC)3 (DMA)4] \u22c5 2H2O}n [Ln = Pr (1); Nd (2); Sm (3); Eu (4)]Single-crystal X-ray diffraction indicates that compounds 1-4 are isomorphous, so only the structure of 3 is described in detail here. Compound 3 crystallizes in the monoclinic system with C2/c space group, and its asymmetric unit comprises only one crystallographically independent Sm(III) ion, two unique HTFMIDC2- ligands with occupancies of 1 and 1/2, respectively, two coordinated DMA molecules and one guest water molecule. The coordination environment of the Sm(III) ion is described in Fig. 1a. Each Sm(III) ion is eight-coordinated by three carboxylate O atoms and three imidazole N atoms from three individual HTFMIDC2- ligands, and two O atoms from two coordinated DMA ligands. The Sm-N bond lengths vary from 2.667(7) to 2.725(6) \u00c5, whereas Sm-O distances are in the range of 2.329(6)-2.389(6) \u00c5, all of which are comparable to those observed for other related imidazole-based dicarboxylate Sm(III) coordination polymers [17, 18, 26]. It is noteworthy to mention that the Pr-O (1), Nd-O (2) and Sm-O (3) bond lengths are slightly longer than the corresponding Eu-O distances in 4 (see Table S1). Such changes mainly can be attributed to the effect of lanthanide contraction.In compound 3, each HTFMIDC2- anion adopts a \u03bc2-kN,O:kN',O' coordination fashion to bridge two Sm(III) ions in a bis-N,O-chelating mode. Six \u03bc2-HTFMIDC2- ligands alternately connect six Sm(III) ions to produce a distorted hexagonal 24-membered ring. In such a hexagonal ring, the neighboring Sm\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Sm distances are 7.6570(11) and 7.6610(16) \u00c5, while the Sm\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Sm\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Sm angles are equal to 77.778(6) and 127.084(7)\u00b0, indicating that the resulting hexagonal ring is observably distorted. These hexagonal rings are edge-sharing to each other to give rise to the formation of a 2D honeycomb-like network along the ab plane (Fig. 1b), which can be defined as a hexagonal honeycomb (6, 3) topology with Sm(III) ions serving as 3-connected nodes. The coordinated DMA molecules hang on both sides of the 2D layer (Fig. 1b), and this feature allows the formation of weak nonclassical C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bonds between DMA molecules and carboxylate O atoms from the adjacent 2D layers, thus generating a 3D supramolecular framework, as illustrated in Fig. 1c.It is noteworthy to mention that the neighboring 2D layers of 3 are stacked along the c axis in an ABAB sequence (Fig. 1d, e). As presented in Fig. 1f, the distance between two adjacent layers B is 22.894(4) \u00c5, suggesting that the vertical distance between layer A and layer B is 11.447(2) \u00c5. On the other hand, the shortest Sm\u2026Sm distance between layer A and layer B is 11.5167(21) \u00c5. Therefore, a slippage distance of 1.2654(4) \u00c5 between layer A and layer B in compound 3 can be achieved. Such a small slippage distance between the neighboring 2D layers leads to the formation of small 1D channels running along c direction, which are occupied by guest water molecules (Fig. 1d). If only the uncoordinated water molecules are removed, compound 3 has a 1100.5-\u00c53 potential solvent volume (20 %) as calculated by PLATON [43].Crystal structure of {[Ln2(\u03bc2-HTFMIDC)3(DMA)2 (H2O)2] \u22c5 DMA}n [Ln = Eu (5)]Single-crystal X-ray structural analysis reveals that compound 5 also crystallizes in monoclinic space group C2/c. The asymmetric unit of 5 contains one crystallographically independent Eu(III) ion, one-and-a-half HTFMIDC2- ligands, one coordinated DMA molecule, one coordinated water molecule as well as a half disordered DMA guest molecule. As shown in Fig. 2a, the coordination environment and geometry of the Eu(III) ion in 5 are very similar to those found in compound 3, except that one of the coordinated DMA molecules is replaced with a coordinated water molecule. The Eu-N bond lengths range from 2.616(19) to 2.728(18) \u00c5, whereas Eu-O distances span from 2.295(17) to 2.443(17) \u00c5.Similar to 3, each HTFMIDC2- ligand in 5 also adopts a \u03bc2-kN,O:kN',O' coordination fashion to link two Eu(III) ions together. Again, the combination of \u03bc2-HTFMIDC2- ligands and Eu(III) ions results in the formation of a 2D honeycomb-like network with a (6,3) topology, as presented in Fig. 2b. In this 2D layer structure, the adjacent Eu\u2026Eu distances are 7.5553(27) and 7.6533(35) \u00c5, whereas the Eu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Eu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Eu angles are 77.441(18) and 129.762(24)\u00b0, all of which are close to those observed in compound 3.Being different from 3, both the coordinated DMA and coordinated water molecules hang on both sides of the 2D layer in compound 5 (Fig. 2b). With this characteristic, strong O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bonds that formed between the coordinated water molecules and the carboxylate O atoms of the HTFMIDC2- ligands further connect the 2D honeycomb-like layers into a 3D supramolecular framework, as depicted in Fig. 2c. Like 3, the neighboring 2D layers in compound 5 are also packed along the c axis in an ABAB fashion (Fig. 2d, e). Nevertheless, the vertical distance and the shortest Eu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Eu distance between layer A and layer B are equal to 10.0580(43) and 10.4583(44) \u00c5, respectively, and thus the slippage distance of between layer A and layer B is calculated to be 2.8658(17) \u00c5 (Fig. 2f). Such a slippage distance is significantly longer than the corresponding one found in 3, explaining the fact that small 1D channels are formed along c axis in 3 but absent in 5 (Fig. 2d), as well as the truth that various hydrogen bonds are formed between layer A and layer B, yielding different 3D supramolecular frameworks of 3 and 5.Syntheses and structural comparison of two types of CPsAll the CPs in the present work were synthesized with the same procedure except for the use of different solvents. Compounds 1-3 can be successfully obtained by employing DMA or DMA/CH3CN (1:1) as solvents (with lower yields when DMA/CH3CN mixed solvents were used), while compounds 4 and 5 only can be prepared by using DMA and DMA/CH3CN (1:1) as solvents, respectively. Unfortunately, attempts to synthesize more CPs with suitable single crystals by using other smaller-radius lanthanide centers such as Gd, Tb and Dy under similar reaction conditions are unsuccessful. Specifically, reactions of H3TFMIDC with Gd(III) oxide by using DMA and DMA/CH3CN as solvents only provide noncrystalline powders and a few small crystalline powders, respectively. The resulting crystalline product (compound 6) cannot be structurally determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction due to its small and low-quality single crystals, but may be characterized to be a coordination compound, as evidenced by the FTIR measurement (Fig. S6). Additionally, reactions of terbium or dysprosium oxides with H3TFMIDC by employing either DMA or DMA/CH3CN as solvents all lead to the formation of black/white solid powders, which may be identified to be their corresponding starting materials of lanthanide oxides (Figs. S7 and S8).Considering that it is hard to tell the structure differences from the very similar FTIR spectra of all the prepared CPs, the representative samples of compounds 2 and 4, as well as 5 and 6, were further studied by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements. As illustrated in Figs. S9 and S10, although a few diffraction peaks in the experimental PXRD patterns are disappeared in comparison with those simulated on the basis of the single-crystal structures, most peak positions of the measured and simulated patterns are in good agreement with each other, indicating that the crystal samples are pure. Besides, PXRD patterns of type I (compounds 2 and 4) and type II (compounds 5 and 6) are different from each other, whereas the PXRD patterns within type I and type II are almost identical, further suggesting that the compounds within type I and type II are isomorphous.On the basis of the above-mentioned PXRD results and single-crystal X-ray diffraction data, it can be concluded that compounds 1-4 (type I), as well as compounds 5 and 6 (type II), exhibit two different kinds of structures. It is worth noting that the coordination number and geometry of Ln(III) in all the CPs are identical; however, one of the coordinated solvent molecules in type I and type II structures is different: One of the coordination sites in structure type II is occupied by a ligated water molecule, while a coordinated DMA molecule occupies the corresponding site in structure type I. As the ionic radius decreased, the coordinated ligands around the Ln(III) ions would become more crowed, and thus there is a tendency that the larger DMA within the coordination sphere is replaced by a smaller water molecule. In this case, we see that the lanthanide contraction causes steric hindrance effect, only resulting in slightly different coordination environments of Ln(III) ions in two types of structures [26]. It is different from many other usual cases in which the lanthanide contraction often leads to different coordination numbers. Such a difference results in slightly different stacking modes and distinctly different hydrogen bonding interactions formed in crystal structures of type I and type II, respectively. The 2D layers in compounds 1-4 are stacked in ABAB fashions with the slippage distances of 1.2596(8)-1.2680(2) \u00c5 between the neighboring layer A and layer B, while compound 5 also presents an ABAB packing mode but with a longer slippage distance of 2.8658(17) \u00c5 between the adjacent layer A and layer B. The 2D honeycomb-like layers are further linked into different 3D supramolecular frameworks through weak C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O and strong O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bonds for type I and type II structures, respectively.In the present work, the CPs based on Ln(III) ions with ionic radius larger than Eu(III) only display structure type I, while those based on Ln(III) ions with ionic radius smaller than Eu(III) only exhibit structure type II. However, the Eu(III) CPs show both types of structures, which can be selectively obtained under different solvent systems, indicating that the Eu(III) ions may be located at a turning point (Scheme 1). Additionally, we have also compared the average Ln-O distances among compounds 1-5. The average bond lengths between lanthanide and O atoms decrease continuously from 2.391 (1), 2.381 (2), 2.362 (3), to 2.347 (4) \u00c5, further indicating the effect of lanthanide contraction [44]. Nevertheless, the average Ln-O distance in 5 (2.365 \u00c5) slightly increases as compared to those in 3 and 4, further suggesting that the Eu(III) ions probably are located at a turning point.Thermal stability analysesTo determine the thermal stabilities of the two types of CPs, thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of the representative compounds 3 and 5 were measured under an air atmosphere in the temperature range of 30-800 \u00b0C. As illustrated in Fig. 3, compound 3 has two steps of weight loss. The first weight loss of 3.7 % from 30 \u00b0C to about 130 \u00b0C can be attributed to the loss of one guest water molecule (calculated 2.7 %) in the asymmetric unit, and then this compound is stable up to 200 \u00b0C. The major weight loss occurred in the next step above 200 \u00b0C is probably caused by the gradual decomposition of the coordinated DMA and HTFMIDC2- ligands, leading to the collapse of the coordination framework. Seen from the TG curve of 5, an initial weight loss of 5.6 % between 30 and 200 \u00b0C may correspond to the release of a half DMA guest molecule per formula unit (calculated 6.9 %). Further weight loss between 200 and 600 \u00b0C also can be ascribed to the decomposition of the whole coordination structure.Photoluminescent propertiesTaking into account the excellent luminescent properties of the Eu(III) ions in the visible region, the photoluminescence of compounds 4 and 5 in the solid state was measured at room temperature. In order to well compare the luminescence intensity, all of the spectra are measured with the same voltage of 400 V and identical pass width of 5.0 nm. When the emission wavelengths were fixed at 614 nm for 4 and 615 nm for 5, both the excitation spectra of 4 and 5 display a broadband roughly covering from 230 to 300 nm, as well as four sharp peaks in the range of 350-420 nm, giving the maximum peaks at 394 and 395 nm for 4 and 5, respectively (Figs. S11 and S12). As presented in Fig. 4, compound 4 exhibits intensity red luminescence and shows the characteristic f-f transition of a Eu(III) ion upon excitation at 394 nm. The strong intense emission at 614 nm is assigned to electric-dipolar 5D0 \u2192 7F2 transition, while the medium strong intensity of emission at 592 nm is attributed to magnetic-dipolar 5D0 \u2192 7F1. Three weak peaks at 579, 652 and 701 nm can be ascribed to the 5D0 \u2192 7F0, 5D0 \u2192 7F3 and 5D0 \u2192 7F4 transitions, respectively [45, 46]. Compound 5 emits red light upon excitation at 395 nm (Fig. 4), and it also exhibits a typical Eu(III) emission spectrum as compared to compound 4. The characteristic peaks at 580, 593, 615, 655 and 704 can be assigned to the characteristic emissions of Eu(III) corresponding to electronic transitions from the excited state 5D0 to the multiplets 7FJ (J = 0 \u2192 4), respectively [45, 46]. The intensity ratios of 5D0 \u2192 7F2/5D0 \u2192 7F1 for 4 and 5 are calculated to be 5.4 and 5.1, respectively, indicating that the Eu(III) ions in both 4 and 5 adopt noncentrosymmetric coordination environments without inversion centers. These results are in agreement with the X-ray single-crystal structure of compounds 4 and 5. In addition, the luminescence intensity of 4 is relatively stronger than that of 5, which may be assigned to the quenching effect of the water molecule coordinated with Eu(III) center in 5 [47].ConclusionIn summary, we have successfully synthesized five new 2D lanthanide (III) coordination polymers showing two types of structures by the assembly of H3TFMIDC multidentate ligands with the corresponding lanthanide oxides. Both two types of structures possess similar 2D honeycomb-like layers but are stacked in slightly different ABAB fashions. The slippage distances between the neighboring layer A and layer B in 1-4 are significantly shorter than the corresponding one in 5. Such a difference leads to the formation of different 3D supramolecular frameworks: The 2D honeycomb-like layers of 1-4 are connected by weak C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bonds, while those in 5 are linked by strong O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bonds. The structural diversity of 1-5 may be ascribed to the effect of lanthanide contraction. Our work can enrich the family of coordination chemistry of H3TFMIDC and demonstrates that this kind of ligand is appropriate for the construction of new lanthanide (III) coordination polymers.Supporting informationCCDC 1478917-1478921 contain the supplementary crystallographic data for the compounds 1-5.

The characteristic peaks at 580, 593, 615, 655 and 704 can be assigned to the characteristic emissions of Eu(III) corresponding to electronic transitions from the excited state 5D0 to the multiplets 7FJ (J = 0 \u2192 4), respectively [45, 46]. The intensity ratios of 5D0 \u2192 7F2/5D0 \u2192 7F1 for 4 and 5 are calculated to be 5.4 and 5.1, respectively, indicating that the Eu(III) ions in both 4 and 5 adopt noncentrosymmetric coordination environments without inversion centers. These results are in agreement with the X-ray single-crystal structure of compounds 4 and 5. In addition, the luminescence intensity of 4 is relatively stronger than that of 5, which may be assigned to the quenching effect of the water molecule coordinated with Eu(III) center in 5 [47].",
