id=\"Sec1\"><title>Introduction</title><p id=\"Par2\">Azo dyes, the largest and most versatile class of synthetic dyes, have been widely and frequently used in various industries including textile, leather, paper, printing, plastic, food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR1\">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>]. A relatively high amount of azo dyes are released into wastewater effluents annually during the manufacturing or processing operations, leads to contamination of the environment [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>]. Since azo dye molecules are characterized by the presence of one or more azo bonds (NN) connected with aromatic rings and auxochromes, most of them are stable and recalcitrant, and thus cannot be easily removed by conventional wastewater treatment methods [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR4\">4</xref>]. These compounds are toxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic and non-biodegradable, and will pose a long-term risk to the ecosystem and human health. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) making use of in situ formed highly reactive radicals have emerged as useful methods for treating most toxic and bio-refractory organic pollutants in wastewater. Several AOP processes have been employed to degrade and mineralize azo dyes in wastewater, such as Fenton, Fenton-like, photocatalysis, ultrasonic catalysis, electrochemical catalysis, and persulfate oxidation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref>]. Among them, persulfate (PS) is the latest investigated oxidant and has been used to treat numerous types of contaminants, especially in terms of in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) for soil and groundwater remediation. PS is capable of generating SO<sub arrange=\"stack\">4</sub><sup arrange=\"stack\">\u00b7\u2212</sup> under various activation methods. Thermal, UV (Ultraviolet) and transition metals are the most common methods that are used. But the high cost of heat and light application limits the widespread use of thermal and UV methods [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR8\">8</xref>].</p><p id=\"Par3\">Metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) themselves are a relatively new and rapidly growing class of compounds. These inorganic\u2013organic porous materials are microporous crystals comprised of metal ions linked by organic bridging ligands, which possess unique attributes, such as tailorable molecular properties, good thermal stability and uniform structured nano scale cavities [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR9\">9</xref>]. These features endow them with outstanding properties and potential applications in drug delivery, gas storage, separation, molecular sensing, adsorption, and especially in catalysis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR12\">12</xref>]. Very recently, researchers have investigated the use of iron-based metal organic frameworks as persulfate catalysts and have made some progress [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>].

Furthermore, the catalytic activities of complex <bold>1</bold> for the degradation of methyl orange in a Fenton-like process have also investigated, which reveals that complex <bold>1</bold> could behave as effective as heterogeneous catalyst to activate persulfate anions and to degrade methyl orange. To evaluate the anti-cancer activity of compound <bold>1</bold> on H9C2 myocardioma cells, the CCK-8 and the cell colony formation assay was conducted.

It should be noted that the S-containing H<sub>2</sub>L ligand could not be dissolved in the common organic solvents such as EtOH, MeOH, CH<sub>3</sub>CN and water, but can be dissolved in the hot DMF and DMA solution. So the DMA was chosen as the dominating solvent in this reaction with the water as the assistant solvent in the elevated temperature. The chemical formula of complex <bold>1</bold> was established via a combination of the elemental analysis, TGA along with the single-crystal X-ray diffraction study, which was formulated as {[Co<sub>2</sub>L<sub>2</sub>MA]\u00b7(DMA)(MeOH)}<sub>n</sub>. The structural solution and refinement results based on the crystal data at room temperature reveals that complex <bold>1</bold> belongs to the orthorhombic crystal system with the space group Cmcm and displays a 3D framework with channels of dimensions 10.06 \u00c5\u2009\u00d7\u200910.12 \u00c5 running along the a axis.

The Co(II) center is located in a slightly distorted square pyramid and connected with one N atom from the MA molecule and four O atoms from four different L<sup>2\u2212</sup> ligands, in which the four O atoms de fi ne a least-squares plane with average deviation 0.001 \u00c5 and the axial position is occupied by N atom with distance 2.473 \u00c5 from the least-squares plane. The Co(II)-O bond distances are in the region of 2.005 to 2.022 \u00c5 and the Co(II)-N bond length is 2.018 \u00c5, which agree with the results in previous reports [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR19\">19</xref>]. the L<sup>2\u2212</sup> anions are from H<sub>2</sub>L ligand and adopts \u03bc<sub>4</sub>-kO: kO\u2032: kO\u2033: kO\u2034 bridging modes to coordinate with four Co(II) centers, that is to say each carboxylate groups of H<sub>2</sub>L ligand adopts the bis-monodentate mode to coordinate to two Co(II) centers, therefore, the Co center and the symmetry-related one (Co1i) are linked by four L<sup>2\u2212</sup> ligands into a paddle wheel [Co<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>] fragment with Co\u2013Co distance of 3.033(2) \u00c5, and the fragment as subunit connects to four neighboring ones via four L<sup>2\u2212</sup> ligands to form the 2D sheet network structure on bc plane with rectangle cavies with dimensions of\u2009\u2248\u200910.06 \u00c5\u2009\u00d7\u200910.12 \u00c5 (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig1\">1</xref>b). The MA ligands are two linkers and utilize two N atoms on the triazine ring to bridge two Co centers with free amino groups.

Considering the following catalytic reaction, the water stability of complex <bold>1</bold> was checked by soaking the freshly prepared <bold>1</bold> in water for 1 day and then the corresponding PXRD pattern was collected. As shown in the Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig2\">2</xref>a, the peak positions of the samples of complex <bold>1</bold> in water showed a good match with that of freshly prepared complex <bold>1</bold> with a slightly difference in the peak intensity, which indicates the complex <bold>1</bold> kept its framework integrality after being soaked in water for 1 day. The slightly difference in the peak intensity might be due to the different lattice solvents. According to the literature, the lattice solvents could also contribute to the diffraction intensities in the PXRD patterns [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR20\">20</xref>]. At the same time, to investigate the thermal stability of <bold>1</bold>, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiment was carried out in the temperature range 25\u2013800\u00a0\u00a0C under a flow of nitrogen with a heating rate of 10\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0min<sup>\u22121</sup> (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig2\">2</xref>b). The TGA curve for the complex <bold>1</bold> showed the weight loss of 16.7% in the temperature range 25\u2013210\u00a0\u00a0C, corresponding to the loss of one lattice DMA and one MeOH molecule (calcd: 16.3%), after which there is no obvious loss until about 370\u00a0\u00b0C. During the temperature range of 380\u2013550\u00a0\u00a0C, a sharp weight loss of 65.1% was occurred. The weight loss was calculated to the decomposition of the organic ligands, suggesting the framework of <bold>1</bold> was totally collapsed. In order to remove the lattice DMA solvents in <bold>1</bold>, the as-prepared samples of <bold>1</bold> was soaked in the MeOH for 3 days and then activated at 393\u00a0K for 12\u00a0h. The absence of the lattice solvents in <bold>1a</bold> (the solvent-free <bold>1</bold>) has been confirmed via the TGA analysis, which reflects that no obvious weight loss could be observed in the temperature of 25 to 350\u00a0\u00a0C. Furthermore, the framework robustness in the activation process gas been confirmed via the PXRD measurements, which indicates its good framework stability in the above mentioned treatments. Porosity and surface area of <bold>1a</bold> were confirmed by N<sub>2</sub> adsorption analysis at 77\u00a0K. As illustrated in Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig2\">2</xref>c, the complex <bold>1a</bold> exhibited type I adsorption isotherm behavior, evidencing its microporous feature. The hysteresis phenomenon may be caused by hindered diffusion through the narrow pore apertures. The BET surface area for <bold>1a</bold> was 925\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>/g, indicating the existence of microporous in the framework of <bold>1a</bold>. The pore size distribution of <bold>1a</bold> was calculated based on desorption isotherm using nonlocal DFT (density functional theory) and its pore size mainly centers around 7.4 \u00c5 (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig2\">2</xref>d).</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec13\"><title>Catalytic Activity</title><p id=\"Par13\">A new advanced oxidation technology based on strongly oxidizing sulfate radicals (SO<sub arrange=\"stack\">4</sub><sup arrange=\"stack\"><bold>\u00b7</bold>\u2013</sup>) has recently been developed to degrade recalcitrant organic pollutants.

The photodegradation activity results of complex <bold>1</bold> are compared with the activity of control blank (i.e. non-catalytic). The progress of the catalysis degradation of methyl orange reaction was estimated by monitoring the absorbance characteristic of methyl orange at 506\u00a0nm. As shown in Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig3\">3</xref>, the degradation efficiency was 92.6% for <bold>1</bold> after 150\u00a0min. In contrast to the control experiments (without MOF samples and with the metal salts and organic ligands), which are 15.2%, 11.3% and 5.7%, respectively. To make a further comparison, the Zn(II)-MOF which is structurally isostructural to the complex <bold>1</bold> was also studied. The degradation efficiency of Zn(II)-MOF is lower than Co(II)-MOF, which may be due to their different metal centers. Compared to the Zn(II)-MOF, the Co(II)-MOF <bold>1</bold> performs better at the beginning, the residual rate of methyl orange was decreased to 12% in the first 50\u00a0min. Subsequently, the reaction continued slowly and nearly ceased at the end. The activity of complex <bold>1</bold> in the degradation of methyl orange may be due to S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>, it can be transformed into sulfate radicals (SO<sub arrange=\"stack\">4</sub><sup arrange=\"stack\"><bold>\u00b7</bold>\u2212</sup>) by catalysis of <bold>1</bold> whilst Co<sup>2+</sup> was oxidized into Co<sup>3+</sup>. The Zn(II) ion is difficult to oxidize or reduce due to its stable d<sup>10</sup> configuration so it showed a much lower catalysis activity. In addition, the complex <bold>1</bold> kept its framework integrality after the catalytic reaction which has been validated from the PXRD measurement (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig2\">2</xref>a).</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec14\"><title>The Viability of H9C2 Myocardioma Cells was Reduced by Compound 1</title><p id=\"Par15\">Firstly, we aimed to investigate the involvement of compound <bold>1</bold> in the H9C2 cancer cell viability and proliferation.

The single crystal X-ray diffraction study reveals that complex <bold>1</bold> crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Cmcm and displays a 3D framework with channels of dimensions 10.06 \u00c5\u2009\u00d7\u200910.12 \u00c5 running along the [1 0 0] direction. The presence of abundant micropores has been confirmed via the N<sub>2</sub> sorption experiments at 77\u00a0K, which reflects a BET surface area of 1012\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>/g and a pore size distribution of 6.7 \u00c5. Furthermore, the catalytic activities of complex <bold>1</bold> for the degradation of methyl orange in a Fenton-like process have also investigated, which reveals that complex <bold>1</bold> could behave as effective as heterogeneous catalyst to activate persulfate anions and to degrade methyl orange. We observed that the newly synthesized compound could significantly inhibit the viability and proliferation of H9C2 myocardioma cells in vitro, which is proved by CCK-8 assay and cell colony formation assay. In addition to this, we also proved that the apoptosis was induced in cancer cells after compound treatment. The relative expression of Bcl-2 was significantly decreased, while Bax increased. Above all, we draw this conclusion, the compound could induce apoptosis and inhibit cancer cell progression in vitro.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec17\" sec-type=\"supplementary-material\"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p id=\"Par18\">CCDC No. contains the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.

A relatively high amount of azo dyes are released into wastewater effluents annually during the manufacturing or processing operations, leads to contamination of the environment [3]. Since azo dye molecules are characterized by the presence of one or more azo bonds (NN) connected with aromatic rings and auxochromes, most of them are stable and recalcitrant, and thus cannot be easily removed by conventional wastewater treatment methods [4]. These compounds are toxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic and non-biodegradable, and will pose a long-term risk to the ecosystem and human health. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) making use of in situ formed highly reactive radicals have emerged as useful methods for treating most toxic and bio-refractory organic pollutants in wastewater. Several AOP processes have been employed to degrade and mineralize azo dyes in wastewater, such as Fenton, Fenton-like, photocatalysis, ultrasonic catalysis, electrochemical catalysis, and persulfate oxidation [5]. Among them, persulfate (PS) is the latest investigated oxidant and has been used to treat numerous types of contaminants, especially in terms of in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) for soil and groundwater remediation. PS is capable of generating SO4\u22c5- under various activation methods. Thermal, UV (Ultraviolet) and transition metals are the most common methods that are used. But the high cost of heat and light application limits the widespread use of thermal and UV methods [6-8].Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) themselves are a relatively new and rapidly growing class of compounds. These inorganic-organic porous materials are microporous crystals comprised of metal ions linked by organic bridging ligands, which possess unique attributes, such as tailorable molecular properties, good thermal stability and uniform structured nano scale cavities [9]. These features endow them with outstanding properties and potential applications in drug delivery, gas storage, separation, molecular sensing, adsorption, and especially in catalysis [10-12]. Very recently, researchers have investigated the use of iron-based metal organic frameworks as persulfate catalysts and have made some progress [13-15]. In this study, a new three-dimensional (3D) transition Co(II)-organic framework (MOF) {[Co2L2MA]\u22c5(DMA)(MeOH)}n (MA=melamine, H2L=2,5-thiophenedicarboxylic acid) bearing the rigid S-containing organic ligand 2,5-thiophenedicarboxylic acid and the N-rich organic linker melamine has been synthesized and were structurally characterized. The presence of abundant micropores has been confirmed via the N2 sorption experiments at 77 K, which reflects a BET surface area of 1012 m2/g and a pore size distribution of 6.7 \u00c5. Furthermore, the catalytic activities of complex 1 for the degradation of methyl orange in a Fenton-like process have also investigated, which reveals that complex 1 could behave as effective as heterogeneous catalyst to activate persulfate anions and to degrade methyl orange. To evaluate the anti-cancer activity of compound 1 on H9C2 myocardioma cells, the CCK-8 and the cell colony formation assay was conducted. All the results indicate the excellent inhibitory effect of compound on cancer cells. Besides, we also confirmed the compound 1 could induce the apoptosis of cancer cells by changing the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax.ExperimentalMaterials and InstrumentationAll reagents and solvents employed in this work were commercially available and used without further purification. Elemental analyses (C, H and N) were determined with Perkin-Elmer 240 elemental analyzer. Thermogravimetric analysis was carried out on a NETSCHZ STA-449C thermo-analyzer with a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min under a nitrogen atmosphere. Infrared spectra were measured on a Nicolet Magna 750 FT-IR spectrometer in the range of 400-4000 cm-1 using the KBr pellets. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analyses were recorded on a Bruker AXS D8 advanced automated diffractometer with Cu-K\u03b1 radiation.Synthesis of Compound {[Co2L2MA]\u22c5(DMA)(MeOH)}n (1)A mixture of Co(NO3)2\u22c56H2O (45 mg, 0.15 mmol) 0.33 mmol melamine (MA, 0.04 g), 0.50 mmol 2,5-thiophenedicarboxylic acid (H2L, 0.08 g), 3 mL DMA and 2 mL MeOH were mixed uniformly and added in a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. The autoclave was heated to 100 \u00b0C with a rate of 5 \u00b0C/min and kept at 100 \u00b0C for 72 h. After being cooled to 20 \u00b0C with a rate of 5 \u00b0C/min, pink block crystals were obtained. Then crystals were washed with MeOH and dried in the air. Yield: ca. 44% (based on H2L). Anal. Calcd (%) for compound 1 (C20H23Co2N7O10S2): C, 34.45; H, 3.49; N, 13.92%. Calculate: C, 34.15; H, 3.30; N, 13.94%.X-ray CrystallographySingle crystal X-ray crystal data of 1 was collected on a computer-controlled Oxford Xcalibu E diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo-K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb=0.71073 \u00c5) at room temperature. Absorption corrections were applied using SADABS. The structures were solved by direct methods by the SHELXS-2014 package and refined by full-matrix least-square methods on F2 by using the SHELXL-2014/6. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically and all H atoms were generated in their ideal locations. Crystallographic data and refinement details are summarized in Table 1, and the selected bond distances and angles for compound 1 are given in Table 1.The Catalytic TestsThe photocatalytic activity of 1 was tested using methyl orange solutions. The degradation reaction was carried out with 150 mL aqueous methyl orange solution (10 mg L-1) containing 5 mg of sodium persulfate and 50 mg of 1 as catalyst. The mixture was placed and stirred in a 250 mL beaker, which was 15 cm vertically below the visible-light source. The container and the light source were placed inside a black box to prevent visible-light leakage. The experiments were performed at 298 K and the pH was adjusted to 3 with sulfuric acid (1 M). The progress of the reaction was estimated by monitoring the absorbance characteristic of methyl orange at 506 nm. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were taken periodically during irradiation, and after filtration, they were analyzed by UV/Vis spectrophotometry. This procedure was repeated in the absence of coordination polymers as a control experiment, and by using equivalent amounts of metal ion or the organic ligand as catalysts instead of the complex 1 as control experiment, respectively.Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) AssaysWhether the compound 1 involved in the growth of the H9C2 myocardioma cells, the CCK-8 experiment was performed according to the operation [16]. In brief, the H9C2 cells in the logarithmic growth phase were collected and planted into 6 well plates at the concentration of 1\u00d7105 cells/well. After incubated in the incubator at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 for 24 h, the cells were exposed to serious concentrations of compound 1a. After treatment, the couture medium was discarded, and fresh medium supplemented with 20\u03bcL CCK-8 was added into cells for another 2 h incubation. Subsequently, the absorbance of each well was detected by flow cytometry. This experiment was repeated at least 3 times.Colony-Forming AssaysThe proliferation of H9C2 myocardioma cells was assessed by performing colony-forming assays according to the manufacturer's guidance [17]. For colony-forming assays, the cells were seeded into the a six-well plate at the concentration of 1\u00d7103 cells/well. The cells were incubated in an incubator at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 for 12 h, followed by compound 1 addition and cultured for 14 days. Finally, the cell colonies in the plates were fixed with methanol and stained with 0.01% crystal Violet (Sigma) for 10 min. All the cells colonies were pictured using an optical microscope.Western BlottingThe relative expression of cell apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and Bax was detected by western blot accordance to the guidance as previous described [18]. After treated with compound 1, the cells in each group were washed and added with lysis buffer, followed by cell lysis on ice for 30 min. Then, the protein samples in each group was extracted with extraction kit and collected into an EP tube. After centrifuged at 12,000 rpm and 4 \u00b0C for 5 min, the supernatant was collected and the sample concentration was determined by BCA kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Subsequently, equal amount 20 \u03bcL proteins were added into the loading wells and separated by SDS-PAGE gel, followed by protein transferring onto the PVDF membranes. After that, the PVDF membranes were sealed with 5% skim milk powder at room temperature for 1 h, and incubated with primary antibody at 4 \u00b0C overnight. On the next day, the PVDF membranes were washed with TBST solution, and incubated with corresponding secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. Finally, image was pictured using the image development system, and the gray level was detected.Results and DiscussionCrystal Structure of Complex 1Reaction of cobalt(II) nitrate H2L and MA in a mixed solvent of DMA and MeOH at 100 \u00b0C for 3 days afforded pink block crystals of 1 with a moderate yield. It should be noted that the S-containing H2L ligand could not be dissolved in the common organic solvents such as EtOH, MeOH, CH3CN and water, but can be dissolved in the hot DMF and DMA solution. So the DMA was chosen as the dominating solvent in this reaction with the water as the assistant solvent in the elevated temperature. The chemical formula of complex 1 was established via a combination of the elemental analysis, TGA along with the single-crystal X-ray diffraction study, which was formulated as {[Co2L2MA]\u22c5(DMA)(MeOH)}n. The structural solution and refinement results based on the crystal data at room temperature reveals that complex 1 belongs to the orthorhombic crystal system with the space group Cmcm and displays a 3D framework with channels of dimensions 10.06 \u00c5\u00d710.12 \u00c5 running along the a axis. The basic molecular unit is shown in the Fig. 1a, which reveals that there is one crystallographically unique Co(II) center, two halves of L2- anion and one-half of MA molecule along with one disordered DMA and one MeOH molecules in the asymmetric unit contains. The Co(II) center is located in a slightly distorted square pyramid and connected with one N atom from the MA molecule and four O atoms from four different L2- ligands, in which the four O atoms de fi ne a least-squares plane with average deviation 0.001 \u00c5 and the axial position is occupied by N atom with distance 2.473 \u00c5 from the least-squares plane. The Co(II)-O bond distances are in the region of 2.005 to 2.022 \u00c5 and the Co(II)-N bond length is 2.018 \u00c5, which agree with the results in previous reports [19]. the L2- anions are from H2L ligand and adopts \u03bc4-kO: kO': kO\": kO\u2034 bridging modes to coordinate with four Co(II) centers, that is to say each carboxylate groups of H2L ligand adopts the bis-monodentate mode to coordinate to two Co(II) centers, therefore, the Co center and the symmetry-related one (Co1i) are linked by four L2- ligands into a paddle wheel [Co2(CO2)4] fragment with Co-Co distance of 3.033(2) \u00c5, and the fragment as subunit connects to four neighboring ones via four L2- ligands to form the 2D sheet network structure on bc plane with rectangle cavies with dimensions of~10.06 \u00c5\u00d710.12 \u00c5 (Fig. 1b). The MA ligands are two linkers and utilize two N atoms on the triazine ring to bridge two Co centers with free amino groups. Thus, MA ligands bridge two adjacent 2D network into a 3D framework with rectangle channels of dimensions 10.06 \u00c5\u00d710.12 \u00c5 running along the [1 0 0] directions, the free amino groups are inside of the channels (Fig. 1c). In the view of topological structure, each the paddle wheel [Co2(CO2)4] fragment can be viewed as a six-connected node and each L2- ligand and MA molecule are linkers, the whole framework can be simplified into a 6-connected topological network with the point symbol (412\u00d763) (Fig. 1d).PXRD, Thermogravimetric and BET Analysis for Complex 1To confirm that the crystal structures are truly representative of the bulk materials, PXRD experiments were carried out for the bulky as-prepared 1 in different synthesis runs at room temperature. The PXRD experimental and computer-simulated patterns of the corresponding compounds in the Fig. 2a show that they are the same regarding to the peak positions, indicating the as-prepared complex 1 is in high phase purity. The slightly different intensity for the peaks in the different positions should be attributed to the crystal face preferred orientation effects. Considering the following catalytic reaction, the water stability of complex 1 was checked by soaking the freshly prepared 1 in water for 1 day and then the corresponding PXRD pattern was collected. As shown in the Fig. 2a, the peak positions of the samples of complex 1 in water showed a good match with that of freshly prepared complex 1 with a slightly difference in the peak intensity, which indicates the complex 1 kept its framework integrality after being soaked in water for 1 day. The slightly difference in the peak intensity might be due to the different lattice solvents. According to the literature, the lattice solvents could also contribute to the diffraction intensities in the PXRD patterns [20]. At the same time, to investigate the thermal stability of 1, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiment was carried out in the temperature range 25-800  C under a flow of nitrogen with a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min-1 (Fig. 2b). The TGA curve for the complex 1 showed the weight loss of 16.7% in the temperature range 25-210  C, corresponding to the loss of one lattice DMA and one MeOH molecule (calcd: 16.3%), after which there is no obvious loss until about 370 \u00b0C. During the temperature range of 380-550  C, a sharp weight loss of 65.1% was occurred. The weight loss was calculated to the decomposition of the organic ligands, suggesting the framework of 1 was totally collapsed. In order to remove the lattice DMA solvents in 1, the as-prepared samples of 1 was soaked in the MeOH for 3 days and then activated at 393 K for 12 h. The absence of the lattice solvents in 1a (the solvent-free 1) has been confirmed via the TGA analysis, which reflects that no obvious weight loss could be observed in the temperature of 25 to 350  C. Furthermore, the framework robustness in the activation process gas been confirmed via the PXRD measurements, which indicates its good framework stability in the above mentioned treatments. Porosity and surface area of 1a were confirmed by N2 adsorption analysis at 77 K. As illustrated in Fig. 2c, the complex 1a exhibited type I adsorption isotherm behavior, evidencing its microporous feature. The hysteresis phenomenon may be caused by hindered diffusion through the narrow pore apertures. The BET surface area for 1a was 925 m2/g, indicating the existence of microporous in the framework of 1a. The pore size distribution of 1a was calculated based on desorption isotherm using nonlocal DFT (density functional theory) and its pore size mainly centers around 7.4 \u00c5 (Fig. 2d).Catalytic ActivityA new advanced oxidation technology based on strongly oxidizing sulfate radicals (SO4\u22c5-) has recently been developed to degrade recalcitrant organic pollutants. Like Fenton's reagent, the persulfate anions can produce sulfate radicals; however the uncatalyzed reaction rate is extremely slow. We used the as-prepared cobalt(II)-MOF 1 as heterogeneous catalysts to activate persulfate anions and generate sulfate radicals SO4\u22c5-. It is possible to represent mechanism according to Eqs. (1), (2) and (3), respectively [21].1Co2++S2O82-\u2192Co3++SO4\u22c5-+SO42-\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}     \\usepackage{amsmath}     \\usepackage{wasysym}     \\usepackage{amsfonts}     \\usepackage{amssymb}     \\usepackage{amsbsy}     \\usepackage{mathrsfs}     \\usepackage{upgreek}     \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}     \\begin{document}$$ {\\text{Co}}^{2 + } + {\\text{S}}_{2} {\\text{O}}_{8}^{2 - } \\to {\\text{Co}}^{3 + } + {\\text{SO}}_{4}^{{\\cdot{-}}} + {\\text{SO}}_{4}^{{2{-}}} $$\\end{document}2Co3++S2O82-\u2192Co2++2SO4\u22c5-\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}     \\usepackage{amsmath}     \\usepackage{wasysym}     \\usepackage{amsfonts}     \\usepackage{amssymb}     \\usepackage{amsbsy}     \\usepackage{mathrsfs}     \\usepackage{upgreek}     \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}     \\begin{document}$$ {\\text{Co}}^{3 + } + {\\text{S}}_{2} {\\text{O}}_{8}^{2 - } \\to {\\text{Co}}^{2 + } + 2{\\text{SO}}_{4}^{{\\cdot{-}}} $$\\end{document}3MB+SO4\u22c5-\u2192CO2+H2O+SO42-\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}     \\usepackage{amsmath}     \\usepackage{wasysym}     \\usepackage{amsfonts}     \\usepackage{amssymb}     \\usepackage{amsbsy}     \\usepackage{mathrsfs}     \\usepackage{upgreek}     \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}     \\begin{document}$$ {\\text{MB}} + {\\text{ SO}}_{4}^{{\\cdot{-}}} \\to {\\text{CO}}_{2} + {\\text{H}}_{2} {\\text{O}} + {\\text{SO}}_{4}^{{2{-}}} $$\\end{document}Herein, we tested complex 1 as heterogeneous catalystes to activate persulfate anions and to degrade methyl orange in the aqueous solution. The photodegradation activity results of complex 1 are compared with the activity of control blank (i.e. non-catalytic). The progress of the catalysis degradation of methyl orange reaction was estimated by monitoring the absorbance characteristic of methyl orange at 506 nm. As shown in Fig. 3, the degradation efficiency was 92.6% for 1 after 150 min. In contrast to the control experiments (without MOF samples and with the metal salts and organic ligands), which are 15.2%, 11.3% and 5.7%, respectively. To make a further comparison, the Zn(II)-MOF which is structurally isostructural to the complex 1 was also studied. The degradation efficiency of Zn(II)-MOF is lower than Co(II)-MOF, which may be due to their different metal centers. Compared to the Zn(II)-MOF, the Co(II)-MOF 1 performs better at the beginning, the residual rate of methyl orange was decreased to 12% in the first 50 min. Subsequently, the reaction continued slowly and nearly ceased at the end. The activity of complex 1 in the degradation of methyl orange may be due to S2O82-, it can be transformed into sulfate radicals (SO4\u22c5-) by catalysis of 1 whilst Co2+ was oxidized into Co3+. The Zn(II) ion is difficult to oxidize or reduce due to its stable d10 configuration so it showed a much lower catalysis activity. In addition, the complex 1 kept its framework integrality after the catalytic reaction which has been validated from the PXRD measurement (Fig. 2a).The Viability of H9C2 Myocardioma Cells was Reduced by Compound 1Firstly, we aimed to investigate the involvement of compound 1 in the H9C2 cancer cell viability and proliferation. After treated with different doses of compound 1 for indicated time, the viability and proliferation were detected. The results of CCK-8 revealed that the viability of H9C2 cancer cell decreased in a dose-dependent manner compared with that of the blank group after compound treatment (Fig. 4a). The similar results were found in cell colony formation assay. In Fig. 4b, we can see the numbers of colony numbers of H9C2 cancer cell was significantly reduced after compound 1 treatment. All the results indicated the compound shows excellent inhibitory effect on cancer cell viability and proliferation in vitro.Relative Expression of Apoptotic Proteins Effected by Compound 1After treated with compound 1 for indicated time, the relative expression of apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and Bax was detected by western blot. It was found that after treatment, the protein expression of Bcl-2 in cells was significantly decreased, while Bax expression was remarkably increased compared with the control group (p<0.05, Fig. 5a). This experiment suggested the induction effect of compound 1 on H9C2 cell apoptosis.ConclusionIn summary, we have successfully prepared a new three-dimensional (3D) transition Co(II)-organic framework by using the rigid S-containing organic ligand 2,5-thiophenedicarboxylic acid and the N-rich organic linker melamine as co-linkers. The single crystal X-ray diffraction study reveals that complex 1 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Cmcm and displays a 3D framework with channels of dimensions 10.06 \u00c5\u00d710.12 \u00c5 running along the [1 0 0] direction. The presence of abundant micropores has been confirmed via the N2 sorption experiments at 77 K, which reflects a BET surface area of 1012 m2/g and a pore size distribution of 6.7 \u00c5. Furthermore, the catalytic activities of complex 1 for the degradation of methyl orange in a Fenton-like process have also investigated, which reveals that complex 1 could behave as effective as heterogeneous catalyst to activate persulfate anions and to degrade methyl orange. We observed that the newly synthesized compound could significantly inhibit the viability and proliferation of H9C2 myocardioma cells in vitro, which is proved by CCK-8 assay and cell colony formation assay. In addition to this, we also proved that the apoptosis was induced in cancer cells after compound treatment. The relative expression of Bcl-2 was significantly decreased, while Bax increased. Above all, we draw this conclusion, the compound could induce apoptosis and inhibit cancer cell progression in vitro.Supplementary MaterialCCDC No. contains the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.

The slightly difference in the peak intensity might be due to the different lattice solvents.

The PXRD experimental and computer-simulated patterns of the corresponding compounds in the Fig. 2a show that they are the same regarding to the peak positions, indicating the as-prepared complex 1 is in high phase purity. The slightly different intensity for the peaks in the different positions should be attributed to the crystal face preferred orientation effects. Considering the following catalytic reaction, the water stability of complex 1 was checked by soaking the freshly prepared 1 in water for 1 day and then the corresponding PXRD pattern was collected. As shown in the Fig. 2a, the peak positions of the samples of complex 1 in water showed a good match with that of freshly prepared complex 1 with a slightly difference in the peak intensity, which indicates the complex 1 kept its framework integrality after being soaked in water for 1 day. The slightly difference in the peak intensity might be due to the different lattice solvents. According to the literature, the lattice solvents could also contribute to the diffraction intensities in the PXRD patterns [20]. At the same time, to investigate the thermal stability of 1, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiment was carried out in the temperature range 25-800  C under a flow of nitrogen with a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min-1 (Fig. 2b). The TGA curve for the complex 1 showed the weight loss of 16.7% in the temperature range 25-210  C, corresponding to the loss of one lattice DMA and one MeOH molecule (calcd: 16.3%), after which there is no obvious loss until about 370 \u00b0C. During the temperature range of 380-550  C, a sharp weight loss of 65.1% was occurred. The weight loss was calculated to the decomposition of the organic ligands, suggesting the framework of 1 was totally collapsed. In order to remove the lattice DMA solvents in 1, the as-prepared samples of 1 was soaked in the MeOH for 3 days and then activated at 393 K for 12 h. The absence of the lattice solvents in 1a (the solvent-free 1) has been confirmed via the TGA analysis, which reflects that no obvious weight loss could be observed in the temperature of 25 to 350  C. Furthermore, the framework robustness in the activation process gas been confirmed via the PXRD measurements, which indicates its good framework stability in the above mentioned treatments.

As illustrated in Fig. 2c, the complex 1a exhibited type I adsorption isotherm behavior, evidencing its microporous feature. The hysteresis phenomenon may be caused by hindered diffusion through the narrow pore apertures. The BET surface area for 1a was 925 m2/g, indicating the existence of microporous in the framework of 1a. The pore size distribution of 1a was calculated based on desorption isotherm using nonlocal DFT (density functional theory) and its pore size mainly centers around 7.4 \u00c5 (Fig. 2d).\n\nHerein, we tested complex 1 as heterogeneous catalystes to activate persulfate anions and to degrade methyl orange in the aqueous solution. The photodegradation activity results of complex 1 are compared with the activity of control blank (i.e. non-catalytic). The progress of the catalysis degradation of methyl orange reaction was estimated by monitoring the absorbance characteristic of methyl orange at 506 nm. As shown in Fig. 3, the degradation efficiency was 92.6% for 1 after 150 min. In contrast to the control experiments (without MOF samples and with the metal salts and organic ligands), which are 15.2%, 11.3% and 5.7%, respectively. To make a further comparison, the Zn(II)-MOF which is structurally isostructural to the complex 1 was also studied. The degradation efficiency of Zn(II)-MOF is lower than Co(II)-MOF, which may be due to their different metal centers. Compared to the Zn(II)-MOF, the Co(II)-MOF 1 performs better at the beginning, the residual rate of methyl orange was decreased to 12% in the first 50 min. Subsequently, the reaction continued slowly and nearly ceased at the end. The activity of complex 1 in the degradation of methyl orange may be due to S2O82-, it can be transformed into sulfate radicals (SO4\u22c5-) by catalysis of 1 whilst Co2+ was oxidized into Co3+. The Zn(II) ion is difficult to oxidize or reduce due to its stable d10 configuration so it showed a much lower catalysis activity. In addition, the complex 1 kept its framework integrality after the catalytic reaction which has been validated from the PXRD measurement (Fig. 2a).\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, we have successfully prepared a new three-dimensional (3D) transition Co(II)-organic framework by using the rigid S-containing organic ligand 2,5-thiophenedicarboxylic acid and the N-rich organic linker melamine as co-linkers.
