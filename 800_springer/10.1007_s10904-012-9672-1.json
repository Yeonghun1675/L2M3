The crystal structure consists of a one-dimensional copper(II) coordination polymeric chain constructed by the [Cu<sub>2</sub>(heae)]<sup>2+</sup> cations as the inorganic second building units (SBUs) and the tpa<sup>2\u2212</sup> anions as linkers. The Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu separations through the bridges of heae<sup>2\u2212</sup> and tpa<sup>2\u2212</sup> are 5.2472(6) and 10.9677(8)\u00a0\u00c5, respectively. Both the copper(II) ions have square pyramidal coordination geometries. A three-dimensional hydrogen bonding network is observed in the crystal. The measured molar conductivity suggests that the polymer may stay intact in solution as the 1D polymer in the crystal. The cytotoxicities of the polymeric copper(II) complex were tested by Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assays against human hepatocellular carcinoma cell SMMC-7721 and human lung adenocarcinoma cell A549.

insights into the interaction model between DNA and the complexes, and to the information about drug design and tools of molecular biology [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR1\">1</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>]. It is well known that modes of DNA non-covalent interaction with metal complexes include electrostatic effect, groove binding and intercalation; and effectiveness mainly depends on the mode and affinity of the binding between the complexes and DNA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR8\">8</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR9\">9</xref>]. Along this line, many of transition metal complexes have been synthesized and their interactions with DNA studied [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR19\">19</xref>].

However, to the best of our knowledge, examples of such polymer-metal complexes are still few, and comparatively little attention has been given to the systems, in which the transition metal ions are propagated both by oxmaido and phenyldicarboxylate bridges, although the oxmaido [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR22\">22</xref>] and phenyldicarboxylate [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>] groups have been shown to be good candidates for the constructing polymer-metal complexes. Taking into the above facts, it is of considerable interest to synthesize and study the DNA-binding properties of polymer-metal complexes with bridging oxamido and phenyldicarboxylate groups in order to gain some insight into the DNA-binding properties and antitumor activities of these kinds of complexes.</p><p>In this work, detailed here a new one-dimensional copper(II) coordination polymer, formulated as [Cu<sub>2</sub>(heae)(tpa)]<sub>n</sub>\u00b7nH<sub>2</sub>O, has been synthesized and structurally characterized by using both <italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>\u2032-<italic>bis</italic>(<italic>N</italic>-hydroxyethylaminoethyl)oxamide (heae) and terephthalate (tpa) as polyatomic bridging ligands.

Cultures were passaged weekly using trypsin\u2013EDTA to detach the cells from their culture flasks. The polymeric copper(II) complex and <italic>cis</italic>-platin were dissolved in DMSO and diluted to the required concentration with culture medium when used. The content of DMSO in the final concentrations did not exceed 0.1\u00a0%. At this concentration, DMSO was found to be non-toxic to the cells tested. Rapidly growing cells were harvested, counted, and incubated at the appropriate concentration in 96-well micro plates for 24\u00a0h. The polymeric copper(II) complex and <italic>cis</italic>-platin dissolved in culture medium were then applied to the culture wells to achieve final concentrations ranging from 10<sup>\u22124</sup> to 10<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00a0\u03bcM.

The concentration of the DNA was determined by UV absorbance at 260\u00a0nm.

A stock solution of the DNA was stored at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and not used after 4\u00a0days. A concentrated stock solution of the copper(II) complex was prepared by dissolving the complex in Tris\u2013HCl and diluting suitably with Tris\u2013HCl buffer to the required concentrations for all the experiments. The absorption spectral titration experiment was performed by keeping the concentration of the copper(II) complex constant while varying the DNA concentration. An equal solution of <italic>HS</italic>-DNA was added to the copper(II) complex solution and reference solution to eliminate the absorbance of the DNA itself. In the EB fluorescence displacement experiment, 5\u00a0\u03bcL of the EB Tris\u2013HCl solution (1\u00a0mmol\u00a0L<sup>\u22121</sup>) was added to 1\u00a0mL of <italic>HS</italic>-DNA solution (at saturated binding levels) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR28\">28</xref>] and stored in the dark for 2\u00a0h.

Before measurements, the system was shaken and incubated at room temperature for 30\u00a0min. The fluorescence spectra were obtained at an excitation wavelength of 522\u00a0nm and an emission wavelength of 584\u00a0nm. Cyclic voltammetric experiment on the copper(II) polymer at different scan rates (from 0.06 to 0.24\u00a0V/s) was recoded on a CHI 832 electrochemical analyzer. The titration experiments were carried out by maintaining constant concentration of the copper(II) polymer while varying the DNA concentration using the solvent of Tris\u2013HCl buffer. The viscosity measurement was carried out using an Ubbelodhe viscometer immersed in a thermostatic water bath maintained at 16 (\u00b10.l)\u00a0\u00b0C. The DNA samples with approximately 200 base pairs in length were prepared by sonication in order to minimize complexities arising from DNA flexibility [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR29\">29</xref>]. Flow times were measured with a digital stopwatch; each sample was measured three times, and an average flow time was calculated.

The benzene dicarboxylate dianions, due to their versatile bonding modes with metal ions and their peculiar structures, involving carboxylate groups that are non-coplanar with themselves and with the benzene ring, could be good candidates for the preparation of polymeric MOFs [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR33\">33</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR35\">35</xref>].

The crystal structure consists of a one-dimensional copper(II) coordination polymeric chain constructed by the [Cu2(heae)]2+ cations as the inorganic second building units (SBUs) and the tpa2- anions as linkers. The Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu separations through the bridges of heae2- and tpa2- are 5.2472(6) and 10.9677(8) \u00c5, respectively. Both the copper(II) ions have square pyramidal coordination geometries. A three-dimensional hydrogen bonding network is observed in the crystal. The measured molar conductivity suggests that the polymer may stay intact in solution as the 1D polymer in the crystal. The cytotoxicities of the polymeric copper(II) complex were tested by Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assays against human hepatocellular carcinoma cell SMMC-7721 and human lung adenocarcinoma cell A549. The polymer exhibits potent cytotoxic effects against the two cell lines. The binding properties of the copper(II) polymer with herring sperm DNA (HS-DNA) have been investigated by using UV absorption and fluorescence spectra and electrochemical techniques and viscosity. The results show that the copper(II) polymer interacts with HS-DNA in the mode of intercalation with the intrinsic binding constant of 1.07 \u00d7 104 M-1.Keywords\u03bc-Trans-oxamidato-bridge\u03bc-Terephthalato-bridgeCrystal structureOne-dimensional copper(II) polymerDNA-bindingCytotoxic activitiesvolume-issue-count6issue-article-count33issue-toc-levels0issue-pricelist-year2012issue-copyright-holderSpringer Science+Business Media, LLCissue-copyright-year2012article-contains-esmYesarticle-numbering-styleContentOnlyarticle-registration-date-year2012article-registration-date-month3article-registration-date-day1article-toc-levels0toc-levels0volume-typeRegularjournal-productNonStandardArchiveJournalnumbering-styleContentOnlyarticle-grants-typeRegularmetadata-grantOpenAccessabstract-grantOpenAccessbodypdf-grantRestrictedbodyhtml-grantRestrictedbibliography-grantRestrictedesm-grantOpenAccessonline-firstfalsepdf-file-referenceBodyRef/PDF/10904_2012_Article_9672.pdftarget-typeOnlinePDFissue-online-date-year2012issue-online-date-month6issue-online-date-day13issue-print-date-year2012issue-print-date-month6issue-print-date-day12issue-typeRegulararticle-typeOriginalPaperjournal-subject-primaryChemistryjournal-subject-secondaryInorganic Chemistryjournal-subject-secondaryPolymer Sciencesjournal-subject-secondaryOrganic Chemistryopen-accessfalseElectronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s10904-012-9672-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.IntroductionRecent years have witnessed a growing interest in the synthesis and interaction of transition metal complexes with DNA due to insights into the interaction model between DNA and the complexes, and to the information about drug design and tools of molecular biology [1-7]. It is well known that modes of DNA non-covalent interaction with metal complexes include electrostatic effect, groove binding and intercalation; and effectiveness mainly depends on the mode and affinity of the binding between the complexes and DNA [8, 9]. Along this line, many of transition metal complexes have been synthesized and their interactions with DNA studied [10-19]. Furthermore, significant developments have occurred in recent years in the chemistry of polymer-metal complexes. In particular, the studies of the interaction of these polymer-metal complexes with DNA have been of great interest [20, 21]. However, to the best of our knowledge, examples of such polymer-metal complexes are still few, and comparatively little attention has been given to the systems, in which the transition metal ions are propagated both by oxmaido and phenyldicarboxylate bridges, although the oxmaido [22] and phenyldicarboxylate [23] groups have been shown to be good candidates for the constructing polymer-metal complexes. Taking into the above facts, it is of considerable interest to synthesize and study the DNA-binding properties of polymer-metal complexes with bridging oxamido and phenyldicarboxylate groups in order to gain some insight into the DNA-binding properties and antitumor activities of these kinds of complexes.In this work, detailed here a new one-dimensional copper(II) coordination polymer, formulated as [Cu2(heae)(tpa)]n\u22c5nH2O, has been synthesized and structurally characterized by using both N,N'-bis(N-hydroxyethylaminoethyl)oxamide (heae) and terephthalate (tpa) as polyatomic bridging ligands. The cytotoxicities experiments reveal that the polymer-copper(II) complex exhibits potent cytotoxic effects against human hepatocellular carcinoma cell SMMC-7721 and human lung adenocarcinoma cell A549. The interaction of the coordination polymer with herring sperm DNA (HS-DNA) was investigated by using electronic absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, electrochemical technique and viscosity measurement, and the results suggested that the copper(II) polymer interacts with HS-DNA in the mode of intercalation.ExperimentalMaterials and ChemicalsThe ligand N,N'-bis(N-hydroxyethylaminoethyl)oxamide (H2heae) was synthesized according to literature method [24]. All chemicals used were of reagent grade. Doubly distilled water was used to prepare buffers. Ethidium bromide (EB) and HS-DNA were purchased from Sigma Corp. and used as received.Physical MeasurementsThe carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen elemental analyses were performed with a Perkin-Elmer elemental analyzer Model 240. The infrared spectrum was recorded with samples as KBr pellets in a Nicolet model Impact 470 FTIR spectrophotometer in the spectral range 4,000-400 cm-1. The UV-Visible spectrum was recorded in a 1-cm-path length quartz cell on a Cary 300 spectro-photometer. Fluorescence was tested on an Fp-750w fluorometer. A CHI 832 electrochemical analyzer (Shanghai CHI Instrument, Shanghai, China) in connection with a glassy carbon working electrode (GCE), a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) and a platinum wire counter electrode was used for the electrochemical measurement. The GCE surface was freshly polished to a mirror prior to each experiment with 0.05 \u03bcm \u03b1-Al2O3 paste and then cleaned in water for 5 min. Viscosity measurement was carried out using an Ubbelodhe viscometer immersed in a thermostatic water bath maintained at 289 (\u00b10.l) K.Synthesis of the Copper(II) PolymerA methanol and acetonitrile (v/v = 1:1) solution (5 mL) of copper(II) chloride dihydrate (17.0 mg, 0.1 mmol) was added dropwise to the same solution (5 mL) containing H2heae (13.1 mg, 0.05 mmol) and piperidine (8.5 mg, 0.1 mmol). The mixture was stirred quickly for 30 min, then an aqueous solution (5 mL) of terephthalic acid (11.6 mg, 0.1 mmol) and piperidine (17.0 mg, 0.2 mmol) was added dropwise into the mixture. The reaction solution was heated under reflux with stirring at 333 K for 6 h. The resulting blue precipitates were collected, washed with water and dried in the desiccator. Yield: 71 %. Then the precipitates were dissolving in water. Deep bluish-green crystals suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained from the solution after 40 days by slow evaporation at room temperature. Anal. Calcd. (%) for Cu2C18H26N4O9: C, 37.83; H, 4.94; N, 9.80. Found (%): C, 37.87; H, 4.90; N, 9.79.Determination of X-ray Crystal StructureThe X-ray diffraction experiment for polymer-copper(II) complex was made on a Bruker diffractometer with graphite monochromatic radiation (\u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5). The crystal structure was solved by the direct method followed by Fourier syntheses. Structure refinement performed by full matrix least-squares SHELXL-97 on F2 [25]. H atoms on the hydroxyl groups, amine groups and water molecule were located in a difference Fourier map and refined in riding mode with free Uiso. Other H atoms were placed in calculated positions, with C-H = 0.97 (methylene), 0.93 \u00c5 (aromatic), and included in the final cycles of refinement in the riding mode, with Uiso(H) = 1.2 Ueq of the carrier carbon atoms. Crystal data and refinement conditions are summarized in Table 1.In Vitro Antitumor Activity Evaluation by SRB AssaysThe cytotoxicities of the polymeric copper(II) complex and cis-platin were evaluated against two cancer cell lines including SMMC-7721 and A549 by using the Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. All cells were cultured in RPMI 1,640 supplemented with 10 % (v/v) foetal bovine serum, 1 % (w/v) penicillin (104 U/mL) and 10 mg/mL streptomycin. Cell lines are maintained at 310 K in a 5 % (v/v) CO2 atmosphere with 95 % (v/v) humidity. Cultures were passaged weekly using trypsin-EDTA to detach the cells from their culture flasks. The polymeric copper(II) complex and cis-platin were dissolved in DMSO and diluted to the required concentration with culture medium when used. The content of DMSO in the final concentrations did not exceed 0.1 %. At this concentration, DMSO was found to be non-toxic to the cells tested. Rapidly growing cells were harvested, counted, and incubated at the appropriate concentration in 96-well micro plates for 24 h. The polymeric copper(II) complex and cis-platin dissolved in culture medium were then applied to the culture wells to achieve final concentrations ranging from 10-4 to 10-1 \u03bcM. Control wells were prepared by addition of culture medium without cells. The plates were incubated at 310 K in a 5 % CO2 atmosphere for 48 h. Upon completion of the incubation, the cells were fixed with ice-cold 10 % trichloroacetic acid (100 mL) for 1 h at 277 K, washed five times in distilled water and allowed to dry in the air and stained with 0.4 % SRB in 1 % acetic acid (100 mL) for 15 min. The cells were washed four times in 1 % acetic acid and air-dried. The stain was solubilized in 10 mM unbuffered Tris base (100 mL) and the OD of each well was measured at 540 nm on a microplate spectrophotometer. The IC50 values were calculated from the curves constructed by plotting cell survival (%) versus the polymeric copper(II) complex and cis-platin concentration.DNA-Binding StudiesAll experiments involving HS-DNA were performed in Tris-HCl buffer solution (pH = 7.16). Solutions of HS-DNA in Tris-HCl buffer gave a ratio of UV absorbance at 260 and 280 nm, A260/A280, of ca. 1.90, indicating that the DNA was sufficiently free of protein [26]. The concentration of the DNA was determined by UV absorbance at 260 nm. The molar absorption coefficient, \u03b5260, was taken as 6,600 L mol-1 cm-1 [27]. A stock solution of the DNA was stored at 4 \u00b0C and not used after 4 days. A concentrated stock solution of the copper(II) complex was prepared by dissolving the complex in Tris-HCl and diluting suitably with Tris-HCl buffer to the required concentrations for all the experiments. The absorption spectral titration experiment was performed by keeping the concentration of the copper(II) complex constant while varying the DNA concentration. An equal solution of HS-DNA was added to the copper(II) complex solution and reference solution to eliminate the absorbance of the DNA itself. In the EB fluorescence displacement experiment, 5 \u03bcL of the EB Tris-HCl solution (1 mmol L-1) was added to 1 mL of HS-DNA solution (at saturated binding levels) [28] and stored in the dark for 2 h. Then the solution of the copper(II) complex was titrated into the DNA/EB mixture and diluted in Tris-HCl buffer to 5 mL to produce the solutions with the varied mole ratio of the copper(II) complex to HS-DNA. Before measurements, the system was shaken and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The fluorescence spectra were obtained at an excitation wavelength of 522 nm and an emission wavelength of 584 nm. Cyclic voltammetric experiment on the copper(II) polymer at different scan rates (from 0.06 to 0.24 V/s) was recoded on a CHI 832 electrochemical analyzer. The titration experiments were carried out by maintaining constant concentration of the copper(II) polymer while varying the DNA concentration using the solvent of Tris-HCl buffer. The viscosity measurement was carried out using an Ubbelodhe viscometer immersed in a thermostatic water bath maintained at 16 (\u00b10.l) \u00b0C. The DNA samples with approximately 200 base pairs in length were prepared by sonication in order to minimize complexities arising from DNA flexibility [29]. Flow times were measured with a digital stopwatch; each sample was measured three times, and an average flow time was calculated. Relative viscosities for HS-DNA in the presence and absence of the complex were calculated from the relation \u03b7 = (t-t0)/t0, where t is the observed flow time of DNA-containing solution and t0 is the flow time of Tris-HCl buffer alone. Data are presented as (\u03b7/\u03b70)1/3 versus binding ratio [30], where \u03b7 is the viscosity of HS-DNA in the presence of complex and \u03b70 is the viscosity of HS-DNA alone.Results and DiscussionSynthetic Route and General Properties of the PolymerThe design and synthesis of polymeric metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has for a long time been a challenging field for coordination chemists, owing to the relative difficulty of synthesizing new compounds. An effective method to construct MOFs is the self-assembly of the inorganic second building units (SBUs) and the organic linker molecules [31]. N,N'-bis(substituent)oxamides, as versatile bridging ligands, of which the trans conformation with vacant coordinated sites is more stable than the cis one in the lack of steric hindrance between the substituents on the amine nitrogen atom, allow the formation of trans-oxamidato-bridged binuclear SBUs [32]. Hence this family of ligands has played important role in constructing polymeric MOFs. Apart from the inorganic SBUs, the organic linker molecules with versatile coordination modes are also indispensable to construct the polymeric MOFs. The benzene dicarboxylate dianions, due to their versatile bonding modes with metal ions and their peculiar structures, involving carboxylate groups that are non-coplanar with themselves and with the benzene ring, could be good candidates for the preparation of polymeric MOFs [23, 33-35]. So far, many of new metal-polymers with interesting structures based on the bridging N,N'-bis(substituent)oxamides have been synthesized and their properties have been studied extensively [36, 37]. However, the structures of reported those polymeric MOFs involving coordinating hydroxy groups in the N,N'-bis(substituent)oxamide bridging ligand appear to be rare. In this paper, we chose N,N'-bis(N-hydroxyethylaminoethyl)oxamide (H2heae) to synthesize the SBU with the trans-heae-bridged binuclear copper(II) building block [Cu2(heae)]2+. And then tpa is used as the organic linker molecule attaching the binuclear copper(II) building blocks to form a 1D copper(II) coordination polymeric complex [Cu2(heae)(tpa)]n\u22c5nH2O. The synthetic pathway for the complexation may be represented by Scheme 1.The polymeric copper(II) complex is both insoluble in non-polar solvents and common polar solvents, moderately soluble in water, methanol and acetonitrile, and very soluble in DMF and DMSO to give stable solutions at room temperature, implying the polymeric nature of the complex [38]. In the solid state the complex is fairly stable in air allowing physical measurements. The molar conductance value of the polymeric copper(II) complex (\u039b = 20 \u03a9-1 cm-2 mol-1 in DMF solution) falls in the expected range for non-electrolyte [39], suggesting that all of the tpa ligands in the copper(II) polymer have been involved with the coordination. Indeed, it is difficult to determine whether the polymer stays intact in solution as the 1D polymer in the crystal structure. The possibility of the polymer falling apart is not ruled out. However, the molar conductivity in solution suggests that the polymeric copper(II) complex is intact as the whole, neutral polymer entity [Cu2(heae)(tpa)]n. This viewpoint is further evidenced by some 1D copper(II) coordination polymers with similar polymeric characteristics [36].IR and Electronic SpectraIn the IR spectrum of the complex, the N-H and O-H vibrations of the bridging oxamidate ligand appear in the 3,202 and 3,490 cm-1, respectively. And the carbonyl stretching vibration is observed at 1,655 cm-1 in the complex, which is characteristic of the bridging oxamidate group [40]. The copper(II) polymer also exhibits characteristic vibration bands of \u03bdas(COO) (1,578 cm-1) and \u03bds(COO) (1,314 cm-1). The \u0394 value, which represents the separation of \u03bdas(COO) and \u03bds(COO), reflects the coordination modes of the carboxyl groups [41]. The \u0394 value (264 cm-1) indicating that the carboxyl groups on tpa ligand behave as mono-dentate ligands in the copper(II) polymer [41].The electronic spectra of the copper(II) polymer were recorded in the UV-Visible. The copper(II) polymer shows three absorption bands with varied intensities. The intense band at 203 nm is assigned to intra-ligand (\u03c0-\u03c0*) transition associated to tpa ligand. While the less intense band at 275 nm corresponds to the charge transfer transition from tpa ligand to the metals. Besides, the broad band observed at the lower frequency of 645 nm in the spectrum matches well with the reported d-d transition of five-coordinated copper(II) in the square-pyramidal geometry [42]. The spectroscopic data of the copper(II) polymer are in agreement with the determination of the crystal structure (vide infra).Description of the StructureThe X-ray single crystal diffraction analysis indicates that the copper(II) complex consists of a neutral one-dimensional chain, [Cu2(heae)(tpa)]n\u22c5nH2O, which is formed by trans-heae binuclear copper(II) complex cations, [Cu2(heae)]2+, as the inorganic SBUs further connected by the linkers, tpa2- anions in end-to-end fashion. The dissymmetric unit contains a complex cation coordinated to a tpa2- anion and a crystallized water molecule as shown in Fig. 1. The selected geometric parameters are summarized in Table 2.Both copper(II) ions have {N2O3} square pyramidal coordination geometries with \u03c4 values [43] of 0.049 (Cu1) and 0.019 (Cu2). Their basal planes are composed of two nitrogen atoms and an oxygen atom from heae2- ligand and one carboxyl oxygen atom of tpa2-. And their apical positions are occupied by hydroxyl oxygen atoms of heae2- ligand. Atoms Cu1 and Cu2 displace from the basal planes 0.0576(13) and 0.0980(13) \u00c5, respectively. The bond lengths of Cu-N and Cu-O in Table 2 are close to those found in other oxamido-bridged copper(II) complexes [44-48]. The axial Cu-O bonds are longer than those in the basal plane. The differences are 0.401(3) and 0.333(3) \u00c5 for atom Cu1 and 0.343(3) and 0.262(3) \u00c5 for atom Cu2. The bond lengths of Cu1-N2 and Cu2-N3 are shorter than Cu1-N1 and Cu2-N4, which is consistent with stronger donor ability of the oxamide nitrogen atoms compared with amine ones.The trans-oxamide bridge, heae2-, as a bis-tetradentate ligand chelates both copper(II) ions with three five-membered rings respectively. The rings formed by oxamide-bridge are planar as usual with the Cu-Cu separation of 5.2472(6) \u00c5. Those formed by ethylenediamine groups adopt the twist conformation with the puckering parameters [49] of Q = 0.437(3) \u00c5, \u03c6 = 54.7(4)\u00ba for atom Cu1 and Q = 0.431(4) \u00c5, \u03c6 = 301.3(4)\u00ba for atom Cu2. While those formed by hydroxyethylamine groups are in envelope, the corresponding puckering parameters are Q = 0.530(3) \u00c5, \u03c6 = 78.9(3)\u00ba for atom Cu1 and Q = 0.495(4) \u00c5, \u03c6 = 251.9(3)\u00ba for atom Cu2. The other bridging ligand, tpa2- anion, bis-monodentately coordinates to two copper(II) ions with Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu distance of 10.9677(8) \u00c5. The dihedral angles between the carboxyl groups and benzene ring are 5.35(14)\u00ba (C18) and 20.83(12)\u00ba (C11).In the crystal, the complex chain extends parallel to the b axis. These 1D chains are connected into a 2D network by the classical O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen-bond between hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups (Fig. 2; Table 3). Subsequently, the 2D layers are further linked with hydrogen bonds of lattice water molecules to yield a 3D supramolecular structure.Cytotoxic Activity of the Polymeric Copper(II) ComplexThe cytotoxicity assays of the polymeric copper(II) complex and cis-platin against two cancer cell lines human hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721 and human lung adenocarcinoma A549 were conducted in our study. It is noteworthy that the IC50 values of the polymeric copper(II) complex are 19.0 \u00b1 0.3 and 11.0 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcM for SMMC-7721 and A549, respectively, which are much higher than those of cis-platin (5.4 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcM for SMMC-7721 and 7.6 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcM for A549), indicating that the cytotoxic activity of the polymeric copper(II) complex is less than that of cis-platin. However, the inhibition of cell proliferation produced by the polymeric copper(II) complex on the same batch of cell lines is still rather active. The polymeric copper(II) complex possessing cytotoxic activity may be attributed to the extended planar structure induced by the p-\u03c0* conjugation from the chelation of the metal ion with the ligands. These findings of cytotoxic activities in vitro prompt us to explore the DNA-binding studies on the polymeric copper(II) complex.DNA-Binding StudiesElectronic Absorption TitrationElectronic absorption spectroscopy is an effective method to examine the binding modes and binding extent of the metal complexes with DNA. The hypochromism and red shift are generally associated with the binding of the metal complexes to the DNA helix, due to the intercalative mode involving a strong stacking interaction between the aromatic chromophore of the complexes and the base pairs of DNA. The electronic absorption spectra of the polymeric copper(II) complex in the absence and presence of HS-DNA are shown in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3a, when titrated by HS-DNA, the band centered at 203 nm exhibits hypochromism accompanied with a red-shift of 5 nm. Obviously, these spectral characteristics reveal that the polymeric copper(II) complex interacts with HS-DNA through the intercalation mode that involves \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction between the aromatic chromophore and the base pairs of the DNA. These spectral changes are analogous to that of our previously reported a one-dimensional copper(II) polymer with formula of [Cu2(H2O)2(dmapox)(tpa)2]n [50], whose interaction mode with DNA is intercalative binding. These observations for the polymeric copper(II) complex can be rationalized by the following reasons. When the polymeric copper(II) complex intercalates the base pairs of HS-DNA, the \u03c0*-orbital of the intercalated ligands in the polymeric copper(II) complex can couple with the \u03c0-orbital of the base pairs, thus decreasing the \u03c0-\u03c0* transition energy and resulting in the bathochromism. Furthermore, the coupling \u03c0-orbital is partially filled by electrons, thus decreasing the transition probabilities and concomitantly resulting in hypochromism.In order to quantitatively evaluate the binding strength of the copper(II) complex with HS-DNA, the intrinsic binding constant Kb was determined by monitoring the changes in absorbance at 203 nm using the following equation [51]:1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}     \\usepackage{amsmath}     \\usepackage{wasysym}     \\usepackage{amsfonts}     \\usepackage{amssymb}     \\usepackage{amsbsy}     \\usepackage{mathrsfs}     \\usepackage{upgreek}     \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}     \\begin{document}$$ \\left[ {\\text{DNA}} \\right]/\\left( {\\varepsilon_{\\text{a}} - \\varepsilon_{\\text{f}} } \\right) = \\left[ {\\text{DNA}} \\right]/\\left( {\\varepsilon_{\\text{b}} - \\varepsilon_{\\text{f}} } \\right) + 1/K_{\\text{b}} \\left( {\\varepsilon_{\\text{b}} - \\varepsilon_{\\text{f}} } \\right) $$\\end{document}where [DNA] is the concentration of DNA, \u03b5f, \u03b5a and \u03b5b correspond to the extinction coefficient, respectively, for the free polymeric copper(II) complex, for each addition of DNA to the polymeric copper(II) complex and for the polymeric copper(II) complex in the fully bound form. As shown in Fig. 3b, in the plot of [DNA]/(\u03b5a-\u03b5f) versus [DNA], the binding constant Kb for the polymeric copper(II) complex was estimated to be 1.07 \u00d7 104 M-1, (R = 0.9911 for nine points), lower than those of typical intercalators (e.g., EB-DNA, ~106 M-1) [52], and has the same level as those of well-established intercalation agents [53].The Ethidium Bromide Fluorescence Displacement ExperimentsTo further investigate the interaction mode between the polymeric copper(II) complex and HS-DNA, the EB fluorescence displacement experiments were used. In general, the intrinsic fluorescence intensity of DNA is very low, and that of EB in Tris-HCl buffer is also not high due to quenching by the solvent molecules. However, on addition of DNA, the fluorescence intensity of EB will be enhanced because of its intercalation into the DNA. Thus, EB can be used to probe the interaction of complexes with DNA. If the complexes can intercalate into DNA, the binding sites of DNA available for EB will be decreased, and hence the fluorescence intensity of EB will be quenched [54]. In our experiment, it has been used to monitor the interaction of the polymeric copper(II) complex with HS-DNA, and the results are shown in Fig. 4. As illustrated in Fig. 4a, the fluorescence intensity of EB at 584 nm shows an obvious decreasing trend with the increasing concentration of the polymeric copper(II) complex, suggesting that the polymeric copper(II) complex binds strongly with HS-DNA. The quenching of EB bound to DNA by polymeric copper(II) complex is in agreement with the linear Stern-Volmer equation [55]:2\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}     \\usepackage{amsmath}     \\usepackage{wasysym}     \\usepackage{amsfonts}     \\usepackage{amssymb}     \\usepackage{amsbsy}     \\usepackage{mathrsfs}     \\usepackage{upgreek}     \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}     \\begin{document}$$ I_{0} /I = 1+ K_{\\text{sv}} \\left[ {\\text{Q}} \\right] $$\\end{document}where I0 and I represent the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of quencher, respectively. Ksv is a linear Stern-Volmer quenching constant, Q is the concentration of quencher. In the quenching plot (see inset in Fig. 4b) of I0/I versus (complex), Ksv is given by the ratio of the slope to intercept. The Ksv value for the polymeric copper(II) complex is 6.14 \u00d7 104 (R = 0.9927 for 14 points).Cyclic Voltammetric StudiesCyclic voltammetry (CV) has been widely employed to study DNA-binding properties for complexes with electronic activity, whether the electrochemical processes are reversible [56], quasi-reversible [57], or irreversible [58, 59]. In order to get a deeper insight into the mutual donor-acceptor electronic influence, we have undertaken CV studies of the copper(II) polymer. The cyclic voltammograms of the polymer (1.0 \u00d7 10-5 mol L-1) at different scan rates (from 0.06 to 0.24 V/s) were investigated (Supporting information, Fig. S1). The results indicated that the oxidation and reduction peak currents (ipa and ipc) both exhibit the linear relationship versus the scan rate (ipc = 3.4436 \u00d7 10-6 + 7.198 \u00d7 10-7 v, R = 0.9663; ipa = -2.966 \u00d7 10-7-7.835 \u00d7 10-7 v, R = 0.9707). These relationships indicate that the electrode processes in Tris-HCl buffer solution are absorption controlled [60].For exploring the binding mode between the polymeric copper(II) complex and HS-DNA, restricting the scan rate to 0.24 V/s, the CV behaviors of the copper(II) polymer (1.0 \u00d7 10-5 mol L-1) without and with different HS-DNA concentrations are studied, and the results are shown in Fig. 5. From this figure, it can be seen that with the increasing concentration of HS-DNA, the voltammetric peak currents decreased apparently, indicating that there exists an interaction between the copper(II) polymer and HS-DNA [61]. The shift in E0' can be used to estimate the ratio of binding constants for reduced and oxidized forms to DNA using following equation [62]:3\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}     \\usepackage{amsmath}     \\usepackage{wasysym}     \\usepackage{amsfonts}     \\usepackage{amssymb}     \\usepackage{amsbsy}     \\usepackage{mathrsfs}     \\usepackage{upgreek}     \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}     \\begin{document}$$ \\Updelta E^{0\\prime } = E_{b}^{0\\prime } --E_{f}^{0\\prime } = 5 9. 1 5 {\\text{log}}\\left( {K_{R} /K_{O} } \\right) $$\\end{document}where \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}     \\usepackage{amsmath}     \\usepackage{wasysym}     \\usepackage{amsfonts}     \\usepackage{amssymb}     \\usepackage{amsbsy}     \\usepackage{mathrsfs}     \\usepackage{upgreek}     \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}     \\begin{document}$$ E_{b}^{0\\prime } $$\\end{document} and \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}     \\usepackage{amsmath}     \\usepackage{wasysym}     \\usepackage{amsfonts}     \\usepackage{amssymb}     \\usepackage{amsbsy}     \\usepackage{mathrsfs}     \\usepackage{upgreek}     \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}     \\begin{document}$$ E_{f}^{0\\prime } $$\\end{document} are the formal potentials of the bound and free copper(II) complex forms, respectively, and KR and KO are the corresponding binding constants for the binding of reduction and oxidation species to HS-DNA, respectively. The ratio of constants for the binding of the Cu(I) and Cu(II) ions to HS-DNA was estimated to be 1.37 in presence of HS-DNA with R = 4 [R = (DNA)/(complex)], suggesting the stronger binding affinity in the Cu(I) state compared to the Cu(II) state for the polymeric copper(II) complex. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the Ebo' value of the copper(II) complex is slightly shifted, indicating that the copper(II) complex could bind intercalatively to HS-DNA [62], which is in agreement with the above spectral results.Viscosity MeasurementsTo clarify further the interaction mode of the polymeric copper(II) complex with HS-DNA, viscosity measurements were applied. In classical intercalation the DNA helix lengthens as base pairs are separated to accommodate the bound ligand leading to increased DNA viscosity [63], whereas in groove binding or electrostatic mode the length of the helix unchanged results in not apparent alteration in DNA viscosity [64, 65]. Therefore viscosity measurement is regarded as the least ambiguous and the most critical means studying the binding mode of metal complexes with DNA in solution and provides stronger arguments for intercalative binding mode [64, 65]. The effects of the copper(II) complex on the viscosity of HS-DNA are shown in Fig. 6. As illustrated in this figure, viscosity experiment result indicates that the polymeric copper(II) complex increases the viscosity of HS-DNA, consistent with classical mode of intercalation. The result accords with the above conclusions.Supplementary MaterialsCCDC 805630 contains the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.
