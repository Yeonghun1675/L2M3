sec-type=\"introduction\"><title>Introduction</title><p>The design and synthesis of coordination polymers with unusual structures and properties are attracting increasing attention, not only for their diverse structure types, but also for their potential applications as functional materials [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR1\">1</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>]. In this aspect, considerable progress has been made on the theoretical prediction and production of useful functional materials. Nowadays, the method of hydrothermal syntheses is widely used to obtain novel crystal structures, because it can solve the problems of ligands solubility and enhance the reactivity of reactants in the crystallization process to obtain perfect crystal. Nevertheless, it is still a great challenge to predict the exact structures and compositions of polymeric complexes assembled by coordination bonds and/or pi\u2013pi interactions. The factors affecting packing of molecules and structure formation in crystallization are intricate and need to be further understood. In order to obtain novel functional complexes and investigate their structure\u2013function relationships, we have synthesized one novel ligand: 2-(4-Chloro-phenyl)-1H-1,3,7,8-tetraaza-cyclopenta[l]phenanthrene (ctpt). ctpt is a derivative of 1,10-phenanthroline, which is a long-conjugated unsymmetrical rigid reagent which can not only act as a terminal ligand but also potentially provide supramolecular interactions such as aromatic stacking to construct intriguing structures. At this stage, combine <italic>N</italic>-heterocyclic ligands and anionic <italic>O</italic>-donor as mixed ligands with metal to design various architectures is considered an attractive design strategy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR8\">8</xref>].</p><p>Until recently, research on coordination polymers has focused on incorporation of <italic>s</italic>-, <italic>d</italic>-, and even <italic>f</italic>-block metal ions as coordination centers, while less consideration has been given to the metals of the <italic>p</italic> block, despite their importance in electroluminescence, photovoltaic conversion, fluorescent sensors, and organic light-emitting diodes. Lead(II), as a heavy <italic>p</italic>-block metal ion, has a large radius and exhibits flexible coordination modes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR9\">9</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>]. Moreover, the stereo-chemical activity of the lone pair of electrons is an interesting issue, which is always discussed. In this paper, we use ctpt and aic (5-Amino-isophthalic acid) ligands to obtain one complex: [Pb(ctpt)<sub>2</sub>(aic) 3H<sub>2</sub>O]<sub>n</sub> (<bold>1</bold>).</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec2\"><title>Experimental</title><sec id=\"Sec3\" sec-type=\"materials|methods\"><title>Materials</title><p>The ligand ctpt was prepared by the method according to the description in the literature procedures [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR11\">11</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR12\">12</xref>].

The 1D zigzag-chain structure is suggested in Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig2\">2</xref>, and the simplified 1D chain structure is suggested in Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig3\">3</xref>. The 2D structure linked by hydrogen bonds is shown in Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig4\">4</xref>. Selected important bond lengths and bond angles are given in Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"Tab2\">2</xref>.</p><p>As shown in Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig1\">1</xref>, the asymmetric unit contains one Pb atom, two ctpt ligands, one aic ligand and three lattice water molecules. In <bold>1</bold>, the Pb atom is hexa-coordinated with three carboxylate oxygen atoms from two distinct aic ligands, and three nitrogen atoms donors from two ctpt ligands, forming distorted [PbN<sub>3</sub>O<sub>3</sub>] pentagonal-bipyramidal geometry. The bond distances of Pb\u2013O in <bold>1</bold> are from 2.507(3) to 2.712(4)\u00a0\u00c5, and those of Pb\u2013N bond distances fall in the 2.584(3)\u20132.736(4)\u00a0\u00c5 range, which are similar with the values reported [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR8\">8</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR17\">17</xref>]. As shown in Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig2\">2</xref>, one aic ligand coordinates to two Pb ions through three carboxylic oxygen atoms in mono-bridging and bidentate chelating fashion, which give rise to a 1D zigzag-chain structure and the distance of Pb\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Pb is 10.364\u00a0\u00c5. <italic>N</italic>-heterocyclic ligands mtp are attached to both sides of this chain regularly, In order to get better insight into the framework, we omit the ctpt ligands to obtain the simplified 1D chain network (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig3\">3</xref>).</p><p>There are two types of H-bonds interactions in complex <bold>1</bold>: N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O interactions and C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O interactions. The most interesting aspect of the structure in <bold>1</bold> concerns the intermolecular N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O [H(8B)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O(1)\u00a0=\u00a01.88\u00a0\u00c5, N(8)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O(1)\u00a0=\u00a02.73\u00a0\u00c5 and N(8)\u2013H(8B)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O(1)\u00a0=\u00a0157\u00b0] interactions, which help in the construction of the 2D layer structure (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig4\">4</xref>). It is an interesting issue for the lone pair of electrons of Pb(II), which is always discussed. The geometries of Pb(II) complexes can be classified as (1) holo-directed, in which the bonds to ligand atoms are distributed throughout the surface of an encompassing globe, and (2) hemi-directed, in which the bonds to ligand atoms are directed throughout only part of the globe [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>]. The coordination environment of Pb(II) in complex <bold>1</bold> is a good example of the holo-directed coordination, that is, the bonds to the ligand atoms are distributed throughout the surface of the encompassing Pb(II) sphere.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec10\"><title>IR Spectra</title><p>The FT-IR spectra absorption peaks at 3418, 3392\u00a0cm<sup>\u22121</sup> for <bold>1</bold> correspond to the stretching vibration of OH in the water. The strong characteristic absorption peaks at 1,612 and 1,587 are attributed to the antisymmetric stretching vibration of the coordinated carboxyl groups, and the peak at 1,398\u00a0cm<sup>\u22121</sup> corresponds to the symmetric stretching of carboxyl. The separations are 214 and 189\u00a0cm<sup>\u22121</sup>, which indicates that the carboxyls groups adopt monodentate and bidentate coordination modes. The characteristic absorption of ctpt ligands appear at 1289, 1108\u00a0cm<sup>\u22121</sup>, and the absorption peaks at 731 and 510\u00a0cm<sup>\u22121</sup> are ascribed to <italic>v</italic> (Pb\u2013N). The IR results are good agreement with their solid structural features from the results of their crystal structures.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec11\"><title>Thermal Analysis</title><p>TG analysis was used to investigate the thermal stability of <bold>1</bold> (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig5\">5</xref>). As expected, complex <bold>1</bold> exhibits three weight loss processes. First weight loss of 5.00\u00a0% from 80 to 145\u00a0\u00b0C reveals the loss of lattice water molecules (calcd. 4.91\u00a0%), and the second weight loss of 18.50\u00a0% from 145 to 361\u00a0\u00b0C corresponds to the loss of aic ligands (calcd. 18.91\u00a0%). The last weight loss reveals the loss of ctpt ligands (calcd. 60.02\u00a0%, found. 60.00\u00a0%). The final formation may be the metal oxide.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec12\"><title>XRPD Patterns of Complex 1</title><p>Complex 1 was characterized by X-ray powder dif-fraction (XRPD) at room temperature. The simulated and experimental XRPD patterns of <bold>1</bold> are shown in Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig6\">6</xref>. The patterns calculated from the single-crystal X-ray data of <bold>1</bold> are in good agreement with the observed in almost identical peak position except for some different peak intensities, which indicates the phase purity of the products.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec13\"><title>Photoluminescent Properties</title><p>In this study, we research the luminescence of <bold>1</bold> (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig7\">7</xref>). Complex <bold>1</bold> shows one strong emission band at 534\u00a0nm (excitation at 320\u00a0nm). To further analyze the nature of these emission bands, the emission properties of aic and ctpt ligands are also investigated under the same experimental conditions. The free ligand ctpt exhibits one emission band at 495\u00a0nm, and aic exhibits one emission band at 438\u00a0nm (excitation at 320\u00a0nm). The results suggest that complex <bold>1</bold> is red-shifted by 39\u00a0nm relative to that of free ligand, and red-shifted by 96\u00a0nm relative to that of aic ligand. The emission bands for the free ligands are probably attributable to the \u03c0*-n transitions. The emission of complex <bold>1</bold> can be attributed to a metal-centered transition involving the s and p metal orbitals, as proposed by Vogler et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR19\">19</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR20\">20</xref>]. However, the effect of the microenvironment between ligands and complex on the luminescence properties still needs further investigations. Complex <bold>1</bold> may be good candidate for potential photoluminescence materials, because it is highly thermally stable and insoluble in water and common organic solvents.</p></sec></sec><sec id=\"Sec14\" sec-type=\"conclusion\"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, we synthesized one new metal\u2013organic complex by using plane multifunctional ligands ctpt.

In this aspect, considerable progress has been made on the theoretical prediction and production of useful functional materials. Nowadays, the method of hydrothermal syntheses is widely used to obtain novel crystal structures, because it can solve the problems of ligands solubility and enhance the reactivity of reactants in the crystallization process to obtain perfect crystal. Nevertheless, it is still a great challenge to predict the exact structures and compositions of polymeric complexes assembled by coordination bonds and/or pi-pi interactions. The factors affecting packing of molecules and structure formation in crystallization are intricate and need to be further understood. In order to obtain novel functional complexes and investigate their structure-function relationships, we have synthesized one novel ligand: 2-(4-Chloro-phenyl)-1H-1,3,7,8-tetraaza-cyclopenta[l]phenanthrene (ctpt). ctpt is a derivative of 1,10-phenanthroline, which is a long-conjugated unsymmetrical rigid reagent which can not only act as a terminal ligand but also potentially provide supramolecular interactions such as aromatic stacking to construct intriguing structures. At this stage, combine N-heterocyclic ligands and anionic O-donor as mixed ligands with metal to design various architectures is considered an attractive design strategy [7, 8].Until recently, research on coordination polymers has focused on incorporation of s-, d-, and even f-block metal ions as coordination centers, while less consideration has been given to the metals of the p block, despite their importance in electroluminescence, photovoltaic conversion, fluorescent sensors, and organic light-emitting diodes. Lead(II), as a heavy p-block metal ion, has a large radius and exhibits flexible coordination modes [9, 10]. Moreover, the stereo-chemical activity of the lone pair of electrons is an interesting issue, which is always discussed. In this paper, we use ctpt and aic (5-Amino-isophthalic acid) ligands to obtain one complex: [Pb(ctpt)2(aic) 3H2O]n (1).ExperimentalMaterialsThe ligand ctpt was prepared by the method according to the description in the literature procedures [11, 12]. All the other chemicals from commercial sources were of AR grade and used without further purification.Instruments and MeasurementsThe FT-IR spectrum was recorded on an Alpha Centauri FT-IR spectrophotometer. TG analysis was performed with a Diamond DSC thermal analyzer at the rate of 10 \u00b0C/min rise of temperature in nitrogen atmosphere. Crystal structures were determined on a Bruker SMART APEX II CCD X-ray diffractometer. Elemental analyses of C, H and N were performed on a PE-2400 elemental analyzer. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a FLSP 920 Edinburgh fluorescence spectrometer.Synthesis of ctptA mixture of 4-Chloro-benzaldehyde, 1,10-phenanthroline- 5,6-dione (0.525 g, 2.5 mmol), ammonium acetate (3.88 g, 50 mmol) and glacial acetic acid was refluxed for 6 h, and then cooled to room temperature. Yellow precipitate was obtained when addition of concentrated aqueous ammonia to neutralize, which was collected and washed with water. The crude product dissolved in ethanol was purified by filtration on silica gel. The principal yellow band was obtained. Then evaporation of the solution gave yellow products. Yield 0.63 g, 70 %. m.p. 316-322 \u00b0C. 1H NMR (CDCl3, ppm): 3.57 (s, 1H, NH), 6.73-7.65 (m, 4H, Ar-H), 7.92-9.11 (m, 6H, aromatic protons in the moiety of phenanthroline, Ar-H). MS (ESI): m/z = 330.1 [M+1]+, 352.1 [M+Na]+.Synthesis of [Pb(ctpt)2(aic) 3H2O]n(1)A mixture of Pb(AC)2 3H2O (0.11 g, 0.3 mmol), ctpt, carboxylate and H2O (18 mL) was stirred at room temperature and adjusted the pH value to about 7.0 with NaOH (20 %). We put the cloudy solution into a 30-mL Teflon-lined stainless vessel at 170 \u00b0C for 3 days and afterwards cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 \u00b0C/h. The yellow crystals of complex 1 were obtained in 81 % yield based on Pb (0.33 g). C46H31Cl2N9O7Pb: calcd. C 50.23, H 2.84, N 11.46 %; found: C 50.19, H 2.86, N 11.41 %. IR (KBr, cm-1): 3418(s), 3392(s), 1612(vs), 1587(vs), 1398(vs), 1289(s), 1108(s), 731(s), 510(m).X-ray CrystallographySingle-crystal X-ray diffraction data were collected at room temperature with a Bruker SMART APEX II CCD diffractometer equipped with a graphite-monochromatized MoK\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5) at 293(2) K in the range of 1.72\u00b0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 26.08\u00b0 for 1. Absorption corrections were applied using multi-scan technique and all the structures were solved by direct methods with SHELXS-97 [13] and refined with SHELXL-97 [14] by full-matrix least-squares techniques on F2. Non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic temperature parameters. All H atoms were positioned geometrically (C-H = 0.093 nm for CH or 0.096 nm for CH3) and refined as a riding mode, with Uiso(H) = 1.2Ueq(C). Further crystallographic data and experimental details for structural analyses of title complex are summarized in Table 1.Results and DiscussionDescription of Crystal StructuresThe molecular structure of complex 1 is shown in Fig. 1. The 1D zigzag-chain structure is suggested in Fig. 2, and the simplified 1D chain structure is suggested in Fig. 3. The 2D structure linked by hydrogen bonds is shown in Fig. 4. Selected important bond lengths and bond angles are given in Table 2.As shown in Fig. 1, the asymmetric unit contains one Pb atom, two ctpt ligands, one aic ligand and three lattice water molecules. In 1, the Pb atom is hexa-coordinated with three carboxylate oxygen atoms from two distinct aic ligands, and three nitrogen atoms donors from two ctpt ligands, forming distorted [PbN3O3] pentagonal-bipyramidal geometry. The bond distances of Pb-O in 1 are from 2.507(3) to 2.712(4) \u00c5, and those of Pb-N bond distances fall in the 2.584(3)-2.736(4) \u00c5 range, which are similar with the values reported [8, 15-17]. As shown in Fig. 2, one aic ligand coordinates to two Pb ions through three carboxylic oxygen atoms in mono-bridging and bidentate chelating fashion, which give rise to a 1D zigzag-chain structure and the distance of Pb\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Pb is 10.364 \u00c5. N-heterocyclic ligands mtp are attached to both sides of this chain regularly, In order to get better insight into the framework, we omit the ctpt ligands to obtain the simplified 1D chain network (Fig. 3).There are two types of H-bonds interactions in complex 1: N-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O interactions and C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O interactions. The most interesting aspect of the structure in 1 concerns the intermolecular N-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O [H(8B)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O(1) = 1.88 \u00c5, N(8)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O(1) = 2.73 \u00c5 and N(8)-H(8B)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O(1) = 157\u00b0] interactions, which help in the construction of the 2D layer structure (Fig. 4). It is an interesting issue for the lone pair of electrons of Pb(II), which is always discussed. The geometries of Pb(II) complexes can be classified as (1) holo-directed, in which the bonds to ligand atoms are distributed throughout the surface of an encompassing globe, and (2) hemi-directed, in which the bonds to ligand atoms are directed throughout only part of the globe [18]. The coordination environment of Pb(II) in complex 1 is a good example of the holo-directed coordination, that is, the bonds to the ligand atoms are distributed throughout the surface of the encompassing Pb(II) sphere.IR SpectraThe FT-IR spectra absorption peaks at 3418, 3392 cm-1 for 1 correspond to the stretching vibration of OH in the water. The strong characteristic absorption peaks at 1,612 and 1,587 are attributed to the antisymmetric stretching vibration of the coordinated carboxyl groups, and the peak at 1,398 cm-1 corresponds to the symmetric stretching of carboxyl. The separations are 214 and 189 cm-1, which indicates that the carboxyls groups adopt monodentate and bidentate coordination modes. The characteristic absorption of ctpt ligands appear at 1289, 1108 cm-1, and the absorption peaks at 731 and 510 cm-1 are ascribed to v (Pb-N). The IR results are good agreement with their solid structural features from the results of their crystal structures.Thermal AnalysisTG analysis was used to investigate the thermal stability of 1 (Fig. 5). As expected, complex 1 exhibits three weight loss processes. First weight loss of 5.00 % from 80 to 145 \u00b0C reveals the loss of lattice water molecules (calcd. 4.91 %), and the second weight loss of 18.50 % from 145 to 361 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of aic ligands (calcd. 18.91 %). The last weight loss reveals the loss of ctpt ligands (calcd. 60.02 %, found. 60.00 %). The final formation may be the metal oxide.XRPD Patterns of Complex 1Complex 1 was characterized by X-ray powder dif-fraction (XRPD) at room temperature. The simulated and experimental XRPD patterns of 1 are shown in Fig. 6. The patterns calculated from the single-crystal X-ray data of 1 are in good agreement with the observed in almost identical peak position except for some different peak intensities, which indicates the phase purity of the products.Photoluminescent PropertiesIn this study, we research the luminescence of 1 (Fig. 7). Complex 1 shows one strong emission band at 534 nm (excitation at 320 nm). To further analyze the nature of these emission bands, the emission properties of aic and ctpt ligands are also investigated under the same experimental conditions. The free ligand ctpt exhibits one emission band at 495 nm, and aic exhibits one emission band at 438 nm (excitation at 320 nm). The results suggest that complex 1 is red-shifted by 39 nm relative to that of free ligand, and red-shifted by 96 nm relative to that of aic ligand. The emission bands for the free ligands are probably attributable to the \u03c0*-n transitions. The emission of complex 1 can be attributed to a metal-centered transition involving the s and p metal orbitals, as proposed by Vogler et al. [19, 20]. However, the effect of the microenvironment between ligands and complex on the luminescence properties still needs further investigations. Complex 1 may be good candidate for potential photoluminescence materials, because it is highly thermally stable and insoluble in water and common organic solvents.ConclusionsIn summary, we synthesized one new metal-organic complex by using plane multifunctional ligands ctpt. This material will give new impetus to the construction of novel functional material with potentially useful physical properties. The complex has been hydrothermally synthesized and structurally characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectrum, TG, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The title complex is highly thermal stabile and insoluble in water and common organic solvents, which is worthy of further study as candidate of potential photoluminescence material.Supplementary MaterialCCDC 1000539 contains the supplementary crystallographic data for 1, respectively.
