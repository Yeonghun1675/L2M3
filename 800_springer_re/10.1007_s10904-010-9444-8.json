Especially porous compounds like MOF-5 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR1\">1</xref>], MIL-53 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>] or HKUST-1 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>] have attracted attention due to their potential as heterogeneous catalysts or adsorbents for gases like hydrogen. Besides porosity, there are also attractive aspects of non-porous coordination polymers such as magnetic, luminescent, vaporochromism or conducting properties, to name a few [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR4\">4</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>]. Coordination polymers offer significant advantages over conventional molecular compounds due to very low solubility in conventional solvents and much higher thermal stability. They also have applications as sensors, organic light emitting diodes and full-colored LCD displays [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>].</p><p>Among the polymeric coinage d<sup>10</sup> metal complexes, silver(I) coordination polymers have received much attention because silver(I) shows a tendency to form coordination polymers with unique metal\u2013carbon [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR8\">8</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR12\">12</xref>] and metal\u2013metal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>] interactions. However, agostic (Ag\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H\u2013C) interactions are rare [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR17\">17</xref>]. Over the past decade, several coordination polymeric networks of Ag<sup>+</sup> have been synthesized and investigated. In contrast, examples of nano-scale structures of Ag<sup>+</sup> coordination polymers are scarce [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR20\">20</xref>]. Thus, their preparation is desirable in order to tailor their physical and chemical properties [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>]. On the other hand, metallic silver has been extensively used in a variety of applications; e.g., catalysis, electronics, photonics, photography, biology and medical science, due to its unique properties. For example, silver has the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity and reflectivity of all metals [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR22\">22</xref>]. It is also well known that Tl<sup>+</sup> and Ag<sup>+</sup> compounds are similar in structure and chemical properties [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. As a continuation of our previous studies on supramolecular compounds of these metal centers [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR34\">34</xref>] and to have a comparison between coordination modes of these metal centers with similar ligands, we wish to report a three-dimensional coordination polymer of Ag<sup>+</sup> with a pyridine-4-carboxylate (py-4-c<sup>\u2212</sup>) ligand. In addition to the synthesis and characterization of a three-dimensional Ag<sup>+</sup> nano-coordination polymer (NCP) of pyridine-4-carboxylic acid (Hpy-4-c) by the sonochemical process [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR19\">19</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR20\">20</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR35\">35</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR36\">36</xref>], silver nanoparticles were fabricated by thermal decomposition in oleic acid (OA) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR37\">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec2\"><title>Experimental</title><sec id=\"Sec3\"><title>Materials and Physical Techniques</title><p>All reagents for synthesis and analysis were commercially available and used as received. Double distilled water was used to prepare aqueous solutions. An ultrasonic bath (Tecna 6; 50\u201360\u00a0Hz and 0.138\u00a0KW) was used for ultrasonic irradiation. Melting points were measured on an Electrothermal 9100 apparatus and were uncorrected. Microanalyses were carried out using a Heraeus CHN-O-Rapid analyzer. IR spectra were recorded using Perkin-Elmer 597 and Nicolet 510P spectrophotometers. The thermal behavior was measured with a PL-STA 1500 apparatus between 35 and 600\u00a0\u00b0C in a static nitrogen atmosphere. Crystallographic measurements were made using a Bruker APEX area-detector diffractometer.

The reaction between pyridine-4-carboxylic acid (Hpy-4-c) and silver(I) nitrate provided a crystalline material with the general formula [Ag<sub>2</sub>(<italic>\u03bc</italic><sub>2</sub>-py-4-c)<sub>2</sub>]<sub><italic>n</italic></sub> (<bold>1</bold>). Structure determination of compound <bold>1</bold> by X-ray crystallography (Tables\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"Tab1\">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"Tab2\">2</xref>) showed the complex to be a novel interpenetrated three-dimensional polymer (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig1\">1</xref>). Two types of silver atoms exist in compound <bold>1</bold>; three-coordinate Ag1 atoms with disordered T-shape <bold>Ag</bold>O<sub>2</sub>N coordination sphere and two-coordinate Ag2 atoms with linear <bold>Ag</bold>N<sub>2</sub> coordination sphere (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig2\">2</xref>, up and middle). The py-4-c<sup>\u2212</sup> ligand acts as a <italic>\u03bc</italic><sub>2</sub>-bridging ligand where one oxygen atom of carboxylate group and the pyridine nitrogen atom of this ligand coordinate to two silver atoms (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig2\">2</xref>, down). The structure was analyzed for close Ag\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O and Ag\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H secondary interactions. It appears that Ag1 atoms in compound <bold>1</bold> have two close contacts with O1 and O2 oxygen atoms (Ag1\u2013O1\u00a0=\u00a03.148 and Ag1\u2013O2\u00a0=\u00a03.088\u00a0\u01fa) and Ag2 atoms have also two weak secondary interactions with O2 atoms (Ag2\u2013O2\u00a0=\u00a02.824\u00a0\u01fa). The closest Ag\u2013O interaction in compound <bold>1</bold> are longer than the Ag\u2013O distances in similar complexes (i.e., 2.248(4), 2.279(5), 2.408(2), 2.576(2) and 2.639(2)\u00a0\u01fa) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>] and shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radius of Ag and O (3.24\u00a0\u01fa) (van der Waals radius of Ag and O are 1.72 and 1.52\u00a0\u00c5 respectively, see [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>]). On the other hand it appears that the silver ions may be involved in Ag\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H\u2013C interactions between the silver atoms and the hydrogen atoms of the py-4-c<sup>\u2212</sup> ligand (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig2\">2</xref>, up and middle). Ag1 with a Ag(1)\u2013H(8) distance of 2.781\u00a0\u00c5 and Ag2 with two Ag(2)\u2013H(4) distances of 2.749\u00a0\u00c5. The reported M\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H distances for silver involved agostic interactions are 2.823, 2.706, 2.657, 2.776, 2.731 and 2.585\u00a0\u01fa [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR17\">17</xref>]. Thus Ag2 atoms in compound <bold>1</bold> with linear <bold>Ag</bold>N<sub>2</sub> coordination sphere have four secondary interactions in the equatorial plane, finally forming approximately octahedral arrangement around Ag<sup>I</sup> ion (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig2\">2</xref>, middle). Figure\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig3\">3</xref>, up and down show the structure of compound <bold>1</bold> along the crystallographic b and c axis, respectively. As could be observed from these figures compound <bold>1</bold> has some vacant pores which may be initially thought that compound <bold>1</bold> is a porous coordination polymer, but more structural considerations indicate that these pores are occupied by other interpenetrating networks, result in a completely packed coordination polymer with no vacant sites.</p><p>Figure\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig4\">4</xref>a shows the simulated XRD pattern from single crystal X-ray data of the compound <bold>1</bold> and Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig4\">4</xref>b shows the XRD pattern of a typical sample of [Ag<sub>2</sub>(<italic>\u03bc</italic><sub>2</sub>-py-4-c)<sub>2</sub>]<sub><italic>n</italic></sub> (<bold>1</bold>) prepared by sonochemical process. Acceptable match, with slight difference in 2\u03b8, were observed between the simulated from single-crystal X-ray data pattern (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig4\">4</xref>a) and its from the experimental powder X-ray diffraction pattern for nanostructures obtained by sonochemical process (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig4\">4</xref>b). The results of XRD powder study indicate that the experimental data are in good agreement with the simulated XRD powder pattern based on single crystal data, hence the obtained compound is as a mono-phase. The morphology and size of the samples prepared by sonochemical process were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Figures\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig5\">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig6\">6</xref> and <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig7\">7</xref> indicate the original morphology of the nanorods prepared by sonochemical process. The corresponding particle size distribution histogram of these nanorods could be observed in Figs.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig5\">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig6\">6</xref> and <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig7\">7</xref>. As could be observed from these figures, when concentration increases from 0.05\u00a0M (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig5\">5</xref>) to 0.15\u00a0M (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig7\">7</xref>), smaller nanorods with the average diameter of 2.212\u00a0\u03bcm, 626\u00a0nm and 239\u00a0nm was formed. This phenomenon was also observed in our previous work [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR19\">19</xref>]. This point could be concluded that the higher concentration of initial reagents results in higher primary seed generation in solution. The increasing of primary seed generation leads to lower thickness of the nanorods.</p><p>Thermo gravimetric (TG) and differential thermal analyses (DTA) of compound <bold>1</bold> show that the crystalline sample is stable up to 230\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig8\">8</xref>), at which temperature pyrolyze of compound <bold>1</bold> organic part starts up to 390\u00a0\u00b0C in one step with an exothermic effect at 352\u00a0\u00b0C and mass loss of 61.2% (calcd 60.1% for removal of py-4-c<sup>\u2212</sup> ligand). Mass loss calculations of the end residue and XRD pattern of the final decomposition product (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig4\">4</xref>c), shows the formation of metallic silver.</p><p>Figure\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig4\">4</xref>c also attributed to the XRD pattern of the residue obtained from calcination of compound <bold>1</bold> nanorods at 823\u00a0K. The obtained pattern match with the standard pattern of cubic silver with the lattice parameters (<italic>a</italic>\u00a0=\u00a04.0862\u00a0\u00c5 and <italic>z</italic>\u00a0=\u00a04) which are close to the reported values (JCPDS card number 04-0783). SEM image (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig9\">9</xref>, up) of the residue obtained from calcination of compound <bold>1</bold> nanorods at 823\u00a0K shows that spongy metallic silver was formed. Thermal decomposition of compound <bold>1</bold> nanorods with 0.15\u00a0M concentration of initial reagent was done [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR37\">37</xref>]. XRD pattern of the residue (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig4\">4</xref>c), shows that the resulting residue was cubic silver with the lattice parameters mentioned above. SEM image of the resulting residue shows the formation of silver nanoparticles with the diameter distribution of 50-95\u00a0nm and the average diameter of about 75\u00a0nm (Figs.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig9\">9</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig10\">10</xref>). A comparison between our previous works on silver(I) coordination polymers with this work shows that Ag<sup>I</sup> coordination polymers have tendency to form Ag<sup>I</sup> coordination polymer nanorods. For example one-dimensional Ag<sup>I</sup> coordination polymer with triphenyl acetate [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR45\">45</xref>], two-dimensional Ag<sup>I</sup> coordination polymer with diphenyl acetate [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR20\">20</xref>] or three-dimensional Ag<sup>I</sup> coordination polymer with pyridine-4-carboxylate (this work), all form Ag<sup>I</sup> coordination polymer nanorods. In this work, we obtained similar result from another 3D coordination polymer with no argentophilic interactions as a chain, grid or network in the compound <bold>1</bold> structure. As it could be observed from Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig1\">1</xref>, silver atoms are separated from each other and surrounded with aromatic pyridine rings. These aromatic pyridine rings could be considered as a template to fabricate silver nanoparticles [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR46\">46</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id=\"Sec9\" sec-type=\"conclusion\"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Nanorods of interpenetrated 3D coordination polymer with thickness distribution of 200\u2013450\u00a0nm were synthesized by sonochemical process. Calcination of the nanorods at 823\u00a0K result in formation agglomerated metallic silver. In order to preparation silver nanostructures two other techniques was used. Silver nanoparticles with the average diameter of 75\u00a0nm prepared from thermal decomposition oleic acid (OA). Probably we could conclude that silver nanoparticles are obtained from 2D or 3D coordination polymer with no argentophilic interactions as a chain, grid or network in the resulting structure.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec10\" sec-type=\"supplementary-material\"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>Complete bond lengths and angles, co-ordinates and displacement parameters have been deposited at Cambridge Crystallography Data Center.

Especially porous compounds like MOF-5 [1], MIL-53 [2] or HKUST-1 [3] have attracted attention due to their potential as heterogeneous catalysts or adsorbents for gases like hydrogen. Besides porosity, there are also attractive aspects of non-porous coordination polymers such as magnetic, luminescent, vaporochromism or conducting properties, to name a few [4-6]. Coordination polymers offer significant advantages over conventional molecular compounds due to very low solubility in conventional solvents and much higher thermal stability. They also have applications as sensors, organic light emitting diodes and full-colored LCD displays [7].Among the polymeric coinage d10 metal complexes, silver(I) coordination polymers have received much attention because silver(I) shows a tendency to form coordination polymers with unique metal-carbon [8-12] and metal-metal [13, 14] interactions. However, agostic (Ag\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5H-C) interactions are rare [15-17]. Over the past decade, several coordination polymeric networks of Ag+ have been synthesized and investigated. In contrast, examples of nano-scale structures of Ag+ coordination polymers are scarce [18-20]. Thus, their preparation is desirable in order to tailor their physical and chemical properties [21]. On the other hand, metallic silver has been extensively used in a variety of applications; e.g., catalysis, electronics, photonics, photography, biology and medical science, due to its unique properties. For example, silver has the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity and reflectivity of all metals [22]. It is also well known that Tl+ and Ag+ compounds are similar in structure and chemical properties [23]. As a continuation of our previous studies on supramolecular compounds of these metal centers [24-34] and to have a comparison between coordination modes of these metal centers with similar ligands, we wish to report a three-dimensional coordination polymer of Ag+ with a pyridine-4-carboxylate (py-4-c-) ligand. In addition to the synthesis and characterization of a three-dimensional Ag+ nano-coordination polymer (NCP) of pyridine-4-carboxylic acid (Hpy-4-c) by the sonochemical process [19, 20, 35, 36], silver nanoparticles were fabricated by thermal decomposition in oleic acid (OA) [37].ExperimentalMaterials and Physical TechniquesAll reagents for synthesis and analysis were commercially available and used as received. Double distilled water was used to prepare aqueous solutions. An ultrasonic bath (Tecna 6; 50-60 Hz and 0.138 KW) was used for ultrasonic irradiation. Melting points were measured on an Electrothermal 9100 apparatus and were uncorrected. Microanalyses were carried out using a Heraeus CHN-O-Rapid analyzer. IR spectra were recorded using Perkin-Elmer 597 and Nicolet 510P spectrophotometers. The thermal behavior was measured with a PL-STA 1500 apparatus between 35 and 600 \u00b0C in a static nitrogen atmosphere. Crystallographic measurements were made using a Bruker APEX area-detector diffractometer. The intensity data were collected using graphite monochromated Mo-K\u03b1 radiation (wavelength = 0.71073 \u00c5). The structure was solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques on F2. Structure solution and refinement were accomplished using SHELXL-97 program packages [38]. The molecular structure plot and simulated XRD powder pattern based on single crystal data were prepared using Mercury software [39]. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using a Philips X'pert diffractometer with monochromatized Cu-k\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 1.54056 \u00c5). The samples were characterized by a scanning electron microscope with gold coating.Synthesis of [Ag2(\u03bc2-py-4-c)2]n (1) and Preparation of Its Single CrystalsIn CH3CN (20 mL) pyridine-4-carboxylic acid (0.246 g, 2 mmol) was mixed and stirred with a solution of KOH (0.114 g, 2 mmol) in H2O (3 mL) to form a clear solution. Addition of AgNO3 (0.340 g, 2 mmol) in CH3CN (5 mL) produced a clear solution. The resulting solution was stirred for 2 h and then allowed to stand for several days in the dark at room temperature to evaporate the solvent and form crystals. Suitable brown crystals for single crystal X-ray analysis were washed with acetone and air dried, d.p. = 230 \u00b0C, Yield: 0.550 g (68% based on final product). IR (selected bands; in cm-1): 670s, 688s, 761s, 830w, 864w, 1028w, 1053w, 1144w, 1228s, 1282s, 1365vs, 1413s, 1546s, 1604s and 1729s. Anal. calcd.

The mixture was subjected to a power level of 0.138 KW for 1 h. To the prepared ligand (Kpy-4-c) solution in double distilled water (50 mL), a proper volume of aqueous AgNO3 solution (50 mL) was added drop-wise under ultrasonic irradiation. The precipitate was filtered, washed with double distilled water and then dried; Found (%): C, 35.82; H, 1.89; N, 7.02%). IR (selected bands; in cm-1): 671s, 686s, 763s, 830w, 865w, 1027w, 1055w, 1144w, 1229s, 1282s, 1365vs, 1414s, 1548s, 1601s and 1731s. To obtain silver nanostructures, compound 1 nanorods was calcinated at 823 K in a furnace and air atmosphere for 5 h.Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles by Thermal Decomposition in Oleic Acid as a SurfactantTo prepare silver nanoparticles in oleic acid (OA), compound 1 nanorods (406 mg, 1.0 mmol) was dispersed in OA (8 mL, 25 mmol) to form a homogenous emulsion. This solution was degassed for 15 min and then heated to 543 K for 1 h in an electric furnace. A black precipitate was formed. A small amount of toluene and a large excess of EtOH was added to the reaction solution. The metallic silver was separated by centrifugation and washed with EtOH.Results and DiscussionStructure DescriptionScheme 1 shows the reaction between silver(I) nitrate and pyridine-4-carboxylic acid (Hpy-4-c) by two different methods. The reaction between pyridine-4-carboxylic acid (Hpy-4-c) and silver(I) nitrate provided a crystalline material with the general formula [Ag2(\u03bc2-py-4-c)2]n (1). Structure determination of compound 1 by X-ray crystallography (Tables 1, 2) showed the complex to be a novel interpenetrated three-dimensional polymer (Fig. 1). Two types of silver atoms exist in compound 1; three-coordinate Ag1 atoms with disordered T-shape AgO2N coordination sphere and two-coordinate Ag2 atoms with linear AgN2 coordination sphere (Fig. 2, up and middle). The py-4-c- ligand acts as a \u03bc2-bridging ligand where one oxygen atom of carboxylate group and the pyridine nitrogen atom of this ligand coordinate to two silver atoms (Fig. 2, down). The structure was analyzed for close Ag\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O and Ag\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5H secondary interactions. It appears that Ag1 atoms in compound 1 have two close contacts with O1 and O2 oxygen atoms (Ag1-O1 = 3.148 and Ag1-O2 = 3.088 \u01fa) and Ag2 atoms have also two weak secondary interactions with O2 atoms (Ag2-O2 = 2.824 \u01fa). The closest Ag-O interaction in compound 1 are longer than the Ag-O distances in similar complexes (i.e., 2.248(4), 2.279(5), 2.408(2), 2.576(2) and 2.639(2) \u01fa) [40-43] and shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radius of Ag and O (3.24 \u01fa) (van der Waals radius of Ag and O are 1.72 and 1.52 \u00c5 respectively, see [44]). On the other hand it appears that the silver ions may be involved in Ag\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5H-C interactions between the silver atoms and the hydrogen atoms of the py-4-c- ligand (Fig. 2, up and middle). Ag1 with a Ag(1)-H(8) distance of 2.781 \u00c5 and Ag2 with two Ag(2)-H(4) distances of 2.749 \u00c5. The reported M\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5H distances for silver involved agostic interactions are 2.823, 2.706, 2.657, 2.776, 2.731 and 2.585 \u01fa [15-17]. Thus Ag2 atoms in compound 1 with linear AgN2 coordination sphere have four secondary interactions in the equatorial plane, finally forming approximately octahedral arrangement around AgI ion (Fig. 2, middle). Figure 3, up and down show the structure of compound 1 along the crystallographic b and c axis, respectively. As could be observed from these figures compound 1 has some vacant pores which may be initially thought that compound 1 is a porous coordination polymer, but more structural considerations indicate that these pores are occupied by other interpenetrating networks, result in a completely packed coordination polymer with no vacant sites.Figure 4a shows the simulated XRD pattern from single crystal X-ray data of the compound 1 and Fig. 4b shows the XRD pattern of a typical sample of [Ag2(\u03bc2-py-4-c)2]n (1) prepared by sonochemical process. Acceptable match, with slight difference in 2\u03b8, were observed between the simulated from single-crystal X-ray data pattern (Fig. 4a) and its from the experimental powder X-ray diffraction pattern for nanostructures obtained by sonochemical process (Fig. 4b). The results of XRD powder study indicate that the experimental data are in good agreement with the simulated XRD powder pattern based on single crystal data, hence the obtained compound is as a mono-phase. The morphology and size of the samples prepared by sonochemical process were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Figures 5, 6 and 7 indicate the original morphology of the nanorods prepared by sonochemical process. The corresponding particle size distribution histogram of these nanorods could be observed in Figs. 5, 6 and 7. As could be observed from these figures, when concentration increases from 0.05 M (Fig. 5) to 0.15 M (Fig. 7), smaller nanorods with the average diameter of 2.212 \u03bcm, 626 nm and 239 nm was formed. This phenomenon was also observed in our previous work [19]. This point could be concluded that the higher concentration of initial reagents results in higher primary seed generation in solution. The increasing of primary seed generation leads to lower thickness of the nanorods.Thermo gravimetric (TG) and differential thermal analyses (DTA) of compound 1 show that the crystalline sample is stable up to 230 \u00b0C (Fig. 8), at which temperature pyrolyze of compound 1 organic part starts up to 390 \u00b0C in one step with an exothermic effect at 352 \u00b0C and mass loss of 61.2% (calcd 60.1% for removal of py-4-c- ligand). Mass loss calculations of the end residue and XRD pattern of the final decomposition product (Fig. 4c), shows the formation of metallic silver.Figure 4c also attributed to the XRD pattern of the residue obtained from calcination of compound 1 nanorods at 823 K. The obtained pattern match with the standard pattern of cubic silver with the lattice parameters (a = 4.0862 \u00c5 and z = 4) which are close to the reported values (JCPDS card number 04-0783). SEM image (Fig. 9, up) of the residue obtained from calcination of compound 1 nanorods at 823 K shows that spongy metallic silver was formed. Thermal decomposition of compound 1 nanorods with 0.15 M concentration of initial reagent was done [37]. XRD pattern of the residue (Fig. 4c), shows that the resulting residue was cubic silver with the lattice parameters mentioned above. SEM image of the resulting residue shows the formation of silver nanoparticles with the diameter distribution of 50-95 nm and the average diameter of about 75 nm (Figs. 9, 10). A comparison between our previous works on silver(I) coordination polymers with this work shows that AgI coordination polymers have tendency to form AgI coordination polymer nanorods. For example one-dimensional AgI coordination polymer with triphenyl acetate [45], two-dimensional AgI coordination polymer with diphenyl acetate [20] or three-dimensional AgI coordination polymer with pyridine-4-carboxylate (this work), all form AgI coordination polymer nanorods. In this work, we obtained similar result from another 3D coordination polymer with no argentophilic interactions as a chain, grid or network in the compound 1 structure. As it could be observed from Fig. 1, silver atoms are separated from each other and surrounded with aromatic pyridine rings. These aromatic pyridine rings could be considered as a template to fabricate silver nanoparticles [46].ConclusionsNanorods of interpenetrated 3D coordination polymer with thickness distribution of 200-450 nm were synthesized by sonochemical process. Calcination of the nanorods at 823 K result in formation agglomerated metallic silver. In order to preparation silver nanostructures two other techniques was used. Silver nanoparticles with the average diameter of 75 nm prepared from thermal decomposition oleic acid (OA). Probably we could conclude that silver nanoparticles are obtained from 2D or 3D coordination polymer with no argentophilic interactions as a chain, grid or network in the resulting structure.Supplementary MaterialComplete bond lengths and angles, co-ordinates and displacement parameters have been deposited at Cambridge Crystallography Data Center.
