id=\"Sec1\"><title>Introduction</title><p>Non-molecular solids such as coordination polymers (CPs) and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been attracting considerable importance since Yaghi <italic>et al.</italic> reported the first family of MOFs with large porosity and high surface areas.[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR1\">1</xref>] Majority of CPs and MOFs are grown from solution either under ambient or solvothermal/hydrothermal condition. A significant structural feature of all these solids is the occurrence of extended metal-ligand interactions analogous to supramolecular synthons[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>] with varying dimensionality. Robson was the first one to recognize metal-ligand interaction as an effective tool to build multi-dimensional coordination polymers.[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>] Yaghi exploited the utility of coordination linkages such as metal-carboxylate and metal-nitrogen to construct porous 3-D MOF solids.[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR4\">4</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref>] In recent years, these zeolite-analogues turned out to be promising materials with greater flexibility and provisions to incorporate multiple functionality.[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>] In contrast to organic solids, crystallization of metal organic solids is quite complex and involves several competing reactions with different rates. To interpret a crystal synthesis, it is important to analyze the aggregation process leading to a crystal nucleus in terms of \u2018chemically reasonable molecular bricks\u2019 from a chemical soup.</p><p>Our group has developed a retrosynthetic approach to interpret the supramolecular aggregation during the crystallization of severawhile the other side can be extended to forml metal organic solids.[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>] We demonstrated its usefulness with many examples drawn from literature and crystals grown in our own group to construe the molecular events preceding crystallization by invoking possible \u2018chemical bricks\u2019 that eventually lead to the final condensed product from a solution. The present work is an attempt to investigate the structural landscape of the system Cu<sup>II</sup><italic>X</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> (X=SO<sub>4</sub> or Cl)\u2013ligand\u2013H<sub>2</sub>O with an objective to explore the role of the synthons\u2013Cu\u2013OSO<sub>3</sub>\u2013 or \u2013Cu\u2013Cl\u2013in engineering extended structural units of the type \u2013X-Cu\u2013X\u2013Cu\u2013. Further, we wanted to probe the competing nature of these with the desirable synthon \u2013L-Cu\u2013 which is responsible for the formation of CPs and MOFs. Our earlier analysis of several copper organic solids suggested that synthons of the type \u2013Cu\u2013OSO<sub>3</sub>\u2013 and\u2013Cu\u2013Cl\u2013 also compete with \u2013Cu\u2013L\u2013 (L-multidentate organic compound) in engineering non-molecular solids.[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR8\">8</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR9\">9</xref>] A CSD analysis showed 11 and 19 hits respectively for extended \u2013Cu\u2013OSO<sub>3</sub>\u2013 and \u2013Cu\u2013Cl\u2013 interactions in non-molecular copper organic solids.[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>] In this paper, we discuss our recent results on the crystallization of a few copper-based coordination solids grown on the basis of our rationale and describe its crystal structures providing molecular insights. The choice of sulphate and chloride anion is particularly significant as they can influence supramolecular assembly in two ways: either it directly coordinates with copper or may occur as counter anion.The organic ligands chosen were both non-bridging (pyrazole, imidazole and 1,10-phenanthroline) and bridging (glutamic acid). Our previous experiences showed that the use of ligands like 4,4<sup>\u2032</sup>-bipyridine or pyrazine favoured extended \u2013Cu\u2013L\u2013Cu\u2013 linkages resulting in coordination polymers. In a few cases, the bridging ligands compete with halide ions to form extended interactions.[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR11\">11</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR12\">12</xref>] In this paper, we discuss the structural chemistry of four new coordination solids including one chiral coordination polymer providing molecular insights.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec2\"><title>Experimental</title><sec id=\"Sec3\"><title>Synthesis</title><p>All the chemicals were bought and used without further purification. CuSO<sub>4</sub>.5H<sub>2</sub>O(0.375g, 1.5 mmol) was dissolved in17 mL of water and the organic ligand (1.5 mmol) was added to this aqueous solution while being stirred. The resultant solution was then transferred to Teflon-lined stainless steel digester and heated at 150<sup>\u2218</sup>C for 3 days. The contents were cooled to room temperature and allowed for crystallization at room temperature. For the synthesis of <bold>1</bold>, [Cu(1,10-<italic>phen</italic>)SO<sub>4</sub> (H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>],1,10-phenanthroline (0.270g, 1.5 mmol); for the synthesis of <bold>2</bold>, [{Cu(<italic>pz</italic>)<sub>4</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>}{Cu(<italic>pz</italic>)<sub>4</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)}]. H<sub>2</sub>O, pyrazole (0.102g, 1.5 mmol) and for the synthesis of <bold>3</bold>, [Cu(<italic>imi</italic>)<sub>4</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>], imidazole (0.102 g, 1.5 mmol) were used as organic ligands. Blue coloured single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction study were obtained in all the three cases.

Synthesis of <bold>5</bold>, [Cu(<italic>glu</italic>) Cl(H<sub>2</sub>O)] was carried by grinding as well as slow evaporation method. Here CuCl<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O (0.170 g, 1 mmol) was taken as copper source and glutamic acid (0.147 g, 1 mmol) was used as organic ligand. We employed D, L and DL glutamic acid in our synthesis. The reactants were ground in a mortar and pestle, dissolved in 10 mL water and kept for crystallization. Dark blue coloured single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction were obtained after 4-5 days. When we used D or L glutamic acid, crystallization yielded either right-handed or left-handed helices as confirmed by structural analysis. However, use of racemic DL acid resulted in spontaneous resolution leading to a mixture of right-handed and left-handed helices. Schemes <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Sch1\">1</xref> and <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Sch2\">2</xref> summarize the experimental condition for the growth of all solids reported in this study.\n</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec4\"><title>X-ray crystallography</title><p>X-ray diffraction study of a crystal mounted on a capillary was carried out on a BRUKER AXS SMART-APEX diffractometer with a CCD area detector (MoK<italic>\u03b1</italic>: 0.71073 \u00c5, monochromator: graphite).[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref>] Frames were collected at T = 293 K by <italic>\u03c9</italic>, <italic>\u03d5</italic> and 2 <italic>\ud835\udf03</italic>\u2013rotation at 10 s per frame with SAINT.[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>] The measured intensities were reduced to <italic>F</italic><sup>2</sup> and corrected for absorption with SADABS.[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>] Structure solution, refinement and data output were carried out with the SHELXTL program.[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>] Non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically.

H<sub>2</sub>O<bold>2</bold> and [Cu(<italic>imi</italic>)<sub>4</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>] <bold>3</bold> and one known solid [Cu(1, 10-<italic>phen</italic>)SO<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>] <bold>1</bold> (scheme <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Sch1\">1</xref>). An interesting feature of the three solids is the occurrence of extended copper\u2013sulphate interaction leading to 1-D chains. The chains, however pack differently depending on the nature of secondary non-covalent forces exhibited by the organic groups. The solid <bold>1</bold> is identical to the compound already reported in the literature except that our synthesis involves only reaction of copper source with the organic ligand.[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR17\">17</xref>] The previous report does not consider the extended interaction between copper and sulphate. In <bold>1</bold>, a strong H-bonding between a pair of water molecules coordinated with copper and the uncoordinated sulphate oxygens are responsible for almost linear metal\u2013ligand chain (figure\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig1\">1</xref>). This also facilitates <italic>\u03c0</italic>\u22ef<italic>\u03c0</italic> interactions between phenanthroline groups to form a sheet. C-H \u22efO interactions between the sheets result in a 3-D network for <bold>1</bold>. The solid <bold>2</bold> is an interesting example of how the system optimizes crystal packing. The major directing force is still an extended \u2013Cu\u2013OSO<sub>3</sub>\u2013Cu\u2013 interaction to form neutral 1-D chains (figure\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig2\">2</xref>). However, the presence of pyrazole groups on copper dictates a different assembly to stabilize the chains. A discrete zwitterionic complex, {Cu(<italic>pz</italic>)<sub>4</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)} enters the lattice to pack the chains efficiently through weak interactions (S-O \u22ef<italic>H</italic><sub>2</sub>O and <italic>\u03c0</italic>\u22ef<italic>\u03c0</italic>). In <bold>3</bold>, we employed imidazole, an isomer of pyrazole. The 1:4 copper complex with the azole unit is the same as in <bold>2</bold>. Nevertheless, the \u2013N\u2013H group in imidazole is favourable to H-bond with sulphate oxygens of adjacent neutral chains (figure\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig3\">3</xref>). In all the three cases, we obtained only the same solid even when we altered the ligand to metal ratio. We performed another crystallization reaction starting with copper nitrate rather than sulphate. The solid <bold>4</bold> is a molecular solid and favourable H-bonding interactions such as N-H \u22ef<italic>ONO</italic><sub>2</sub> and C-H \u22ef<italic>ONO</italic><sub>2</sub> dictate the aggregation of the discrete complex, {Cu(<italic>imi</italic>)<sub>4</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>}. The overall H-bonded assembly in <bold>4</bold> is shown in figure\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig4\">4</xref>. Lack of good quality crystals and probable disorder resulted in poor statistics for <bold>4</bold>. Reaction of copper nitrate with 1,10-phenanthroline and pyrazole did not yield any new metal organic solids. It appears that a favourable N-H \u22efO with imidazole unit is responsible for the isolation of <bold>3</bold>. Use of copper chloride resulted in known solids[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>] for pyrazole and imidazole, [Cu(<italic>pz</italic>)<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>] and [Cu(<italic>imi</italic>)<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>].\n</p><p>With an objective to crystallize new coordination polymers, we attempted reaction of copper sulphate and copper chloride with an amino acid, namely glutamic acid which is chiral and multidentate. One side of glutamic acid is ideal for chelation with copper while the other side can be extended to form a CP. Glutamic acid showed different crystallization behaviour when it was reacted with copper chloride and copper sulphate (scheme <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Sch2\">2</xref>). To start with, copper chloride and copper sulphate salts produced different pH when dissolved in aqueous solution. We did not alter pH of initial solution with any external source. In the case of copper chloride, initial pH was around 2 and crystallization led to a blue colour crystal, <bold>5</bold> after a few days. Single crystal X-ray analysis established the compound to be [Cu(<italic>glu</italic>)Cl(H<sub>2</sub>O)]. Interestingly, when we increased pH of the initial solution above 5 using dilute NaOH, morphologically different blue colour crystal <bold>6</bold> was obtained. Single crystal X-ray analysis confirmed the solid <bold>6</bold> to be [Cu(<italic>glu</italic>)(H<sub>2</sub>O)].H<sub>2</sub>O. The compound <bold>6</bold> was found to be exactly the same as the one reported earlier by Mizutani <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR19\">19</xref>] Whenever we used copper sulphate or copper nitrate as the source, we ended up obtaining only <bold>6</bold>. When we attempted a mechanochemical reaction between copper chloride and glutamic acid, we observed a few new peaks along with reactants; the peaks were later identified to belong to <bold>5</bold>. Both <bold>5</bold> and <bold>6</bold> are 1-D coordination polymers crystallizing in the same chiral space group, <italic>P</italic>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub> with an absolute structure parameter (Flack parameter) of \u223c0.00. Crystal structures of <bold>5</bold> and <bold>6</bold> showed a remarkable self assembly induced by the counter anion as well as the organic ligand (figure\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig5\">5</xref>). In <bold>5</bold>, two alternate helical chains are observed \u2013 one formed through extended \u2013Cu\u2013Cl\u2013Cu\u2013 and another through \u2013Cu\u2013 L\u2013Cu\u2013. A significant characteristic is that both chloride\n</p><p>and glutamate bridge adjacent copper ions forming two independent helical chains. Copper forms a chelate with N and a carboxylate oxygen while the other carboxylate oxygen is coordinated to a different copper thereby leading toa helical chain (figure\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig5\">5</xref>). The terminal carboxylic acid group of the amino acid stabilizes these sheets through a favourable H-bonding (figure\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig6\">6</xref>). In <bold>6</bold>, the crystal structure shows a different helical chain. In this reaction, the building block during aggregation is {Cu(<italic>glu</italic>)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>}<sup>+</sup> with no Cl attached to copper. To compensate for charge compensation, the complex becomes zwitterionic releasing the proton from the terminal carboxylic acid group. Formation of 1-D helical chain is still a favourable direction to assemble. However, the system opts for the free carboxylate group at the tail for favourable coordination with neighbouring complex.

A significant structural feature of all these solids is the occurrence of extended metal-ligand interactions analogous to supramolecular synthons[2] with varying dimensionality. Robson was the first one to recognize metal-ligand interaction as an effective tool to build multi-dimensional coordination polymers.[3] Yaghi exploited the utility of coordination linkages such as metal-carboxylate and metal-nitrogen to construct porous 3-D MOF solids.[4,5] In recent years, these zeolite-analogues turned out to be promising materials with greater flexibility and provisions to incorporate multiple functionality.[6] In contrast to organic solids, crystallization of metal organic solids is quite complex and involves several competing reactions with different rates. To interpret a crystal synthesis, it is important to analyze the aggregation process leading to a crystal nucleus in terms of \u2018chemically reasonable molecular bricks' from a chemical soup.Our group has developed a retrosynthetic approach to interpret the supramolecular aggregation during the crystallization of severawhile the other side can be extended to forml metal organic solids.[7-10] We demonstrated its usefulness with many examples drawn from literature and crystals grown in our own group to construe the molecular events preceding crystallization by invoking possible \u2018chemical bricks' that eventually lead to the final condensed product from a solution. The present work is an attempt to investigate the structural landscape of the system CuIIXn (X=SO4 or Cl)-ligand-H2O with an objective to explore the role of the synthons-Cu-OSO3- or -Cu-Cl-in engineering extended structural units of the type -X-Cu-X-Cu-. Further, we wanted to probe the competing nature of these with the desirable synthon -L-Cu- which is responsible for the formation of CPs and MOFs. Our earlier analysis of several copper organic solids suggested that synthons of the type -Cu-OSO3- and-Cu-Cl- also compete with -Cu-L- (L-multidentate organic compound) in engineering non-molecular solids.[8,9] A CSD analysis showed 11 and 19 hits respectively for extended -Cu-OSO3- and -Cu-Cl- interactions in non-molecular copper organic solids.[10] In this paper, we discuss our recent results on the crystallization of a few copper-based coordination solids grown on the basis of our rationale and describe its crystal structures providing molecular insights. The choice of sulphate and chloride anion is particularly significant as they can influence supramolecular assembly in two ways: either it directly coordinates with copper or may occur as counter anion.The organic ligands chosen were both non-bridging (pyrazole, imidazole and 1,10-phenanthroline) and bridging (glutamic acid). Our previous experiences showed that the use of ligands like 4,4'-bipyridine or pyrazine favoured extended -Cu-L-Cu- linkages resulting in coordination polymers. In a few cases, the bridging ligands compete with halide ions to form extended interactions.[11,12] In this paper, we discuss the structural chemistry of four new coordination solids including one chiral coordination polymer providing molecular insights.ExperimentalSynthesisAll the chemicals were bought and used without further purification. CuSO4.5H2O(0.375g, 1.5 mmol) was dissolved in17 mL of water and the organic ligand (1.5 mmol) was added to this aqueous solution while being stirred. The resultant solution was then transferred to Teflon-lined stainless steel digester and heated at 150\u2218C for 3 days. The contents were cooled to room temperature and allowed for crystallization at room temperature. For the synthesis of 1, [Cu(1,10-phen)SO4 (H2O)2],1,10-phenanthroline (0.270g, 1.5 mmol); for the synthesis of 2, [{Cu(pz)4SO4}{Cu(pz)4SO4(H2O)}]. H2O, pyrazole (0.102g, 1.5 mmol) and for the synthesis of 3, [Cu(imi)4SO4], imidazole (0.102 g, 1.5 mmol) were used as organic ligands. Blue coloured single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction study were obtained in all the three cases. For the synthesis of 4, [Cu(imi)4 (NO3)2], Cu(NO3)2. 3H2O (0.360 g, 1.5 mmol) was used as copper source and imidazole (0.102 g, 1.5 mmol) was used as organic ligand under similar conditions as for the synthesis of 1, 2 and 3. Synthesis of 5, [Cu(glu) Cl(H2O)] was carried by grinding as well as slow evaporation method. Here CuCl2.2H2O (0.170 g, 1 mmol) was taken as copper source and glutamic acid (0.147 g, 1 mmol) was used as organic ligand. We employed D, L and DL glutamic acid in our synthesis. The reactants were ground in a mortar and pestle, dissolved in 10 mL water and kept for crystallization. Dark blue coloured single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction were obtained after 4-5 days. When we used D or L glutamic acid, crystallization yielded either right-handed or left-handed helices as confirmed by structural analysis. However, use of racemic DL acid resulted in spontaneous resolution leading to a mixture of right-handed and left-handed helices. Schemes 1 and 2 summarize the experimental condition for the growth of all solids reported in this study. X-ray crystallographyX-ray diffraction study of a crystal mounted on a capillary was carried out on a BRUKER AXS SMART-APEX diffractometer with a CCD area detector (MoK\u03b1: 0.71073 \u00c5, monochromator: graphite).[13] Frames were collected at T = 293 K by \u03c9, \u03d5 and 2 \ud835\udf03-rotation at 10 s per frame with SAINT.[14] The measured intensities were reduced to F2 and corrected for absorption with SADABS.[14] Structure solution, refinement and data output were carried out with the SHELXTL program.[15] Non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were placed in geometrically calculated positions by using a riding model. Structures were drawn with DIAMOND program.[16] Crystal and refinement data of all new solids are summarized in table 1. Other physical measurementsTG analysis were carried out using Perkin-Elmer TGA7 and DTA7 system on well ground samples of 5 and 6 in flowing nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10\u2218C/min. While the solid 5 is unusually stable till 200\u2218C, 6 loses water molecule at around 95\u2218C (figure S1). PXRD showed the dehydrated products to be X-ray amorphous. Magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed with a SQUID magnetometer of Quantum Design Inc., USA. Diamagnetic corrections were estimated from Pascal's constants.Results and DiscussionCrystallization from a solution containing copper sulphate and organic ligand (1,10-phenanthroline, pyrazole and imidazole) yielded two new non-molecular solids, [{Cu(pz)4SO4}{Cu(pz)4SO4(H2O)}]. H2O2 and [Cu(imi)4SO4] 3 and one known solid [Cu(1, 10-phen)SO4(H2O)2] 1 (scheme 1). An interesting feature of the three solids is the occurrence of extended copper-sulphate interaction leading to 1-D chains. The chains, however pack differently depending on the nature of secondary non-covalent forces exhibited by the organic groups. The solid 1 is identical to the compound already reported in the literature except that our synthesis involves only reaction of copper source with the organic ligand.[17] The previous report does not consider the extended interaction between copper and sulphate. In 1, a strong H-bonding between a pair of water molecules coordinated with copper and the uncoordinated sulphate oxygens are responsible for almost linear metal-ligand chain (figure 1). This also facilitates \u03c0\u22ef\u03c0 interactions between phenanthroline groups to form a sheet. C-H \u22efO interactions between the sheets result in a 3-D network for 1. The solid 2 is an interesting example of how the system optimizes crystal packing. The major directing force is still an extended -Cu-OSO3-Cu- interaction to form neutral 1-D chains (figure 2). However, the presence of pyrazole groups on copper dictates a different assembly to stabilize the chains. A discrete zwitterionic complex, {Cu(pz)4SO4(H2O)} enters the lattice to pack the chains efficiently through weak interactions (S-O \u22efH2O and \u03c0\u22ef\u03c0). In 3, we employed imidazole, an isomer of pyrazole. The 1:4 copper complex with the azole unit is the same as in 2. Nevertheless, the -N-H group in imidazole is favourable to H-bond with sulphate oxygens of adjacent neutral chains (figure 3). In all the three cases, we obtained only the same solid even when we altered the ligand to metal ratio. We performed another crystallization reaction starting with copper nitrate rather than sulphate. The solid 4 is a molecular solid and favourable H-bonding interactions such as N-H \u22efONO2 and C-H \u22efONO2 dictate the aggregation of the discrete complex, {Cu(imi)4(NO3)2}. The overall H-bonded assembly in 4 is shown in figure 4. Lack of good quality crystals and probable disorder resulted in poor statistics for 4. Reaction of copper nitrate with 1,10-phenanthroline and pyrazole did not yield any new metal organic solids. It appears that a favourable N-H \u22efO with imidazole unit is responsible for the isolation of 3. Use of copper chloride resulted in known solids[18] for pyrazole and imidazole, [Cu(pz)4Cl2] and [Cu(imi)4Cl2]. With an objective to crystallize new coordination polymers, we attempted reaction of copper sulphate and copper chloride with an amino acid, namely glutamic acid which is chiral and multidentate. One side of glutamic acid is ideal for chelation with copper while the other side can be extended to form a CP. Glutamic acid showed different crystallization behaviour when it was reacted with copper chloride and copper sulphate (scheme 2). To start with, copper chloride and copper sulphate salts produced different pH when dissolved in aqueous solution. We did not alter pH of initial solution with any external source. In the case of copper chloride, initial pH was around 2 and crystallization led to a blue colour crystal, 5 after a few days. Single crystal X-ray analysis established the compound to be [Cu(glu)Cl(H2O)]. Interestingly, when we increased pH of the initial solution above 5 using dilute NaOH, morphologically different blue colour crystal 6 was obtained. Single crystal X-ray analysis confirmed the solid 6 to be [Cu(glu)(H2O)].H2O. The compound 6 was found to be exactly the same as the one reported earlier by Mizutani et al.[19] Whenever we used copper sulphate or copper nitrate as the source, we ended up obtaining only 6. When we attempted a mechanochemical reaction between copper chloride and glutamic acid, we observed a few new peaks along with reactants; the peaks were later identified to belong to 5. Both 5 and 6 are 1-D coordination polymers crystallizing in the same chiral space group, P212121 with an absolute structure parameter (Flack parameter) of ~0.00. Crystal structures of 5 and 6 showed a remarkable self assembly induced by the counter anion as well as the organic ligand (figure 5). In 5, two alternate helical chains are observed - one formed through extended -Cu-Cl-Cu- and another through -Cu- L-Cu-. A significant characteristic is that both chloride and glutamate bridge adjacent copper ions forming two independent helical chains. Copper forms a chelate with N and a carboxylate oxygen while the other carboxylate oxygen is coordinated to a different copper thereby leading toa helical chain (figure 5). The terminal carboxylic acid group of the amino acid stabilizes these sheets through a favourable H-bonding (figure 6). In 6, the crystal structure shows a different helical chain. In this reaction, the building block during aggregation is {Cu(glu)(H2O)4}+ with no Cl attached to copper. To compensate for charge compensation, the complex becomes zwitterionic releasing the proton from the terminal carboxylic acid group. Formation of 1-D helical chain is still a favourable direction to assemble. However, the system opts for the free carboxylate group at the tail for favourable coordination with neighbouring complex. To further strengthen the 1-D chains, a lattice water comes into play for efficient packing resulting in the overall composition for the solid 6 as [Cu(glu)(H2O)].H2O. The structural chemistry of the solids 5 and 6 clearly demonstrate how a combination of different forces, a strong metal-ligand interaction and a directional weak H-bonding dictate the outcome of a crystallization reaction (figures 7, 8 and 9).

The magnetic susceptibility data of 5 and 6 obey the Curie-Weiss law, \u03c7M = C/(T - \ud835\udf03) (C = 0.6730 emu mol-1 K, \ud835\udf03 = -10.80 K for 5, and C = 0.5776 emu mol-1 K, \ud835\udf03 = - 7.19 K for 6. The small Weiss constants in these complexes reveal the weak anti-ferromagnetic interactions.The magnetic moments calculated per copper(II) was found to be higher than the spin only value of 1.73 BM; this may be due to larger g values. A few coordination polymers show higher magnetic moments arising from g values greater than 2.0.[20] Detailed magnetic characterization on single crystals combined with ESR analysis and calculation is required to understand the origin of magnetic ordering in these compounds. It should be noted, a few non-molecular solids containing extended -Cu-Cl-Cu- chains seem to show interesting magnetic ordering: CuCl2 is multi-ferroic[21] and paratacamite, [Cu2Cl(OH)3] is ferrimagnetic below 2K.[22] ConclusionThe examples described in this paper illustrate the importance of analyzing intermolecular interactions responsible for the isolation of a crystal from mother liquor. Metal-X (X-halide, sulphate, etc.) interactions are competitive synthons to produce extended structures or non-molecular solids and can be judiciously exploited to obtain desirable CPs and MOFs. Retro synthetic analysis provides chemical insights into the operation of various intermolecular forces which assemble a particular crystal structure. Influence of pH and metal source and participation of innocent species present in the mother liquor including solvent molecules in the supramolecular assembly may become obvious once we identify the chemically reasonable building blocks.AcknowledgementsVineet Kumar acknowledges University Grants Commission (UGC) for a Research Fellowship.
