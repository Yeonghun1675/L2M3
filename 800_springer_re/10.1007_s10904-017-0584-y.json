In contrast to White\u2019s orthorhombic structure, which is comprised of rhomboid iodide-bridged dimers, Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub>Py<sub>4</sub>, our new tetragonal crystal structure in space group <italic>P</italic>4<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2 is disordered and can be interpreted as either iodide-bridged dimers or helical chains. To determine the structure type, variable temperature X-ray diffraction and luminescence measurements were carried out. The photoluminescence spectrum shows a distinct cluster-centered transition at high excitation energies which is consistent with the dimer structure. DFT and TD-DFT calculations were performed to explain the difference between the emission spectrum at high energies compared to low energies. Furthermore, correlation of the luminescence spectrum with the X-ray results as temperature is varied demonstrates that the cluster-centered luminescence band in Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub>Py<sub>4</sub> arises from close Cu\u22efCu distances which vary with temperature. A low temperature X-ray crystallographic redetermination of the cubane tetrameric Cu<sub>4</sub>I<sub>4</sub>Py<sub>4</sub> is also presented.

id=\"Sec1\" sec-type=\"introduction\"><title>Introduction</title><p>The copper(I) halide complexes of substituted pyridine ligands have been well studied both because of their rich structural diversity, and the fact many of these complexes exhibit intense photoluminescence. Thus, the cubane tetramer Cu<sub>4</sub>I<sub>4</sub>Py<sub>4</sub> (Py\u2009=\u2009pyridine, type I in Chart <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Str1\">1</xref>) shows six close Cu\u22efCu distances ranging between 2.619 and 2.721\u00a0\u00c5 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR1\">1</xref>], all of which are within the 2.8\u00a0\u00c5 van der Waals radius sum for copper [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>]. This complex shows interesting photoluminescence behavior. At 77\u00a0K, its spectrum is dominated by a high energy emission band located in the blue region. Computational work has shown that this band is associated with halide to ligand (Py) charge transfer (XLCT) behavior [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref>]. The band is not observed when an aliphatic amine, such as piperidine, is coordinated in place of Py. The high energy XLCT band observed in Cu<sub>4</sub>I<sub>4</sub>Py<sub>4</sub> is highly thermochromic, and its greatly reduced intensity at ambient temperature reveals a dominant low energy yellow emission. The non-thermochromic low energy emission band results from a combination of halide to metal charge transfer (XMCT) and intra-metal (d\u2192s,p) character. Since it is associated with the core Cu<sub><italic>n</italic></sub>I<sub><italic>n</italic></sub> cluster (<italic>n</italic>\u2009=\u20094), the band is referred to as cluster centered (CC). A second 1:1 CuI:Py complex is known and takes the form of an infinite stair step polymer, type II in Chart <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Str1\">1</xref> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>]. Interestingly, its previously reported emission spectrum shows a single broad feature at 450\u00a0nm [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>]. This non-thermochromic band is assigned to a mixed halide/metal-to-ligand charge transfer (XMLCT) transition. CC transitions appear to be absent in this case.</p><p></p><p>The 1:2 CuI:Py complex, <bold>1b</bold>, was first reported by White et al. in 1984 as an iodide-bridged dimer, Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub>Py<sub>4</sub>, rhomboid form, type III in Chart <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Str1\">1</xref> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>]. Compound <bold>1b</bold> was prepared by concentration of a solution of CuI in Py. Subsequently, Ford et al. replicated the synthesis, precipitating the product as a powder through the addition of hexane to the CuI/Py solution [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref>]. They further reported its emission spectrum as consisting of a broad non-thermochromic LE band centered at 502\u00a0nm, consistent with CC behavior. There was no evidence of an XLCT band. The <bold>1b</bold> dimer structure has not been re-determined since White\u2019s work. Importantly, White claimed that \u201c[c]rystals were badly twinned and attempts to obtain a monocrystalline specimen unsuccessful; eventually, data were measured by deconvolution of the diffraction pattern at high 2\u03b8 of a twinned specimen and the structure solved, showing the complex to be a dimer\u201d [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>].</p><p>As part of our studies on the highly emissive complexes of CuI, we have prepared crystals of the 1:2 complex of CuI:Py and determined their structure and photophysical behavior. Here we report a new polymorph of 1:2 CuI:Py, <bold>1a</bold>, distinct from White\u2019s polymorph, <bold>1b</bold>. It can be interpreted from the X-ray crystal structure as either a rhomboid dimer (type III) or as a Py-decorated, single-stranded iodide-bridged chain (type IV, see Chart <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Str1\">1</xref>). In order to determine the correct interpretation, we report temperature dependent structure determinations in conjunction with variable temperature photoluminescence results for <bold>1a</bold>, as well as computational results. Additionally, we report the first low temperature X-ray structure determination of Cu<sub>4</sub>I<sub>4</sub>Py<sub>4</sub>, <bold>2</bold>, and discuss behavior of the Cu<sub><italic>n</italic></sub>I<sub><italic>n</italic></sub> clusters with changing temperature.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec2\"><title>Experimental</title><sec id=\"Sec3\"><title>General</title><p>All reagents were purchased from Aldrich or Acros and were used as received. Pyridine was distilled before use. Atomic absorption copper analysis was carried out as previously described [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR8\">8</xref>]. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were conducted using a TA Instruments Q500 in the dynamic (variable temp.) mode with a maximum heating rate of 50\u2009\u00b0C/min to 500\u2009\u00b0C under 60\u00a0mL/min N<sub>2</sub> flow.

In contrast, slow diffusion of ether into the CuI/Py solution produces colorless block crystals identified as polymorph <bold>1a</bold>. Under 365\u00a0nm irradiation, the crystals show a moderately intense green luminescence emission. As has been reported [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref>], this 1:2 CuI:Py complex undergoes loss of Py over the course of several hours when left in open air, according to reaction (1).

Comparison of the theoretical powder patterns generated from the two structures showed no overlap (see Figure S1). Thus, the structures are polymorphs. Also surprisingly, we were unable to produce White\u2019s originally reported <bold>1b</bold> crystals. Multiple attempts at crystallization using solutions of CuI/Py according to White\u2019s published method yielded only the tetragonal polymorph. To determine whether <bold>1a</bold> was the major polymorph under the preparative conditions used, powder diffraction was carried out on a freshly crystallized sample. As shown in Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig1\">1</xref>, a very good match was seen between the experimental data and the calculated powder pattern for <bold>1a</bold>. Although traces of polymorph <bold>1b</bold> cannot be ruled out (see overlay Figure S2), it is clear that the vast majority of the sample consists of polymorph <bold>1a</bold>.</p><p></p><p>Crystals of the new polymorph, <bold>1a</bold>, like those of <bold>1b</bold>, showed a strong tendency toward twinning. In fact, twinning was apt to produce falsely-reduced symmetry. Solution of a twinned <bold>1a</bold> crystal in tetragonal space group <italic>P</italic>4<sub>1</sub> yielded a fairly good quality structure, showing Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub>Py<sub>4</sub> dimers. However, a rather high wR2 value of near 13% and the presence of four independent dimer molecules, suggested that this might not, in fact, be the true structure solution. Careful cutting of block crystals into thin plates yielded data that solved in tetragonal space group <italic>P</italic>4<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2. In this higher symmetry cell, the <italic>a-</italic> and <italic>b</italic>-axes are shortened by half and only a single crystallographically independent dimer unit is present. Additionally, the final wR2 refined to near 3%. Nevertheless, even this cut crystal still showed moderate racemic twinning.</p><p>The structure of <bold>1a</bold> showed very interesting positional disorder affecting all atoms. Disordered CuPy<sub>2</sub> fragments are related by 2<sub>1</sub> screw symmetry. Bi-positional disorder allows the resulting atom map to be interpreted according to two equally valid models: that of iodide-bridged dimers, Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub>Py<sub>4</sub>, or iodide-bridged chains (CuIPy<sub>2</sub>)<sub><italic>n</italic></sub>. The situation is illustrated in Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig2\">2</xref>, where it can be seen that replacing dimers with chains is a matter of which set of disordered CuPy<sub>2</sub> fragments is chosen. Of note is the fact that in the dimer solution, close Cu\u22efCu interactions are evident, see Tables\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"Tab2\">2</xref> and <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"Tab3\">3</xref>. No such interactions are seen in the chain solution, either within or between chains.</p><p></p><p>For <bold>1a</bold> the assignment of dimer versus chain structure for CuIPy<sub>2</sub> cannot be made on the basis of crystallographic data alone. Unfortunately, the high ligand lability of the Cu(I) complexes, as exhibited by the facile loss of Py from <bold>1a</bold>, precluded the use of mass spectrometry in determining oligomer size. The choice of dimers (type III in Chart <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Str1\">1</xref>) as the more likely bonding arrangement is supported by the prevalence of Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub>(XPy)<sub>4</sub> dimers in the literature for substituted pyridines (XPy) and the near absence of [CuI(XPy)<sub>2</sub>]<sub><italic>n</italic></sub> chains (type IV). A search of the Cambridge Crystallographic Database [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>] for pyridine-substituted CuI revealed roughly 50 rhomboid dimer-based structures [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR19\">19</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR29\">29</xref>]. In contrast, only a single chain structure, [(CuI)<sub>2</sub>(tetra-4-(4-pyridyl)phenylmethane)], has been identified [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR31\">31</xref>]. Moreover, in the latter case the chain structure was found to be a kinetic product, spontaneously and irreversibly rearranging to the more densely-packed dimer form. However, to confirm <bold>1a</bold> as a dimeric structure additional characterization was required.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec11\"><title>Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy Studies</title><p>We collected the diffuse reflectance spectrum (DRS) of <bold>1a</bold> and in Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig3\">3</xref> and S7 show the Fresnel transformed absorbance spectrum. The presence or absence of a CC transition should enable differentiation between the dimer or chain configurations. This is because CC bands are unique to cluster configurations and thus would strongly support a dimer assignment. Absorption spectra reveal a very broad and highly intense peak with a maximum at 335\u00a0nm, a lower intensity narrow shoulder at 262\u00a0nm, and another peak at 425\u00a0nm. Deconvolution of this spectrum allows for easier interpretation and assignment of these transitions. The broad peak at 335\u00a0nm is most likely a XMLCT transition, and would be observed for either the chain or the dimer configuration. The more interesting feature of the DRS absorption spectrum is the partially obscured shoulder at 262\u00a0nm. This low intensity and narrow peak is most reminiscent of a CC transition, which occurs at higher energies than those associated with MLCT transitions and has been previously reported for cubane <bold>2</bold>. Therefore, the absorbance spectrum offers the first piece of evidence of the type III dimer configuration. The remaining peak at 425\u00a0nm can thus be assigned to as a XLCT.</p><p></p></sec><sec id=\"Sec12\"><title>Luminescence Studies</title><p>Because of the ambiguity in the X-ray structural data, luminescence measurements were used to determine whether <bold>1a</bold> exists as a dimer (type III) or chain (type IV) configuration. We would expect to observe drastically different luminescence spectra and temperature dependence for these structures. Chain configurations would be expected to show a single XMLCT emission and excitation combination that does not undergo a shift in emission energy with temperature. In contrast, dimer configurations luminesce similarly to the well-known tetramer complex <bold>2</bold> due to the presence of individual metal-halide clusters (Figure S5), their spectra consisting of a high energy emission band and a low energy emission band at 78\u00a0K [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref>]. White and Ford have assigned these emission bands to a XLCT and a mixed XMCT CC transition, respectively. In these studies upon heating <bold>2</bold> to ambient temperature the high energy XLCT band is lost, while a blue shift of the low energy CC band occurred.</p><p>Luminescence measurements for <bold>1a</bold> (Figs.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig4\">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig5\">5</xref>) performed at 394\u00a0nm excitation and 78\u00a0K show a single broad emission peak at 500\u00a0nm. This prominent peak is reduced in intensity as the temperature is increased, but no wavelength shift is observed. Due to the lack of emission energy shift, we assign this transition as a XMLCT band [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR32\">32</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR34\">34</xref>]. Upon changing the excitation wavelength to 340\u00a0nm, distinctly different emission peaks are observed. The emission band at 500\u00a0nm remains unaltered; however, at 78\u00a0K two additional peaks at 435 and 607\u00a0nm are observed. The high energy band at 435\u00a0nm is observed only at temperatures below 103\u00a0K. The low energy band is present throughout the studied temperature range and undergoes a blue shift of 22, from 607 to 583\u00a0nm, upon warming the sample from 78 to 173\u00a0K. The energies and temperature dependence of these emission peaks are very similar to those reported for the well-known tetrameric complex <bold>2</bold> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref>]. Accordingly, we assign the high energy peak at 435\u00a0nm to a XLCT transition, while the low energy peak at 607\u00a0nm is assigned to a CC transition [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref>]. The presence of a CC band, which is only possible in a Cu<sub><italic>n</italic></sub>I<sub><italic>n</italic></sub> cluster, confirms that <bold>1a</bold> is configured as a dimer.</p><p></p><p></p></sec><sec id=\"Sec13\"><title>Computational Studies</title><p>We have performed DFT and TD-DFT calculations on a dimer model of <bold>1a</bold> to explore the assignments of the emission bands observed in the luminescence spectra. Our model is in good agreement with experimental data. Ground state geometry computational results for <bold>1a</bold> (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig6\">6</xref>), which are summarized in Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"Tab4\">4</xref>, show a partially distorted tetrahedral copper(I) center coordinated to two nitrogen atoms and two iodine atoms. The slight distortion of the tetrahedron is apparent in the reduced N\u2013Cu\u2013I angle of ~107\u00b0. Dimeric Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub> clusters form planar rhombic metal-halide centers with \u00b5<sub>2</sub>-bridging I atoms [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR19\">19</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR29\">29</xref>]. Calculated atom\u22efatom distances for the rhombic centers are in agreement with the experimental values (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig7\">7</xref>). The calculated Cu\u22efCu distance of 2.88\u00a0\u00c5 for the <bold>1a</bold> dimer is in good agreement with the experimental value, which ranges from 2.67 to 2.71\u00a0\u00c5 between 100 and 250\u00a0K (see Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"Tab3\">3</xref>). The structural accuracy of our dimer model is further supported by the agreement between the TFD-calculated and experimental infrared spectra (Figure S6).</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The TD-DFT-calculated absorption spectrum of <bold>1a</bold> is shown in Figure S7. Absorption calculations for the dimer are in good agreement with the experimental data. In this spectrum we observe a calculated broad high-intensity peak at 400\u00a0nm with a less prominent peak at 267\u00a0nm. Deconvolution of this spectrum results in three peaks at 264, 343, and 408\u00a0nm which are similar in energy to the deconvoluted experimental data. Molecular orbital calculations at each of these absorption energies were performed (Figure S8\u2013<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig10\">10</xref> and Table S2\u2013<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"Tab3\">3</xref>). Only excited states at corresponding absorption energies with an f-oscillation value &gt;0.01 are considered for MO calculations. These calculated states are at 400, 338, and 267\u00a0nm. For each of these energies, we calculated distinctly different MO transitions. At 400\u00a0nm we clearly see a predominant XLCT type transition with negligible MLCT contributions. These XLCT transition types account for 82.4% of the total contribution and confirm our XLCT assignment of this absorption peak. Upon increasing the energy to 338\u00a0nm, the MO contribution shifts to a dominant MLCT (71.0%) with the remaining contribution being both a XMLCT and XLCT transition (29.0%). This 71.0/29.0% split strongly supports our mixed XMLCT assignment of this peak. Finally, calculated MOs at 269\u00a0nm reveal a complex metal-halide MO rearrangement for all transitions. Specifically, MO calculation results predict that, upon excitation, electrons from the Cu 3d/I 5p atomic orbitals populate the Cu 4\u00a0s/3p AOs. Rearrangement of the Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub> cluster is defined as a CC transition and strongly supports this assignment of the band at 268\u00a0nm. In summary, we assign the absorption peaks at 400, 338, and 267\u00a0nm to XLCT, XMLCT, and CC transitions, respectively. Our peak assignments for <bold>1a</bold> agree with the previously-reported DFT and TD-DFT calculations for the cubane <bold>2</bold> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR35\">35</xref>]. The various XLCT, XMLCT, or CC absorption bands help explain the difference in emission spectra between 394 and 340\u00a0nm and show that emission energy is tunable by adjusting the excitation energy.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></sec><sec id=\"Sec14\"><title>Temperature Dependent Studies</title><p>In order to better understand the atomic interactions within the central cluster in <bold>1a</bold>, its X-ray structure was determined at 100, 150, 200, and 250\u00a0K, see Table S1. The dimeric structure of <bold>1a</bold>, determined at 100\u00a0K, is shown in Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig8\">8</xref>. Selected bond lengths and angles for the <bold>1a</bold> dimer structure determined at the four temperatures are given in Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"Tab3\">3</xref>. Comparison of these data to one another and to those of <bold>1b</bold> at ambient temperature is instructive. Bond lengths are typically expected to lengthen as temperature is increased. This is generally the case for <bold>1a</bold>. However, some interesting behavior is seen that can be attributed to flexing of the Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub> cluster core as the temperature changes. The Cu\u22efCu distance steadily lengthens with increasing temperature, increasing from 2.6686(9)\u00a0\u00c5 at 100\u00a0K to 2.7129(12)\u00a0\u00c5 at 250\u00a0K, while remaining within the van der Waals radius sum. However, I\u22efI separation shows no change within experimental precision between 100 (4.525(5)\u00a0\u00c5) and 150\u00a0K (4.530(5)\u00a0\u00c5), but above this temperature is seen to shorten greatly, decreasing to 4.479(5)\u00a0\u00c5 at 250\u00a0K. This trend is presumably shaped by two competing effects. The tendency of the I\u22efI distance to lengthen with increasing temperature is ultimately overcome by reshaping of the rhomboid ring as the Cu atoms move apart, see Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig9\">9</xref>. Accordingly, the Cu\u2013I\u2013Cu angle is seen to increase with temperature, while the I\u2013Cu\u2013I angle contracts. Comparing bond length data of polymorphs <bold>1a</bold> and <bold>1b</bold>, we see that the ambient temperature Cu\u22efCu in <bold>1b</bold> is nearly identical to that of <bold>1a</bold> at 100\u00a0K. Consistent with the ring flexing associated with a short Cu\u22efCu distance in <bold>1b</bold>, its I\u22efI is longer than that of <bold>1a</bold> seen at any temperature.</p><p>An X-ray structural determination of Cu<sub>4</sub>I<sub>4</sub>Py<sub>4</sub> (<bold>2</bold>) was carried out at 100\u00a0K, see Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig10\">10</xref>. In this case the new structural analysis was consistent with the previously reported ambient temperature determination [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR1\">1</xref>]. As is apparent from data in Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"Tab2\">2</xref>, Cu\u22efCu distances in <bold>2</bold> are seen to contract on average by 0.020\u00a0\u00c5 between 295 and 100\u00a0K. However, the I\u22efI distances remain nearly constant upon cooling, decreasing by only 0.005\u00a0\u00c5 on average. Once again, this is likely the result of bond lengthening being offset by ring flexure.</p><p>Based on the foregoing results, we are able to correlate the luminescence data to the X-ray structural data as a function of temperature. This is the first report that combines luminescence and X-ray structural data for the dimer as a function of temperature, allowing more detailed photophysical analysis of <bold>1a</bold>. Upon cooling from 250 to 100\u00a0K, the X-ray structural data reveal no change in the crystalline phase for <bold>1a</bold>. As described above, we see contraction of the Cu\u2013I\u2013Cu angle and expansion of the I\u2013Cu\u2013I angle, which results in shorter Cu\u22efCu distances at lower temperatures. This variation in Cu\u22efCu distance has been discussed as an important factor in determining the luminescence properties of Cu<sub><italic>n</italic></sub>I<sub><italic>n</italic></sub> cluster crystals [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR35\">35</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>]. This dependence becomes clear when comparing the Cu\u22efCu distance and low energy maximum emission peak wavelength over varying temperatures as seen in Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig11\">11</xref>. The linear change in Cu\u22efCu distance directly correlates with a linear shift of the emission energy and further supports the CC assignment of this peak.</p><p></p></sec></sec><sec id=\"Sec15\" sec-type=\"conclusion\"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have reported a new polymorph of the 1:2 CuI:pyridine complex, <bold>1a</bold>. The structure of <bold>1a</bold> has been assigned as an iodine-bridged dimer, Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub>Py<sub>4</sub>, rather than a chain, (CuIPy<sub>2</sub>)<sub><italic>n</italic></sub>. This assignment was based on spectroscopic evidence for Cu<sub><italic>n</italic></sub>I<sub><italic>n</italic></sub> cluster behavior and the prevalence of Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub> dimers in the literature. Excitation at high energies reveal a complex emission spectrum containing XLCT, XMLCT, and CC transitions. In conjunction with the DRS spectra, a DFT and TD-DFT analysis suggest this is the result of excitation of a CC absorption band. Comparison of <bold>1a</bold> to known dimer polymorph <bold>1b</bold> reveals a longer, albeit still formally bonding, Cu\u22efCu distance for the new polymorph. A combination of variable temperature crystallography and luminescence spectroscopy has clearly demonstrated the Cu\u22efCu distance dependence of emission energies for <bold>1a</bold>.

In contrast to White's orthorhombic structure, which is comprised of rhomboid iodide-bridged dimers, Cu2I2Py4, our new tetragonal crystal structure in space group P41212 is disordered and can be interpreted as either iodide-bridged dimers or helical chains. To determine the structure type, variable temperature X-ray diffraction and luminescence measurements were carried out. The photoluminescence spectrum shows a distinct cluster-centered transition at high excitation energies which is consistent with the dimer structure. DFT and TD-DFT calculations were performed to explain the difference between the emission spectrum at high energies compared to low energies. Furthermore, correlation of the luminescence spectrum with the X-ray results as temperature is varied demonstrates that the cluster-centered luminescence band in Cu2I2Py4 arises from close Cu\u22efCu distances which vary with temperature. A low temperature X-ray crystallographic redetermination of the cubane tetrameric Cu4I4Py4 is also presented. Both Cu2I2Py4 and Cu4I4Py4 structures show distortion of the CunIn core cluster at low temperature resulting in reduced Cu\u22efCu distances, but with I\u22efI distances roughly unchanged.KeywordsCopper(I) iodidePyridineDimerPolymorphLuminescenceX-ray crystal structureDensity functional theorypublisher-imprint-nameSpringervolume-issue-count6issue-article-count29issue-toc-levels0issue-pricelist-year2017issue-copyright-holderSpringer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Natureissue-copyright-year2017article-contains-esmYesarticle-numbering-styleContentOnlyarticle-registration-date-year2017article-registration-date-month5article-registration-date-day15article-toc-levels0toc-levels0volume-typeRegularjournal-productNonStandardArchiveJournalnumbering-styleContentOnlyarticle-grants-typeRegularmetadata-grantOpenAccessabstract-grantOpenAccessbodypdf-grantRestrictedbodyhtml-grantRestrictedbibliography-grantRestrictedesm-grantOpenAccessonline-firstfalsepdf-file-referenceBodyRef/PDF/10904_2017_Article_584.pdfoutput-mediumAllpdf-typeTypesettarget-typeOnlinePDFissue-online-date-year2017issue-online-date-month11issue-online-date-day18issue-print-date-year2017issue-print-date-month11issue-print-date-day18issue-typeSupplementarticle-typeOriginalPaperjournal-subject-primaryChemistryjournal-subject-secondaryInorganic Chemistryjournal-subject-secondaryOrganic Chemistryjournal-subject-secondaryPolymer Sciencesjournal-subject-collectionSC5open-accessfalseElectronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s10904-017-0584-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.IntroductionThe copper(I) halide complexes of substituted pyridine ligands have been well studied both because of their rich structural diversity, and the fact many of these complexes exhibit intense photoluminescence. Thus, the cubane tetramer Cu4I4Py4 (Py=pyridine, type I in Chart 1) shows six close Cu\u22efCu distances ranging between 2.619 and 2.721 \u00c5 [1], all of which are within the 2.8 \u00c5 van der Waals radius sum for copper [2]. This complex shows interesting photoluminescence behavior. At 77 K, its spectrum is dominated by a high energy emission band located in the blue region. Computational work has shown that this band is associated with halide to ligand (Py) charge transfer (XLCT) behavior [3-5]. The band is not observed when an aliphatic amine, such as piperidine, is coordinated in place of Py. The high energy XLCT band observed in Cu4I4Py4 is highly thermochromic, and its greatly reduced intensity at ambient temperature reveals a dominant low energy yellow emission. The non-thermochromic low energy emission band results from a combination of halide to metal charge transfer (XMCT) and intra-metal (d\u2192s,p) character. Since it is associated with the core CunIn cluster (n=4), the band is referred to as cluster centered (CC). A second 1:1 CuI:Py complex is known and takes the form of an infinite stair step polymer, type II in Chart 1 [6]. Interestingly, its previously reported emission spectrum shows a single broad feature at 450 nm [6]. This non-thermochromic band is assigned to a mixed halide/metal-to-ligand charge transfer (XMLCT) transition. CC transitions appear to be absent in this case.The 1:2 CuI:Py complex, 1b, was first reported by White et al. in 1984 as an iodide-bridged dimer, Cu2I2Py4, rhomboid form, type III in Chart 1 [7]. Compound 1b was prepared by concentration of a solution of CuI in Py. Subsequently, Ford et al. replicated the synthesis, precipitating the product as a powder through the addition of hexane to the CuI/Py solution [3-5]. They further reported its emission spectrum as consisting of a broad non-thermochromic LE band centered at 502 nm, consistent with CC behavior. There was no evidence of an XLCT band. The 1b dimer structure has not been re-determined since White's work. Importantly, White claimed that \"[c]rystals were badly twinned and attempts to obtain a monocrystalline specimen unsuccessful; eventually, data were measured by deconvolution of the diffraction pattern at high 2\u03b8 of a twinned specimen and the structure solved, showing the complex to be a dimer\" [7].As part of our studies on the highly emissive complexes of CuI, we have prepared crystals of the 1:2 complex of CuI:Py and determined their structure and photophysical behavior. Here we report a new polymorph of 1:2 CuI:Py, 1a, distinct from White's polymorph, 1b. It can be interpreted from the X-ray crystal structure as either a rhomboid dimer (type III) or as a Py-decorated, single-stranded iodide-bridged chain (type IV, see Chart 1). In order to determine the correct interpretation, we report temperature dependent structure determinations in conjunction with variable temperature photoluminescence results for 1a, as well as computational results. Additionally, we report the first low temperature X-ray structure determination of Cu4I4Py4, 2, and discuss behavior of the CunIn clusters with changing temperature.ExperimentalGeneralAll reagents were purchased from Aldrich or Acros and were used as received. Pyridine was distilled before use. Atomic absorption copper analysis was carried out as previously described [8]. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were conducted using a TA Instruments Q500 in the dynamic (variable temp.) mode with a maximum heating rate of 50\u00b0C/min to 500\u00b0C under 60 mL/min N2 flow. Steady-state photoluminescence spectra were recorded with a Model QuantaMaster-1046 photoluminescence spectrophotometer from Photon Technology International. The instrument is equipped with two excitation monochromators and a single emission monochromator with a 75 W xenon arc lamp. Low temperature steady-state photoluminescence measurements were achieved by using a Janis St-100 optical cryostat equipped with a Honeywell temperature controller. Liquid nitrogen was used as coolant.Synthesis and Crystallization[Cu2I2Py4], 1a:CuI (190 mg, 1.00 mmol) was dissolved in 1.5 mL Py. The yellow solution was filtered and layered with ethyl ether and allowed to crystallize. After 1 day, colorless block crystals had formed. Alternatively, a bulk powder was formed via careful dropwise addition of ether to the CuI/Py solution until powder started to form, and then continuing slow addition until no more solid appeared. The solids were handled only briefly in air, as they readily lost Py to form Cu4I4Py4 (2). Yield=303 mg (0.435 mmol, 86.9%). %Cu (AAS) 19.4 (calcd 18.1). TGA Calcd for \u00bd Cu4I4Py4: 77.1. Found: 77.1 (40-90\u00b0C). Calcd for CuI: 54.5. Found: 54.8 (90-150\u00b0C).[Cu4I4Py4], 2:CuI (190 mg, 1.00 mmol) was dissolved in 1.5 mL Py. The yellow solution was filtered and an excess of ethyl ether was added, immediately precipitating a white powder which was collected and washed with additional ether and dried under vacuum. (156 mg, 0.145 mmol, 57.8%). %Cu (AAS) 24.0 (calcd 23.4). TGA Calcd for CuI: 70.7. Found: 70.9 (90-140\u00b0C). X-ray quality crystals were grown by diffusion of ethyl ether into an acetone solution of the complex.X-ray CrystallographyCrystals were mounted on glass fibers and quickly transferred to the diffractometer with sample cold stream running. All measurements were made using graphite-monochromated Mo K\u03b1 radiation on a Bruker-AXS three-circle Apex DUO diffractometer, equipped with a SMART Apex II CCD detector. Initial space group determination was based on a matrix consisting of 36 frames. The data were reduced using SAINT+ [9], and empirical absorption correction applied using SADABS [10].Structures were solved using intrinsic phasing. Least-squares refinement for all structures was carried out on F2. The non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were located in the Fourier difference map and then allowed to refine isotropically. Structure solution was carried out using SHELXTL [11] and refinement was performed using the ShelXle program [12]. Details of the X-ray experiments and crystal data are summarized in Table 1 and S1. Selected bond lengths and bond angles are given in Tables 2 and 3. Crystallographic data for the structures reported herein have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre and allocated the deposition numbers CCDC 1529200-1529204. These data can be obtained free of charge from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif.Powder diffraction was carried out on the instrument described above using a Cu Im\u00b5s source. Samples were ground and prepared as mulls using Paratone N oil. Three 180 s frames were collected, covering 8-70\u00b0 2\u03b8. Frames were merged using the Apex III software and were further processed using Diffrac-EVA software [13]. Simulated powder patterns from single crystal determinations were generated using Mercury [14].DFT CalculationsDensity Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed for a Cu2I2Py4 dimer along with a single cubane Cu4I4Py4 using Gaussian 09 at the University of Maine supercomputing group. X-ray structural data were used as initial input. Ground state and excited state geometries were obtained using the LANL2DZ basis set with the hybrid density functional theory due to Becke's 3-parameter nonlocal exchange functional with the non-local correlation functional of Lee, Yang and Parr, B3LYP, for all atoms [15-17]. Molecular orbitals were also calculated using Gaussian 09. Optimized ground state structures were used for vertical energy calculations using the time dependent DFT (TD-DFT) method. Avogadro software (version 1.1.1) was used for molecular orbital visualization. Optimized ground state geometries were compared to X-ray structural data to validate our models. In addition, we have calculated the infrared spectrum and absorption spectra .Diffuse Reflectance SpectroscopyDiffuse reflectance UV-visible spectra were collected on solid samples at 298 K. The light source was a Mikropack DH-2000 deuterium and halogen light source coupled with an Ocean Optics USB4000 detector. Collected light was collected with a fiber optic cable. Spectra was referenced with PTFE. Data was processed using SpectraSuite 1.4.2_09.Infrared SpectroscopyInfrared spectra were collected on solid samples at 298 K using a Perkin Elmer FT-IR Spectrum Two equipped with a Universal Attenuated Total Reflectance accessory consisting of a ZnSe crystal with a 2 micron path length. The detector is a LiTaO3 MIR detector. Spectra were collected between 450 and 4000 cm-1 at a 2 cm-1 resolution.Results and DiscussionSyntheses and StructuresCopper(I) iodide readily dissolves in Py to form a yellow solution. From this solution either the ligand-rich phase CuIPy2 (1) or the metal-rich phase Cu4I4Py4 (2) can be precipitated through the addition of ethyl ether, depending on the experimental conditions. Rapid addition of ether produces 2 as a white solid having intense yellow luminescence under 365 nm irradiation. In contrast, slow diffusion of ether into the CuI/Py solution produces colorless block crystals identified as polymorph 1a. Under 365 nm irradiation, the crystals show a moderately intense green luminescence emission. As has been reported [3-5], this 1:2 CuI:Py complex undergoes loss of Py over the course of several hours when left in open air, according to reaction (1). The product after Py loss is the 1:1 compound Cu4I4Py4, 2.14CuIPy2s\u2192Cu4I4Py4s+4Pyg\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}     \\usepackage{amsmath}     \\usepackage{wasysym}     \\usepackage{amsfonts}     \\usepackage{amssymb}     \\usepackage{amsbsy}     \\usepackage{mathrsfs}     \\usepackage{upgreek}     \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}     \\begin{document}$${4 CuIP}{{y}_{2}}\\left( {s} \\right) \\to {C}{{u}_{4}}{{I}_{4}}{P}{{y}_{4}}\\left( {s} \\right){ }+{ 4 Py }\\left( {g} \\right)$$\\end{document}The surprising aspect of CuIPy2, as prepared in this way, is that the tetragonal X-ray crystal structure of 1a does not match White's reported orthorhombic crystal structure, 1b [7], see Table 1. Comparison of the theoretical powder patterns generated from the two structures showed no overlap (see Figure S1). Thus, the structures are polymorphs. Also surprisingly, we were unable to produce White's originally reported 1b crystals. Multiple attempts at crystallization using solutions of CuI/Py according to White's published method yielded only the tetragonal polymorph. To determine whether 1a was the major polymorph under the preparative conditions used, powder diffraction was carried out on a freshly crystallized sample. As shown in Fig. 1, a very good match was seen between the experimental data and the calculated powder pattern for 1a. Although traces of polymorph 1b cannot be ruled out (see overlay Figure S2), it is clear that the vast majority of the sample consists of polymorph 1a.Crystals of the new polymorph, 1a, like those of 1b, showed a strong tendency toward twinning. In fact, twinning was apt to produce falsely-reduced symmetry. Solution of a twinned 1a crystal in tetragonal space group P41 yielded a fairly good quality structure, showing Cu2I2Py4 dimers. However, a rather high wR2 value of near 13% and the presence of four independent dimer molecules, suggested that this might not, in fact, be the true structure solution. Careful cutting of block crystals into thin plates yielded data that solved in tetragonal space group P41212. In this higher symmetry cell, the a- and b-axes are shortened by half and only a single crystallographically independent dimer unit is present. Additionally, the final wR2 refined to near 3%. Nevertheless, even this cut crystal still showed moderate racemic twinning.The structure of 1a showed very interesting positional disorder affecting all atoms. Disordered CuPy2 fragments are related by 21 screw symmetry. Bi-positional disorder allows the resulting atom map to be interpreted according to two equally valid models: that of iodide-bridged dimers, Cu2I2Py4, or iodide-bridged chains (CuIPy2)n. The situation is illustrated in Fig. 2, where it can be seen that replacing dimers with chains is a matter of which set of disordered CuPy2 fragments is chosen. Of note is the fact that in the dimer solution, close Cu\u22efCu interactions are evident, see Tables 2 and 3. No such interactions are seen in the chain solution, either within or between chains.For 1a the assignment of dimer versus chain structure for CuIPy2 cannot be made on the basis of crystallographic data alone. Unfortunately, the high ligand lability of the Cu(I) complexes, as exhibited by the facile loss of Py from 1a, precluded the use of mass spectrometry in determining oligomer size. The choice of dimers (type III in Chart 1) as the more likely bonding arrangement is supported by the prevalence of Cu2I2(XPy)4 dimers in the literature for substituted pyridines (XPy) and the near absence of [CuI(XPy)2]n chains (type IV). A search of the Cambridge Crystallographic Database [18] for pyridine-substituted CuI revealed roughly 50 rhomboid dimer-based structures [7, 19-29]. In contrast, only a single chain structure, [(CuI)2(tetra-4-(4-pyridyl)phenylmethane)], has been identified [30, 31]. Moreover, in the latter case the chain structure was found to be a kinetic product, spontaneously and irreversibly rearranging to the more densely-packed dimer form. However, to confirm 1a as a dimeric structure additional characterization was required.Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy StudiesWe collected the diffuse reflectance spectrum (DRS) of 1a and in Fig. 3 and S7 show the Fresnel transformed absorbance spectrum. The presence or absence of a CC transition should enable differentiation between the dimer or chain configurations. This is because CC bands are unique to cluster configurations and thus would strongly support a dimer assignment. Absorption spectra reveal a very broad and highly intense peak with a maximum at 335 nm, a lower intensity narrow shoulder at 262 nm, and another peak at 425 nm. Deconvolution of this spectrum allows for easier interpretation and assignment of these transitions. The broad peak at 335 nm is most likely a XMLCT transition, and would be observed for either the chain or the dimer configuration. The more interesting feature of the DRS absorption spectrum is the partially obscured shoulder at 262 nm. This low intensity and narrow peak is most reminiscent of a CC transition, which occurs at higher energies than those associated with MLCT transitions and has been previously reported for cubane 2. Therefore, the absorbance spectrum offers the first piece of evidence of the type III dimer configuration. The remaining peak at 425 nm can thus be assigned to as a XLCT.Luminescence StudiesBecause of the ambiguity in the X-ray structural data, luminescence measurements were used to determine whether 1a exists as a dimer (type III) or chain (type IV) configuration. We would expect to observe drastically different luminescence spectra and temperature dependence for these structures. Chain configurations would be expected to show a single XMLCT emission and excitation combination that does not undergo a shift in emission energy with temperature. In contrast, dimer configurations luminesce similarly to the well-known tetramer complex 2 due to the presence of individual metal-halide clusters (Figure S5), their spectra consisting of a high energy emission band and a low energy emission band at 78 K [3-5]. White and Ford have assigned these emission bands to a XLCT and a mixed XMCT CC transition, respectively. In these studies upon heating 2 to ambient temperature the high energy XLCT band is lost, while a blue shift of the low energy CC band occurred.Luminescence measurements for 1a (Figs. 4, 5) performed at 394 nm excitation and 78 K show a single broad emission peak at 500 nm. This prominent peak is reduced in intensity as the temperature is increased, but no wavelength shift is observed. Due to the lack of emission energy shift, we assign this transition as a XMLCT band [32-34]. Upon changing the excitation wavelength to 340 nm, distinctly different emission peaks are observed. The emission band at 500 nm remains unaltered; however, at 78 K two additional peaks at 435 and 607 nm are observed. The high energy band at 435 nm is observed only at temperatures below 103 K. The low energy band is present throughout the studied temperature range and undergoes a blue shift of 22, from 607 to 583 nm, upon warming the sample from 78 to 173 K. The energies and temperature dependence of these emission peaks are very similar to those reported for the well-known tetrameric complex 2 [3-5]. Accordingly, we assign the high energy peak at 435 nm to a XLCT transition, while the low energy peak at 607 nm is assigned to a CC transition [3-5]. The presence of a CC band, which is only possible in a CunIn cluster, confirms that 1a is configured as a dimer.Computational StudiesWe have performed DFT and TD-DFT calculations on a dimer model of 1a to explore the assignments of the emission bands observed in the luminescence spectra. Our model is in good agreement with experimental data. Ground state geometry computational results for 1a (Fig. 6), which are summarized in Table 4, show a partially distorted tetrahedral copper(I) center coordinated to two nitrogen atoms and two iodine atoms. The slight distortion of the tetrahedron is apparent in the reduced N-Cu-I angle of ~107\u00b0. Dimeric Cu2I2 clusters form planar rhombic metal-halide centers with \u00b52-bridging I atoms [19-29]. Calculated atom\u22efatom distances for the rhombic centers are in agreement with the experimental values (Fig. 7). The calculated Cu\u22efCu distance of 2.88 \u00c5 for the 1a dimer is in good agreement with the experimental value, which ranges from 2.67 to 2.71 \u00c5 between 100 and 250 K (see Table 3). The structural accuracy of our dimer model is further supported by the agreement between the TFD-calculated and experimental infrared spectra (Figure S6).The TD-DFT-calculated absorption spectrum of 1a is shown in Figure S7. Absorption calculations for the dimer are in good agreement with the experimental data. In this spectrum we observe a calculated broad high-intensity peak at 400 nm with a less prominent peak at 267 nm. Deconvolution of this spectrum results in three peaks at 264, 343, and 408 nm which are similar in energy to the deconvoluted experimental data. Molecular orbital calculations at each of these absorption energies were performed (Figure S8-10 and Table S2-3). Only excited states at corresponding absorption energies with an f-oscillation value >0.01 are considered for MO calculations. These calculated states are at 400, 338, and 267 nm. For each of these energies, we calculated distinctly different MO transitions. At 400 nm we clearly see a predominant XLCT type transition with negligible MLCT contributions. These XLCT transition types account for 82.4% of the total contribution and confirm our XLCT assignment of this absorption peak. Upon increasing the energy to 338 nm, the MO contribution shifts to a dominant MLCT (71.0%) with the remaining contribution being both a XMLCT and XLCT transition (29.0%). This 71.0/29.0% split strongly supports our mixed XMLCT assignment of this peak. Finally, calculated MOs at 269 nm reveal a complex metal-halide MO rearrangement for all transitions. Specifically, MO calculation results predict that, upon excitation, electrons from the Cu 3d/I 5p atomic orbitals populate the Cu 4 s/3p AOs. Rearrangement of the Cu2I2 cluster is defined as a CC transition and strongly supports this assignment of the band at 268 nm. In summary, we assign the absorption peaks at 400, 338, and 267 nm to XLCT, XMLCT, and CC transitions, respectively. Our peak assignments for 1a agree with the previously-reported DFT and TD-DFT calculations for the cubane 2 [35]. The various XLCT, XMLCT, or CC absorption bands help explain the difference in emission spectra between 394 and 340 nm and show that emission energy is tunable by adjusting the excitation energy.Temperature Dependent StudiesIn order to better understand the atomic interactions within the central cluster in 1a, its X-ray structure was determined at 100, 150, 200, and 250 K, see Table S1. The dimeric structure of 1a, determined at 100 K, is shown in Fig. 8. Selected bond lengths and angles for the 1a dimer structure determined at the four temperatures are given in Table 3. Comparison of these data to one another and to those of 1b at ambient temperature is instructive. Bond lengths are typically expected to lengthen as temperature is increased. This is generally the case for 1a. However, some interesting behavior is seen that can be attributed to flexing of the Cu2I2 cluster core as the temperature changes. The Cu\u22efCu distance steadily lengthens with increasing temperature, increasing from 2.6686(9) \u00c5 at 100 K to 2.7129(12) \u00c5 at 250 K, while remaining within the van der Waals radius sum. However, I\u22efI separation shows no change within experimental precision between 100 (4.525(5) \u00c5) and 150 K (4.530(5) \u00c5), but above this temperature is seen to shorten greatly, decreasing to 4.479(5) \u00c5 at 250 K. This trend is presumably shaped by two competing effects. The tendency of the I\u22efI distance to lengthen with increasing temperature is ultimately overcome by reshaping of the rhomboid ring as the Cu atoms move apart, see Fig. 9. Accordingly, the Cu-I-Cu angle is seen to increase with temperature, while the I-Cu-I angle contracts. Comparing bond length data of polymorphs 1a and 1b, we see that the ambient temperature Cu\u22efCu in 1b is nearly identical to that of 1a at 100 K. Consistent with the ring flexing associated with a short Cu\u22efCu distance in 1b, its I\u22efI is longer than that of 1a seen at any temperature.An X-ray structural determination of Cu4I4Py4 (2) was carried out at 100 K, see Fig. 10. In this case the new structural analysis was consistent with the previously reported ambient temperature determination [1]. As is apparent from data in Table 2, Cu\u22efCu distances in 2 are seen to contract on average by 0.020 \u00c5 between 295 and 100 K. However, the I\u22efI distances remain nearly constant upon cooling, decreasing by only 0.005 \u00c5 on average. Once again, this is likely the result of bond lengthening being offset by ring flexure.Based on the foregoing results, we are able to correlate the luminescence data to the X-ray structural data as a function of temperature. This is the first report that combines luminescence and X-ray structural data for the dimer as a function of temperature, allowing more detailed photophysical analysis of 1a. Upon cooling from 250 to 100 K, the X-ray structural data reveal no change in the crystalline phase for 1a. As described above, we see contraction of the Cu-I-Cu angle and expansion of the I-Cu-I angle, which results in shorter Cu\u22efCu distances at lower temperatures. This variation in Cu\u22efCu distance has been discussed as an important factor in determining the luminescence properties of CunIn cluster crystals [35-39]. This dependence becomes clear when comparing the Cu\u22efCu distance and low energy maximum emission peak wavelength over varying temperatures as seen in Fig. 11. The linear change in Cu\u22efCu distance directly correlates with a linear shift of the emission energy and further supports the CC assignment of this peak.ConclusionsWe have reported a new polymorph of the 1:2 CuI:pyridine complex, 1a. The structure of 1a has been assigned as an iodine-bridged dimer, Cu2I2Py4, rather than a chain, (CuIPy2)n. This assignment was based on spectroscopic evidence for CunIn cluster behavior and the prevalence of Cu2I2 dimers in the literature. Excitation at high energies reveal a complex emission spectrum containing XLCT, XMLCT, and CC transitions. In conjunction with the DRS spectra, a DFT and TD-DFT analysis suggest this is the result of excitation of a CC absorption band. Comparison of 1a to known dimer polymorph 1b reveals a longer, albeit still formally bonding, Cu\u22efCu distance for the new polymorph. A combination of variable temperature crystallography and luminescence spectroscopy has clearly demonstrated the Cu\u22efCu distance dependence of emission energies for 1a. Results demonstrate that the luminescence bands in Cu2I2Py4 can be tuned as a function of temperature. A low-temperature X-ray structure of the cubane tetramer Cu4I4Py4, 2, has also been reported and shows contraction of the Cu4I4 cluster.AcknowledgementsWe are indebted to NSF (CHE-0443345) and the College of William and Mary for the purchase of the X-ray equipment.References1.C.L.

For each of these energies, we calculated distinctly different MO transitions. At 400\u00a0nm we clearly see a predominant XLCT type transition with negligible MLCT contributions. These XLCT transition types account for 82.4% of the total contribution and confirm our XLCT assignment of this absorption peak. Upon increasing the energy to 338\u00a0nm, the MO contribution shifts to a dominant MLCT (71.0%) with the remaining contribution being both a XMLCT and XLCT transition (29.0%). This 71.0/29.0% split strongly supports our mixed XMLCT assignment of this peak. Finally, calculated MOs at 269\u00a0nm reveal a complex metal-halide MO rearrangement for all transitions.

Rearrangement of the Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub> cluster is defined as a CC transition and strongly supports this assignment of the band at 268\u00a0nm.
