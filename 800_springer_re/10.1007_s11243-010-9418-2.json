In these POM-based hybrids, POMs have been employed as inorganic ligands or non-coordinating templates to construct many kinds of fascinating structures [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR12\">12</xref>]. However, POMs-based compounds with interpenetrating structures are relatively limited [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>]. In particular, POMs acting as non-coordinating templates included in the cavities of two dimensional twofold interpenetrating frameworks are rarely reported [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>].</p><p>As is known, numerous known hybrid compounds suggest that the introduction of neutral N-containing organic ligands may lead to the formation of linear or layered structures or infinite high-dimensional frameworks. To the best of our knowledge, these neutral N-containing organic ligands used in the POM-based compounds are usually based on rigid organic ligands, such as bipyridine and triazole [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR17\">17</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>], or flexible organic ligands, such as bis(imidazole) and bis(triazole) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR22\">22</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR25\">25</xref>]. However, examples that employ semi-rigid neutral organic amine ligands [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR26\">26</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR27\">27</xref>] to construct POM-templated compounds have not been reported before. Therefore, it is still a great challenge to synthesize POM-templated twofold interpenetrating inorganic\u2013organic hybrid networks, especially with semi-rigid neutral organic amine ligands.</p><p>As an extension of our ongoing effort in the design of POM-templated inorganic\u2013organic hybrid compounds, here we select the semi-rigid ligand <bold>L</bold> [<bold>L</bold>\u00a0=\u00a0N, N\u2032-bis(4-pyridylformyl)piperazine] (Chart\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig6\">1</xref>) to get the target compound. Our ideas are based on the following considerations: (i) as a kind of multi-pyridine ligand with long spacer, <bold>L</bold> tends to coordinate with metal ions resulting in the formation of interpenetrating or entangled structures [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR28\">28</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR32\">32</xref>]; (ii) as a kind of semi-rigid ligand, <bold>L</bold> tends to form larger cavities, which can accommodate Keggin-type POM anions.

The compound <bold>1</bold> crystallizes in the tetragonal space group <italic>I</italic>4<italic>/m</italic> and the PW<sub>12</sub> anion lies on the lattice points of the <italic>I</italic> center cell. The bond valence sum calculations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR36\">36</xref>] suggest that one W (1) atom of PW<sub>12</sub> is in the +V oxidation state. The coordination environment of the Cu(II) atom is shown in Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig1\">1</xref>. Each Cu(II) atom is six-coordinated by four nitrogen atoms from four <bold>L</bold> ligands, and two oxygen atoms from two coordinated water molecules with Cu(1)\u2013N(1) bond distance of 2.009(18)\u00a0\u00c5, N(1)\u2013Cu(1)\u2013N(1A) angles of 87.7(10)\u2013180.0(7)\u00b0, and Cu(1)\u2013O(7) bond distance of 2.42(2)\u00a0\u00c5, N(1)\u2013Cu(1)\u2013O(7) and O(7)\u2013Cu(1)\u2013O(7A) angles of 89.8(7)\u201390.2(7)\u00b0, 180.0(2) \u00b0, respectively. In the polyanion PW<sub>12</sub>, the central P atom is surrounded by a cube of eight half-occupied oxygen atoms and represents a disordered tetrahedral arrangement [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR37\">37</xref>]. The distances of P\u2013O bonds are 1.56(3)\u00a0\u00c5. The W\u2013O distances can be grouped into three parts: W\u2013O<sub>a</sub> (center oxygen atom), 2.44(3)\u20132.46(3) \u00c5; W\u2013O<sub>b/c</sub> (bridge oxygen atom), 1.87(2)\u20131.92(2) \u00c5; W\u2013O<sub>t</sub> (terminal oxygen atom), 1.62(3)\u20131.72(2)\u00a0\u00c5, respectively. Each <bold>L</bold> acts as a bidentate linker, providing two N atoms to bridge two Cu(II) atoms. Each metal Cu(II) atom acting as a 4-connected node connects with four <bold>L</bold> ligands, leading to the formation of a rhombic 2D (4, 4) grid network with Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu distance ca. 15.998\u00a0\u00c5, as shown in Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig2\">2</xref>. The neighboring 2D (4, 4) grid sheets are parallel to each other, and the distance among the adjacent parallel 2D layers is 15.998\u00a0\u00c5, which is just the same as the distance of Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu in the 2D layer.</p><p>It is supposed that the Keggin PW<sub>12</sub> anions act as non-coordinating template during the assembly process so that the cationic coordination networks are aggregated around them. It is noteworthy that the 2D cationic coordination networks are stacked together in a perpendicular mode, resulting in the formation of 2D twofold interpenetrating networks with large cavities of approximately 15.998\u00a0\u00d7\u00a015.998\u00a0\u00c5 in compound <bold>1</bold> (Fig. S1). The diameter of the PW<sub>12</sub> anion (about 10.528\u00a0\u00c5) fits the cubic cavity well, and the template anion completely fills the cubic cavity (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig3\">3</xref> and Fig. S2). In addition, there exist two kinds of weak C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonding interactions in the structure (Table S2). One is from carbon atoms [C(3),C(7)] of <bold>L</bold> ligands and oxygen atoms [O(6),O(8)] of neighboring <bold>L</bold> ligands; the other is from carbon atoms [C(2)] of <bold>L</bold> ligands and oxygen atoms [O(2\u00a0W),O(5\u00a0W)] of the lattice water molecules. These hydrogen bonding interactions consolidate the structure of compound <bold>1</bold>.</p><p>The construction of the title compound with 2D interpenetrating network can be attributed to not only the coordination pattern of the Cu(II) center and the <bold>L</bold> ligand but also the template effect of PW<sub>12</sub> anion. Hou and co-workers [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR38\">38</xref>] used the same <bold>L</bold> ligand and various inorganic anions such as SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>, N<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>, I<sup>\u2212</sup>, SCN<sup>\u2212</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>, Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> to generate many new coordination polymers, which exhibited non-interpenetrating structures. Compared with the above anions, Keggin-type PW<sub>12</sub> polyanions show larger size (ca. 10.528\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010.528\u00a0\u00c5). Therefore, both the long semi-rigid <bold>L</bold> ligand and the PW<sub>12</sub> template play significant roles in constructing this unusual structure. To the best of our knowledge, the examples of POM-templated inorganic\u2013organic hybrid compound with 2D twofold interpenetrating cationic networks are very limited [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>].</p><p>The IR spectrum of compound <bold>1</bold> is shown in Fig. S3. The broad band at 3,343\u00a0cm<sup>\u22121</sup> can be attributed to the water molecules. The very strong peak at 1,624\u00a0cm<sup>\u22121</sup> is assigned to the \u2013CO\u2013 stretching vibration of <bold>L</bold>. The characteristic bands observed at 1,544, 1,471, 1,438 and 1,271\u00a0cm<sup>\u22121</sup> can be ascribed to C\u2013C and C\u2013N stretching vibrations of the piperazine-ring and pyridine-ring of <bold>L</bold> ligand. The presence of the expected characteristic bands at 950, 899, 815, 1,056\u00a0cm<sup>\u22121</sup> indicate the <italic>\u03bd</italic>(W\u2013O), <italic>\u03bd</italic>(W\u2013O\u2013W), <italic>\u03bd</italic>(P\u2013O) stretching of PW<sub>12</sub>, respectively.</p><p>Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) was performed to gauge the thermal stability of compound <bold>1</bold> as shown in Fig. S4, which exhibits two weight-loss stages. The first weight loss step between 55 and 280\u00a0\u00b0C is ascribed to the loss of coordinated water and lattice water molecules. The weight loss is about 8.8%, in correspondence with the calculated value of 7.9%. The second weight loss of 25.7% (calc. 25.9%) from 280 to 700\u00a0\u00b0C can be ascribed to the decomposition of organic ligand <bold>L</bold> and PW<sub>12</sub>.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec8\"><title>Voltammetric behavior of <bold>1</bold>-CPE</title><p>The electrochemical behavior of compound <bold>1</bold> bulk-modified carbon paste electrode (<bold>1</bold>-CPE) was investigated in 1\u00a0M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> aqueous solution, as shown in Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig4\">4</xref>. In the potential range of 0 to \u2212650\u00a0mV, two pairs of reversible redox peaks \u0399\u2013\u0399\u2032 and \u0399\u0399\u2013\u0399\u0399\u2032 appear, which can be attributed to the redox of PW<sub>12</sub> polyanions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>]. The mean peak potentials <italic>E</italic><sub>1/2</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0(<italic>E</italic><sub>pa</sub>\u00a0+\u00a0<italic>E</italic><sub>pc</sub>)/2 are approximately \u2212336 and \u2212550\u00a0mV (scan rate: 80\u00a0mVs<sup>\u22121</sup>), respectively. Redox peaks \u0399\u2013\u0399\u2032 and \u0399\u0399\u2013\u0399\u0399\u2032 correspond to two consecutive one-electron processes of W<sup>VI</sup>/W<sup>V</sup> atoms [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>]. The cyclic voltammetry behavior of <bold>1</bold>\u2013CPE at different scan rates was recorded, and the cathodic peak potentials gradually shifted to the negative direction and the corresponding anodic peak potentials shifted to the positive direction with increasing scan rates. The peak currents were proportional to the scan rates up to 450\u00a0mV\u00a0s<sup>\u22121</sup>, suggesting that the redox process is surface-controlled (Fig. S5).</p><p>The elaboration of sensors sensitive to nitrite is an important challenge for medical and environmental applications [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>]. As is well known, direct electroreduction of nitrite ion requires a large overpotential on most electrode surfaces, but the reduction can be catalyzed by the nitrite reductases and POMs [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR42\">42</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>]. In our experiment, we found that the <bold>1</bold>-CPE showed good electrocatalytic activity toward the reduction of nitrite. Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig5\">5</xref> shows cyclic voltammograms for the electrocatalytic reduction of nitrite at a bare CPE and <bold>1</bold>-CPE in 1\u00a0M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> aqueous solution. No obvious voltammetric response is observed at the bare CPE in the presence of nitrite in the potential range of 0 and \u2212650\u00a0mV. However, at the <bold>1</bold>-CPE, with the addition of nitrite, both reduction peak currents increase markedly while the corresponding oxidation peak currents decrease markedly, which indicates that the reduction of nitrite is mediated by the reduced species of PW<sub>12</sub> anions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id=\"Sec9\" sec-type=\"conclusion\"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, compound <bold>1</bold> represents a rarely reported 2D twofold interpenetrating network templated by Keggin-type PW<sub>12</sub> anions. In the structure of the compound <bold>1</bold>, the interlaced interpenetrating network shows a perpendicular mode, which leads to the formation of large cavities. Keggin-type PW<sub>12</sub> anions play an important template role in constructing the final 2D interpenetrating networks. The <bold>1</bold>-CPE displays good electrocatalytic activity toward the reduction of nitrite in 1\u00a0M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> aqueous solution, which suggests the practical application of the title compound in the field of electrocatalysis.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec10\" sec-type=\"supplementary-material\"><title>Supplementary materials</title><p>CCDC 773892 for compound <bold>1</bold> contains the supplementary crystallographic data that offers TG, IR, tables of selected bond lengths and angles and structural figures.

{[Cu2(L)4(H2O)4](PW11VIWVO40)}\u22c516H2O (1) constructed from PW11VIWVO404-, N,N'-bis(4-pyridylformyl) piperazine (L) and Cu(II) has been hydrothermally synthesized and structurally characterized by elemental analyses, IR and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that the semi-rigid piperazine-based ligands L coordinate to the Cu(II) atoms to constitute a two dimensional coordination network. The 2D (4, 4) cationic layers are stacked together in a perpendicular mode, resulting in the formation of twofold interpenetrating frameworks with large cavities. The PW12 anions reside in the large cubic-like cavities, serving as non-coordinating templates. The compound 1 displays good electrocatalytic activity toward the reduction of nitrite in 1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution.volume-issue-count8issue-article-count17issue-toc-levels0issue-pricelist-year2010issue-copyright-holderSpringer Science+Business Media B.V.issue-copyright-year2010article-contains-esmYesarticle-numbering-styleUnnumberedarticle-registration-date-year2010article-registration-date-month8article-registration-date-day26article-toc-levels0toc-levels0volume-typeRegularjournal-productNonStandardArchiveJournalnumbering-styleUnnumberedarticle-grants-typeRegularmetadata-grantOpenAccessabstract-grantOpenAccessbodypdf-grantRestrictedbodyhtml-grantRestrictedbibliography-grantRestrictedesm-grantOpenAccessonline-firstfalsepdf-file-referenceBodyRef/PDF/11243_2010_Article_9418.pdftarget-typeOnlinePDFissue-online-date-year2010issue-online-date-month10issue-online-date-day19issue-print-date-year2010issue-print-date-month10issue-print-date-day18issue-typeRegulararticle-typeOriginalPaperjournal-subject-primaryChemistryjournal-subject-secondaryInorganic Chemistry journal-subject-secondaryPhysical Chemistry journal-subject-secondaryCatalysisopen-accessfalseElectronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s11243-010-9418-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.IntroductionPolyoxometalates (POMs)-based inorganic-organic hybrid compounds have attracted extensive attention and intense interest in recent years due to their structural diversity and potential applications as functional materials [1-5]. In these POM-based hybrids, POMs have been employed as inorganic ligands or non-coordinating templates to construct many kinds of fascinating structures [6-12]. However, POMs-based compounds with interpenetrating structures are relatively limited [13-15]. In particular, POMs acting as non-coordinating templates included in the cavities of two dimensional twofold interpenetrating frameworks are rarely reported [16].As is known, numerous known hybrid compounds suggest that the introduction of neutral N-containing organic ligands may lead to the formation of linear or layered structures or infinite high-dimensional frameworks. To the best of our knowledge, these neutral N-containing organic ligands used in the POM-based compounds are usually based on rigid organic ligands, such as bipyridine and triazole [17-21], or flexible organic ligands, such as bis(imidazole) and bis(triazole) [22-25]. However, examples that employ semi-rigid neutral organic amine ligands [26, 27] to construct POM-templated compounds have not been reported before. Therefore, it is still a great challenge to synthesize POM-templated twofold interpenetrating inorganic-organic hybrid networks, especially with semi-rigid neutral organic amine ligands.As an extension of our ongoing effort in the design of POM-templated inorganic-organic hybrid compounds, here we select the semi-rigid ligand L [L = N, N'-bis(4-pyridylformyl)piperazine] (Chart 1) to get the target compound. Our ideas are based on the following considerations: (i) as a kind of multi-pyridine ligand with long spacer, L tends to coordinate with metal ions resulting in the formation of interpenetrating or entangled structures [28-32]; (ii) as a kind of semi-rigid ligand, L tends to form larger cavities, which can accommodate Keggin-type POM anions. In this way, we successfully obtained a Keggin-type PW12O404--templated 2D twofold cross-interpenetrating compound {[Cu2(L)4(H2O)4](PW11VIWVO40)}\u22c516H2O (1). The unusual structure and electrochemical properties of compound 1 are reported in this paper.ExperimentalH3PW12O40\u22c524H2O was commercially available and used without further purification. The organic ligand L was synthesized according to the procedure described in the literature [33]. All other reagents and solvents were of reagent grade. Elemental analyses (C, H, and N) were carried out on a Perkin-Elmer 240C elemental analyzer. FT-IR spectra (KBr pellets) were obtained on a Magna FT-IR 560 spectrometer. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was recorded on a Pyris-Diamond TG/DAT instrument in flowing N2 with a heating rate of 10\u00b0C min-1. A CHI 440 electrochemical workstation connected to a Digital-586 personal computer was used for control of the electrochemical measurements and for data collection. A conventional three-electrode system was used with a SCE as reference electrode, a platinum wire as auxiliary electrode and the modified electrode as the working electrode, respectively.Synthesis of {[Cu2(L)4(H2O)4](PW11VIWVO40)}\u22c516H2O (1)A mixture of H3PW12O40\u22c524H2O (0.300 g, 0.09 mmol), Cu(NO3)2\u22c53H2O (0.080 g, 0.33 mmol), L (0.032 g, 0.11 mmol) and H2O (8 mL) was stirred for half an hour at room temperature. Then, the pH was adjusted to 6.8 with 1.0 mol L-1 NaOH. The mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 120\u00b0 C for 3 days. After slow cooling to room temperature, purple block crystals of 1 were obtained (yield: ca. 35% based on Cu). Elemental analysis (%) found for C64H104Cu2N16O68PW12: C 16.8, H 2.3, N 5.0%. Calcd: C 16.8, H 2.3, N 4.9%. IR (KBr, cm-1): 3,433(s), 1,624(s), 1,544(w), 1,471(m), 1,438(m), 1,265(m), 1,166(w), 1,101(m), 1,056(s), 1,006(m), 950(s), 877(s), 815(s), 732(m).X-ray crystallographic studyCrystallographic data for compound 1 was collected at 185 K with a Bruker APEX diffractometer with Mo K\u03b1 (\u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5) by \u03c9 scan mode. The structure was solved by direct methods using the SHELXS program of the SHELXTL package and refined by full-matrix least-squares methods with SHELXL [34, 35]. For compound 1, N(2), O(8), C(7), O(4 W) atoms and some disordered solvent molecules were refined disordered with the site occupancy factors refined using free variables. The L ligand was found to be disordered over three positions, N(2), O(8) and C(7), and was modeled with anisotropic displacement parameters and 61, 63 and 61% rate of occupancy, respectively. All the other non-hydrogen atoms except for some water molecules were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms of the L ligands were localized in their calculated positions and refined using a riding model.Crystal data for 1: {[Cu2(L)4(H2O)4](PW11VIWVO40)}\u22c516H2O, Mr = 4549.88, Tetragonal, space group I4/m, a = 18.9524(8) \u00c5, b = 18.9524(8) \u00c5, c = 17.4748(7) \u00c5, \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3 = 90\u00b0, V = 6276.8(5) \u00c53, Z = 2, Dc = 2.407, \u03bc = 11.385 mm-1, F(000) = 4,210.

Table S1 (Supporting Information) lists the data of selected bond distances and angles.Preparation of compound 1 bulk-modified carbon paste electrode (1-CPE)The 1-CPE was fabricated as follows: 0.5 g graphite powder and 0.032 g compound 1 were mixed and ground together by agate mortar and pestle for about half an hour, and then 0.20 mL paraffin oil was added and stirred with a glass rod. The homogenized mixture was used to pack 3 mm inner diameter glass tubes to a length of 0.8 cm. The electrical contact was established with the copper stick, and the surface of the 1-CPE was polished by weighing paper.Results and discussionDescription of crystal structure of compound 1Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that compound 1 consists of two Cu(II) atoms, four L ligands, one non-coordinating [PW11VIWVO40]4- (PW12) anion, four coordinated water molecules, and sixteen lattice water molecules. The compound 1 crystallizes in the tetragonal space group I4/m and the PW12 anion lies on the lattice points of the I center cell. The bond valence sum calculations [36] suggest that one W (1) atom of PW12 is in the +V oxidation state. The coordination environment of the Cu(II) atom is shown in Fig. 1. Each Cu(II) atom is six-coordinated by four nitrogen atoms from four L ligands, and two oxygen atoms from two coordinated water molecules with Cu(1)-N(1) bond distance of 2.009(18) \u00c5, N(1)-Cu(1)-N(1A) angles of 87.7(10)-180.0(7)\u00b0, and Cu(1)-O(7) bond distance of 2.42(2) \u00c5, N(1)-Cu(1)-O(7) and O(7)-Cu(1)-O(7A) angles of 89.8(7)-90.2(7)\u00b0, 180.0(2) \u00b0, respectively. In the polyanion PW12, the central P atom is surrounded by a cube of eight half-occupied oxygen atoms and represents a disordered tetrahedral arrangement [37]. The distances of P-O bonds are 1.56(3) \u00c5. The W-O distances can be grouped into three parts: W-Oa (center oxygen atom), 2.44(3)-2.46(3) \u00c5; W-Ob/c (bridge oxygen atom), 1.87(2)-1.92(2) \u00c5; W-Ot (terminal oxygen atom), 1.62(3)-1.72(2) \u00c5, respectively. Each L acts as a bidentate linker, providing two N atoms to bridge two Cu(II) atoms. Each metal Cu(II) atom acting as a 4-connected node connects with four L ligands, leading to the formation of a rhombic 2D (4, 4) grid network with Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu distance ca. 15.998 \u00c5, as shown in Fig. 2. The neighboring 2D (4, 4) grid sheets are parallel to each other, and the distance among the adjacent parallel 2D layers is 15.998 \u00c5, which is just the same as the distance of Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu in the 2D layer.It is supposed that the Keggin PW12 anions act as non-coordinating template during the assembly process so that the cationic coordination networks are aggregated around them. It is noteworthy that the 2D cationic coordination networks are stacked together in a perpendicular mode, resulting in the formation of 2D twofold interpenetrating networks with large cavities of approximately 15.998 \u00d7 15.998 \u00c5 in compound 1 (Fig. S1). The diameter of the PW12 anion (about 10.528 \u00c5) fits the cubic cavity well, and the template anion completely fills the cubic cavity (Fig. 3 and Fig. S2). In addition, there exist two kinds of weak C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bonding interactions in the structure (Table S2). One is from carbon atoms [C(3),C(7)] of L ligands and oxygen atoms [O(6),O(8)] of neighboring L ligands; the other is from carbon atoms [C(2)] of L ligands and oxygen atoms [O(2 W),O(5 W)] of the lattice water molecules. These hydrogen bonding interactions consolidate the structure of compound 1.The construction of the title compound with 2D interpenetrating network can be attributed to not only the coordination pattern of the Cu(II) center and the L ligand but also the template effect of PW12 anion. Hou and co-workers [38] used the same L ligand and various inorganic anions such as SO42-, N3-, I-, SCN-, NO3-, Cl- to generate many new coordination polymers, which exhibited non-interpenetrating structures. Compared with the above anions, Keggin-type PW12 polyanions show larger size (ca. 10.528 \u00d7 10.528 \u00c5). Therefore, both the long semi-rigid L ligand and the PW12 template play significant roles in constructing this unusual structure. To the best of our knowledge, the examples of POM-templated inorganic-organic hybrid compound with 2D twofold interpenetrating cationic networks are very limited [16].The IR spectrum of compound 1 is shown in Fig. S3. The broad band at 3,343 cm-1 can be attributed to the water molecules. The very strong peak at 1,624 cm-1 is assigned to the -CO- stretching vibration of L. The characteristic bands observed at 1,544, 1,471, 1,438 and 1,271 cm-1 can be ascribed to C-C and C-N stretching vibrations of the piperazine-ring and pyridine-ring of L ligand. The presence of the expected characteristic bands at 950, 899, 815, 1,056 cm-1 indicate the \u03bd(W-O), \u03bd(W-O-W), \u03bd(P-O) stretching of PW12, respectively.Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) was performed to gauge the thermal stability of compound 1 as shown in Fig. S4, which exhibits two weight-loss stages. The first weight loss step between 55 and 280 \u00b0C is ascribed to the loss of coordinated water and lattice water molecules. The weight loss is about 8.8%, in correspondence with the calculated value of 7.9%. The second weight loss of 25.7% (calc. 25.9%) from 280 to 700 \u00b0C can be ascribed to the decomposition of organic ligand L and PW12.Voltammetric behavior of 1-CPEThe electrochemical behavior of compound 1 bulk-modified carbon paste electrode (1-CPE) was investigated in 1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution, as shown in Fig. 4. In the potential range of 0 to -650 mV, two pairs of reversible redox peaks \u0399-\u0399' and \u0399\u0399-\u0399\u0399' appear, which can be attributed to the redox of PW12 polyanions [39]. The mean peak potentials E1/2 = (Epa + Epc)/2 are approximately -336 and -550 mV (scan rate: 80 mVs-1), respectively. Redox peaks \u0399-\u0399' and \u0399\u0399-\u0399\u0399' correspond to two consecutive one-electron processes of WVI/WV atoms [40]. The cyclic voltammetry behavior of 1-CPE at different scan rates was recorded, and the cathodic peak potentials gradually shifted to the negative direction and the corresponding anodic peak potentials shifted to the positive direction with increasing scan rates. The peak currents were proportional to the scan rates up to 450 mV s-1, suggesting that the redox process is surface-controlled (Fig. S5).The elaboration of sensors sensitive to nitrite is an important challenge for medical and environmental applications [41]. As is well known, direct electroreduction of nitrite ion requires a large overpotential on most electrode surfaces, but the reduction can be catalyzed by the nitrite reductases and POMs [42, 43]. In our experiment, we found that the 1-CPE showed good electrocatalytic activity toward the reduction of nitrite. Fig. 5 shows cyclic voltammograms for the electrocatalytic reduction of nitrite at a bare CPE and 1-CPE in 1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. No obvious voltammetric response is observed at the bare CPE in the presence of nitrite in the potential range of 0 and -650 mV. However, at the 1-CPE, with the addition of nitrite, both reduction peak currents increase markedly while the corresponding oxidation peak currents decrease markedly, which indicates that the reduction of nitrite is mediated by the reduced species of PW12 anions [40].ConclusionsIn summary, compound 1 represents a rarely reported 2D twofold interpenetrating network templated by Keggin-type PW12 anions. In the structure of the compound 1, the interlaced interpenetrating network shows a perpendicular mode, which leads to the formation of large cavities. Keggin-type PW12 anions play an important template role in constructing the final 2D interpenetrating networks. The 1-CPE displays good electrocatalytic activity toward the reduction of nitrite in 1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution, which suggests the practical application of the title compound in the field of electrocatalysis.Supplementary materialsCCDC 773892 for compound 1 contains the supplementary crystallographic data that offers TG, IR, tables of selected bond lengths and angles and structural figures.

The peak currents were proportional to the scan rates up to 450 mV s-1, suggesting that the redox process is surface-controlled (Fig. S5).", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "chemical formula weight": [{"value": "756.9", "unit": "g/mol", "condition": ""}], "crystal system": [{"value": "tetragonal", "condition": ""}], "space group": [{"value": "Fm-3m", "condition": ""}], "lattice parameters": [{"value": {"a": "", "b": "", "c": "", "alpha": "", "beta": "", "gamma": ""}, "condition": ""}], "density": [{"value": "1.12", "unit": "g/cm3", "condition": ""}], "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "400", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "decomposition point", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "Compound 2", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "C36H42N6O4"}, "chemical formula weight": [{"value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}], "crystal system": [{"value": "monoclinic", "condition": ""}], "space group": [{"value": "P21/c", "condition": ""}], "lattice parameters": [{"value": {"a": "10.812", "b": "15.261", "c": "13.973", "alpha": "", "beta": "", "gamma": "", "condition": "T = 298(2) K"}}], "density": [{"value": "1.292", "unit": "g cm^\u22123", "condition": ""}], "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "", "unit": "", "type": "", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "Complex 4", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "chemical formula weight": [{"value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}], "crystal system": [{"value": "", "condition": ""}], "space group": [{"value": "", "condition": ""}], "lattice parameters": [{"value": {"a": "", "b": "", "c": "", "alpha": "", "beta": "", "gamma": "", "condition": ""}}], "density": [{"value": "2.407", "unit": "", "condition": ""}], "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "", "unit": "", "type": "", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "MOF-XYZ", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "chemical formula weight": [{"value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}], "crystal system": [{"value": "", "condition": ""}], "space group": [{"value": "", "condition": ""}], "lattice parameters": [{"value": {"a": "", "b": "", "c": "", "alpha": "", "beta": "", "gamma": "", "condition": ""}}], "density": [{"value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}], "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "120", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "an initial weight loss", "condition": ""}, {"value": "110 to 280", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "gradual removal of coordinated water molecules", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "1", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "[Cu2(L)4(H2O)4](PW11VIWVO40)\u00b716H2O"}, "chemical formula weight": [{"value": "4549.88", "unit": "", "condition": ""}], "crystal system": [{"value": "Tetragonal", "condition": ""}], "space group": [{"value": "I4/m", "condition": ""}], "lattice parameters": [{"value": {"a": "18.9524", "b": "18.9524", "c": "17.4748", "alpha": "90\u00b0", "beta": "90\u00b0", "gamma": "90\u00b0", "condition": ""}}], "density": [{"value": "2.407", "unit": "", "condition": ""}], "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "", "unit": "", "type": "", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "1", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "chemical formula weight": [{"value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}], "crystal system": [{"value": "", "condition": ""}], "space group": [{"value": "", "condition": ""}], "lattice parameters": [{"value": {"a": "", "b": "", "c": "", "alpha": "", "beta": "", "gamma": "", "condition": ""}}], "density": [{"value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}], "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "55 and 280", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "loss of coordinated water and lattice water molecules", "condition": ""}, {"value": "280 to 700", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "decomposition of organic ligand L and PW12", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["chemical_formula_weight", "crystal_system", "space_group", "lattice_parameters", "density", "decomposition_temperature"]}, {"idx": 12, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"Fig1\"><label>Fig.\u00a01</label><caption xml:lang=\"en\"><p>ORTEP drawing of compound <bold>1</bold> with thermal ellipsoids at 30% probability.
