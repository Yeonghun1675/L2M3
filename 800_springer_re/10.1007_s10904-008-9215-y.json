It also plays an important role in many chemical and biological systems [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR1\">1</xref>]. It is necessary to study the existent state and kinetic characteristics of water. In fact, water is the congeries of a great deal of water molecules that are connected to each other by hydrogen bonds. The key to understanding the behavior of water is the precise structural data of various hydrogen-bonded water networks. A water cluster is the simple model of water in bulk [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>]. Studying water clusters, therefore, may be the key to understanding the unusual properties of water and explaining many natural phenomena [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>].</p><p>The design and synthesis of novel water clusters with different topologies are of current interest. Thus far many water clusters have been reported, including zero-dimensional (0D) discrete water clusters [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR4\">4</xref>], one-dimensional (1D) water chains or tapes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref>], two-dimensional (2D) water layers [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>], and three-dimensional (3D) water networks [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>]. These water clusters not only provide significant insight into the investigation of bulk water, but also display fascinating architectures and topologies. Moreover, little attention has been paid to the structure of water clusters as host complexes. For example, interpenetrating networks have attracted great interest due to their exquisite architectures and potentially interesting properties [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR8\">8</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, interpenetrating networks constructed by water clusters and coordination polymer chains have not been reported. Herein, we report the first example of the vertical interpenetration of a 1D water column and a 1D coordination polymer chain, which exhibits a very interesting and potentially unique structure. Such a structure is observed in a new zinc phosphonate compound, i.e., Zn<sub>3</sub>(L<sub>1</sub>H)<sub>2</sub>(2,2\u2032-bipy)<sub>3</sub>\u00a0\u00b7\u00a018H<sub>2</sub>O (1).

In the reaction process, the precursor APhMDPH<sub>4</sub> undergoes in situ concentration and forms a new phosphonate ligand, L<sub>1</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. L<sub>1</sub>H<sub>4</sub> is a new chemical substances which can be described as the derivative of bicyclic [3.3.1]nonane.

In compound <bold>1</bold>, the L<sub>1</sub>H<sub>4</sub> molecule loses three protons and transfers one proton to the imino group to serve as L<sub>1</sub>H<sup>3\u2212</sup> ions. There are two kinds of Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions in an asymmetrical unit. Zn1 is five-coordinated and generates a distorted O<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub> trigonal bipyramid. In the {ZnO<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>} trigonal bipyramid, three oxygen atoms come from two different L<sub>1</sub>H<sup>3\u2212</sup> ions (one L<sub>1</sub>H<sup>3\u2212</sup> ion acts as a chelate ligand and the other L<sub>1</sub>H<sup>3\u2212</sup> ion serves as bridge), and two nitrogen atoms come from a 2,2-bipy ligand.

Thus, each {ZnO<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>} trigonal bipyramid is connected to the neighboring {ZnO<sub>4</sub>N<sub>2</sub>} octahedron by an L<sub>1</sub>H<sup>3\u2212</sup> ion to form a dimeric unit; and, the adjacent dimeric units are interconnected by bridged phosphonate groups thereby extending to a 1D [Zn<sub>3</sub>(L<sub>1</sub>H)<sub>2</sub>(2,2\u2032-bipy)<sub>3</sub>]<sub>n</sub> zigzag infinite chain (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig2\">2</xref>).</p><p>Concommittantly, the lattice water molecules are self-assembled to generate a huge water column (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig3\">3</xref>a). The repeating unit of the water column contains thirty-six water molecules. First, six water molecules (O1W, O2W, O6W, O7W, O8W, O9W) are joined together to form an (H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub> cluster with a motif of bicyclo[3.1.0]-hexane; i.e., a five-membered water ring and a three-membered water ring are joined together by sharing two water molecules. Then two neighboring (H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub> clusters are further self-assembled to form the (H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>14</sub> cluster via the bridging effect of water molecule O4W (O4W\u2013H2W4 O5W#10, 2.780(8) \u00c5; O4W\u2013H2W4 O7W#11, 2.68(2) \u00c5). The (H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>14</sub> cluster can be described as a distorted water cage in which the two-five-membered water rings are parallel and serve as top and bottom of the cage. The other four water molecules (two O5W and two O3W) are connected to the (H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>14</sub> cage via hydrogen bonds O1W\u2013H1W1 O4W#13 (2.729(8) \u00c5) and O7W\u2013H1W7 O(3W)#6 (2.87(2) \u00c5), respectively, forming a (H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>18</sub> water cage. Then symmetrical hydrogen bond O2W\u2013H1W2 O1W#7 (2.82(2) \u00c5) joins the two (H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>18</sub> water cages together with a 70.7(2)\u00b0 rotation, thereby generating the (H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>36</sub> repeating unit. Finally, neighboring repeating units interconnect via the hydrogen bond O2W\u2013H1W2 O1W#7 to form a 1D infinite column along the<italic> c</italic> axis. Such complex 1D water column has not been reported previously and displays a exquisite structure; i.e., the projection viewed along c axis can be described as a double axe (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig3\">3</xref>b). The hydrogen bond distances between the water molecules represent a considerable broad range; viz., the shortest is O8W\u2013H2W8 O7W (2.51(3) \u00c5), while the longest is O7W\u2013H2W7 O2W (3.24(3) \u00c5). The average O O distance of the 1D water column is 2.80 \u00c5, which is larger than that for Ic (2.75 \u00c5) and I<sub>h</sub> (2.759 \u00c5), but smaller than that for liquid water (2.85 \u00c5) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR11\">11</xref>].</p><p>The 1D water column and the [Zn<sub>3</sub>(L<sub>1</sub>H)<sub>2</sub>(2,2\u2032-bipy)<sub>3</sub>]<sub>n</sub> 1D chain (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig4\">4</xref>a) intersectant vertically. They are connected to each other by hydrogen bonds between water molecules O3W, O5W, O6W and phosphonate groups of L<sub>1</sub>H<sup>3\u2212</sup> anion (O3W\u2013H1W3 O10#12, 3.07(2) \u00c5; O5W\u2013H1W5 O(6)#9 2.810(4) \u00c5; O5W\u2013H2W5 O9#8, 3.016(4) \u00c5; O6W\u2013H1W6 O(6)#7, 2.800(5) \u00c5; O6W\u2013H1W6 O(8)#7, 3.294(6)). In addition, the 2,2\u2032-bipy rings of the adjacent 1D coordination polymer chains, which are alternately attached each other, exhibit very strong \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking interactions with a face-to-face distance of 3.285 \u00c5. The strong \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking interactions integrate the coordination polymer chains together, generating a large channel of ca. 11 \u00d7 7 \u01fa, which lets the 1D water column drill through (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig4\">4</xref>b). Therefore, a vertical interpenetrating network of 1D water column and 1D coordination polymer chain is formed. This structure is not only aesthetically interesting, but also may be significant in the design of new hydrated materials (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig4\">4</xref>c).</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec9\"><title>IR Spectra and TGA</title><p>Figure\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig5\">5</xref> shows the IR spectra of <bold>1</bold>.

Also observed are a series of strong peaks in the 1,258 \u2013 1,056 cm<sup>\u22121</sup> region, which is assigned to symmetrical and unsymmetrical vibrations of PO<sub>2</sub> group from the L<sub>1</sub>H<sup>3\u2212</sup> ions. The peaks occurring a near 923 cm<sup>\u22121</sup> are assigned to the P\u2013O\u2013P stretching vibrations of phosphonic anhydride group.</p><p>The TGA of <bold>1</bold> is given in Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig6\">6</xref>.

It also plays an important role in many chemical and biological systems [1]. It is necessary to study the existent state and kinetic characteristics of water. In fact, water is the congeries of a great deal of water molecules that are connected to each other by hydrogen bonds. The key to understanding the behavior of water is the precise structural data of various hydrogen-bonded water networks. A water cluster is the simple model of water in bulk [2]. Studying water clusters, therefore, may be the key to understanding the unusual properties of water and explaining many natural phenomena [3].The design and synthesis of novel water clusters with different topologies are of current interest. Thus far many water clusters have been reported, including zero-dimensional (0D) discrete water clusters [4], one-dimensional (1D) water chains or tapes [5], two-dimensional (2D) water layers [6], and three-dimensional (3D) water networks [7]. These water clusters not only provide significant insight into the investigation of bulk water, but also display fascinating architectures and topologies. Moreover, little attention has been paid to the structure of water clusters as host complexes. For example, interpenetrating networks have attracted great interest due to their exquisite architectures and potentially interesting properties [8]. However, to the best of our knowledge, interpenetrating networks constructed by water clusters and coordination polymer chains have not been reported. Herein, we report the first example of the vertical interpenetration of a 1D water column and a 1D coordination polymer chain, which exhibits a very interesting and potentially unique structure. Such a structure is observed in a new zinc phosphonate compound, i.e., Zn3(L1H)2(2,2'-bipy)3 \u22c5 18H2O (1). Compound 1 is obtained by a in situ hydrothermal reactions of 1-amino-1-phenylmethane-1,1-diphosphonic acid (APhMDPH4), ZnO and 2,2'-bipyridyl (2,2-bipy). In the reaction process, the precursor APhMDPH4 undergoes in situ concentration and forms a new phosphonate ligand, L1H4. L1H4 is a new chemical substances which can be described as the derivative of bicyclic [3.3.1]nonane. (Scheme 1).ExperimentalMaterials and MeasurementsThe 1-amino-1-phenylmethane-1,1-diphosphonic acid (APhMDPH4) was prepared as reported in reference [9]. ZnO was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. and 2,2-bipyridine was purchased from Alfa Aesar Chemical Reagent Co.; both materials were used without further purification. Elemental analysis (C, H, N) was obtained with a Perkin-Elmer 240B elemental analyzer. IR spectra were recorded as KBr pellets at a range 400-4,000 cm-1 on a Nicolet 5700 FT-IR spectrometer with a spectral resolution of 4.00 cm-1. Thermogravimetric (TGA) studies were carried out with a NETZSCH STA 449C at a heating rate 10 K/min in air.Low-Temperature, Low-Pressure Hydrothermal MethodSingle crystals of compounds 1 were obtained by a low-temperature, low-pressure hydrothermal method. In this method, we apply a small plastic centrifuge tube to replace the Teflon reactor, which is widely used in normal hydrothermal reaction. The reaction temperature is set at 80 \u00b0C so that we can prevent the vaporization of water by sealing with thread tape. In general, reactants will first deposit in the bottom of the tube. Single crystals of the final products then grow from these powders over several days. Crystal growth is observed throughout this period. This single crystal growth method is simple, inexpensive and convenient.Synthesis of Zn3(L1H)2(2,2'-bipy)3 \u22c5 18H2O (1)A mixture of APhMDPH4 (0.0667 g, 0.25 mmol), ZnO (0.0101 g, 0.125 mmol), 2,2'-bipy (0.0195 g, 0.125 mmol) and distilled water (1 mL) was sealed in a small centrifuge tube, heated and then preserved at 80 \u00b0C for 3 days. Colorless crystals of 1 for single crystal diffraction analysis were obtained. Yield: 88% (based on ZnO).

The structure was performed at 273 K using graphite monochromated Mo-K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 0.71073 \u01fa). The data were corrected for absorption using the SADABS program. The structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS-97 program [10]. Non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters by full-matrix least-squares calculations on F2 using SHELXL-97. Hydrogen atoms were directly obtained from Difference Fourier Maps and several DFIX commands were applied on hydrogen atoms. Drawings were produced using Diamond 3.0 and Mercury 1.4.1 software.

In compound 1, the L1H4 molecule loses three protons and transfers one proton to the imino group to serve as L1H3- ions. There are two kinds of Zn2+ ions in an asymmetrical unit. Zn1 is five-coordinated and generates a distorted O3N2 trigonal bipyramid. In the {ZnO3N2} trigonal bipyramid, three oxygen atoms come from two different L1H3- ions (one L1H3- ion acts as a chelate ligand and the other L1H3- ion serves as bridge), and two nitrogen atoms come from a 2,2-bipy ligand. Zn2 is octahedrally coordinated by a 2,2-bipy ligand and two chelate L1H3- ions. The bond lengths for Zn1 (Zn-O: 1.993(2)-2.023(2) \u00c5, Zn-N: 2.095(3)-2.100(3) \u00c5) and Zn2 (Zn-O: 2.073(2)-2.133(2) \u01fa, Zn-N: 2.160(2) \u01fa) are normal for five-coordinated and six-coordinated zinc ions, respectively.Each L1H3- ion acts as a pentadentate ligand, which chelates to two zinc ions and bridges with another zinc ion. Thus, each {ZnO3N2} trigonal bipyramid is connected to the neighboring {ZnO4N2} octahedron by an L1H3- ion to form a dimeric unit; and, the adjacent dimeric units are interconnected by bridged phosphonate groups thereby extending to a 1D [Zn3(L1H)2(2,2'-bipy)3]n zigzag infinite chain (Fig. 2).Concommittantly, the lattice water molecules are self-assembled to generate a huge water column (Fig. 3a). The repeating unit of the water column contains thirty-six water molecules. First, six water molecules (O1W, O2W, O6W, O7W, O8W, O9W) are joined together to form an (H2O)6 cluster with a motif of bicyclo[3.1.0]-hexane; i.e., a five-membered water ring and a three-membered water ring are joined together by sharing two water molecules. Then two neighboring (H2O)6 clusters are further self-assembled to form the (H2O)14 cluster via the bridging effect of water molecule O4W (O4W-H2W4 O5W#10, 2.780(8) \u00c5; O4W-H2W4 O7W#11, 2.68(2) \u00c5). The (H2O)14 cluster can be described as a distorted water cage in which the two-five-membered water rings are parallel and serve as top and bottom of the cage. The other four water molecules (two O5W and two O3W) are connected to the (H2O)14 cage via hydrogen bonds O1W-H1W1 O4W#13 (2.729(8) \u00c5) and O7W-H1W7 O(3W)#6 (2.87(2) \u00c5), respectively, forming a (H2O)18 water cage. Then symmetrical hydrogen bond O2W-H1W2 O1W#7 (2.82(2) \u00c5) joins the two (H2O)18 water cages together with a 70.7(2)\u00b0 rotation, thereby generating the (H2O)36 repeating unit. Finally, neighboring repeating units interconnect via the hydrogen bond O2W-H1W2 O1W#7 to form a 1D infinite column along the c axis. Such complex 1D water column has not been reported previously and displays a exquisite structure; i.e., the projection viewed along c axis can be described as a double axe (Fig. 3b). The hydrogen bond distances between the water molecules represent a considerable broad range; viz., the shortest is O8W-H2W8 O7W (2.51(3) \u00c5), while the longest is O7W-H2W7 O2W (3.24(3) \u00c5). The average O O distance of the 1D water column is 2.80 \u00c5, which is larger than that for Ic (2.75 \u00c5) and Ih (2.759 \u00c5), but smaller than that for liquid water (2.85 \u00c5) [11].The 1D water column and the [Zn3(L1H)2(2,2'-bipy)3]n 1D chain (Fig. 4a) intersectant vertically. They are connected to each other by hydrogen bonds between water molecules O3W, O5W, O6W and phosphonate groups of L1H3- anion (O3W-H1W3 O10#12, 3.07(2) \u00c5; O5W-H1W5 O(6)#9 2.810(4) \u00c5; O5W-H2W5 O9#8, 3.016(4) \u00c5; O6W-H1W6 O(6)#7, 2.800(5) \u00c5; O6W-H1W6 O(8)#7, 3.294(6)). In addition, the 2,2'-bipy rings of the adjacent 1D coordination polymer chains, which are alternately attached each other, exhibit very strong \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions with a face-to-face distance of 3.285 \u00c5. The strong \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions integrate the coordination polymer chains together, generating a large channel of ca. 11 \u00d7 7 \u01fa, which lets the 1D water column drill through (Fig. 4b). Therefore, a vertical interpenetrating network of 1D water column and 1D coordination polymer chain is formed. This structure is not only aesthetically interesting, but also may be significant in the design of new hydrated materials (Fig. 4c).IR Spectra and TGAFigure 5 shows the IR spectra of 1. The broad-strong peak centered at 3,411 cm-1 reveals the existence of water molecules. The corresponding H-O-H bending vibration band of the lattice free water molecules is located at 1,636 cm-1. Such peaks are absent when the 1 is heated at 200 \u00b0C and releases all of its water molecules. The peak corresponding to the N-H stretching vibration is located at 3,111 cm-1, and is initially concealed by the broad and strong water band. A series of characteristic peaks in the range 1,401-1,598 cm-1 are attributed to 2,2'-bipyridine and the phenyl group of the L1H3- ion. Also observed are a series of strong peaks in the 1,258 - 1,056 cm-1 region, which is assigned to symmetrical and unsymmetrical vibrations of PO2 group from the L1H3- ions. The peaks occurring a near 923 cm-1 are assigned to the P-O-P stretching vibrations of phosphonic anhydride group.The TGA of 1 is given in Fig. 6. Species 1 is unstable in air and loses eighteen lattice water molecules by 200 \u00b0C. The observed weight loss (14.78%) is slightly smaller than the calculated value (16.66%). The weight loss occurring between from 290 to 590 \u00b0C corresponds to the decomposition of the 2,2'-bipyridine ligands as well as the imine and phenyls groups in the L1H3- ions. The observed weight loss (41.09%) is close to the calculated value (41.59%). The residual material is stable to 800 \u00b0C. The final product at 1,100 \u00b0C is assumed to be Zn3P2O5 with an observed total weight loss of 82.62% (Calc. 82.07%).ConclusionsIn summary, we have synthesized and characterized a novel zinc phosphonate compound, i.e. Zn3(L1H)2(2,2'-bipy)3 \u22c5 18H2O (1), in which the phosphonate ligand, L1H4, is generated in an in situ concentration reaction. Species 1 is described as a unique vertical interpenetrating network of a 1D zigzag coordination polymer chain with a complex 1D water column. Current work is underway to design other novel interpenetrating architectures constructed by water clusters and coordination polymers and to investigate the properties and applications of these unique materials.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by grants of the National Nature Science Foundation of China (No. 20671074).
