ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR1\">1</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>]. They can be divided into various categories according to the external stimuli, specifically thermochromic [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR4\">4</xref>], photochromic [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref>], mechano-/piezochromic [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>] and electrochromic materials [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>]. Among these chromic materials, there is much current interest in photochromic materials owing to their possible applications in fields such as protection, decoration, displays, memory, switches, photography and sensors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR8\">8</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, the research in this domain has mainly concentrated on pure organic photochromic materials, such as spirooxazines, <italic>N</italic>-salicylidenes and Schiff bases, but there are rare examples of electron-transfer complexes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR11\">11</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref>].</p><p id=\"Par3\">The key to design and syntheses of such electron-transfer photochromic complexes is to choose suitable electron donors and acceptors. <italic>N,N</italic>\u2032-disubstituted 4,4\u2032-bipyridiniums (viologens) are an attractive class of electron acceptor molecules containing an electrically charged moiety within the conjugated system and have been adopted to prepare redox photochromic materials [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>]. Many groups have put most of their efforts into investigating the influence of the surroundings of bipyridinium derivatives on the photochromism, such as different substituents and coexisting guest species [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>]. Some zwitterionic viologen derivatives bearing carboxylate as a coordinating group have been used to construct coordination polymers, most of which contain a variety of secondary ligands as counterions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR19\">19</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR22\">22</xref>]. Recently, Gao\u2019s group have reported on coordination polymers based on a viologen ligand, which possess interesting magnetic and electrochemical properties [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>]. Considering that some flexible viologen-based di- and tetracarboxylic ligands have been used to synthesize coordination compounds [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR25\">25</xref>], the coordination chemistry of rigid viologen ligands is nevertheless still relatively unexplored. In this paper, we report the syntheses and crystal structures of two new coordination polymers, namely [Mn(L)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]<sub><italic>n</italic></sub> (<bold>1</bold>) and [Ni(L)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>\u00b714H<sub>2</sub>O]<sub><italic>n</italic></sub> (<bold>2</bold>), which are both photochromic electron-transfer complexes, derived from the rigid viologen-based tetracarboxylic ligand 1,1\u2032-bis(3,5-dicarboxyphenyl)-4,4\u2032-bipyridinium dichloride (H<sub>4</sub>L\u00b72Cl).</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec2\"><title>Experimental</title><sec id=\"Sec3\"><title>Materials and methods</title><p id=\"Par4\">All reagents and solvents for synthesis were commercially available and used directly without further purification. 1,1\u2032-Bis(3,5-dicarboxyphenyl)-4,4\u2032-bipyridinium dichloride (H<sub>4</sub>L\u00b72Cl) was synthesized according to the procedure reported in the literature [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>].

Diffraction data were collected on a Rigaku-AFC7 diffractometer equipped with a Rigaku Saturn CCD area-detector system. The measurements were made with graphite monochromatic Mo K<italic>\u03b1</italic> radiation (<italic>\u03bb</italic>\u00a0=\u00a00.71073 \u00c5) at 153\u00a0K under a cold nitrogen stream. The frame data were integrated and absorption corrections made using the Rigaku CrystalClear program package. All calculations were performed with the SHELXTL-97 program package, and structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least squares against <italic>F</italic><sup>2</sup>. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically, and hydrogen atoms of the organic ligands were generated theoretically onto the specific atoms. The hydrogen atoms of the water were located in the difference Fourier map and the position refined with the O\u2013H distance restrained to 0.85(1) \u00c5. For compound <bold>1</bold>, the diffraction data were treated by the \u201cSQUEEZE\u201d method as implemented in PLATON to remove diffuse electron density associated with badly disordered solvent molecules. Due to the mixed solvents that were used during the synthesis of compound <bold>1</bold>, the solvent content could not be precisely specified.

The asymmetric unit contains one Mn(II) center, one L ligand and two coordinated water ligands. It should be pointed out that several solvent molecules were detected, but most of them were largely disordered, and could not be located in the crystal structural refinement. Accordingly, all of the solvent contribution was subtracted from the data using SQUEEZE during the refinement [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR26\">26</xref>]. As shown in Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig1\">1</xref>a, the Mn(II) center is six-coordinated by two water ligands and four oxygen atoms from four independent L ligands in monodentate modes, giving a distorted octahedral geometry (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig1\">1</xref>a). The Mn\u2013O distances are 2.152(2)\u20132.223(19)\u00a0\u00c5, which are comparable with previously reported data [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR27\">27</xref>]. Meanwhile, each ligand L connects three Mn(II) centers through its three hydroxy groups, while each Mn(II) connects with four L ligands through O atoms. This gives rise to a 2D framework as shown in Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig1\">1</xref>b, which further stacks into a 3D supramolecular network through O\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonds (<italic>d</italic><sub>O\u2013O</sub>\u00a0=\u00a02.698\u00a0\u00c5) between the water ligands and uncoordinated carboxyl groups of the L ligands (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig1\">1</xref>c). In the 2D framework, pairs of Mn atoms are doubly bridged by two carboxyl groups from two L ligands to form a dinuclear unit with Mn\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Mn distance of 3.500\u00a0\u00c5.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec9\"><title>Crystal structure of compound <bold>2</bold></title><p id=\"Par9\">Compound <bold>2</bold> crystallizes in the monoclinic space group <italic>P</italic>2<sub>1</sub>/<italic>n</italic> and exhibits a 1D coordination network.

The next weight loss occurred (calc. 4.8%, obs. 4.6%) from 110 to 200\u00a0\u00b0C, which could be attributed to the loss of two coordinated water ligands. Above ca. 300\u00a0\u00b0C, compound <bold>1</bold> started to lose its ligand L as a result of thermal decomposition. In compound <bold>2</bold>, the loss of the free water molecules (calc. 28.9%, obs. 28.5%) occurred from 30 to 145\u00a0\u00b0C. The next process occurred at 145\u2013200\u00a0\u00b0C with a weight loss of 8.3% (calc. 8.5%), corresponding to loss of four coordinated water ligands. Then above ca. 300\u00a0\u00b0C, compound <bold>2</bold> started to decompose.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec11\"><title>Photochromic properties</title><p id=\"Par11\">Both compounds show color changes upon illumination with a 300\u00a0W Xe lamp (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig3\">3</xref>). The yellow samples of both compounds turn dark green or green after illumination. The green photoproducts are stable in air without any noticeable color change for two days, but the color slowly changes back to yellow upon prolonged standing in air. In addition, such decolored samples also display color changes after further irradiation, indicating reversible photochromism for both compounds. The UV\u2013Vis reflectance spectra were measured before and after illumination. The original spectra both show strong absorption bands below 400\u00a0nm, with rapidly decreased tailing in the visible light region, assigned to the n\u2013\u03c0* and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0* transitions of the conjugated aromatic carboxylate. The photoproducts of both compounds show new characteristic bands at 520 and 690\u00a0nm. These bands are similar to those observed for the bipyridinium radical [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR29\">29</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>], suggesting that the color change of may arise from the photoinduced generation of radicals in the ligand L. Their coloration tends to be saturated after illumination for 30\u00a0min, as the UV\u2013Vis spectra show no further change, indicating that the photochromic process has gone to completion.</p><p id=\"Par12\">To confirm the generation of the radicals, the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra of both compounds were measured before and after irradiation (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig4\">4</xref>). The ESR spectrum of the virgin sample <bold>1</bold> is broad, which is typical of a normal Mn(II) complex [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR31\">31</xref>]. However, a signal was observed at <italic>g</italic>\u00a0=\u00a02.0023, which is uncertain whether the signal has a contribution from residual radicals. After irradiation, the signal at <italic>g</italic>\u00a0=\u00a02.0023 is dramatically increased in intensity, confirming the formation of radicals (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig4\">4</xref>a). For compound <bold>2</bold>, no organic radical signals were detected before irradiation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR32\">32</xref>]; however, after light irradiation, a noticeable signal with a g value of 2.0042 was observed, suggesting the generation of viologen radicals (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig4\">4</xref>b). It is generally known that viologen derivatives are redox active and can generate radicals upon light irradiation. The PXRD and IR spectra of these compounds show no obvious changes during the photochromic process, suggesting that the crystal structure remains intact (Figure S1-S2 and S5-S6). Thus, the photochromic process may be attributed to photoinduced radical generation within the viologen ligand.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec12\"><title>Magnetic properties</title><p id=\"Par13\">Magnetic studies have been performed on powdered crystalline samples of both compounds before and after irradiation. The temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibilities of <bold>1\u20132</bold> were investigated in the range of 2\u2013300\u00a0K with a 1 kOe applied field (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig5\">5</xref>). The <italic>\u03c7</italic><sub>M</sub><italic>T</italic> of <bold>1</bold> at 300\u00a0K before irradiation is 4.11\u00a0cm<sup>3</sup>\u00a0K\u00a0mol<sup>\u22121</sup>, which is slightly lower than the value for one magnetically non-interacting Mn<sup>2+</sup> ion with <italic>S</italic>\u00a0=\u00a05/2 and <italic>g</italic>\u00a0=\u00a02 (<italic>\u03c7</italic><sub>M</sub><italic>T</italic>\u00a0=\u00a04.375\u00a0cm<sup>3</sup>\u00a0K\u00a0mol<sup>\u22121</sup>). With decreasing temperature, the <italic>\u03c7</italic><sub>M</sub><italic>T</italic> value increases and reaches 7.38\u00a0cm<sup>3</sup>\u00a0K\u00a0mol<sup>\u22121</sup> at 2.0\u00a0K. The temperature dependence of the reciprocal susceptibility in the temperature range 2-300\u00a0K is well fitted by the Curie\u2013Weiss law with <italic>C</italic>\u00a0=\u00a03.92\u00a0cm<sup>3</sup>\u00a0K\u00a0mol<sup>\u22121</sup> and <italic>\u03b8</italic>\u00a0=\u00a08.10\u00a0K (Figure S7), indicating ferromagnetic coupling between the Mn centers. After illumination with Xe light for 30\u00a0min, the <italic>\u03c7</italic><sub>M</sub><italic>T</italic> value at 300\u00a0K fell by 11.4%. This reduction is larger than that previously reported by Iversen et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR33\">33</xref>].</p><p id=\"Par14\">For compound 2, the value of <italic>\u03c7</italic><sub>M</sub><italic>T</italic> at 300\u00a0K is 1.37\u00a0cm<sup>3</sup>\u00a0K\u00a0mol<sup>\u22121</sup>, as expected for the spin-only value of one Ni<sup>2+</sup> with <italic>S</italic>\u00a0=\u00a01 and <italic>g</italic>\u00a0=\u00a02.31. As the temperature decreases, the <italic>\u03c7</italic><sub>M</sub><italic>T</italic> value remains almost constant down to about 50\u00a0K and then starts to increase rapidly, reaching 3.05\u00a0cm<sup>3</sup>\u00a0K\u00a0mol<sup>\u22121</sup> at 14\u00a0K, after which it drops abruptly to a minimum value of 1.28\u00a0cm<sup>3</sup>\u00a0K\u00a0mol<sup>\u22121</sup> at 2\u00a0K. The temperature dependence of the reciprocal susceptibilities obeys the Curie\u2013Weiss law above 5\u00a0K with C\u00a0=\u00a01.40\u00a0cm<sup>3</sup>\u00a0K\u00a0mol<sup>\u22121</sup> and <italic>\u03b8</italic>\u00a0=\u00a08.53\u00a0K (Figure S8), consistent with ferromagnetic coupling between the Ni<sup>2+</sup> centers. After illumination with Xe light for 30\u00a0min, the <italic>\u03c7</italic><sub>M</sub><italic>T</italic> value at 300\u00a0K fell by 10.5%. The observed decreases in <italic>\u03c7</italic><sub>M</sub><italic>T</italic> at 300\u00a0K for both compounds after illumination may be attributed to the strong interaction between the viologen radical and the metal ions (Mn<sup>2+</sup>/Ni<sup>2+</sup>). The magnetic behavior will require more detailed study in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec id=\"Sec13\" sec-type=\"conclusions\"><title>Conclusion</title><p id=\"Par15\">In conclusion, two new coordination polymers were solvothermally synthesized by using a rigid viologen-based ligand.

coordination polymers, [Mn(L)(H2O)2]n (1) and [Ni(L)\u22c514H2O]n (2), have been synthesized from a rigid viologen-based tetracarboxylic acid ligand, 1,1'-bis(3,5-dicarboxyphenyl)-4,4'-bipyridinium dichloride (H4L\u22c52Cl) and the Mn(II)/Ni(II) chlorides. The compounds have been characterized by infrared spectra, elemental analyses, single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction analyses and thermogravimetric analyses. Compound 1 has a 2D coordination network with uncoordinated carboxyl groups, which further stack into a 3D supramolecular structure by hydrogen-bonding interactions. Compound 2 shows a 3D supramolecular framework with 1D channels along the crystallographic b-axis, formed from zigzag chains through hydrogen-bonding interactions. Both compounds display prominent photochromic and photomagnetic behavior upon light irradiation, suggesting that they may be potential photomagnetic materials.publisher-imprint-nameSpringervolume-issue-count8issue-article-count11issue-toc-levels0issue-pricelist-year2017issue-copyright-holderSpringer International Publishing AGissue-copyright-year2017article-contains-esmYesarticle-numbering-styleUnnumberedarticle-registration-date-year2017article-registration-date-month6article-registration-date-day21article-toc-levels0toc-levels0volume-typeRegularjournal-productNonStandardArchiveJournalnumbering-styleUnnumberedarticle-grants-typeRegularmetadata-grantOpenAccessabstract-grantOpenAccessbodypdf-grantRestrictedbodyhtml-grantRestrictedbibliography-grantRestrictedesm-grantOpenAccessonline-firstfalsepdf-file-referenceBodyRef/PDF/11243_2017_Article_157.pdftarget-typeOnlinePDFissue-online-date-year2017issue-online-date-month8issue-online-date-day7issue-print-date-year2017issue-print-date-month8issue-print-date-day7issue-typeRegulararticle-typeOriginalPaperjournal-subject-primaryChemistryjournal-subject-secondaryCatalysisjournal-subject-secondaryPhysical Chemistryjournal-subject-secondaryInorganic Chemistryjournal-subject-secondaryOrganometallic Chemistryjournal-subject-collectionSC5open-accessfalseElectronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s11243-017-0157-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.IntroductionChromic materials have interesting potential applications in fields such as chemistry, physics, biology and materials science [1-3]. They can be divided into various categories according to the external stimuli, specifically thermochromic [4], photochromic [5], mechano-/piezochromic [6] and electrochromic materials [7]. Among these chromic materials, there is much current interest in photochromic materials owing to their possible applications in fields such as protection, decoration, displays, memory, switches, photography and sensors [8-10]. To the best of our knowledge, the research in this domain has mainly concentrated on pure organic photochromic materials, such as spirooxazines, N-salicylidenes and Schiff bases, but there are rare examples of electron-transfer complexes [11-13].The key to design and syntheses of such electron-transfer photochromic complexes is to choose suitable electron donors and acceptors. N,N'-disubstituted 4,4'-bipyridiniums (viologens) are an attractive class of electron acceptor molecules containing an electrically charged moiety within the conjugated system and have been adopted to prepare redox photochromic materials [14, 15]. Many groups have put most of their efforts into investigating the influence of the surroundings of bipyridinium derivatives on the photochromism, such as different substituents and coexisting guest species [16-18]. Some zwitterionic viologen derivatives bearing carboxylate as a coordinating group have been used to construct coordination polymers, most of which contain a variety of secondary ligands as counterions [19-22]. Recently, Gao's group have reported on coordination polymers based on a viologen ligand, which possess interesting magnetic and electrochemical properties [23, 24]. Considering that some flexible viologen-based di- and tetracarboxylic ligands have been used to synthesize coordination compounds [14, 25], the coordination chemistry of rigid viologen ligands is nevertheless still relatively unexplored. In this paper, we report the syntheses and crystal structures of two new coordination polymers, namely [Mn(L)(H2O)2]n (1) and [Ni(L)(H2O)4\u22c514H2O]n (2), which are both photochromic electron-transfer complexes, derived from the rigid viologen-based tetracarboxylic ligand 1,1'-bis(3,5-dicarboxyphenyl)-4,4'-bipyridinium dichloride (H4L\u22c52Cl).ExperimentalMaterials and methodsAll reagents and solvents for synthesis were commercially available and used directly without further purification. 1,1'-Bis(3,5-dicarboxyphenyl)-4,4'-bipyridinium dichloride (H4L\u22c52Cl) was synthesized according to the procedure reported in the literature [23]. IR spectra were recorded in the range 4000-400 cm-1 on a Perkin-Elmer FTIR spectrum 2000 spectrometer with pressed KBr pellets. Elemental analyses for C, H and N were measured on an Elementar Vario EL III microanalyzer. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were recorded with a Rigaku MiniFlex-II X-Ray diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 1.54178 \u00c5). TGA measurements were performed on a TG-209 system with a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min under an N2 atmosphere. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra were measured at room temperature on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda-950 UV-Vis spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere. Electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements were recorded on a Bruker A300 spectrometer operating in the X-band at room temperature. Magnetic susceptibility data were collected over the temperature range of 2-300 K in a magnetic field of 1000 Oe with an MPMS (SQUID)-XL magnetometer.Synthesis of compound 1[H4L]Cl2 (0.006 g, 0.01 mmol) and MnCl2\u22c54H2O (0.020 g, 0.10 mmol) were mixed in H2O/MeOH/EtOH (3:0.5:0.5 v/v 4 mL), and the mixture was stirred for 10 min. Then, dicyandiamide (0.168 g, 2 mmol) was added with stirring. The resulting suspension was kept at 100 \u00b0C for 72 h in a sealed glass bottle. The yellow crystals were separated by filtration, rinsed several times with H2O and dried in air. Yield: 68%. Anal. Calcd for C26H18MnN2O10: C, 54.41; N, 4.88; H, 3.14.

Dicyandiamide (0.168 g, 2 mmol) was then added with stirring. The resulting suspension was kept at 100 \u00b0C for 48 h in a sealed glass bottle. The light yellow crystals were filtered off, rinsed several times with H2O and dried in air. Yield: 73%. Anal. Calcd for C26H50N2NiO26: C, 36.05; N, 3.24; H, 5.78. Found, C, 36.23; N, 3.32; H, 5.65.

Diffraction data were collected on a Rigaku-AFC7 diffractometer equipped with a Rigaku Saturn CCD area-detector system. The measurements were made with graphite monochromatic Mo K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5) at 153 K under a cold nitrogen stream. The frame data were integrated and absorption corrections made using the Rigaku CrystalClear program package. All calculations were performed with the SHELXTL-97 program package, and structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least squares against F2. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically, and hydrogen atoms of the organic ligands were generated theoretically onto the specific atoms. The hydrogen atoms of the water were located in the difference Fourier map and the position refined with the O-H distance restrained to 0.85(1) \u00c5. For compound 1, the diffraction data were treated by the \"SQUEEZE\" method as implemented in PLATON to remove diffuse electron density associated with badly disordered solvent molecules. Due to the mixed solvents that were used during the synthesis of compound 1, the solvent content could not be precisely specified. Crystallographic data have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center as supplementary publication numbers CCDC 1539486 and 1539487 for 1 and 2, respectively. These data can be obtained free of charge from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif (Tables 1, 2).Results and discussionCrystal structure of compound 1Single-crystal X-ray structure analysis revealed that compound 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c and exhibits a 2D coordination network. The asymmetric unit contains one Mn(II) center, one L ligand and two coordinated water ligands. It should be pointed out that several solvent molecules were detected, but most of them were largely disordered, and could not be located in the crystal structural refinement. Accordingly, all of the solvent contribution was subtracted from the data using SQUEEZE during the refinement [26]. As shown in Fig. 1a, the Mn(II) center is six-coordinated by two water ligands and four oxygen atoms from four independent L ligands in monodentate modes, giving a distorted octahedral geometry (Fig. 1a). The Mn-O distances are 2.152(2)-2.223(19) \u00c5, which are comparable with previously reported data [27]. Meanwhile, each ligand L connects three Mn(II) centers through its three hydroxy groups, while each Mn(II) connects with four L ligands through O atoms. This gives rise to a 2D framework as shown in Fig. 1b, which further stacks into a 3D supramolecular network through O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bonds (dO-O = 2.698 \u00c5) between the water ligands and uncoordinated carboxyl groups of the L ligands (Fig. 1c). In the 2D framework, pairs of Mn atoms are doubly bridged by two carboxyl groups from two L ligands to form a dinuclear unit with Mn\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Mn distance of 3.500 \u00c5.Crystal structure of compound 2Compound 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/n and exhibits a 1D coordination network. The asymmetric unit contains one Ni(II) center, one L ligand, four coordinated water ligands and fourteen free water molecules. As shown in Fig. 2a, the Ni(II) center is six-coordinated by four water ligands plus two oxygen atoms from two independent L ligands in monodentate modes, giving a distorted octahedral geometry (Fig. 2a). The Ni-O distances are 2.026(4)-2.084(19) \u00c5, which are comparable with previously reported data [28]. In compound 2, the deprotonated L ligands bridge two Ni atoms, each of which is bridged by two L ligands, extending the structure into a zigzag chain (Fig. 2b). The neighboring two zigzag chains are interconnected through hydrogen bonds between the water ligands and uncoordinated carboxyl groups of the organic ligands (dO-O = 2.687-2.719 \u00c5), to generate a 2D supramolecular network (Fig. 2c). This is connected into three dimensions by another hydrogen bond interaction between the water ligands and uncoordinated carboxyl groups of the organic ligands (dO-O = 2.692 \u00c5, Fig. 2d). The 1D channels along the crystallographic b-axis are filled by free water molecules; the pore size is ca. 9.6 \u00d7 11.5 \u00c52 (Fig. 2d, taking into account of the van der Waals radii, measured as the largest and shortest distances between the diagonals of the parallelogram). The PLATON calculations show that the guest accessible volume (1710.2 \u00c53 per unit cell) comprises 42.7% of the unit cell volume [26].Thermogravimetric analysesThe thermogravimetric analyses were performed under an N2 atmosphere on crystalline samples of both compounds (Figure S3-S4). For compound 1, the first weight loss occurred at 50-110 \u00b0C, corresponding to loss of the free solvent molecules (calc. 12.8%, obs. 12.5%). The next weight loss occurred (calc. 4.8%, obs. 4.6%) from 110 to 200 \u00b0C, which could be attributed to the loss of two coordinated water ligands. Above ca. 300 \u00b0C, compound 1 started to lose its ligand L as a result of thermal decomposition. In compound 2, the loss of the free water molecules (calc. 28.9%, obs. 28.5%) occurred from 30 to 145 \u00b0C. The next process occurred at 145-200 \u00b0C with a weight loss of 8.3% (calc. 8.5%), corresponding to loss of four coordinated water ligands. Then above ca. 300 \u00b0C, compound 2 started to decompose.Photochromic propertiesBoth compounds show color changes upon illumination with a 300 W Xe lamp (Fig. 3). The yellow samples of both compounds turn dark green or green after illumination. The green photoproducts are stable in air without any noticeable color change for two days, but the color slowly changes back to yellow upon prolonged standing in air. In addition, such decolored samples also display color changes after further irradiation, indicating reversible photochromism for both compounds. The UV-Vis reflectance spectra were measured before and after illumination. The original spectra both show strong absorption bands below 400 nm, with rapidly decreased tailing in the visible light region, assigned to the n-\u03c0* and \u03c0-\u03c0* transitions of the conjugated aromatic carboxylate. The photoproducts of both compounds show new characteristic bands at 520 and 690 nm. These bands are similar to those observed for the bipyridinium radical [29, 30], suggesting that the color change of may arise from the photoinduced generation of radicals in the ligand L. Their coloration tends to be saturated after illumination for 30 min, as the UV-Vis spectra show no further change, indicating that the photochromic process has gone to completion.To confirm the generation of the radicals, the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra of both compounds were measured before and after irradiation (Fig. 4). The ESR spectrum of the virgin sample 1 is broad, which is typical of a normal Mn(II) complex [23, 31]. However, a signal was observed at g = 2.0023, which is uncertain whether the signal has a contribution from residual radicals. After irradiation, the signal at g = 2.0023 is dramatically increased in intensity, confirming the formation of radicals (Fig. 4a). For compound 2, no organic radical signals were detected before irradiation [32]; however, after light irradiation, a noticeable signal with a g value of 2.0042 was observed, suggesting the generation of viologen radicals (Fig. 4b). It is generally known that viologen derivatives are redox active and can generate radicals upon light irradiation. The PXRD and IR spectra of these compounds show no obvious changes during the photochromic process, suggesting that the crystal structure remains intact (Figure S1-S2 and S5-S6). Thus, the photochromic process may be attributed to photoinduced radical generation within the viologen ligand.Magnetic propertiesMagnetic studies have been performed on powdered crystalline samples of both compounds before and after irradiation. The temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibilities of 1-2 were investigated in the range of 2-300 K with a 1 kOe applied field (Fig. 5). The \u03c7MT of 1 at 300 K before irradiation is 4.11 cm3 K mol-1, which is slightly lower than the value for one magnetically non-interacting Mn2+ ion with S = 5/2 and g = 2 (\u03c7MT = 4.375 cm3 K mol-1). With decreasing temperature, the \u03c7MT value increases and reaches 7.38 cm3 K mol-1 at 2.0 K. The temperature dependence of the reciprocal susceptibility in the temperature range 2-300 K is well fitted by the Curie-Weiss law with C = 3.92 cm3 K mol-1 and \u03b8 = 8.10 K (Figure S7), indicating ferromagnetic coupling between the Mn centers. After illumination with Xe light for 30 min, the \u03c7MT value at 300 K fell by 11.4%. This reduction is larger than that previously reported by Iversen et al. [33].For compound 2, the value of \u03c7MT at 300 K is 1.37 cm3 K mol-1, as expected for the spin-only value of one Ni2+ with S = 1 and g = 2.31. As the temperature decreases, the \u03c7MT value remains almost constant down to about 50 K and then starts to increase rapidly, reaching 3.05 cm3 K mol-1 at 14 K, after which it drops abruptly to a minimum value of 1.28 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K. The temperature dependence of the reciprocal susceptibilities obeys the Curie-Weiss law above 5 K with C = 1.40 cm3 K mol-1 and \u03b8 = 8.53 K (Figure S8), consistent with ferromagnetic coupling between the Ni2+ centers. After illumination with Xe light for 30 min, the \u03c7MT value at 300 K fell by 10.5%. The observed decreases in \u03c7MT at 300 K for both compounds after illumination may be attributed to the strong interaction between the viologen radical and the metal ions (Mn2+/Ni2+). The magnetic behavior will require more detailed study in the future.ConclusionIn conclusion, two new coordination polymers were solvothermally synthesized by using a rigid viologen-based ligand. Both compounds display prominent photochromic and photomagnetic behavior upon light irradiation. Hence, this work demonstrates a new strategy for the design of molecular photomagnetic materials.AcknowledegmentsWe thank for the financial supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21261019), the Application Basis Research Project of Yunnan Province Science and Technology Department, and Shanghai key Laboratory of Rare Earth Functional Materials.References1.Bouas-LaurentHD\u00fcrrHPure Appl Chem2001736396651:CAS:528:DC%2BD3MXltVyksrc%3D10.1351/pac2001730406392.BechingerCFerrereSZabanASpragureJNature19963836086101:CAS:528:DyaK28XmtlWhtrg%3D10.1038/383608a03.AndrewTLTsaiHYMenonRScience20093249179211:CAS:528:DC%2BD1MXlslWnur0%3D10.1126/science.11677044.SunWLiYShiWZhaoXFangPJ Mater Chem201121926392701:CAS:528:DC%2BC3MXnsVWhtL8%3D10.1039/c1jm10155b5.ShenJ-JLiX-XYuT-LWangFHaoP-FFuY-LInorg Chem201655827182731:CAS:528:DC%2BC28XhtlKqt7bJ10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b015996.SuiQRenX-TDaiY-XWangKLiW-TGongTFangJ-JZouBGaoE-QWangLChem Sci20178275827681:CAS:528:DC%2BC28XitFehtbrK10.1039/C6SC04579K7.WuJ-HLiouG-SAdv Funct Mater201424642264291:CAS:528:DC%2BC2cXhsVSnurfM10.1002/adfm.2014016088.SunJ-KCaiL-XChenY-JLiZ-HZhangJChem Commun201147687068721:CAS:528:DC%2BC3MXntlagsLw%3D10.1039/c1cc11550b9.WangM-SYangCWangG-EXuGLvX-YXuZ-NLinR-GCaiL-ZGuoG-CAngew Chem Int Ed201251343234351:CAS:528:DC%2BC38XivV2lsLc%3D10.1002/anie.20110822010.GaraiBMallickABanerjeeRChem Sci20167219522001:CAS:528:DC%2BC2MXitVGgtrjK10.1039/C5SC04450B11.OrticaFDyes Pigm2012928078161:CAS:528:DC%2BC3MXht12iurzI10.1016/j.dyepig.2011.04.00212.HadjoudisERontoyianniAAmbroziakKDziembowskaTMavridisIMJ Photochem Photobiol A20041625215301:CAS:528:DC%2BD2cXhs1GjsLs%3D10.1016/S1010-6030(03)00395-213.RobertFNaikADTinantBRobietteRGarciaYChem Eur J200915432743421:CAS:528:DC%2BD1MXltFGisL8%3D10.1002/chem.20080193214.SunJ-KZhangJDalton Trans20154419041190551:CAS:528:DC%2BC2MXhsFGqtrzO10.1039/C5DT03195H15.KiriyaDTosunMZhaoPKangJSJaveyAJ Am Chem Soc2014136785378561:CAS:528:DC%2BC2cXotFOiuro%3D10.1021/ja503332716.LinR-GXuGWangM-SLuGLiP-XGuoG-CInorg Chem201352119912051:CAS:528:DC%2BC3sXnvVKhtA%3D%3D10.1021/ic301181b17.TanBChenCCaiL-XZhangY-JHuangX-YZhangJInorg Chem201554345634611:CAS:528:DC%2BC2MXkt1Oitr0%3D10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5b0002318.SunJ-KWangPYaoQ-XChenY-JLiZ-HZhangY-FWuL-MZhangJJ Mater Chem20122212212122191:CAS:528:DC%2BC38Xns1SmsrY%3D10.1039/c2jm30558e19.LiW-BYaoQ-XSunLYangX-DGuoR-YZhangJJ CrystEngComm2017197227261:CAS:528:DC%2BC28XitFahsbzM10.1039/C6CE02496C20.TomaOMercierNAllainMKassibaAABellatJ-PWeberGBezverkhyyIInorg Chem201554892389301:CAS:528:DC%2BC2MXhsVOqsL7L10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5b0097521.HiguchiMNakamuraKHorikeSHijikataYYanaiNFukushimaTKimJKatoKTakataMWatanabeDOshimaSKitagawaSAngew Chem20121248494849710.1002/ange.20120383422.WanFQiuL-XZhouL-LSunY-QYouYDalton Trans20154418320183231:CAS:528:DC%2BC2MXhsFCqsrbO10.1039/C5DT03405A23.GongTYangXSuiQQiYXiF-GGaoE-QInorg Chem201655961031:CAS:528:DC%2BC2MXitVKitb%2FN10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5b0188824.GongTLouXFangJ-JGaoE-QHuBDalton Trans20164519109191161:CAS:528:DC%2BC28Xhslylu7nF10.1039/C6DT03637F25.AulakhDVargheseJRWriedtMInorg Chem201554175617641:CAS:528:DC%2BC2MXitVOmsL8%3D10.1021/ic502681326.SpekALJ Appl Crystallogr2003367131:CAS:528:DC%2BD3sXltlChtw%3D%3D10.1107/S002188980202211227.LiBYangFZhangYLiGZhouQHuaJShiZFengSDalton Trans201241267726841:CAS:528:DC%2BC38Xitl2hsr0%3D10.1039/c1dt11654a28.SunW-WTianC-YJingX-HWangY-QGaoE-QChem Commun2009314741474310.1039/b904068d29.LiuJ-JGuanY-FLinM-JHuangC-CDaiW-XCryst Growth Des201616283628421:CAS:528:DC%2BC28Xks1ejtb0%3D10.1021/acs.cgd.6b0016330.LiH-YXuHZangS-QMakTCWChem Commun2016525255281:CAS:528:DC%2BC2MXhslCms73E10.1039/C5CC08168H31.PiligkosSWeiheHBillENeeseFMkamiHESmithGMCollisonDRajaramanGTimcoGAWinpennyREPMcInnesEJLChem Eur J200915315231671:CAS:528:DC%2BD1MXktFyisbg%3D10.1002/chem.20080189532.DasKDattaARoySCleggJKGarribbaESinhaCKaraHPolyhedron20147862711:CAS:528:DC%2BC2cXovFKhsb4%3D10.1016/j.poly.2014.04.03233.SvendsenHJorgensenMRVOvergaardJChenYSChastanetGLetardJFKatoKTakataMIversenBBInorg Chem20115010974109841:CAS:528:DC%2BC3MXht12jsrbP10.1021/ic2015258Electronic supplementary materialBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.

The asymmetric unit contains one Ni(II) center, one L ligand, four coordinated water ligands and fourteen free water molecules. As shown in Fig. 2a, the Ni(II) center is six-coordinated by four water ligands plus two oxygen atoms from two independent L ligands in monodentate modes, giving a distorted octahedral geometry (Fig. 2a). The Ni-O distances are 2.026(4)-2.084(19) \u00c5, which are comparable with previously reported data [28]. In compound 2, the deprotonated L ligands bridge two Ni atoms, each of which is bridged by two L ligands, extending the structure into a zigzag chain (Fig. 2b). The neighboring two zigzag chains are interconnected through hydrogen bonds between the water ligands and uncoordinated carboxyl groups of the organic ligands (dO-O = 2.687-2.719 \u00c5), to generate a 2D supramolecular network (Fig. 2c). This is connected into three dimensions by another hydrogen bond interaction between the water ligands and uncoordinated carboxyl groups of the organic ligands (dO-O = 2.692 \u00c5, Fig. 2d). The 1D channels along the crystallographic b-axis are filled by free water molecules; the pore size is ca. 9.6 \u00d7 11.5 \u00c52 (Fig. 2d, taking into account of the van der Waals radii, measured as the largest and shortest distances between the diagonals of the parallelogram). The PLATON calculations show that the guest accessible volume (1710.2 \u00c53 per unit cell) comprises 42.7% of the unit cell volume [26].\n\nThermogravimetric analyses\n\nThe thermogravimetric analyses were performed under an N2 atmosphere on crystalline samples of both compounds (Figure S3-S4). For compound 1, the first weight loss occurred at 50-110 \u00b0C, corresponding to loss of the free solvent molecules (calc. 12.8%, obs. 12.5%).

The temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibilities of 1-2 were investigated in the range of 2-300 K with a 1 kOe applied field (Fig. 5). The \u03c7MT of 1 at 300 K before irradiation is 4.11 cm3 K mol-1, which is slightly lower than the value for one magnetically non-interacting Mn2+ ion with S = 5/2 and g = 2 (\u03c7MT = 4.375 cm3 K mol-1). With decreasing temperature, the \u03c7MT value increases and reaches 7.38 cm3 K mol-1 at 2.0 K. The temperature dependence of the reciprocal susceptibility in the temperature range 2-300 K is well fitted by the Curie-Weiss law with C = 3.92 cm3 K mol-1 and \u03b8 = 8.10 K (Figure S7), indicating ferromagnetic coupling between the Mn centers. After illumination with Xe light for 30 min, the \u03c7MT value at 300 K fell by 11.4%. This reduction is larger than that previously reported by Iversen et al.

As the temperature decreases, the \u03c7MT value remains almost constant down to about 50 K and then starts to increase rapidly, reaching 3.05 cm3 K mol-1 at 14 K, after which it drops abruptly to a minimum value of 1.28 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K. The temperature dependence of the reciprocal susceptibilities obeys the Curie-Weiss law above 5 K with C = 1.40 cm3 K mol-1 and \u03b8 = 8.53 K (Figure S8), consistent with ferromagnetic coupling between the Ni2+ centers. After illumination with Xe light for 30 min, the \u03c7MT value at 300 K fell by 10.5%.
