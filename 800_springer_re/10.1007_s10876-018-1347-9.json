aesthetic and topological interest [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR1\">1</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>]. Robson and Batten have described the interesting phenomenon of interpenetration in two comprehensive reviews [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR4\">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref>]. Despite numerous interesting interpenetrating structures have been constructed, it still afforded an intriguing fascination for chemists.</p><p id=\"Par3\">On the other hand, due to the porous structures, large surface areas, and potential applications in functional materials, metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) have aroused extensive research interest in recent years [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>]. The template method in design and build these materials have become an important method in the trend of synthetic chemistry [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR8\">8</xref>]. In this field, a number of MOFs are constructed by the template function of the neutral, anion and cationic. Among them, polyoxometalates (POMs) have attracted intense interest not only because they have various classes of POM anions but also due to their great potential applications, such as catalysis, adsorption, electrochemistry and magnetic materials [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR9\">9</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>]. Especially the catalysis is still the most important area. However, the application is limited due to their low stability under catalytic conditions. An effective approach to immobilize POMs is using POMs as templates to constructed MOFs to encapsulate them in the void of metal\u2013organic framework (MOF). This will not only combine their advantages but also gain a stable POM with particular properties. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR17\">17</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>]. Since the interpenetrating networks are composed of several identical networks, the stability of the network and the rigidity of the skeleton will be greatly enhanced. There is supramolecular interaction between each fragment of interpenetrating networks, and it is prone to cause expansion or vibration when external conditions changed, resulting in flexible and dynamic channels. It has a very important application prospect in molecular switches and drug delivery [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR19\">19</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR20\">20</xref>]. So scientists have a special interest in interpenetrated POM-templated MOFs research. However, the non-coordinating POMs act as template is limited in the number of MOFs, and most of them are non-interpenetrating structures. Interpenetrating structures in which non-coordinating POMs act as template are extremely rare because the large size and highly charged POM anions are thought to be effective in preventing interpenetration [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR8\">8</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>]. To our knowledge, Wang and Su first synthesized two POM-based 3D MOFs with twofold and five-fold interpenetrating networks in 2007 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR22\">22</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. After that, Yang reported the first four-fold interpenetrating POM-templated 3D MOF in 2010 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>]. We also reported a POM-templated chiral three-fold interpenetrated 3D MOF in 2012 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR25\">25</xref>]. As an extension of our continuous effort in explore synthesis of POM-templated interpenetrated 3D MOF, we choose the flexible bis(triazole) ligand, btp [btp\u00a0=\u00a01,3-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)propane] [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR26\">26</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR27\">27</xref>], which the 1,2,4-triazole groups in ligand can provide more potential coordination sites and the long \u2013(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>\u2013 fragments in the ligands can build a host framework with big cavities to formation the interpenetrating framework with POM as template. In this paper, We covered the synthesis and characterization of the compound [Co<sub>2</sub>(btp)<sub>3</sub>(GeMo<sub>12</sub>O<sub>40</sub>)] in detail, which represents a rare case of interpenetrating framework templated by non-coordinating POMs.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec2\"><title>Experimental Section</title><sec id=\"Sec3\"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id=\"Par4\">All reactants and solvents were purchased from commercial sources without further purification.

The Co (II) center is six-coordinated with six pyridyl nitrogen atoms from six different btp ligands, exhibiting a distorted octahedral coordination geometry. Each btp ligand acts as a bidentate ligand connecting two Co (II) ions with a Co\u2013Co distances of 12.793 \u00c5, forming a 3D framework. From the perspective of topology, if the Co (II) ions are considered as 6-connected nodes and btp ligands are regarded as connectors, the 3D framework of <bold>1</bold> belongs to a 3D 6-connected net with 4<sup>12</sup>\u00a0\u00d7\u00a06<sup>3</sup> topology which is a classical pcu net (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig2\">2</xref>).

In the process of a typical experiment, 70\u00a0mg of <bold>1</bold> sample were dispersed in 200\u00a0ml\u00a0MB solution which the concentration is 5.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u22125</sup>\u00a0mol\u00a0L<sup>\u22121</sup> in the dark for about half an hour to reach adsorption\u2013desorption equilibrium. Then, put the suspension stirred continuously under visible light and UV light, respectively. Every 30\u00a0min, 3\u00a0mL of suspension was removed from the reactor and centrifuged immediately to separate the suspended solid. The centrifugal solution was monitored by a UV spectrophotometer. For comparing, the experiments of only MB (without catalyst) under the irradiation of visible light and UV light were also investigated. Through experimental results we found that the absorbance of the solution decreased with the increase of irradiation time (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig5\">5</xref>a, c). After 6\u00a0h of visible light irradiation, the photodegradation ratio of MB increased from 15 to 27% due to the photocatalysis of the compound <bold>1</bold>. While the photodegradation ratio of MB increases from 11% without any catalyst to 41% in presence of <bold>1</bold> after 6\u00a0h of UV light irradiation (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig5\">5</xref>b, d). In addition, to verify the stability, the PXRD of compound 1 was collected after photocatalytic experiments and it is same as the original one. All of the data showed that compound <bold>1</bold> is a stable but not efficient photocatalyst in degradation of MB under visible light and UV light irradiation. In the process of photocatalytic, polyoxoanions are playing the leading role in degradation of MB. A possible reaction mechanism was proposed, after absorbing the light energy which is higher than its HOMO\u2013LUMO energy level difference, the ground state of POM is generated to excited state POM* and at the same time generated electron\u2013hole pair and free radical such as \u00b7OH. The POM* is reduced to mixed valence compounds POM<sub>red</sub> (heteropoly blue) while organic matter was oxidized to carbon dioxide, water and inorganic anions to realize the degradation of dye. The POM<sub>red</sub> has no photocatalytic activity. In order to guarantee the photochemical activity of POM in the reaction process and complete oxidation of organic matter, it must make POM<sub>red</sub> rapid regenerated to POM [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR37\">37</xref>]. In compound <bold>1</bold>, due to the POM<sub>red</sub> of polymolybdate is very stable, the oxidation process of POM<sub>red</sub> to POM is slow. As a result, the photocatalytic activity of compound <bold>1</bold> is relatively low. </p></sec></sec></sec><sec id=\"Sec15\" sec-type=\"conclusions\"><title>Conclusion</title><p id=\"Par14\">In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized and characterized a rare case of a two-fold interpenetrate 3D framework templated by non-coordinating POMs, further enriching the chemistry of POM-based metal\u2013organic framework. The optical band gap of <bold>1</bold> indicates that <bold>1</bold> is potential wide-gap semiconductive material. The photocatalytic activity of compound <bold>1</bold> in degradation of MB under visible light and UV light irradiation are also investigated.</p></sec><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Science and technology development plan of Jilin province (20150520006JH), Science and technology research project of Education Department of Jilin province (2016219), Natural Science Foundation of China (21501065, 21676115, 21607051, 51404108) and Science and technology development plan of Siping city (2013055).</p></ack><ref-list id=\"Bib1\"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id=\"CR1\"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type=\"journal\"><person-group person-group-type=\"author\"><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>ZM</given-names></name><name><surname>Batten</surname><given-names>SR</given-names></name><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>JF</given-names></name></person-group><source>J.

Robson and Batten have described the interesting phenomenon of interpenetration in two comprehensive reviews [4, 5]. Despite numerous interesting interpenetrating structures have been constructed, it still afforded an intriguing fascination for chemists.On the other hand, due to the porous structures, large surface areas, and potential applications in functional materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have aroused extensive research interest in recent years [6]. The template method in design and build these materials have become an important method in the trend of synthetic chemistry [7, 8]. In this field, a number of MOFs are constructed by the template function of the neutral, anion and cationic. Among them, polyoxometalates (POMs) have attracted intense interest not only because they have various classes of POM anions but also due to their great potential applications, such as catalysis, adsorption, electrochemistry and magnetic materials [9-16]. Especially the catalysis is still the most important area. However, the application is limited due to their low stability under catalytic conditions. An effective approach to immobilize POMs is using POMs as templates to constructed MOFs to encapsulate them in the void of metal-organic framework (MOF). This will not only combine their advantages but also gain a stable POM with particular properties. [17, 18]. Since the interpenetrating networks are composed of several identical networks, the stability of the network and the rigidity of the skeleton will be greatly enhanced. There is supramolecular interaction between each fragment of interpenetrating networks, and it is prone to cause expansion or vibration when external conditions changed, resulting in flexible and dynamic channels. It has a very important application prospect in molecular switches and drug delivery [19, 20]. So scientists have a special interest in interpenetrated POM-templated MOFs research. However, the non-coordinating POMs act as template is limited in the number of MOFs, and most of them are non-interpenetrating structures. Interpenetrating structures in which non-coordinating POMs act as template are extremely rare because the large size and highly charged POM anions are thought to be effective in preventing interpenetration [8, 21, 24]. To our knowledge, Wang and Su first synthesized two POM-based 3D MOFs with twofold and five-fold interpenetrating networks in 2007 [22, 23]. After that, Yang reported the first four-fold interpenetrating POM-templated 3D MOF in 2010 [24]. We also reported a POM-templated chiral three-fold interpenetrated 3D MOF in 2012 [25]. As an extension of our continuous effort in explore synthesis of POM-templated interpenetrated 3D MOF, we choose the flexible bis(triazole) ligand, btp [btp = 1,3-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)propane] [26, 27], which the 1,2,4-triazole groups in ligand can provide more potential coordination sites and the long -(CH2)n- fragments in the ligands can build a host framework with big cavities to formation the interpenetrating framework with POM as template. In this paper, We covered the synthesis and characterization of the compound [Co2(btp)3(GeMo12O40)] in detail, which represents a rare case of interpenetrating framework templated by non-coordinating POMs.Experimental SectionMaterials and MethodsAll reactants and solvents were purchased from commercial sources without further purification. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a SHIMADZU IR Affinity-1 spectrometer using KBr discs in the range of 4000-400 cm-1. C, N, and H microanalyses were obtained with a Perkin-Elmer 2400 CHN elemental analyzer, and those of Co and Mo were performed with a Perkin-Elmer Optima 2100DV ICP spectrometer. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was performed on a Netzsch STA449F3 instrument in N2 atmosphere with a heat rate of 10 \u00b0C min-1. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were recorded on a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 (\u03bb = 1.5418 \u00c5) radiation. Diffuse reflectance spectra were collected on a finely ground sample with a Cary 500 spectrophotometer equipped with a 110 mm diameter integrating sphere in 200-800 nm by using barium sulfate (BaSO4) as a standard with 100% reflectance. Electrochemical properties were measured on CHI 660C electrochemical workstation at room temperature. A conventional three-electrode system was used with a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode and a Pt wire as the counter electrode.SynthesisCo(CH3COO)2\u22c5H2O (0.04 g, 0.2 mmol), btp (0.018 g, 0.1 mmol), GeO2 (0.01 g, 0.1 mmol), Na2MoO4\u22c52H2O (0.242 g, 1 mmol) were mixed in 10 mL water and adjusted pH value to about 5. The solution is then placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel reaction kettle with a capacity of 18 ml. The reactants in the Teflon-lined stainless steel reaction kettle was heated at 170 \u00b0C for 5 days, and then cooled to room temperature naturally. Red brown crystals of 1 were obtained by 42% yield. Anal. Calcd for C42H60Co2GeMo12N36O40 (Mr = 3051): C, 16.53; H, 1.98; N, 16.53; Co, 3.86; Mo, 37.74%.

The crystallographic data of compound 1 was collected on a Bruker Smart Apex II diffractometer with graphite monochromatic Mo K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5) at 293 K with \u03c9 scans. Multiscan absorption corrections were applied. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full matrix least-squares on F2 using the SHELXTL crystallographic software package [28]. The positions of hydrogen atoms on the carbon atoms were determined by theoretical calculation. The crystal data and structure refinements of compound 1 are shown in Table 1. The supplementary crystallographic data (CCDC- 1538551) for this paper can be obtained free of charge from The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif.Results and DiscussionCrystal Structure DescriptionStructure of [Co2(btp)3(GeMo12O40)] (1)X-ray single-crystal diffraction analyses revealed that compound 1 crystallizes in the trigonal space group R-3. The asymmetric unit of 1 contains one-third of Co (II) ion, one-sixth of (GeMo12O40)4- cluster and one btp ligand (Fig. 1). The Co (II) center is six-coordinated with six pyridyl nitrogen atoms from six different btp ligands, exhibiting a distorted octahedral coordination geometry. Each btp ligand acts as a bidentate ligand connecting two Co (II) ions with a Co-Co distances of 12.793 \u00c5, forming a 3D framework. From the perspective of topology, if the Co (II) ions are considered as 6-connected nodes and btp ligands are regarded as connectors, the 3D framework of 1 belongs to a 3D 6-connected net with 412 \u00d7 63 topology which is a classical pcu net (Fig. 2). Two identical 6-connect 3D networks interpenetrate each other, forming a two-fold interpenetrated 3D framework. In this interpenetrating structure, the channels with the size 9.936 \u00d7 9.936 \u00c5 in the 3D framework can accommodate nanosized polyoxoanions (GeMo12O40)4- (d = 10.3 \u00c5) as guests. The anions fill into the channels constructed by two interpenetrated 6-connect 3D networks (Fig. 3). Selected important bond lengths and bond angles are shown in Table 2.CharacterizationPXRD and XPS CharacterizationIn order to verify the phase purity of the crystalline products, we measured the PXRD of compound 1. The PXRD data for 1 is shown in Fig. S1. The peak positions of the experimental and simulated PXRD pattern are agree well with each other which indicate the phase purity of the compound.The XPS spectra of compound 1 are displayed in Fig. S2. There are two peaks at 781.9 and 796.8 eV in the XPS spectra are ascribed to the binding energies of CoII (2p3/2) and CoII (2p1/2) [29], respectively. Two peaks at 231.7 and 234.8 eV corresponded to the binding energies of MoVI (3d5/2) and MoVI(3d3/2) [30].Thermal AnalysesAs shown in Fig. S3, the crushed single crystal samples were heated up to 1000 \u00b0C in the nitrogen atmosphere and the heating rate was 10 \u00b0C min-1. Between 275 and 750 \u00b0C, a 36.4% drop in weight corresponds to the decomposition of organic ligands and GeMo12O404- anions (Calcd.: 35%). Then, there is no weight loss after 750 \u00b0C, indicating that 1 is completely decompose. The residual weight 63.6% (Calcd.: 65%) corresponding to GeO2, MoO3 and CoO.Optical PropertySome metal-organic frameworks were reported as promising semiconductor materials [31, 32]. Therefore, we have measured the UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of 1 in order to obtain its band gap (Eg, photoresponse wavelength region). In a plot of the Kubelka-Munk function F versus energy E, the intersection point of the line extrapolated from the linear portion of the adsorption edge and the energy axis is defined as Eg [33, 34].The F-E plots is displayed in Fig. S4, and the Eg value estimated from the intersection point is 1.99. The Eg value of 1 is smaller than the Eg value of TiO2, thus indicating that 1 is a potential wide-gap semiconductive material [35].Cyclic VoltammetryThe redox property of compound 1 modified carbon paste electrode (1-CPE) was studied. Figure 4a shows the cyclic voltammograms of 1-CPE in 1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution under scan rates from 50 to 400 mV s-1. In the potential range of - 900 to + 800 mV, the redox peaks I-I', II-II' of 1-CPE correspond to two consecutive two-electron processes of Mo with the mean peak potentials E1/2 = (Epc + Epa)/2 at - 291 and 26 mV (scan rate: 150 mV s-1). The potential difference value between the corresponding anodic and cathodic peaks (\u2206Ep) of I-I', II-II' are 734 and 716 mV. As the scanning rate increases from 50 to 400 mV s-1, the anodic peak potentials are moving slightly in the positive direction and the cathodic peak potentials are slightly moving in the negative direction. In order to better understand the electrochemical behavior of compound 1, we choose the parent POMs (H4[GeMo12O40]\u22c514H2O) to compare with that of compound 1 in the same conditions (Fig. 4b). The redox peaks I-I', II-II', III-III' of GeMo12-CPE correspond to three consecutive two-electron processes of Mo with the mean peak potentials E1/2 = (Epc + Epa)/2 at - 432, 51 and 423 mV (scan rate: 150 mV s-1) [36]. The \u2206Ep of I-I', II-II', III-III' are 252, 46, 214 mV less than the \u2206Ep of 1-CPE showing the speed of electron transfer in the hybrid solids was slower than in the parent POMs. These results indicate that the redox abilities of the parent GeMo12 polyoxoanion could be weakened in the hybrid solids. The combination with Co-(btp) complex cations changed the redox behavior of GeMo12 polyoxoanion.Photocatalytic PropertyThe photocatalytic activities of 1 sample were assessed by degradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible light and UV light, respectively. In the process of a typical experiment, 70 mg of 1 sample were dispersed in 200 ml MB solution which the concentration is 5.0 \u00d7 10-5 mol L-1 in the dark for about half an hour to reach adsorption-desorption equilibrium. Then, put the suspension stirred continuously under visible light and UV light, respectively. Every 30 min, 3 mL of suspension was removed from the reactor and centrifuged immediately to separate the suspended solid. The centrifugal solution was monitored by a UV spectrophotometer. For comparing, the experiments of only MB (without catalyst) under the irradiation of visible light and UV light were also investigated. Through experimental results we found that the absorbance of the solution decreased with the increase of irradiation time (Fig. 5a, c). After 6 h of visible light irradiation, the photodegradation ratio of MB increased from 15 to 27% due to the photocatalysis of the compound 1. While the photodegradation ratio of MB increases from 11% without any catalyst to 41% in presence of 1 after 6 h of UV light irradiation (Fig. 5b, d). In addition, to verify the stability, the PXRD of compound 1 was collected after photocatalytic experiments and it is same as the original one. All of the data showed that compound 1 is a stable but not efficient photocatalyst in degradation of MB under visible light and UV light irradiation. In the process of photocatalytic, polyoxoanions are playing the leading role in degradation of MB. A possible reaction mechanism was proposed, after absorbing the light energy which is higher than its HOMO-LUMO energy level difference, the ground state of POM is generated to excited state POM* and at the same time generated electron-hole pair and free radical such as \u22c5OH. The POM* is reduced to mixed valence compounds POMred (heteropoly blue) while organic matter was oxidized to carbon dioxide, water and inorganic anions to realize the degradation of dye. The POMred has no photocatalytic activity. In order to guarantee the photochemical activity of POM in the reaction process and complete oxidation of organic matter, it must make POMred rapid regenerated to POM [37]. In compound 1, due to the POMred of polymolybdate is very stable, the oxidation process of POMred to POM is slow. As a result, the photocatalytic activity of compound 1 is relatively low. ConclusionIn conclusion, we have successfully synthesized and characterized a rare case of a two-fold interpenetrate 3D framework templated by non-coordinating POMs, further enriching the chemistry of POM-based metal-organic framework. The optical band gap of 1 indicates that 1 is potential wide-gap semiconductive material. The photocatalytic activity of compound 1 in degradation of MB under visible light and UV light irradiation are also investigated.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the Science and technology development plan of Jilin province (20150520006JH), Science and technology research project of Education Department of Jilin province (2016219), Natural Science Foundation of China (21501065, 21676115, 21607051, 51404108) and Science and technology development plan of Siping city (2013055).References1.WuHYangJSuZMBattenSRMaJFJ.

Through experimental results we found that the absorbance of the solution decreased with the increase of irradiation time (Fig. 5a, c). After 6 h of visible light irradiation, the photodegradation ratio of MB increased from 15 to 27% due to the photocatalysis of the compound 1. While the photodegradation ratio of MB increases from 11% without any catalyst to 41% in presence of 1 after 6 h of UV light irradiation (Fig. 5b, d). In addition, to verify the stability, the PXRD of compound 1 was collected after photocatalytic experiments and it is same as the original one. All of the data showed that compound 1 is a stable but not efficient photocatalyst in degradation of MB under visible light and UV light irradiation. In the process of photocatalytic, polyoxoanions are playing the leading role in degradation of MB. A possible reaction mechanism was proposed, after absorbing the light energy which is higher than its HOMO-LUMO energy level difference, the ground state of POM is generated to excited state POM* and at the same time generated electron-hole pair and free radical such as \u22c5OH. The POM* is reduced to mixed valence compounds POMred (heteropoly blue) while organic matter was oxidized to carbon dioxide, water and inorganic anions to realize the degradation of dye. The POMred has no photocatalytic activity. In order to guarantee the photochemical activity of POM in the reaction process and complete oxidation of organic matter, it must make POMred rapid regenerated to POM [37]. In compound 1, due to the POMred of polymolybdate is very stable, the oxidation process of POMred to POM is slow. As a result, the photocatalytic activity of compound 1 is relatively low. \n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, we have successfully synthesized and characterized a rare case of a two-fold interpenetrate 3D framework templated by non-coordinating POMs, further enriching the chemistry of POM-based metal-organic framework. The optical band gap of 1 indicates that 1 is potential wide-gap semiconductive material. The photocatalytic activity of compound 1 in degradation of MB under visible light and UV light irradiation are also investigated.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": []}]], "include_properties": ["decomposition_temperature"]}, {"idx": 8, "type": "table", "classification": ["Crystal"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"Tab1\"><label>Table\u00a01</label><caption xml:lang=\"en\"><p>Crystal data and structure refinements for compound <bold>1</bold></p></caption><table frame=\"hsides\" rules=\"groups\"><thead><tr><th align=\"left\"></th><th align=\"left\"><p><bold>1</bold></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\"><p>Formula</p></td><td align=\"left\"><p>C<sub>42</sub>H<sub>60</sub>Co<sub>2</sub>GeMo<sub>12</sub>N<sub>36</sub>O<sub>40</sub></p></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\"><p>FW</p></td><td align=\"left\"><p>3051</p></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\"><p>Crystal system</p></td><td align=\"left\"><p>Trigonal</p></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\"><p>Space group</p></td><td align=\"left\"><p>R-3</p></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\"><p><italic>a</italic>/\u00c5</p></td><td align=\"left\"><p>16.4707 (12)</p></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\"><p><italic>b</italic>/\u00c5</p></td><td align=\"left\"><p>16.4707 (12)</p></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\"><p><italic>c</italic>/\u00c5</p></td><td align=\"left\"><p>25.6723 (18)</p></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\"><p><italic>\u03b1</italic> (\u00b0)</p></td><td align=\"left\"><p>90</p></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\"><p><italic>\u03b2</italic> (\u00b0)</p></td><td align=\"left\"><p>90</p></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\"><p><italic>\u03b3</italic> (\u00b0)</p></td><td align=\"left\"><p>120</p></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\"><p><italic>V</italic>/\u00c5<sup>3</sup></p></td><td align=\"left\"><p>6031.4 (8)</p></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\"><p><italic>Z</italic></p></td><td align=\"left\"><p>18</p></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\"><p><italic>Dc</italic>/g\u00a0cm<sup>\u22123</sup></p></td><td align=\"left\"><p>2.520</p></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\"><p><italic>F</italic> (000)</p></td><td align=\"left\"><p>4422</p></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\"><p><italic>R</italic> (int)</p></td><td align=\"left\"><p>0.0268</p></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\"><p>GOF on <italic>F</italic><sup>2</sup></p></td><td align=\"left\"><p>1.021</p></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\"><p><italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub>[<italic>I</italic>\u00a0&gt;\u00a02<italic>\u03c3</italic>(<italic>I</italic>)]</p></td><td align=\"left\"><p>0.0536</p></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\"><p><italic>\u03c9R</italic><sub>2</sub> (all data)</p></td><td align=\"left\"><p>0.1217</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>", "clean_text": "Table 1.
