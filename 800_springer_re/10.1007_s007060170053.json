Introduction Recently, the rational design of extended arrays based on 2- and 3-dimensional coordination polymers has become of increasing interest [1\u00b17]. The major goal in this area is the development of functional materials with interesting applications such as nonlinear optics, catalysis, or molecular sieving. In one class of such compounds, the inorganic part consists of metal halides and the organic component is built up of rigid bidentate organic spacers such as aromatic amines which link the inorganic moieties to a multidimensional coordination network. During the last few years, several such compounds have been reported, most of them prepared by classical solution chemistry or solvothermal techniques [1, 8\u00b122]. An alternative way for their preparation is the controlled thermal decomposition of suitable precursors. If the preparation of a special compound is hampered by low yields or affords phase mixtures that have to be separated manually, this method can be Corresponding author. E-mail: cnaether@ac.uni-kiel.de</p><p id=\"Pg2\">very helpful. An example for such a reaction is the thermal decomposition of 2 1\u0089CuCl\u0085-pyrazine\u0086\u008a leading to 21\u0089Cu2Cl2\u0085-pyrazine\u0086\u008a (Fig. 1) [21]. The latter compound was \u00aerst obtained as a by-product in a very complex reaction [15]. Later we have shown that this adduct can be prepared straightforwardly in a hydrothermal reaction, but even this method results in poor yields and phase mixtures [21]. However, the 1:1 adduct 21\u0089CuCl\u0085-pyrazine\u0086\u008a which is much easier available can be quantitatively transformed to the 2:1 adduct by controlled heating [21]. The crystal structure of 21\u0089CuCl\u0085-pyrazine\u0086\u008a consists of CuCl chains parallel to the a-axis which are linked by the pyrazine ligands, thus forming sheets parallel to (010) [16], whereas in the 2:1 adduct staircase-like CuCl double chains are found which are connected to sheets by the pyrazine ligands [15] (Fig. 1). The 1:1 adducts with 4,40-bipyridine [17\u00b119] have also been described. These compounds have the same ratio of copper(I) halide to aromatic base as the pyrazine compound, but their structures are completely different from that of 2 1\u0089CuCl\u0085-pyrazine\u0086\u008a. They consist of Cu2X2 clusters linked to four 4,40-bipyridine molecules forming hexagonal (6,3)-sheets [17\u00b119] (Fig. 2, left). In contrast, the structures of the 2:1 adducts of CuX (X\u0088Cl, Br) and bipyridine [19] are similar to that of 21\u0089Cu2Cl2\u0085-pyrazine\u0086\u008a: CuCl double chains are found which are connected via the 4,40-bipyridine molecules (Fig. 2, right). Because of the similar structures of the 4,40-bipyridine and the pyrazine compounds and the identical stoichiometric ratio between the copper(I) halide and the aromatic amine it seemed reasonable to suppose that even here the 1:1 adducts can be transformed to the 2:1 adducts by controlled thermal decomposition. During our investigations, Graham et al. have reported on the structures of some new coordination polymers and, in addition, on their thermal behaviour, including investigations on the 4,40-bipyridine compounds discussed here [22]. They pointed out that the 1:1 adduct with iodine \u00aerst transforms to the 2:1 adduct which in turn forms Cu(I)I upon further heating. For the chlorine and bromine compounds, 2:1 adducts formed as intermediate compounds loose again half of the pyrazine ligands, Fig. 1.

This conclusion was drawn only on the basis of thermogravimetric data. From our investigations there is no hint for the formation of such intermediates, especially for the bromine compound. Because the structure of the 2:1 adduct of copper(I) iodide and 4,40-bipyridine is unknown, we have prepared and structurally characterized this compound in addition. Results and Discussion Crystal structure of 21[Cu2I2(-4,4 0-bipyridine)] The 2:1 adduct 21\u0089Cu2I2\u0085-4;40-bipyridine\u0086\u008a crystallizes in the triclinic space group P-1 with one formula unit in the unit cell. The compound is not isotypic to 2 1\u0089Cu2X2\u0085-4;40-bipyridine\u0086\u008a (X\u0088Cl, Br) [19] which exerts monoclinic symmetry; however, the topology of the coordination network is comparable. In the crystal of the title compound the copper cations and iodide anions occupy general positions, whereas the 4,40-bipyridine molecule is located around a centre of inversion. Each copper cation is in a slightly distorted tetrahedral environment of three iodine atoms and one nitrogen atom of the 4,40-bipyridine ligand (Fig. 3). The copper-centred tetrahedra are connected via common edges built up of two iodine atoms, forming in\u00aenite staircase-like double chains in the direction of the crystallographic a-axis (Fig. 3). The Cu-Cu distances between the copper cations of neighbouring tetrahedra are 2.806(4) and 2.845(4) A\u00ca . The Cu-I double chains are linked by the 4,40-bipyridine ligands into sheets between which no pronounced interaction can be Fig. 2.

As in other CuX coordination polymers containing aromatic bases, the copper cations point in the direction of the nitrogen lone-pair. Thermoanalytical investigations Heating of 21\u0089CuX\u0085-4;40-bipyridine\u0086\u008a (X\u0088Cl, Br, I) in a dynamic air atmosphere reveals a complete different behaviour for the three compounds (Fig. 4A). For X\u0088Cl, a \u00aerst loss in mass of about 20.3% is observed in the TG curve which is Fig. 3.

Upon further heating, a strong exothermic peak is detected at about 307C where the mass of the sample decreases. Up to this point the total loss in mass is about 30.3%. After this thermal event, two more TG signals of 30.6 and 7.5% could be resolved. The loss in mass in the \u00aerst TG step is signi\u00aecantly lower than that calculated for the removal of half of the 4,40-bipyridine ligands (theor.: 1 2 4,40-bipyridine\u0088 30.6%). The theoretical value is reached at the temperature where the mass of the sample decreases dramatically. Above that point, the experimental loss in mass of 30.6% corresponds to the loss of the remaining ligands. The last signal in the TG curve corresponds approximately to the oxidation of copper(I) chloride presumably formed by the decomposition reaction. For 21\u0089CuBr\u0085-4;40-bipyridine\u0086\u008a, three different TG signals could be resolved successfully (Fig. 4B). The \u00aerst two agree well with the removal of the 4,40bipyridine ligands (theor.: 1 2 4,40-bipyridine\u0088 26.1%) and the last one with the oxidation of copper(I) bromide. For the \u00aerst TG step, practically no change of the sample temperature is observed, whereas the second step is accompanied by a strong exothermic signal at 300C in the DTA curve. Fig. 4.

Analogously to the bromide the \u00aerst step corresponds to the loss of half of the 4,40bipyridine ligands (theor.: 1 2 4,40-bipyridine\u0088 22.5%). Interestingly, in the second step the removal of the remaining ligands and the oxidation of the copper(I) iodide (theor.: 55.4%) occur simultaneously. To support the assumption that CuI is oxidized DTA-TG measurements on pure CuI were performed which show that this compound is oxidized at about 300C. In contrast to the former compound, the \u00aerst TG step is accompanied with an endothermic peak at about 247C in the DTA curve. For the second step, a strong exothermic peak at about 307C is observed. The \u00aenal product of all three compounds at the end of the reactions was identi\u00aeed as copper(II) oxide [23]. To identify the intermediate products occuring during the thermal reactions, temperature-resolved X-ray powder diffraction experiments were performed under a static air atmosphere in glass capillaries (Fig. 5). Decomposition starts at about 310 K as indicated by a pronounced change of the diffraction patterns. A comparison of the diffraction patterns observed above the transition temperature with that calculated for 21\u0089CuX\u0085-4;40-bipyridine\u0086\u008a (X\u0088Cl, Br, I) from single crystal data demonstrates that the 2:1 coordination polymers 21\u0089Cu2X2\u0085-4;40-bipyridine\u0086\u008a (X\u0088Cl, Br, I) have been formed. The higher transition temperatures compared to the temperatures observed in the DTA-TG experiments originate from the different experimental conditions. The DTA-TG experiments were conducted under a dynamic air atmosphere, whereas in the X-ray diffraction experiments a static air atmosphere was employed, i.e. the reaction takes place in part under a self-produced atmosphere. Above about 390C the diffraction pattern vanishes (not shown in Fig. 5) because the product formed during the decomposition is presumably removed from the area of the X-ray beam due to the strong exothermic reactions. However, samples of the chlorine and bromine compound that were cooled down after the second transition showed that copper(I) chloride [24\u00b128] and copper(I) bromide [29] was formed, both slightly contaminated with copper(II) oxide [23]. From the powder experiments there is no evidence for other phases as intermediates. However, the results of the DTA-TG investigations revealed that the thermal reactions are more complicated, especially for the chlorine compound. In this case, the transformation of the 1:1 to the 2:1 adduct cannot be resolved successfully. If the thermal decomposition is stopped after the \u00aerst TG step and the residue is investigated by elementary analysis, the C:N ratio is higher than expected for 4,40bipyridine. Therefore, it might be that part of the ligand decomposes during the reaction. The reason for the different behaviour of the three compounds investigated might be due to the different energies of the reactions involved. For all compounds, the transformation of the 2:1 adduct to the copper(I) halides is strongly exothermic (Fig. 4). For the transformation of the 1:1 to the 2:1 adduct, the reaction seems to be exothermic for X\u0088Cl, slightly endothermic for X\u0088Br, and more endothermic for X\u0088 I. This leads to an increase of the reaction rate for the chlorine compound and to a more complex reaction. In addition, for X\u0088Br this step is better resolved and for X\u0088 I the 2:1 adduct is stable over a large temperature range. It is obvious from the results obtained under a dynamic air atmosphere that these reaction conditions are unsuitable for the preparation of pure and large amounts of 902 C. Na\u00c8ther and I. Je\u00fb</p><p id=\"Pg7\">the 2:1 coordination polymers. Therefore, additional measurements were performed under an argon atmosphere (Fig. 6). In this case, no oxidation can take place, and the transformation of the 1:1 to the 2:1 adducts and the formation of the copper(I) iodide could successfully be resolved. As expected, all reactions are endothermic, and the experimental mass changes are in good agreement with the calculated values. The continuous loss in mass at the end of the TG curves is due to the vaporisation and partial decomposition of the copper(I) halides. If the reactions are stopped after the \u00aerst TG step, formation of the 2:1 adducts is evident by a comparison of the experimental diffraction patterns with those Fig. 5. Results of the temperature resolved X-ray powder diffraction experiment on 2 1\u0089CuX\u0085-4;40-bipyridine\u0086\u008a (X\u0088Cl, Br, I) measured in transmission geometry (CoK-radiation; powdered single crystals, measured temperature range: 20\u00b1400C, static air atmosphere, heating rate: 10C/min, measured every 10C, glass-capillaries) CuX-4,40-bipyridine Coordination Polymers 903</p><p id=\"Pg8\">calculated from single crystal data (Fig. 7). Additional elementary analysis proves that the compounds are phase-pure (see Experimental). From the X-ray powder diffraction and DTA-TG experiments there is absolutely no evidence for the occurence of (CuX)4(4,4 0-bipyridine) (X\u0088Cl, Br) phases as intermediate products as pointed out previously [22]. However, additional DTA-TG experiments were performed using similar experimental conditions as given in Ref. [22] to ascertain the above results. From these curves there is de\u00aenitely no hint for a further TG step between the Cu2X2(4,4 0-bipyridine) and the CuX phases (X\u0088Cl, Br). Due to the fast heating rate, the transition between the 2:1 coordination polymers and the copper(I) halides cannot be resolved successfully, and the corresponding TG curves are much more dif\u00aecult to interpret. Depending on the basis line used for the evaluation, the TG steps seem to be much smaller. In further experiments, the 1:1 compounds were heated up before, after, and until the composition of the sample reached a stoichiometric ratio of 4:1 between the copper(I) halide and the 4,40-bipyridine ligand and cooled down immediately. For X\u0088Br, X-ray powder diffraction proofs clearly that the residues obtained in this experiments consist either of pure CuBr or of a mixture of CuBr and the 2:1 adduct. There are no additional peaks present, and there is no evidence for the formation of Fig. 6.

The same results were obtained for X\u0088Cl. In one experimental powder pattern which consists of a mixture of a large amount of CuCl and a small amount of Cu2Cl2(4,4 0-bipyridine), an additional peak was observed which could not be indexed. The thermal decomposition from the 1:1 to the 2:1 adducts was additionally investigated by thermomicroscopy. Heating crystals of the 1:1 coordination polymers on a hot stage under a dynamic argon atmosphere caused a colour change from red to yellow. The reaction occurs over a large temperature range until it is completed and starts at different positions of the crystals. During the transformation the crystals develop cracks as expected for a reconstructive solid-solid phase transition. Because no smooth microscopic pathway between both crystal structures can be found, this transformation presumably proceeds by nucleation and growth of a new phase, which may be the reason why both compounds are stable simultaneously within a small temperature range. Similar observations have been reported for 2 1[CuCl(-pyrazine)] [21]. Conclusions In the present contribution we have shown that the thermal decomposition of suitable CuX precursors can be used for the quantitative preparation of new coordination polymers. This may be helpful for the synthesis of compounds which cannot be prepared by classical solvent chemistry or which can only be obtained as a phase mixture of different compounds. For the purity of the compounds prepared by thermal decomposition and for the sequence of the reaction it turned out to be necessary to investigate their dependence on the gas-atmosphere using different methods. From thermogravimetric data alone no de\u00aenite conclusions can be drawn. In contrast to previous work [22] we did not \u00aend any evidence for the formation of new compounds with the composition (CuX)4(4,4 0-bipyridine) (X\u0088Cl, Br) as intermediate products.

Introduction Recently, the rational design of extended arrays based on 2- and 3-dimensional coordination polymers has become of increasing interest [1\u00b17]. The major goal in this area is the development of functional materials with interesting applications such as nonlinear optics, catalysis, or molecular sieving. In one class of such compounds, the inorganic part consists of metal halides and the organic component is built up of rigid bidentate organic spacers such as aromatic amines which link the inorganic moieties to a multidimensional coordination network. During the last few years, several such compounds have been reported, most of them prepared by classical solution chemistry or solvothermal techniques [1, 8\u00b122]. An alternative way for their preparation is the controlled thermal decomposition of suitable precursors. If the preparation of a special compound is hampered by low yields or affords phase mixtures that have to be separated manually, this method can be Corresponding author. E-mail: cnaether@ac.uni-kiel.devery helpful. An example for such a reaction is the thermal decomposition of 2 1\u0089CuCl\u0085-pyrazine\u0086\u008a leading to 21\u0089Cu2Cl2\u0085-pyrazine\u0086\u008a (Fig. 1) [21]. The latter compound was \u00aerst obtained as a by-product in a very complex reaction [15]. Later we have shown that this adduct can be prepared straightforwardly in a hydrothermal reaction, but even this method results in poor yields and phase mixtures [21]. However, the 1:1 adduct 21\u0089CuCl\u0085-pyrazine\u0086\u008a which is much easier available can be quantitatively transformed to the 2:1 adduct by controlled heating [21]. The crystal structure of 21\u0089CuCl\u0085-pyrazine\u0086\u008a consists of CuCl chains parallel to the a-axis which are linked by the pyrazine ligands, thus forming sheets parallel to (010) [16], whereas in the 2:1 adduct staircase-like CuCl double chains are found which are connected to sheets by the pyrazine ligands [15] (Fig. 1). The 1:1 adducts with 4,40-bipyridine [17\u00b119] have also been described. These compounds have the same ratio of copper(I) halide to aromatic base as the pyrazine compound, but their structures are completely different from that of 2 1\u0089CuCl\u0085-pyrazine\u0086\u008a. They consist of Cu2X2 clusters linked to four 4,40-bipyridine molecules forming hexagonal (6,3)-sheets [17\u00b119] (Fig. 2, left). In contrast, the structures of the 2:1 adducts of CuX (X\u0088Cl, Br) and bipyridine [19] are similar to that of 21\u0089Cu2Cl2\u0085-pyrazine\u0086\u008a: CuCl double chains are found which are connected via the 4,40-bipyridine molecules (Fig. 2, right). Because of the similar structures of the 4,40-bipyridine and the pyrazine compounds and the identical stoichiometric ratio between the copper(I) halide and the aromatic amine it seemed reasonable to suppose that even here the 1:1 adducts can be transformed to the 2:1 adducts by controlled thermal decomposition. During our investigations, Graham et al. have reported on the structures of some new coordination polymers and, in addition, on their thermal behaviour, including investigations on the 4,40-bipyridine compounds discussed here [22]. They pointed out that the 1:1 adduct with iodine \u00aerst transforms to the 2:1 adduct which in turn forms Cu(I)I upon further heating. For the chlorine and bromine compounds, 2:1 adducts formed as intermediate compounds loose again half of the pyrazine ligands, Fig. 1.

Na\u00c8ther and I. Je\u00fbforming the new phases (CuX)2(4,4 0-bipyridine)0:5 (X\u0088Cl, Br) which are equivalent to (CuX)4(4,4 0-bipyridine). This conclusion was drawn only on the basis of thermogravimetric data. From our investigations there is no hint for the formation of such intermediates, especially for the bromine compound. Because the structure of the 2:1 adduct of copper(I) iodide and 4,40-bipyridine is unknown, we have prepared and structurally characterized this compound in addition. Results and Discussion Crystal structure of 21[Cu2I2(-4,4 0-bipyridine)] The 2:1 adduct 21\u0089Cu2I2\u0085-4;40-bipyridine\u0086\u008a crystallizes in the triclinic space group P-1 with one formula unit in the unit cell. The compound is not isotypic to 2 1\u0089Cu2X2\u0085-4;40-bipyridine\u0086\u008a (X\u0088Cl, Br) [19] which exerts monoclinic symmetry; however, the topology of the coordination network is comparable. In the crystal of the title compound the copper cations and iodide anions occupy general positions, whereas the 4,40-bipyridine molecule is located around a centre of inversion. Each copper cation is in a slightly distorted tetrahedral environment of three iodine atoms and one nitrogen atom of the 4,40-bipyridine ligand (Fig. 3). The copper-centred tetrahedra are connected via common edges built up of two iodine atoms, forming in\u00aenite staircase-like double chains in the direction of the crystallographic a-axis (Fig. 3). The Cu-Cu distances between the copper cations of neighbouring tetrahedra are 2.806(4) and 2.845(4) A\u00ca . The Cu-I double chains are linked by the 4,40-bipyridine ligands into sheets between which no pronounced interaction can be Fig. 2.

As in other CuX coordination polymers containing aromatic bases, the copper cations point in the direction of the nitrogen lone-pair. Thermoanalytical investigations Heating of 21\u0089CuX\u0085-4;40-bipyridine\u0086\u008a (X\u0088Cl, Br, I) in a dynamic air atmosphere reveals a complete different behaviour for the three compounds (Fig. 4A). For X\u0088Cl, a \u00aerst loss in mass of about 20.3% is observed in the TG curve which is Fig. 3. Crystal structure of 21\u0089Cu2I2\u0085-4;40-bipyridine\u0086\u008a with copper coordination and labelling (top) and view along [010] (bottom) 900 C. Na\u00c8ther and I. Je\u00fbaccompanied by two exothermic peaks in the DTA curve at peak temperatures (Tp) of about 230 and 270C (Fig. 4A). Upon further heating, a strong exothermic peak is detected at about 307C where the mass of the sample decreases. Up to this point the total loss in mass is about 30.3%. After this thermal event, two more TG signals of 30.6 and 7.5% could be resolved. The loss in mass in the \u00aerst TG step is signi\u00aecantly lower than that calculated for the removal of half of the 4,40-bipyridine ligands (theor.: 1 2 4,40-bipyridine\u0088 30.6%). The theoretical value is reached at the temperature where the mass of the sample decreases dramatically. Above that point, the experimental loss in mass of 30.6% corresponds to the loss of the remaining ligands. The last signal in the TG curve corresponds approximately to the oxidation of copper(I) chloride presumably formed by the decomposition reaction. For 21\u0089CuBr\u0085-4;40-bipyridine\u0086\u008a, three different TG signals could be resolved successfully (Fig. 4B). The \u00aerst two agree well with the removal of the 4,40bipyridine ligands (theor.: 1 2 4,40-bipyridine\u0088 26.1%) and the last one with the oxidation of copper(I) bromide. For the \u00aerst TG step, practically no change of the sample temperature is observed, whereas the second step is accompanied by a strong exothermic signal at 300C in the DTA curve. Fig. 4. DTA-TG curve for 21\u0089CuCl\u0085-4;40-bipyridine\u0086\u008a (A), 21\u0089CuBr\u0085-4;40-bipyridine\u0086\u008a (B), and 2 1\u0089CuI\u0085-4;40-bipyridine\u0086\u008a (C) (simultaneous measurement; powdered single crystals, heating rate: 1C/min, dynamic air atmosphere (\u00afow rate: 100 cm3/min), Al2O3-crucible; peak temperatures in C, mass change in %) CuX-4,40-bipyridine Coordination Polymers 901For 21\u0089CuI\u0085-4; 40-bipyridine\u0086\u008a, only two TG signals are observed (Fig. 4C). Analogously to the bromide the \u00aerst step corresponds to the loss of half of the 4,40bipyridine ligands (theor.: 1 2 4,40-bipyridine\u0088 22.5%). Interestingly, in the second step the removal of the remaining ligands and the oxidation of the copper(I) iodide (theor.: 55.4%) occur simultaneously. To support the assumption that CuI is oxidized DTA-TG measurements on pure CuI were performed which show that this compound is oxidized at about 300C. In contrast to the former compound, the \u00aerst TG step is accompanied with an endothermic peak at about 247C in the DTA curve. For the second step, a strong exothermic peak at about 307C is observed. The \u00aenal product of all three compounds at the end of the reactions was identi\u00aeed as copper(II) oxide [23]. To identify the intermediate products occuring during the thermal reactions, temperature-resolved X-ray powder diffraction experiments were performed under a static air atmosphere in glass capillaries (Fig. 5). Decomposition starts at about 310 K as indicated by a pronounced change of the diffraction patterns. A comparison of the diffraction patterns observed above the transition temperature with that calculated for 21\u0089CuX\u0085-4;40-bipyridine\u0086\u008a (X\u0088Cl, Br, I) from single crystal data demonstrates that the 2:1 coordination polymers 21\u0089Cu2X2\u0085-4;40-bipyridine\u0086\u008a (X\u0088Cl, Br, I) have been formed. The higher transition temperatures compared to the temperatures observed in the DTA-TG experiments originate from the different experimental conditions. The DTA-TG experiments were conducted under a dynamic air atmosphere, whereas in the X-ray diffraction experiments a static air atmosphere was employed, i.e. the reaction takes place in part under a self-produced atmosphere. Above about 390C the diffraction pattern vanishes (not shown in Fig. 5) because the product formed during the decomposition is presumably removed from the area of the X-ray beam due to the strong exothermic reactions. However, samples of the chlorine and bromine compound that were cooled down after the second transition showed that copper(I) chloride [24\u00b128] and copper(I) bromide [29] was formed, both slightly contaminated with copper(II) oxide [23]. From the powder experiments there is no evidence for other phases as intermediates. However, the results of the DTA-TG investigations revealed that the thermal reactions are more complicated, especially for the chlorine compound. In this case, the transformation of the 1:1 to the 2:1 adduct cannot be resolved successfully. If the thermal decomposition is stopped after the \u00aerst TG step and the residue is investigated by elementary analysis, the C:N ratio is higher than expected for 4,40bipyridine. Therefore, it might be that part of the ligand decomposes during the reaction. The reason for the different behaviour of the three compounds investigated might be due to the different energies of the reactions involved. For all compounds, the transformation of the 2:1 adduct to the copper(I) halides is strongly exothermic (Fig. 4). For the transformation of the 1:1 to the 2:1 adduct, the reaction seems to be exothermic for X\u0088Cl, slightly endothermic for X\u0088Br, and more endothermic for X\u0088 I. This leads to an increase of the reaction rate for the chlorine compound and to a more complex reaction. In addition, for X\u0088Br this step is better resolved and for X\u0088 I the 2:1 adduct is stable over a large temperature range. It is obvious from the results obtained under a dynamic air atmosphere that these reaction conditions are unsuitable for the preparation of pure and large amounts of 902 C. Na\u00c8ther and I. Je\u00fbthe 2:1 coordination polymers. Therefore, additional measurements were performed under an argon atmosphere (Fig. 6). In this case, no oxidation can take place, and the transformation of the 1:1 to the 2:1 adducts and the formation of the copper(I) iodide could successfully be resolved. As expected, all reactions are endothermic, and the experimental mass changes are in good agreement with the calculated values. The continuous loss in mass at the end of the TG curves is due to the vaporisation and partial decomposition of the copper(I) halides. If the reactions are stopped after the \u00aerst TG step, formation of the 2:1 adducts is evident by a comparison of the experimental diffraction patterns with those Fig. 5. Results of the temperature resolved X-ray powder diffraction experiment on 2 1\u0089CuX\u0085-4;40-bipyridine\u0086\u008a (X\u0088Cl, Br, I) measured in transmission geometry (CoK-radiation; powdered single crystals, measured temperature range: 20\u00b1400C, static air atmosphere, heating rate: 10C/min, measured every 10C, glass-capillaries) CuX-4,40-bipyridine Coordination Polymers 903calculated from single crystal data (Fig. 7). Additional elementary analysis proves that the compounds are phase-pure (see Experimental). From the X-ray powder diffraction and DTA-TG experiments there is absolutely no evidence for the occurence of (CuX)4(4,4 0-bipyridine) (X\u0088Cl, Br) phases as intermediate products as pointed out previously [22]. However, additional DTA-TG experiments were performed using similar experimental conditions as given in Ref. [22] to ascertain the above results. From these curves there is de\u00aenitely no hint for a further TG step between the Cu2X2(4,4 0-bipyridine) and the CuX phases (X\u0088Cl, Br). Due to the fast heating rate, the transition between the 2:1 coordination polymers and the copper(I) halides cannot be resolved successfully, and the corresponding TG curves are much more dif\u00aecult to interpret. Depending on the basis line used for the evaluation, the TG steps seem to be much smaller. In further experiments, the 1:1 compounds were heated up before, after, and until the composition of the sample reached a stoichiometric ratio of 4:1 between the copper(I) halide and the 4,40-bipyridine ligand and cooled down immediately. For X\u0088Br, X-ray powder diffraction proofs clearly that the residues obtained in this experiments consist either of pure CuBr or of a mixture of CuBr and the 2:1 adduct. There are no additional peaks present, and there is no evidence for the formation of Fig. 6.

The same results were obtained for X\u0088Cl. In one experimental powder pattern which consists of a mixture of a large amount of CuCl and a small amount of Cu2Cl2(4,4 0-bipyridine), an additional peak was observed which could not be indexed. The thermal decomposition from the 1:1 to the 2:1 adducts was additionally investigated by thermomicroscopy. Heating crystals of the 1:1 coordination polymers on a hot stage under a dynamic argon atmosphere caused a colour change from red to yellow. The reaction occurs over a large temperature range until it is completed and starts at different positions of the crystals. During the transformation the crystals develop cracks as expected for a reconstructive solid-solid phase transition. Because no smooth microscopic pathway between both crystal structures can be found, this transformation presumably proceeds by nucleation and growth of a new phase, which may be the reason why both compounds are stable simultaneously within a small temperature range. Similar observations have been reported for 2 1[CuCl(-pyrazine)] [21]. Conclusions In the present contribution we have shown that the thermal decomposition of suitable CuX precursors can be used for the quantitative preparation of new coordination polymers. This may be helpful for the synthesis of compounds which cannot be prepared by classical solvent chemistry or which can only be obtained as a phase mixture of different compounds. For the purity of the compounds prepared by thermal decomposition and for the sequence of the reaction it turned out to be necessary to investigate their dependence on the gas-atmosphere using different methods. From thermogravimetric data alone no de\u00aenite conclusions can be drawn. In contrast to previous work [22] we did not \u00aend any evidence for the formation of new compounds with the composition (CuX)4(4,4 0-bipyridine) (X\u0088Cl, Br) as intermediate products.

The latter compound was \u00aerst obtained as a by-product in a very complex reaction [15].

However, the 1:1 adduct 21\u0089CuCl\u0085-pyrazine\u0086\u008a which is much easier available can be quantitatively transformed to the 2:1 adduct by controlled heating [21]. The crystal structure of 21\u0089CuCl\u0085-pyrazine\u0086\u008a consists of CuCl chains parallel to the a-axis which are linked by the pyrazine ligands, thus forming sheets parallel to (010) [16], whereas in the 2:1 adduct staircase-like CuCl double chains are found which are connected to sheets by the pyrazine ligands [15] (Fig. 1). The 1:1 adducts with 4,40-bipyridine [17\u00b119] have also been described. These compounds have the same ratio of copper(I) halide to aromatic base as the pyrazine compound, but their structures are completely different from that of 2 1\u0089CuCl\u0085-pyrazine\u0086\u008a. They consist of Cu2X2 clusters linked to four 4,40-bipyridine molecules forming hexagonal (6,3)-sheets [17\u00b119] (Fig. 2, left). In contrast, the structures of the 2:1 adducts of CuX (X\u0088Cl, Br) and bipyridine [19] are similar to that of 21\u0089Cu2Cl2\u0085-pyrazine\u0086\u008a: CuCl double chains are found which are connected via the 4,40-bipyridine molecules (Fig. 2, right). Because of the similar structures of the 4,40-bipyridine and the pyrazine compounds and the identical stoichiometric ratio between the copper(I) halide and the aromatic amine it seemed reasonable to suppose that even here the 1:1 adducts can be transformed to the 2:1 adducts by controlled thermal decomposition. During our investigations, Graham et al. have reported on the structures of some new coordination polymers and, in addition, on their thermal behaviour, including investigations on the 4,40-bipyridine compounds discussed here [22]. They pointed out that the 1:1 adduct with iodine \u00aerst transforms to the 2:1 adduct which in turn forms Cu(I)I upon further heating.

Upon further heating, a strong exothermic peak is detected at about 307C where the mass of the sample decreases. Up to this point the total loss in mass is about 30.3%. After this thermal event, two more TG signals of 30.6 and 7.5% could be resolved. The loss in mass in the \u00aerst TG step is signi\u00aecantly lower than that calculated for the removal of half of the 4,40-bipyridine ligands (theor.: 1 2 4,40-bipyridine\u0088 30.6%). The theoretical value is reached at the temperature where the mass of the sample decreases dramatically. Above that point, the experimental loss in mass of 30.6% corresponds to the loss of the remaining ligands. The last signal in the TG curve corresponds approximately to the oxidation of copper(I) chloride presumably formed by the decomposition reaction. For 21\u0089CuBr\u0085-4;40-bipyridine\u0086\u008a, three different TG signals could be resolved successfully (Fig. 4B).

Upon further heating, a strong exothermic peak is detected at about 307C where the mass of the sample decreases. Up to this point the total loss in mass is about 30.3%. After this thermal event, two more TG signals of 30.6 and 7.5% could be resolved. The loss in mass in the \u00aerst TG step is signi\u00aecantly lower than that calculated for the removal of half of the 4,40-bipyridine ligands (theor.: 1 2 4,40-bipyridine\u0088 30.6%). The theoretical value is reached at the temperature where the mass of the sample decreases dramatically. Above that point, the experimental loss in mass of 30.6% corresponds to the loss of the remaining ligands. The last signal in the TG curve corresponds approximately to the oxidation of copper(I) chloride presumably formed by the decomposition reaction.

The higher transition temperatures compared to the temperatures observed in the DTA-TG experiments originate from the different experimental conditions. The DTA-TG experiments were conducted under a dynamic air atmosphere, whereas in the X-ray diffraction experiments a static air atmosphere was employed, i.e. the reaction takes place in part under a self-produced atmosphere. Above about 390C the diffraction pattern vanishes (not shown in Fig. 5) because the product formed during the decomposition is presumably removed from the area of the X-ray beam due to the strong exothermic reactions.

From the powder experiments there is no evidence for other phases as intermediates. However, the results of the DTA-TG investigations revealed that the thermal reactions are more complicated, especially for the chlorine compound. In this case, the transformation of the 1:1 to the 2:1 adduct cannot be resolved successfully. If the thermal decomposition is stopped after the \u00aerst TG step and the residue is investigated by elementary analysis, the C:N ratio is higher than expected for 4,40bipyridine.

The reason for the different behaviour of the three compounds investigated might be due to the different energies of the reactions involved. For all compounds, the transformation of the 2:1 adduct to the copper(I) halides is strongly exothermic (Fig. 4).
