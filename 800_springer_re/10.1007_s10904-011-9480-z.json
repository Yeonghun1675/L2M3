The crystal structure of <bold>1</bold> exhibits puckered CuCN chains connected by qox molecules forming 2D-sheets. The 2D-sheets contain hexagonal nets stacked in A\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A fashion. The paralleled sheets are close packed via extensive H-bonds, \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking, strong Cu-Cu interaction and short Cu\u2013C contacts which develop 3D-network. Unique rhombic [Cu<sub>2</sub>(\u03bc<sub>3</sub>-CN)<sub>2</sub>] motifs result as consequence of interwoven of the 2D-sheets. The structure of <bold>2</bold> exhibits different XRPD pattern than that of <bold>1</bold> although, the two structures have the same Cu:CN:L stoichiometric ratio.

Thus, <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> can be considered as examples of room-temperature luminescent Cu-containing polymers which can be used in applications as molecular sensing systems.

The crystal data and structure refinement parameters of <bold>1</bold> are collected in Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"Tab1\">1</xref>. The asymmetric unit of <bold>1</bold> contains two molecules which consist of four crystallography different Cu(I) atoms, four ordered cyanide groups and two qox molecules, Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig1\">1</xref>. The red crystals of <bold>1</bold> were early prepared by hydrothermal reaction [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR26\">26</xref>] of CuCN, KCN, qox and H<sub>2</sub>O for 48\u00a0h at 160\u00a0\u00b0C which gave [Cu<sub>2</sub>(CN)<sub>2</sub>qox], <bold>1\u2032</bold>. The network structure of <bold>1\u2032</bold> is constructed of [Cu(CN)]<sub>\u221e</sub> chains linked through qox ligands into a 2D-sheet while the interpenetration of the [Cu<sub>6</sub>(CN)<sub>4</sub>(qox)<sub>2</sub>] rings supposed to be avoided [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR26\">26</xref>]. The hydrothermal method used to prepare <bold>1\u2032</bold> is considered as unconventional technique. In fact solvothermal techniques have now been utilized to produce a rich array of chemical products mainly the multidimensional supramolecular coordination polymers. However, high-temperature methods for preparing inorganic solid state materials generally lead to the isolation of thermodynamic phases [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>]. The complexity of the hydrothermal reactions domain often allows the formation of mixtures of solid state structures meanwhile the control and prediction of crystal structures would not be possible. Nevertheless, it is clear form empirical observations that the architecture of the final product directly depends on the subtle interplay of the characteristics of metal ion and ligand as well as on the reaction conditions. It should also be pointed out that until recently, no cyanide-bridged bimetallic complexes have been prepared by the solvothermal technique [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>]. In the case of <bold>1\u2032</bold>, red crystals were recovered in ca. 20% yield from an uncharacterized amorphous brown powder [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR26\">26</xref>]. In the present study, the red crystals of <bold>1</bold> were the only solid state product obtained at room temperature in ca. 25.3% yield. However, many trials have been carried out to obtain the bimetallic complex applying different techniques by using (n-Bu)<sub>3</sub>SnCl, or to obtain the tin free [Cu<sub>2</sub>(CN)<sub>2</sub>(qox)]<sub>2</sub> by the reaction of the binary adducts qox and K<sub>3</sub>[Cu(CN)<sub>4</sub>] or using the in situ preparing K<sub>3</sub>[Cu(CN)<sub>4</sub>] in solution at room temperature which all ended up, so far unsuccessfully. The (n-Bu)<sub>3</sub>SnCl should play an essential role to decompose the relatively stable K<sub>3</sub>[Cu(CN)<sub>4</sub>] complex forming the suitable (CuCN)<sub>n</sub> fragments which are self assembled under the effect of the organic ligand. In this case the more volatile n-Bu<sub>3</sub>SnCN should be produced or otherwise dimmers of (n-Bu<sub>3</sub>Sn)<sub>2</sub> and cyanogen should be formed. For the time being, however, it seems to be difficult ascribing a reasonable mechanism for the formation of <bold>1</bold> at room temperature only in presence of (n-Bu)<sub>3</sub>SnCl without further extensive investigations.</p><p>The crystal structure of <bold>1</bold> exhibits puckered CuCN chains connected by qox molecules forming 2D-fused deformed six-member rings; [Cu<sub>6</sub>(CN)<sub>4</sub>(qox)<sub>2</sub>], which create wide voids capable to accommodate the qox molecules, Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig2\">2</xref>. The dimensions of the six-membered ring are 12.672\u00a0\u00c5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a09.876\u00a0\u00c5 which reflect less wide space than those of the rings of <bold>3</bold> and <bold>4</bold> due to the participation of R<sub>3</sub>Sn fragments in the formation of the rings [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR36\">36</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR37\">37</xref>]. The distortion of the [Cu<sub>6</sub>(CN)<sub>4</sub>(qox)<sub>2</sub>] rings is due to the bent structure of the cyanide groups as well as to twisting of the qox rings to a certain degree (11.80\u00b0). The distortion comes also from the location of the qox ligands in the six-membered ring where they locate apart only by one side containing the Cu<sub>2</sub>CN fragment. The 2D-sheets containing such hexagonal nets stacked in a parallel array (\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 fashion) represent yet another variant of the honeycomb net observed previously in a number of prototype compounds [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR19\">19</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR26\">26</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>], Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig3\">3</xref>.</p><p>Alternatively, the structure of <bold>1</bold> consists of puckered parallel (CuCN)<sub>\u221e</sub> chains with separation distances 7.054\u201312.672\u00a0\u00c5. The puckered structure is mainly due to non-linear angles at Cu(I) sites; N(27)\u2013Cu(1)\u2013N(29)\u00a0=\u00a0145.18\u00b0, C(26)\u2013Cu(14)\u2013C(32)\u00a0=\u00a0124.41\u00b0, N(25)\u2013Cu(2)\u2013N(28)\u00a0=\u00a0143.83\u00b0 and C(31)\u2013Cu(3)\u2013C(30)\u00a0=\u00a0124.04\u00b0 and also to the bent structure of the CuCN bonds; 162.20\u00b0\u2013175.90\u00b0, Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"Tab2\">2</xref>. These puckered infinite CuCN chains are interconnected by the qox molecules via Cu(2) &amp; Cu(3) and Cu(1) &amp; Cu(14) forming 2D-sheets. Each 2D-sheet is close packed through extensive H-bonds, 2.536\u20132.859\u00a0\u00c5, Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"Tab3\">3</xref>, as well as \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking in the range of 3.129\u20133.166\u00a0\u00c5, in addition to relatively long but not negligible Cu\u2013C contacts; Cu(2)\u2013C(6)\u00a0=\u00a03.011\u00a0\u00c5 and Cu(1)\u2013C(22)\u00a0=\u00a03.027\u00a0\u00c5. The network structure of <bold>1</bold> comprises parallel sheets arranged in \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 fashion along the c-axis exhibiting separation distances 2.703\u20133.777\u00a0\u00c5. These parallel \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 2D-sheets are close packed via extensive H-bonds, \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking, strong Cu\u2013Cu interaction and short Cu\u2013C contacts which develop the 2D-sheets into 3D-network. These crystal packing effects are due to interwoven of the 2D-sheets along the a-axis or the b-axis creating unique 3D-network structure. The \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking is mainly observed between the qox molecules with distances in the range of 3.352\u20133.464\u00a0\u00c5 while the Cu\u2013C contacts are in the range of 2.703\u20133.440\u00a0\u00c5; Cu(3)\u2013C(31)\u00a0=\u00a02.703\u00a0\u00c5, Cu(14)\u2013C(26)\u00a0=\u00a02.909\u00a0\u00c5 and Cu(1)\u2013C(14)\u00a0=\u00a03.440\u00a0\u00c5. Also, extensive H-bonds play an essential role of connecting the 2D-sheets; 2.969\u20133.219\u00a0\u00c5, Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"Tab3\">3</xref>.</p><p>In view of the present lively discussion of cuprophilicity one might also argue that the Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu distances of established examples in favour of cuprophilic attraction are usually longer than 2.70\u00a0\u00c5 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>]. It might be counter-argued that the shortest Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu distances in <bold>1</bold>; Cu(3)\u2013Cu(3)\u00a0=\u00a03.045\u00a0\u00c5 and Cu(14)\u2013Cu(14)\u00a0=\u00a03.199\u00a0\u00c5 represent obviously efficient bridging between the parallel interwoven 2D-sheets. On the other hand, there are longer separation distances between the other copper atoms, Cu(14)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu(1)\u00a0=\u00a04.696\u00a0\u00c5, Cu(1)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu(1)\u00a0=\u00a06.551\u00a0\u00c5 and Cu(2)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu(2)\u00a0=\u00a06.942\u00a0\u00c5. The discussion of the data of the crystal structure of <bold>1</bold> and a careful look of the perspective view of <bold>1</bold> along the a-axis, Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig4\">4</xref> might suggest the presence of unique feature which could be obviously realized from the short Cu(3)\u2013C(31)\u2032 contact; 2.703\u00a0\u00c5 and the short Cu(3)\u2013Cu(3) distance; 3.045\u00a0\u00c5. This unique feature represents the driving forces which are different from optical molecular packing that are therefore more likely to explain the preference of formation of the unique rhombic [Cu<sub>2</sub>(\u03bc<sub>3</sub>-CN)<sub>2</sub>] motifs resulting as a consequence of interwoven of the 2D-sheets along the a-axis or the b-axis. The [Cu<sub>2</sub>(\u03bc<sub>3</sub>-CN)<sub>2</sub>] motifs seem to display the essential role for bridging the parallel interwoven sheets, in addition to H-bonding, developing 3D-network structure. It is worth mentioned that the number of the supramolecular coordination polymers containing the rhombic [Cu<sub>2</sub>(\u03bc<sub>3</sub>-CN)<sub>2</sub>] motifs is now growing up [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR26\">26</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR37\">37</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR45\">45</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR50\">50</xref>] presenting a rich collection of structural data on crystallographically established rhombs. It was found that the carbon ends of both cyanide groups point towards the copper ions producing \u03bc<sub>3</sub>-CN units. The previously described 3D-framework of the coordination polymer [Cu<sub>2</sub>(CN)<sub>2</sub>(pip)] (pip\u00a0=\u00a0piprazine) even seems to involve \u03bc<sub>4</sub>-CN units, i.e. here both the carbon and the nitrogen atom must be assumed to connect two copper ions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR47\">47</xref>].</p><p>Inspection of the copper site geometries indicate that Cu(I) sites; Cu(1), Cu(2) and Cu(14), acquire distorted TP-3 geometry, however Cu(3) site exhibits unique behavior that it assumes T-4 geometry rather than distorted TP-3 geometry, Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"Tab2\">2</xref>. The bond angles of Cu(3) are completely different than those of Cu(1), Cu(2) and Cu(14) where there is strong interaction between Cu(3) and C(31)\u2032 as indicated by the Cu(3)\u2013C(31)\u2032 distance; 2.703\u00a0\u00c5. In this case C(31)\u2032 atom is attached to two Cu(3) atoms forming the rhombic [Cu<sub>2</sub>(\u03bc<sub>3</sub>-CN)<sub>2</sub>] motif. The presence of the rhombic [Cu<sub>2</sub>(\u03bc<sub>3</sub>-CN)<sub>2</sub>] fragment acquires the formation of bent CN groups, Cu(3)\u2013C(31)\u2013N(28)\u00a0=\u00a0162.62\u00b0 and Cu(3)\u2032\u2013C(31)\u2013N(28)\u00a0=\u00a0162.62\u00b0, Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"Tab2\">2</xref>. The Cu(3)\u2032\u2013C(31)\u2013N(28) fragment occupies nearly a perpendicular plane above the plane of the C(30)\u2013Cu(3)\u2013C(31) fragment where C(31)\u2032\u2013Cu(3)\u2013C(30)\u00a0=\u00a095.08\u00b0. The strong Cu(3)\u2013Cu(3) interaction, 3.045\u00a0\u00c5 supports the formation of such unique fragments. The presence of the [Cu<sub>2</sub>(\u03bc<sub>3</sub>-CN)<sub>2</sub>] fragments having two bifurcated cyanide groups lead to bridge the interwoven 2D-sheets via Cu(3)\u2013C(31)\u2032 and Cu(3)\u2013Cu(3), Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig4\">4</xref>, developing 3D-network structure.</p><p>In spite of the Cu(3)\u2013C(31)\u2032 distance of 2.703\u00a0\u00c5 is longer than the wide variable Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7C distances, 2.072\u20132.617\u00a0\u00c5 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR26\">26</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR45\">45</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR50\">50</xref>], present in the rhombic motifs, it is quite close to that of 2.617\u00a0\u00c5 representing a new Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7C distance in the compounds containing such rhombic motif. The angle of the bifurcated CuCN fragments is in the usual range of the reported CuCN angles in the rhombic motifs and it is close to the value of 161.6\u00b0 present in [(CuCN)<sub>2</sub>(bpe)] [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR26\">26</xref>]. Actually, the \u201cbifurcated\u201d cyanide bridge is hardly met outside assemblies involving the rhombic [Cu<sub>2</sub>(\u03bc<sub>3</sub>-CN)<sub>2</sub>] fragments, and it might be speculated somewhat provocatively that the asymmetric CN bridge would be rather a consequence of cuprophilicity than the primary cause of comparatively short Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu distances. A further support of the formation of the rhombic motif is the angle of Cu(3)\u2013C(31)\u2013Cu(3)\u2032\u00a0=\u00a079.93\u00b0 which is close to the range of; 69.14\u00b0\u201377.30\u00b0, present in the prototype compounds [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR26\">26</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR45\">45</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR50\">50</xref>].</p><p>Consulting the crystal structures of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>3</bold> indicated that they are different as also gathered from their X-ray patterns, Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig5\">5</xref>.

It is obvious that the cyanide group acts as a bidentate ligand connecting the copper atoms forming nonlinear chains. This opinion is further supported by the appearance of the medium band, in the IR spectra of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>, at 410 and 407\u00a0cm<sup>\u22121</sup>, respectively, due to the stretching vibrations of the Cu\u2013C bond.

The first step takes place in the temperature range 170\u2013250\u00a0\u00b0C, and it corresponds to the release of two qox molecules or one qaz molecule. The second step corresponds to the loss of four cyanide groups (<bold>1</bold>) or two cyanide groups (<bold>2</bold>) in the temperature range 300\u2013470\u00a0\u00b0C. This step is followed by an increase in the mass in the temperature range 480\u2013550\u00a0\u00b0C due to the gain of mass of oxygen. At higher temperatures over 600\u00a0\u00b0C, the residues suffer oxidation leading to the final product of cuprite. Also, the molecular weight of the residues obtained after complete thermolyses of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> are coincident with Cu<sub>2</sub>O. The thermogravimetric analysis data of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> indicated their stability up to 170\u00a0\u00b0C as well as the presence of CuCN fragment and qox or qaz in the structures of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>, respectively.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec15\"><title>X-Ray powder Diffraction and Structure of the SCP <bold>2</bold></title><p>X-ray powder diffraction of [Cu<sub>2</sub>(CN)<sub>2</sub>qaz]<sub>\u221e</sub>, <bold>2</bold>; shows diffraction pattern which is different than the simulated patterns calculated from the X-ray single crystal data of <bold>1</bold> or that of [(CuCN)<sub>4</sub>qaz] [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>], Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig5\">5</xref>. The structure of <bold>1</bold> contains the CuCN building blocks which form puckered chains connected by \u03bc<sub>2</sub>-qox ligand. The 3D-network structure contains six-membered rings of Cu<sub>6</sub>(CN)<sub>4</sub>(qox)<sub>2</sub>. The structure of [(CuCN)<sub>4</sub>qaz] prepared by hydrothermal method comprises of two sets of CuCN chains. In one chain, propagating parallel to the b-axis alternating Cu(2) and Cu(3) atoms are 2-coordinate and 3-coordinate, respectively. In the other chain, running between the a- and c-axes, Cu(4) is 2-coordinate and Cu(1) is 3-coordinate, respectively. The sets of CuCN chains are linked by qaz units. \u03c0-Stacking of qaz ligands is evident in addition to Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu interaction [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>]. However, the X-ray powder diffraction of <bold>2</bold> shows the peaks in the 2\u03b8 region of 20\u201335 which resemble those found in that of [(CuCN)<sub>4</sub>qaz] [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>]. The structure of <bold>2</bold> exhibits different Cu:CN stoichiometric ratio than that of <bold>3</bold> and [(CuCN)<sub>4</sub>qaz]. The structure of <bold>2</bold> exhibits different XRPD pattern than that of <bold>1</bold> although, the two structures have the same Cu:CN:L stoichiometric ratio. Thus, the difference between the structures of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> may come from the fact that only one nitrogen site of qaz is involved in coordination with Cu atom. Indeed, one could not argue the structure of <bold>2</bold> only by using IR, NMR and mass spectra as well as elemental analysis. The chemical composition and the polymeric nature of <bold>2</bold> are the only information that one should suggest bearing in mind the bridging capability of the cyanide and the qaz ligands as well as versatility nature of Cu(I) topology which lead to the formation of 3D-networks.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec16\"><title>Electronic Absorption and Emission Spectra of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold></title><p>Qox and qaz are similar to naphthalene in electronic structure except that qox and qaz have lower-lying (n,\u03c0*) states. In this case, the spectra of qox and qaz resemble that of naphthalene [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR48\">48</xref>]. However, it is to be expected that the \u03c0* levels are appreciably lowered in the diazanaphthalenes and that the n\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\u03c0* transitions are shifted far enough to the red to make them discernible. The electronic absorption spectra of qox and qaz display four absorption bands at 215\u2013220, 270, 308\u2013310 and 325\u00a0nm, Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"Tab5\">5</xref>.

The band at 325\u00a0nm disappears on the addition of HCl supporting the n\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\u03c0* transition. These bands appear at more or less the same wavelengths in the electronic absorption spectra of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>, Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"Tab5\">5</xref>. However, the band at 325\u00a0nm in the spectra of qox and qaz disappears in the spectra of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> due to coordination of qox or qaz to the copper atoms and/or the formation of hydrogen bonds. The emission spectra of qox and qaz display one broad symmetrical band at 420 and 450\u00a0nm, respectively corresponding to the <sup>1</sup>(n,\u03c0*)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0S<sub>o</sub> fluorescence of qox or qaz [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR52\">52</xref>]. On the other hand, the emission spectra of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> display three bands centered at 385\u2013390, 418\u2013420 and 475\u2013480\u00a0nm, Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"Tab5\">5</xref>. The emission band of qox or qaz suffers a shift to higher energy in the emission spectra of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> under the effect of coordination of qox and qaz to the copper site. On the other hand, the possible photophysical sources of luminescence behavior in <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>, for the remaining two peaks at 390 and 475\u00a0nm, can be argued to the MC transition and MLCT, respectively. The emission band at 390\u00a0nm of <bold>1</bold> and that at 385\u00a0nm of <bold>2</bold> resembles that of CuCN [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>] which is assumed to arise from transitions from the lowest excited-triplet state to the ground state. Lifetime studies of soluble Cu(1)-cyano species have suggested that emission is usually a phosphorescence phenomenon [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR53\">53</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR54\">54</xref>].

The release of that colored wastewater in the ecosystem is a dramatic source of esthetic pollution, and perturbation in aquatic life. Different techniques have been used for this purpose, e.g. adsorption, oxidation, reduction, and electrochemical reactions. Recent investigations revealed that reactive dyes could be decolorized by advanced oxidation processes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR56\">56</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR58\">58</xref>]. The catalytic oxidation of MY dye was studied using H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as oxidant and the MOF <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> as heterogeneous catalysts. When a solution of MY dye was mixed with hydrogen peroxide, no reaction can be observed. However, when the MOF catalyst <bold>1</bold> or <bold>2</bold> was added, a reaction occurred leading to a color removal of the dye at \u03bb<sub>max</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0435\u00a0nm, Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig6\">6</xref>. The final solution is completely bleached after 3\u20133.5\u00a0h as illustrated by the absorption spectra of MY in water (at \u03bb<sub>max</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0435\u00a0nm) at the beginning and end of the reaction, Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig6\">6</xref>. The catalytic activity of <bold>1</bold> is more pronounced than that of <bold>2</bold> since the ratio of degradation decreases on going from <bold>1</bold> to <bold>2</bold>. After 60\u00a0min, there is a fast degradation of MY dye. On the other hand, after 2\u00a0h about 76% of MY dye is degraded in the case of catalyst <bold>1</bold> while for <bold>2</bold> about 62% of MY dye is degraded. This means that the two MOF <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> have catalytic activity towards the degradation of MY dye. An important issue that must be addressed while studying liquid-phase oxidations over a solid catalyst is a possibility of catalyst recycling. In each case, after the end of the first experiment, the catalyst is washed with double distilled water, dried, and then starting a new experiment. It was found that the MOF <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> maintained their catalytic activity for two cycles of the dye oxidation with hydrogen peroxide. It is worth mentioned here that the components of these MOF (CuCN and the organic ligands) have no catalytic activity towards the degradation of MY dye when they are tested at the same conditions. On the other hand, investigation of the catalysts after the catalytic cycle by elemental analysis and the IR spectra show that the catalysts are stable keeping their identity. Also, magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that the used catalysts are still diamagnetic which indicates that the structures of the MOF catalysts <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> after the catalytic cycles remain containing the Cu(I)CN building blocks. Further study concerning the mechanism and the factors affecting the reaction rate is currently carried out.</p></sec></sec><sec id=\"Sec18\" sec-type=\"supplementary-material\"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p>CCDC 805390 contains the supplementary crystallographic data for <bold>1</bold>.

The crystal structure of 1 exhibits puckered CuCN chains connected by qox molecules forming 2D-sheets. The 2D-sheets contain hexagonal nets stacked in A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5A fashion. The paralleled sheets are close packed via extensive H-bonds, \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, strong Cu-Cu interaction and short Cu-C contacts which develop 3D-network. Unique rhombic [Cu2(\u03bc3-CN)2] motifs result as consequence of interwoven of the 2D-sheets.

The products should be either [(Cu)n(CN)mXL] complexes or organotin-copper(I)cyanide containing polymers [16-30]. Copper(I)cyanide has shown promise in the assembly of zeolitic-type frameworks [31-34] and as a precursor in the synthesis of YBa2Cu3O7-x superconductors [35].In continue of our research work on structure variability and flexibility associated with the study of the organometallic systems [36], the reactions of the ternary adducts K3[Cu(CN)4], R3SnCl {R = Me or ph] and qox were carried out at room temperature to obtain the bimetallic 3D-supramolecular coordination polymers \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}     \\usepackage{amsmath}     \\usepackage{wasysym}     \\usepackage{amsfonts}     \\usepackage{amssymb}     \\usepackage{amsbsy}     \\usepackage{mathrsfs}     \\usepackage{upgreek}     \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}     \\begin{document}$$ {}_{\\infty }^{3} \\left[ {{\\text{Cu}}_{2} \\left( {\\text{CN}} \\right)_{3} \\left( {{\\text{Me}}_{3} {\\text{Sn}}} \\right){\\text{qox}}} \\right] $$\\end{document}, 3 [36] and \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}     \\usepackage{amsmath}     \\usepackage{wasysym}     \\usepackage{amsfonts}     \\usepackage{amssymb}     \\usepackage{amsbsy}     \\usepackage{mathrsfs}     \\usepackage{upgreek}     \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}     \\begin{document}$$ {}_{\\infty }^{3} \\left[ {{\\text{Cu}}_{2} \\left( {\\text{CN}} \\right)_{4} \\left( {{\\text{ph}}_{3} {\\text{Sn}}} \\right)_{2}{\\text{qox}}} \\right] $$\\end{document}, 4 [37]. In this case the [Cun(CN)m]x- anions represent the main building blocks and the (R3Sn)+ cation acts as an essential element of the framework to produce uncharged architectures in which channels remain, mostly, blocked by the R groups. However, in some cases, due to structural variability, inclusion of the (R3Sn)+ cation does not take place and instead the channels are free from the organometallic or the organic cations and solvent molecules inclusion. So, extending the previous essays, the unexpectedly, organotin-free MOF \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}     \\usepackage{amsmath}     \\usepackage{wasysym}     \\usepackage{amsfonts}     \\usepackage{amssymb}     \\usepackage{amsbsy}     \\usepackage{mathrsfs}     \\usepackage{upgreek}     \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}     \\begin{document}$$ {}_{\\infty }^{3} \\left[ {{\\text{Cu}}_{2} \\left( {\\text{CN}} \\right)_{2} \\mu {\\text{-(qox)}}} \\right]_{2} $$\\end{document}, 1 and [Cu2(CN)2\u03bc-(qaz)]n, 2 have been crystallized from H2O/CH3CN solution containing (n-Bu)3SnCl and from H2O/acetone solution containing Me3SnCl, respectively. Two MOF have been obtained for which single crystals have been isolated for 1 and was subjected to single crystals X-ray study, while 2 was investigated by IR, 1H-NMR and mass spectra as well as TGA. Applications of 1 and 2, as the catalytic activity and the fluorescence properties, were also investigated.ExperimentalMaterialsAll the reactions in this study were carried out using the ternary adducts K3[Cu(CN)4], organotin chloride and bipodal ligand. K3[Cu(CN)4] was prepared following the literature procedure [38]. Organotin chlorides which are mainly, trimethyltin chloride, and tributyltin chloride as well as the bipodal ligands; quinoxaline (qox) and quinazoline (qaz), Scheme 1, were purchased from either Aldrich or Fluka and used without further purification. Metanil Yellow (MY) (98% purity), Scheme 2, was received from B.D.H. Chemicals Ltd and used as received. The solvents; acetonitrile, acetone and petroleum ether were of analytical grade supplied by Aldrich or Merck and used as received. Hydrogen peroxide (30% w/v, Merck) was used. The initial concentration of H2O2 was determined iodometrically using standard Na2S2O3.Catalytic Activity MeasurementsFor the catalytic runs a stock solution of the MY dye (4 \u00d7 10-5 M) was prepared in doubly distilled water. A number of reactors (100 mL) containing a definite quantity of the catalyst (0.05 mmol) together with the appropriate volume (3 mL) of the MY dye solution (4 \u00d7 10-5 M) were placed in a water shaker thermostat at 25 \u00b0C to attain this temperature. To each reactor 1 mL of 0.5 M H2O2 solution was added and the time was noted. After 1 h, aliquot of each flask was withdrawn and the absorbance was recorded. Also, at regular time intervals aliquot of each conical was withdrawn, filtrated to remove the catalyst, and the absorbance was recorded at \u03bbmax of 435 nm. Generally, the dye/H2O2 mixture was stable for several hours without changes in the absorbance. This means that no reaction takes place between the MY dye and H2O2 in the absence of the catalyst.InstrumentsMicroanalyses were carried out with a Perkin Elmer 2400 automatic elemental analyzer, while copper was determined using Perkin Elmer 2380 atomic absorption spectrometer. Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer 1720 spectrophotometer as KBr discs, in the range of 4000-400 cm-1. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DPX 200 spectrometer, using DMSO-d6 as a solvent. Mass spectra were recorded on a Finnigan MAT SSQ 7000 spectrometer. Electronic absorption spectra as solid matrices were measured on a Shimadzu (UV-3101 PC) spectrometer. Fluorescence spectra of solids were carried out using a Perkin-Elmer (LS 50 B) spectrometer at excitation wavelength 280 nm. A shaker water thermostat (Julabo SW20C) was used to shake the heterogeneous reaction mixture at 120 rpm at fixed temperature \u00b10.1 \u00b0C. Thermogravimetric analyses were carried out on TGA-50H thermal analyzer (under N2 atmosphere), in the range of 25 to 800 \u00b0C at a heating rate 20 \u00b0C/min. X-ray powder diffraction patterns were recorded using a Diano Corporation diffractometer equipped with Co K\u03b1 radiation tube operated at 45 kV, 9 mA. Single crystal X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out on a Kappa CCD Enraf Nonius FR 90 four circle goniometer with a graphite monochromatic MoK\u03b1 radiation source (\u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5) operated at 20 mA/50 kV.X-Ray Crystallography and Structure Determination of 1The well developed crystal was mounted on glass fibers, and the measurements were made at 25 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C. The structure was solved using direct-method and all of the non-hydrogen atoms were located from the initial solution or from subsequent electron density difference map during the initial stages of the refinement. After locating all of the non-hydrogen atoms in the structure, the model was refined against F2, first using isotropic and finally anisotropic thermal displacement parameters. The positions of the hydrogen atoms were then calculated and refined isotropically, and a final cycle of refinements was performed.Synthesis of \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}     \\usepackage{amsmath}     \\usepackage{wasysym}     \\usepackage{amsfonts}     \\usepackage{amssymb}     \\usepackage{amsbsy}     \\usepackage{mathrsfs}     \\usepackage{upgreek}     \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}     \\begin{document}$$ {}_{\\infty }^{3} \\left[ {{\\text{Cu}}_{2} \\left( {\\text{CN}} \\right)_{2} {\\text{qox}}} \\right]_{2} $$\\end{document}, 1A solution of 180 mg (0.63 mmol) of K3[Cu(CN)4] in 10 mL H2O was added, with gentle stirring to a mixture of 538 mg (1.9 mmol) of (n-Bu)3SnCl and 80 mg (0.63 mmol) of qox in 20 mL acetone under nitrogen atmosphere. Already, after 6 weeks, red needle crystals had resulted.

However, although a number of synthesis variations of these crystals were attempted, one would unable to produce crystals pure enough and suitable for X-ray diffraction measurements. Anal.

The crystal data and structure refinement parameters of 1 are collected in Table 1. The asymmetric unit of 1 contains two molecules which consist of four crystallography different Cu(I) atoms, four ordered cyanide groups and two qox molecules, Fig. 1. The red crystals of 1 were early prepared by hydrothermal reaction [26] of CuCN, KCN, qox and H2O for 48 h at 160 \u00b0C which gave [Cu2(CN)2qox], 1'. The network structure of 1' is constructed of [Cu(CN)]\u221e chains linked through qox ligands into a 2D-sheet while the interpenetration of the [Cu6(CN)4(qox)2] rings supposed to be avoided [26]. The hydrothermal method used to prepare 1' is considered as unconventional technique. In fact solvothermal techniques have now been utilized to produce a rich array of chemical products mainly the multidimensional supramolecular coordination polymers. However, high-temperature methods for preparing inorganic solid state materials generally lead to the isolation of thermodynamic phases [39]. The complexity of the hydrothermal reactions domain often allows the formation of mixtures of solid state structures meanwhile the control and prediction of crystal structures would not be possible. Nevertheless, it is clear form empirical observations that the architecture of the final product directly depends on the subtle interplay of the characteristics of metal ion and ligand as well as on the reaction conditions. It should also be pointed out that until recently, no cyanide-bridged bimetallic complexes have been prepared by the solvothermal technique [40]. In the case of 1', red crystals were recovered in ca. 20% yield from an uncharacterized amorphous brown powder [26]. In the present study, the red crystals of 1 were the only solid state product obtained at room temperature in ca. 25.3% yield. However, many trials have been carried out to obtain the bimetallic complex applying different techniques by using (n-Bu)3SnCl, or to obtain the tin free [Cu2(CN)2(qox)]2 by the reaction of the binary adducts qox and K3[Cu(CN)4] or using the in situ preparing K3[Cu(CN)4] in solution at room temperature which all ended up, so far unsuccessfully. The (n-Bu)3SnCl should play an essential role to decompose the relatively stable K3[Cu(CN)4] complex forming the suitable (CuCN)n fragments which are self assembled under the effect of the organic ligand. In this case the more volatile n-Bu3SnCN should be produced or otherwise dimmers of (n-Bu3Sn)2 and cyanogen should be formed. For the time being, however, it seems to be difficult ascribing a reasonable mechanism for the formation of 1 at room temperature only in presence of (n-Bu)3SnCl without further extensive investigations.The crystal structure of 1 exhibits puckered CuCN chains connected by qox molecules forming 2D-fused deformed six-member rings; [Cu6(CN)4(qox)2], which create wide voids capable to accommodate the qox molecules, Fig. 2. The dimensions of the six-membered ring are 12.672 \u00c5 \u00d7 9.876 \u00c5 which reflect less wide space than those of the rings of 3 and 4 due to the participation of R3Sn fragments in the formation of the rings [36, 37]. The distortion of the [Cu6(CN)4(qox)2] rings is due to the bent structure of the cyanide groups as well as to twisting of the qox rings to a certain degree (11.80\u00b0). The distortion comes also from the location of the qox ligands in the six-membered ring where they locate apart only by one side containing the Cu2CN fragment. The 2D-sheets containing such hexagonal nets stacked in a parallel array (\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5 fashion) represent yet another variant of the honeycomb net observed previously in a number of prototype compounds [19, 26, 40-44], Fig. 3.Alternatively, the structure of 1 consists of puckered parallel (CuCN)\u221e chains with separation distances 7.054-12.672 \u00c5. The puckered structure is mainly due to non-linear angles at Cu(I) sites; N(27)-Cu(1)-N(29) = 145.18\u00b0, C(26)-Cu(14)-C(32) = 124.41\u00b0, N(25)-Cu(2)-N(28) = 143.83\u00b0 and C(31)-Cu(3)-C(30) = 124.04\u00b0 and also to the bent structure of the CuCN bonds; 162.20\u00b0-175.90\u00b0, Table 2. These puckered infinite CuCN chains are interconnected by the qox molecules via Cu(2) & Cu(3) and Cu(1) & Cu(14) forming 2D-sheets. Each 2D-sheet is close packed through extensive H-bonds, 2.536-2.859 \u00c5, Table 3, as well as \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking in the range of 3.129-3.166 \u00c5, in addition to relatively long but not negligible Cu-C contacts; Cu(2)-C(6) = 3.011 \u00c5 and Cu(1)-C(22) = 3.027 \u00c5. The network structure of 1 comprises parallel sheets arranged in \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5 fashion along the c-axis exhibiting separation distances 2.703-3.777 \u00c5. These parallel \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5 2D-sheets are close packed via extensive H-bonds, \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, strong Cu-Cu interaction and short Cu-C contacts which develop the 2D-sheets into 3D-network. These crystal packing effects are due to interwoven of the 2D-sheets along the a-axis or the b-axis creating unique 3D-network structure. The \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking is mainly observed between the qox molecules with distances in the range of 3.352-3.464 \u00c5 while the Cu-C contacts are in the range of 2.703-3.440 \u00c5; Cu(3)-C(31) = 2.703 \u00c5, Cu(14)-C(26) = 2.909 \u00c5 and Cu(1)-C(14) = 3.440 \u00c5. Also, extensive H-bonds play an essential role of connecting the 2D-sheets; 2.969-3.219 \u00c5, Table 3.In view of the present lively discussion of cuprophilicity one might also argue that the Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu distances of established examples in favour of cuprophilic attraction are usually longer than 2.70 \u00c5 [18]. It might be counter-argued that the shortest Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu distances in 1; Cu(3)-Cu(3) = 3.045 \u00c5 and Cu(14)-Cu(14) = 3.199 \u00c5 represent obviously efficient bridging between the parallel interwoven 2D-sheets. On the other hand, there are longer separation distances between the other copper atoms, Cu(14)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu(1) = 4.696 \u00c5, Cu(1)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu(1) = 6.551 \u00c5 and Cu(2)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu(2) = 6.942 \u00c5. The discussion of the data of the crystal structure of 1 and a careful look of the perspective view of 1 along the a-axis, Fig. 4 might suggest the presence of unique feature which could be obviously realized from the short Cu(3)-C(31)' contact; 2.703 \u00c5 and the short Cu(3)-Cu(3) distance; 3.045 \u00c5. This unique feature represents the driving forces which are different from optical molecular packing that are therefore more likely to explain the preference of formation of the unique rhombic [Cu2(\u03bc3-CN)2] motifs resulting as a consequence of interwoven of the 2D-sheets along the a-axis or the b-axis. The [Cu2(\u03bc3-CN)2] motifs seem to display the essential role for bridging the parallel interwoven sheets, in addition to H-bonding, developing 3D-network structure. It is worth mentioned that the number of the supramolecular coordination polymers containing the rhombic [Cu2(\u03bc3-CN)2] motifs is now growing up [16, 18, 21, 26, 37, 45-50] presenting a rich collection of structural data on crystallographically established rhombs. It was found that the carbon ends of both cyanide groups point towards the copper ions producing \u03bc3-CN units. The previously described 3D-framework of the coordination polymer [Cu2(CN)2(pip)] (pip = piprazine) even seems to involve \u03bc4-CN units, i.e. here both the carbon and the nitrogen atom must be assumed to connect two copper ions [47].Inspection of the copper site geometries indicate that Cu(I) sites; Cu(1), Cu(2) and Cu(14), acquire distorted TP-3 geometry, however Cu(3) site exhibits unique behavior that it assumes T-4 geometry rather than distorted TP-3 geometry, Table 2. The bond angles of Cu(3) are completely different than those of Cu(1), Cu(2) and Cu(14) where there is strong interaction between Cu(3) and C(31)' as indicated by the Cu(3)-C(31)' distance; 2.703 \u00c5. In this case C(31)' atom is attached to two Cu(3) atoms forming the rhombic [Cu2(\u03bc3-CN)2] motif. The presence of the rhombic [Cu2(\u03bc3-CN)2] fragment acquires the formation of bent CN groups, Cu(3)-C(31)-N(28) = 162.62\u00b0 and Cu(3)'-C(31)-N(28) = 162.62\u00b0, Table 2. The Cu(3)'-C(31)-N(28) fragment occupies nearly a perpendicular plane above the plane of the C(30)-Cu(3)-C(31) fragment where C(31)'-Cu(3)-C(30) = 95.08\u00b0. The strong Cu(3)-Cu(3) interaction, 3.045 \u00c5 supports the formation of such unique fragments. The presence of the [Cu2(\u03bc3-CN)2] fragments having two bifurcated cyanide groups lead to bridge the interwoven 2D-sheets via Cu(3)-C(31)' and Cu(3)-Cu(3), Fig. 4, developing 3D-network structure.In spite of the Cu(3)-C(31)' distance of 2.703 \u00c5 is longer than the wide variable Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C distances, 2.072-2.617 \u00c5 [21, 26, 45-50], present in the rhombic motifs, it is quite close to that of 2.617 \u00c5 representing a new Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C distance in the compounds containing such rhombic motif. The angle of the bifurcated CuCN fragments is in the usual range of the reported CuCN angles in the rhombic motifs and it is close to the value of 161.6\u00b0 present in [(CuCN)2(bpe)] [26]. Actually, the \"bifurcated\" cyanide bridge is hardly met outside assemblies involving the rhombic [Cu2(\u03bc3-CN)2] fragments, and it might be speculated somewhat provocatively that the asymmetric CN bridge would be rather a consequence of cuprophilicity than the primary cause of comparatively short Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu distances. A further support of the formation of the rhombic motif is the angle of Cu(3)-C(31)-Cu(3)' = 79.93\u00b0 which is close to the range of; 69.14\u00b0-77.30\u00b0, present in the prototype compounds [21, 26, 45-50].Consulting the crystal structures of 1 and 3 indicated that they are different as also gathered from their X-ray patterns, Fig. 5. The (Cu)n(CN)m main building blocks are different while the anionic [Cu2(CN)3]- building blocks in 3 are bridged by the cationic Me3Sn+ units forming puckered parallel chains which are connected by qox molecules. On the other hand, the neutral Cu2(CN)2 puckered chains of 1 are connected by qox molecules forming 2D-sheets. The building block of 3 contains two crystallographically identical distorted TP-3 copper sites while 1 contains four crystallographically different copper sites; three Cu(I) sites acquire distorted TP-3 geometries and one Cu(I) site assumes distorted (T-4) geometry. 3 Exhibits 2D-layers arranged in AB\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5AB\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5AB fashion developing 3D-network while 1 reveals 2D-sheets arranged in A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5 fashion which, also, develop 3D-network. The Cu-Cu interactions as well as Cu-C contacts are more efficient in 1 than in 3 where they adopt the formation of the [Cu2(\u03bc3-CN)2] motif.Infrared Spectra of 1 and 2The IR spectra of 1 and 2 show the IR-bands characteristic to (CuCN)n fragment and the bipodal ligands, S 1 and S 2, respectively. The (CuCN)n fragment absorbs IR radiation at wavenumbers in the normal range of \u03bdC\u2261N; 2117 cm-1 for 1 and 2160, 2124 and 2103 cm-1 for 2. It is worth mentioned that the \u03bdC\u2261N bands of 1 and 2 are different than those of K3[Cu(CN)4] that is potentially used as one of the adducts for the formation of 1 and 2, while they are similar to those of CuCN; 2168, 2123 and 2104 cm-1 [51]. The \u03bdC\u2261N bands of K3[Cu(CN)4] appear at 2081, 2075, 2040 and 2032 cm-1, in addition to a weak band at 2170 cm-1 which is characteristic of the T-4 configured [Cu(CN)4]-3 unit. It is obvious that the cyanide group acts as a bidentate ligand connecting the copper atoms forming nonlinear chains. This opinion is further supported by the appearance of the medium band, in the IR spectra of 1 and 2, at 410 and 407 cm-1, respectively, due to the stretching vibrations of the Cu-C bond. The IR spectra of 1 and 2 reveal, also, the characteristic bands of the bipodal ligands as compared with those of qox and qaz at 1590, 1580, 1497, 1208 cm-1 for 1 and at 1619, 1578, 1545, 1492, 1212 cm-1 for 2. The C-H bonds of qox absorb at 3067, 3043, 1356, 862 and 758 cm-1 while for qaz, they absorb at 3065, 3042, 1427, 1405, 1379, 1306, 870 and 754 cm-1. The overtone and combination bands appear as weak ones in the region of 1973-1722 cm-1. These data indicate the participation of the cyanide and the bipodal ligands in the coordination sphere of the copper atoms. The absence of the bands due to stretching vibrations of the butyl or the methyl groups as well as the band due to \u03bdSn-C advocates the absence of the organotin unit in the network structures of 1 and 2. Thus, the IR spectra of 1 and 2 support the presence of the nonlinear (CuCN)n chains and the bipodal ligands.NMR Spectra of qox, qaz, 1 and 2The 1H-NMR spectrum of 1 displays one sharp singlet peak at 8.93 ppm which can be assigned to the two protons of the CH=N moiety of qox since they are chemically and magnetically equivalent, while the aromatic protons give rise to two multiplet peaks at 8.054-8.11 and 7.84-7.87 ppm corresponding to H (5,8) and H (6,7), respectively. This assignment was supported by consulting the 1H-NMR spectrum of 1 with that of qox, which exhibits sharp singlet and two multiplets at 8.92, 8.04-8.09 and 7.82-7.84 ppm corresponding to H(2), H(3), H(5,8) and H(6,7), respectively. On the other hand, the 1H-NMR spectrum of 2 shows two singlets at 9.59 and 9.28 ppm corresponding to the protons H(4) and H(2) of the CH=N moiety of qaz, respectively, while he aromatic protons give rise to one doublet and two broad multiplets at 8.13, 8.00 and 7.85 ppm corresponding to absorption of the protons; H(8), H(5,7) and H(6), respectively. This assignment was supported by consulting the 1H-NMR spectrum of 2 with that of qaz, which exhibits two sharp singlet, one doublet and two multiplets at 9.58, 9.27, 8.10-8.14, 7.97-8.00 and 7.73-7.77 ppm corresponding to H(4), H(2), H(8), H(5,7) and H(6), respectively. It is observed that the peaks of 1 and 2 are generally shifted to downfield relative to those of qox and qaz indicating the coordination of qox or qaz to the copper atoms. Thus, 1H-NMR spectra supported the presence of qox and qaz in the structures of 1 and 2. The absence of the peaks corresponding to the organotin units reveals that the structures of 1 and 2 are free from the (Me)3Sn and (n-Bu)3Sn units.Mass Spectrum of 2The structure elucidation of 2 by the mass spectrometry (MS) approach seems to be essentially helpful where the single crystal X-ray structure is not available, S 3. The mass spectrum of 2 exhibits the base peak at m/z 130 corresponding to the molecular ion of qaz. Fragmentation of qaz ion gives rise to peaks at m/z = 50, 76 and 103 due to [C4H2]+, [C6H4]+ and [C7H5N]+, respectively, Scheme 3. The ion peaks at m/z = 154, 194, 220, 258 and 284 are due to [Cu2CN]+, [Cu-qaz]+, [CuCNqaz]+, [Cu2qaz]+ and [Cu2CNqaz]+, fragments, respectively. The mass spectrum exhibits the ion peaks at m/z = 309, 620 and 928 corresponding to [Cu2(CN)2qaz]+ \u2261 [M]+, [Cu4(CN)4(qaz)2]+ \u2261 [2 M]+ and [Cu6(CN)6(qaz)3]+ \u2261 [3 M]+, respectively. These ion peaks indicate the polymeric nature of 2. Also, the mass spectrum displays the ion peaks at m/z = 332, 372, 505, 532 and 593 corresponding to [Cu4(CN)3]+, [Cu3(CN)2qaz]+, [Cu3(CN)2(qaz)2]+, [Cu3(CN)3(qaz)2]+ and [Cu4(CN)3(qaz)2]+, respectively. In addition, the mass spectrum shows the ion peaks at m/z = 658, 710, 835, 860 and 1017 corresponding to [Cu5(CN)3(qaz)2]+, [Cu5(CN)5(qaz)2]+, [Cu7(CN)5(qaz)2]+, [Cu7(CN)6(qaz)2]+ and [Cu7(CN)7(qaz)3]+, respectively. Thus, the mass spectrum of 2 confirms the presence of the bipodal ligand; qaz, CuCN fragment. Also, it supports the polymeric nature of the Cu2(CN)2 building blocks.Thermogravimetric Analyses of 1 and 2The SCP 1 and 2 undergo thermolyses in three steps, Table 4. The first step takes place in the temperature range 170-250 \u00b0C, and it corresponds to the release of two qox molecules or one qaz molecule. The second step corresponds to the loss of four cyanide groups (1) or two cyanide groups (2) in the temperature range 300-470 \u00b0C. This step is followed by an increase in the mass in the temperature range 480-550 \u00b0C due to the gain of mass of oxygen. At higher temperatures over 600 \u00b0C, the residues suffer oxidation leading to the final product of cuprite. Also, the molecular weight of the residues obtained after complete thermolyses of 1 and 2 are coincident with Cu2O. The thermogravimetric analysis data of 1 and 2 indicated their stability up to 170 \u00b0C as well as the presence of CuCN fragment and qox or qaz in the structures of 1 and 2, respectively.X-Ray powder Diffraction and Structure of the SCP 2X-ray powder diffraction of [Cu2(CN)2qaz]\u221e, 2; shows diffraction pattern which is different than the simulated patterns calculated from the X-ray single crystal data of 1 or that of [(CuCN)4qaz] [21], Fig. 5. The structure of 1 contains the CuCN building blocks which form puckered chains connected by \u03bc2-qox ligand. The 3D-network structure contains six-membered rings of Cu6(CN)4(qox)2. The structure of [(CuCN)4qaz] prepared by hydrothermal method comprises of two sets of CuCN chains. In one chain, propagating parallel to the b-axis alternating Cu(2) and Cu(3) atoms are 2-coordinate and 3-coordinate, respectively. In the other chain, running between the a- and c-axes, Cu(4) is 2-coordinate and Cu(1) is 3-coordinate, respectively. The sets of CuCN chains are linked by qaz units. \u03c0-Stacking of qaz ligands is evident in addition to Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu interaction [21]. However, the X-ray powder diffraction of 2 shows the peaks in the 2\u03b8 region of 20-35 which resemble those found in that of [(CuCN)4qaz] [21]. The structure of 2 exhibits different Cu:CN stoichiometric ratio than that of 3 and [(CuCN)4qaz]. The structure of 2 exhibits different XRPD pattern than that of 1 although, the two structures have the same Cu:CN:L stoichiometric ratio. Thus, the difference between the structures of 1 and 2 may come from the fact that only one nitrogen site of qaz is involved in coordination with Cu atom. Indeed, one could not argue the structure of 2 only by using IR, NMR and mass spectra as well as elemental analysis. The chemical composition and the polymeric nature of 2 are the only information that one should suggest bearing in mind the bridging capability of the cyanide and the qaz ligands as well as versatility nature of Cu(I) topology which lead to the formation of 3D-networks.Electronic Absorption and Emission Spectra of 1 and 2Qox and qaz are similar to naphthalene in electronic structure except that qox and qaz have lower-lying (n,\u03c0*) states. In this case, the spectra of qox and qaz resemble that of naphthalene [48]. However, it is to be expected that the \u03c0* levels are appreciably lowered in the diazanaphthalenes and that the n \u2192 \u03c0* transitions are shifted far enough to the red to make them discernible. The electronic absorption spectra of qox and qaz display four absorption bands at 215-220, 270, 308-310 and 325 nm, Table 5. These bands correspond to 1Bb \u2190 1A, 1La \u2190 1A, 1Lb \u2190 1A and n \u2192 \u03c0* transitions, respectively. The band at 325 nm disappears on the addition of HCl supporting the n \u2192 \u03c0* transition. These bands appear at more or less the same wavelengths in the electronic absorption spectra of 1 and 2, Table 5. However, the band at 325 nm in the spectra of qox and qaz disappears in the spectra of 1 and 2 due to coordination of qox or qaz to the copper atoms and/or the formation of hydrogen bonds. The emission spectra of qox and qaz display one broad symmetrical band at 420 and 450 nm, respectively corresponding to the 1(n,\u03c0*) \u2192 So fluorescence of qox or qaz [52]. On the other hand, the emission spectra of 1 and 2 display three bands centered at 385-390, 418-420 and 475-480 nm, Table 5. The emission band of qox or qaz suffers a shift to higher energy in the emission spectra of 1 and 2 under the effect of coordination of qox and qaz to the copper site. On the other hand, the possible photophysical sources of luminescence behavior in 1 and 2, for the remaining two peaks at 390 and 475 nm, can be argued to the MC transition and MLCT, respectively. The emission band at 390 nm of 1 and that at 385 nm of 2 resembles that of CuCN [2] which is assumed to arise from transitions from the lowest excited-triplet state to the ground state. Lifetime studies of soluble Cu(1)-cyano species have suggested that emission is usually a phosphorescence phenomenon [53, 54]. Thus, 1 and 2 are present examples of room-temperature luminescent Cu-containing polymers which can be used in applications as molecular sensing systems.Catalytic StudiesFifteen percent of the total world production of dyes is lost during the dyeing process and is released in the textile effluent [55]. The release of that colored wastewater in the ecosystem is a dramatic source of esthetic pollution, and perturbation in aquatic life. Different techniques have been used for this purpose, e.g. adsorption, oxidation, reduction, and electrochemical reactions. Recent investigations revealed that reactive dyes could be decolorized by advanced oxidation processes [56-58]. The catalytic oxidation of MY dye was studied using H2O2 as oxidant and the MOF 1 and 2 as heterogeneous catalysts. When a solution of MY dye was mixed with hydrogen peroxide, no reaction can be observed. However, when the MOF catalyst 1 or 2 was added, a reaction occurred leading to a color removal of the dye at \u03bbmax = 435 nm, Fig. 6. The final solution is completely bleached after 3-3.5 h as illustrated by the absorption spectra of MY in water (at \u03bbmax = 435 nm) at the beginning and end of the reaction, Fig. 6. The catalytic activity of 1 is more pronounced than that of 2 since the ratio of degradation decreases on going from 1 to 2. After 60 min, there is a fast degradation of MY dye. On the other hand, after 2 h about 76% of MY dye is degraded in the case of catalyst 1 while for 2 about 62% of MY dye is degraded. This means that the two MOF 1 and 2 have catalytic activity towards the degradation of MY dye. An important issue that must be addressed while studying liquid-phase oxidations over a solid catalyst is a possibility of catalyst recycling. In each case, after the end of the first experiment, the catalyst is washed with double distilled water, dried, and then starting a new experiment. It was found that the MOF 1 and 2 maintained their catalytic activity for two cycles of the dye oxidation with hydrogen peroxide. It is worth mentioned here that the components of these MOF (CuCN and the organic ligands) have no catalytic activity towards the degradation of MY dye when they are tested at the same conditions. On the other hand, investigation of the catalysts after the catalytic cycle by elemental analysis and the IR spectra show that the catalysts are stable keeping their identity. Also, magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that the used catalysts are still diamagnetic which indicates that the structures of the MOF catalysts 1 and 2 after the catalytic cycles remain containing the Cu(I)CN building blocks. Further study concerning the mechanism and the factors affecting the reaction rate is currently carried out.Supplementary DataCCDC 805390 contains the supplementary crystallographic data for 1.
