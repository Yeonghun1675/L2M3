id=\"Sec1\" sec-type=\"introduction\"><title>Introduction</title><p id=\"Par3\">Exploring ways of obtaining nanomaterials [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR1\">1</xref>] and their properties [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>] is crucial for future technical and technological development [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>]. An important question is the synthesis of nanoparticles with different chemical composition, sizes, shapes and structures [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR4\">4</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR8\">8</xref>]. The applications of nanomaterials are so numerous, that practically all domains can benefit [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR9\">9</xref>]. Nanomaterials have broad applications in a variety of fields because of their unusual and size dependent optical, magnetic, electronic and chemical properties [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR11\">11</xref>]. Physical properties and applications of nanostructured materials are heavily dependent upon how they are prepared. Among a variety of approaches, the utilization of ultrasound for materials synthesis has been extensively examined over many years, and is now positioned as one of the most powerful tools in nanostructured materials synthesis. Chemistry deals with the interaction between energy and matter, and chemical reactions require some form of energy (e.g., heat, light, radiation, electric potential, etc.) to proceed [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR12\">12</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref>]. Precise control over chemical reactions is a key to the success of nanostructured materials synthesis, but currently such control is limited to the manipulations of various reaction parameters including time, energy input, and pressure [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>]. Ultrasound propagation in aqueous salt solutions leads to the hydrolysis, reduction, complexation, decomplexation and crystallization. Arnim Henglein initiated a series of experiments and reported some fundamental findings in aqueous solutions containing inorganic species and explained in terms of free radical formation due to sonolytic dissociation of water and resulting into the formation of reactive species such as; H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> and reduction of several metal cations or their precipitation as corresponding hydroxides. In 1986, initiated a series of systematic and well defined research, unfolding several new applications of ultrasound in the areas involving organic syntheses, polymerization, degradation, waste water treatment, metal catalysis, extraction processes of natural products, cell disruption, food technology, industrial scale up operations, photocatalysis, electrosonolytic and several such combinatorial techniques to name just few of these activities [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>]. The size and physical appearances of the crystals grown under ultrasonic medium has, however, attracted the attention recently [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>] due to its application in the synthesis and growth of nanometer to centimeter sized crystals on an industrial scale [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR17\">17</xref>]. Sonochemical method for crystallization, with controllable conditions is rapid besides, being able to produce crystals of uniform size, high purity and narrow size distribution [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>]. The acoustic cavitation process offers significant potential for modifying and improving products in terms of their crystal purity and morphological forms [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR19\">19</xref>], even in ambient conditions. The electrical [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR20\">20</xref>] and optical properties [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>], which depend upon the size and shape of inorganic nanocrystals, can be controlled better using ultrasound. Thus, the crystals of desired molecular shape, symmetry and intermolecular forces can be synthesized [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR22\">22</xref>] through the variation in the concentration of precursors and sonication time [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>].</p><p id=\"Par4\">In this investigation, a novel polymer of [Ni(dipic)<sub>2</sub>Mn(O)<sub>2</sub>] was prepared by two methods, reflux and sonochemistry and confirmed by various techniques.

Figure\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig5\">5</xref> shows the SEM for these polymers. Images show, the particles size of polymer was prepared by reflux is bigger than the grain size of the sample was prepared by sonochemical method with the same concentration because of, preparation methods are different for these polymers and sonochemistry usage of high intensity ultrasound, therefore is a good synthetic method for preparation nanostructured materials that are often unavailable by other method [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>].</p><p id=\"Par11\">The comparison structural of these polymers were done by X-ray powder diffraction analysis (XRD). Figure\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig6\">6</xref>a shows the XRD graph for the typical sample of this polymer was prepared by sonochemical process (<bold>1</bold>).

Figures indicate that the structure obtained by sonochemical process is identical to structure was obtained by single crystal owing to, as shown in Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig6\">6</xref> in these XRD graphs number of pages are match to gather in these structures. For comparison the thermal stability of polymer structures synthesized by sonochemistry and reflux methods, thermal gravimetric (TG) was performed between 25 and 1000\u00a0\u00b0C under a flow of dry air. The TGA curves show that the decomposition of polymer is a multiple step process and the final fragment weight corresponds to the metal oxide. The TGA graph for single crystal indicates three peaks. The first peak at around 60\u201380\u00a0\u00b0C corresponds to the removal of lattice water molecule. The second peak at around 110\u2013130\u00a0\u00b0C is due to the loss of coordinated water molecules. The final peak at 427\u00a0\u00b0C is related to decomposition of whole structure (Fig.\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig7\">7</xref>). Polymer was prepared by sonochemistry is minor stable and started to decomposition at 40\u00a0\u00b0C. Decomposition of polymer <bold>1</bold> achieved earlier than of its single crystal <bold>2</bold>, maybe due to the much higher surface to volume ratio of this structure is needed to the less of heat for destruction of its structure [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR25\">25</xref>].

An important question is the synthesis of nanoparticles with different chemical composition, sizes, shapes and structures [4-8]. The applications of nanomaterials are so numerous, that practically all domains can benefit [9]. Nanomaterials have broad applications in a variety of fields because of their unusual and size dependent optical, magnetic, electronic and chemical properties [10, 11]. Physical properties and applications of nanostructured materials are heavily dependent upon how they are prepared. Among a variety of approaches, the utilization of ultrasound for materials synthesis has been extensively examined over many years, and is now positioned as one of the most powerful tools in nanostructured materials synthesis. Chemistry deals with the interaction between energy and matter, and chemical reactions require some form of energy (e.g., heat, light, radiation, electric potential, etc.) to proceed [12, 13]. Precise control over chemical reactions is a key to the success of nanostructured materials synthesis, but currently such control is limited to the manipulations of various reaction parameters including time, energy input, and pressure [14]. Ultrasound propagation in aqueous salt solutions leads to the hydrolysis, reduction, complexation, decomplexation and crystallization. Arnim Henglein initiated a series of experiments and reported some fundamental findings in aqueous solutions containing inorganic species and explained in terms of free radical formation due to sonolytic dissociation of water and resulting into the formation of reactive species such as; H2O2, O3 and reduction of several metal cations or their precipitation as corresponding hydroxides. In 1986, initiated a series of systematic and well defined research, unfolding several new applications of ultrasound in the areas involving organic syntheses, polymerization, degradation, waste water treatment, metal catalysis, extraction processes of natural products, cell disruption, food technology, industrial scale up operations, photocatalysis, electrosonolytic and several such combinatorial techniques to name just few of these activities [15]. The size and physical appearances of the crystals grown under ultrasonic medium has, however, attracted the attention recently [16] due to its application in the synthesis and growth of nanometer to centimeter sized crystals on an industrial scale [17]. Sonochemical method for crystallization, with controllable conditions is rapid besides, being able to produce crystals of uniform size, high purity and narrow size distribution [18]. The acoustic cavitation process offers significant potential for modifying and improving products in terms of their crystal purity and morphological forms [19], even in ambient conditions. The electrical [20] and optical properties [21], which depend upon the size and shape of inorganic nanocrystals, can be controlled better using ultrasound. Thus, the crystals of desired molecular shape, symmetry and intermolecular forces can be synthesized [22] through the variation in the concentration of precursors and sonication time [23].In this investigation, a novel polymer of [Ni(dipic)2Mn(O)2] was prepared by two methods, reflux and sonochemistry and confirmed by various techniques. The thermal behavior of this structure was studied by Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) method. Magnetic property of this polymer was studied by VSM.ExperimentalMaterials and MethodAll synthetic work was done at room temperature. Ni(NO3)2.6H2O, Mn(NO3)2.4H2O, Fe(NO3)3.9H2O, pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, and sodium hydroxide were obtained and used as received from Aldrich Chemical Co. FT-IR spectra were recorded as KBr pellets on a FT-IR JASCO 460 spectrophotometer. Measurements of C, H and N were applied using a Pakin-Elmer 2400 CHN elemental analyzer. TGA was used for investigation the weight changes of structures by using TGA-PL England equipment. The sample, ca.3 mg, was deposited in Pt cell at heating rate 10 \u00b0C/min. The morphology of polymers was studied by scanning electron microscopy technique (SEM) using a VEGA\\\\TESCAN-XMU equipment. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area measurements and pore volumes were measured with the nitrogen physistroption at -196 \u00b0C using a Quantachrome NOVA 4200e apparatus. Phase analysis for sample were prepared by sonochemistry was evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu-K\u03b1 radiation between 0\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 (2\u03b8) with step size 0.02 \u00b0/s recorded on a diffractometer model X'Pert MPD. The XRD graph for single crystal was prepared using Mercury software.Synthesis Single Crystal of [Ni(dipic)2Mn(O)2]n by RefluxThe equivalent molar ratios of two metal nitrates [5.0 mL of Ni(NO3)2 (0.50 mmol) + 5 mL of Mn(NO3)2 (0.50 mmol)] in the presence of iron (III) nitrate nonahydrate as catalyst were dissolved in 10.0 mL of distilled water, next pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (167 mg, 1.00 mmol) and an aqua solution (2.0 mL) of NaOH (80 mg, 2.0 mmol) were added gutty to this solution. The mixture was stirred at room temperature. Solution filtered off and left to evaporate at room temperature. After 5 days, green crystals of [Ni(dipic)2Mn(O)2]n were formed 57 % yield based on metal nitrates. Anal. Cal. for C14 H6 Ni N2Mn O10: C, 35.29; H, 1.26; N, 5.88 Found: C, 35.06; H, 1.01; N, 5.73.Sonochemical Synthesis of [Ni(dipic)2Mn(O)2]nFor preparation the polymer of [Ni(dipic)2Mn(O)2]n, 10 mL aqueous solution of nickel (II) nitrate hexahydrate (0.1 M) and manganese(II) nitrate tetrahydrate (0.1 M) in the presence of iron (III) nitrate nonahydrate as catalyst, under the ultrasonic irradiation, (10 mL) aqueous solution of pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (0.2 M) and (10 mL) of sodium hydroxide (0.4 M) were added gutty under high-density ultrasonic probe, operating at 20 kHz with a maximum power output of 300 W for 1 h. Solution filtered off and left to evaporate at room temperature. After 5 days green crystals of [Ni(dipic)2Mn(O)2]n were formed 57 % yield based on metal nitrates. Anal. Cal. for C14 H6 Ni N2Mn O10: C, 35.29; H, 1.26; N, 5.88 Found: C, 35.21; H, 1.12; N, 5.74.Result and DiscussionThe Crystallography data collections and structure refinement of [Ni(dipic)2Mn(O)2]n are listed in Table 1. Bond lengths and bond angles for single crystal 2 are listed in Table 2. Figure 1, shows the ORTEP diagram for [Ni(dipic)2Mn(O)2]n. The X-ray single crystal of 2 shows, in the structure of polymer [Ni(dipic)2Mn(O)2]n, nickel center achieves hexacoordination by coordinating with two deprotonated dipicolinate groups, which acting as tridentate chelating ligands. The MnII center is tetra-coordination with four \u00b5-carboxylate oxygen from [Ni(dipic)2]2-. The title polymer crystallized in the monoclinic space group Cc. Figure 2 shows packing for this polymer approximately along b and c. Figure 3. Show octahedral geometry around Ni center for single crystal.The FT-IR spectrum of [Ni(dipic)2Mn(O)2]n was prepared by reflux method (Fig. 4a) show broad absorption bonds at 3385 cm-1, assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric \u03c5(H2O) stretching vibration of coordinated and lattice water molecules. The stretching vibrations of the dipicolinate carboxylate groups were observed at 1621, 1432 cm-1 for \u03c5as (COO), and 1383, 1339 and 1284 cm-1, for \u03c5s (COO), respectively. The FT-IR spectrum of polymer 1 as shown in Fig. 4b is the same to FT-IR of polymer 2.The morphology of polymers were synthesized by sonochemical and reflux, were characterized by SEM. Figure 5 shows the SEM for these polymers. Images show, the particles size of polymer was prepared by reflux is bigger than the grain size of the sample was prepared by sonochemical method with the same concentration because of, preparation methods are different for these polymers and sonochemistry usage of high intensity ultrasound, therefore is a good synthetic method for preparation nanostructured materials that are often unavailable by other method [24].The comparison structural of these polymers were done by X-ray powder diffraction analysis (XRD). Figure 6a shows the XRD graph for the typical sample of this polymer was prepared by sonochemical process (1). Figure 6b shows the XRD graph from single crystal 2 and this pattern obtained using Mercury software. Figures indicate that the structure obtained by sonochemical process is identical to structure was obtained by single crystal owing to, as shown in Fig. 6 in these XRD graphs number of pages are match to gather in these structures. For comparison the thermal stability of polymer structures synthesized by sonochemistry and reflux methods, thermal gravimetric (TG) was performed between 25 and 1000 \u00b0C under a flow of dry air. The TGA curves show that the decomposition of polymer is a multiple step process and the final fragment weight corresponds to the metal oxide. The TGA graph for single crystal indicates three peaks. The first peak at around 60-80 \u00b0C corresponds to the removal of lattice water molecule. The second peak at around 110-130 \u00b0C is due to the loss of coordinated water molecules. The final peak at 427 \u00b0C is related to decomposition of whole structure (Fig. 7). Polymer was prepared by sonochemistry is minor stable and started to decomposition at 40 \u00b0C. Decomposition of polymer 1 achieved earlier than of its single crystal 2, maybe due to the much higher surface to volume ratio of this structure is needed to the less of heat for destruction of its structure [25]. The polymer was prepared by sonochemistry has a higher surface than reflux and the result of SEM images illustrated, the particles size of polymer 1 is smaller than of polymer 2.The BET surface area and pore volume for polymer 2 are 76.54 m2/gr and 0.328 cm3/gr, respectively these parameters for polymer 1 are 143.27 m2/gr and 0.523 cm3/gr because of, the particles size outcome of 2 are smaller than of 1. Figure 8 shows magnetization curves at room temperature for 1 and 2. Both of these polymer exhibit paramagnetic behavior.Conclusion In this work new polymer of [Ni(dipic)2Mn(O)2]n was synthesized using reflux method and characterized by SC-XRD and elemental analysis. In different method this polymer was prepared by sonochemistry, next these structures compared by, FT-IR spectroscopy,XRD and SEM, BET specific surface area, TGA and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The results confirmed, these structures are the same but polymer 1 have smaller particles than polymer 2 Thermal behavior of these structures confirmed, decomposition of polymer 1 performed earlier than of its single crystal 2. Magnetization curves confirmed these polymers exhibit paramagnetic behavior.AcknowledgmentsThe authors are grateful to the University of Sistan and Baluchestan for financial support.References1.AlivisatosAPJ.
