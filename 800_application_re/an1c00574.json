Thus, the mixing efficiency of this 3D chaotic micromixer was estimated by the COMSOL software. As can be seen in a,b, the simulation results show that the mixing efficiency of the micromixer is about 93%, indicating that the 3D micromixer has a good mixing effect. To evaluate the actual mixing efficiency of this micromixer, a blue dye and water were injected from the middle and both sides with the same flow rate (10 \u03bcL/min), respectively. The microscope was used to collect the images at the inlet and outlet. c shows two obvious boundary lines (Inlet), indicating that the dye at the center is separate from the water on both sides. As shown in d, the color looks uniform (outlet), indicating that blue dye has mixed well with the water. To further evaluate the mixing performance, the image processing software (Image J) was used to analyze the images. As shown in e, the gray values display three visible levels from top to bottom at the inlet. However, the gray values tend to be uniform at the outlet, further demonstrating that blue dye and water have been well mixed by the 3D micromixer. Furthermore, the mixing efficiency could be calculated by the following equation 1    \u03c3 =     1   N - 1      \u2211   i = 1   N      (   X   i   -   X\u0305   i   )   2         2      M   e   = 1 -      \u03c3   2       \u03c3   max   2        where \u03c3 is the standard deviation, X  i  is the normalized color intensity at point i, X\u0305  i  is the average color intensity, and \u03c3max is the maximum standard deviation at the inlet. The mixing efficiency of the micromixer was calculated as ~80%, indicating that the immune MNPs, Salmonella, and the immune Fe-MOF/PtNPs could be well mixed through the 3D micromixer.\n\nBecause the concentration of Salmonella was related to Fe-MOF/PtNPs on the sandwich complexes, the relationship between the temperature change and the amount of Fe-MOF/PtNPs was established. Different concentrations of immune Fe-MOF/PtNPs were used to catalyze 50 \u03bcL of H2O2 (10 M) and the produced heat was measured using this thermal sensor. As shown in b, the temperature increase changes from 2.63 to 42.74 \u00b0C with the concentration of immune Fe-MOF/PtNPs increasing from 0.025 to 0.5 mg/mL. A linear relationship between temperature increase (\u0394T) and Fe-MOF/PtNPs concentration (C) is found and can be described as \u0394T = 81.841*C + 2.298 (R 2 = 0.993). To further demonstrate the merit of this thermal measurement method, it was compared with the common method using a sample bottle (2 mL) and a pressure meter. As shown in b, the temperature increase (\u0394T) changes while the pressure change (\u0394P) does not change when the concentration of immune Fe-MOF/PtNPs is lower than 0.1 mg/mL, indicating that this proposed method could detect a lower concentration of immune Fe-MOF/PtNPs than the common method. Besides, the slope of the calibration curve of this proposed method is bigger than that of the common method, verifying that this proposed method has a higher sensitivity.\n\nOptimization of the Microfluidic Immunosensor\n\nIt has been reported that PtNPs and Fe-MOFs exhibit excellent peroxidase-like activity, and the modification of Fe-MOF with PtNPs might enhance the activity due to their strong synergistic effect. The load capacity of Fe-MOFs with PtNPs is crucial to this immunosensor. Thus, different volumes of PtNPs from 0.5 to 4 mL were added into the same amount (2 mg) of Fe-MOFs to prepare Fe-MOF/PtNPs, which were further evaluated by catalyzing H2O2 into O2 to push H2O to react with the preloaded CaO powder (0.5 g) and employing the thermal sensor to monitor the temperature increase. As can be seen in Figure S6a, when the volume of PtNPs changes from 0 to 2 mL, the temperature increase (\u0394T) changes from 8.33 to 30.91 \u00b0C. This is because of the synergistic effect of PtNPs and Fe-MOFs on the catalysis of H2O2, resulting in the production of more O2 and thus the involvement of more H2O in the exothermic reaction between CaO and H2O. However, the further increase in 4 mL does not lead to obviously more increase in the temperature, indicating that 2 mL of PtNPs is sufficient to modify 2 mg of Fe-MOFs. Thus, the optimal volume for PtNPs was 2 mL.\n\nAnalytical Performance of the Immunosensor\n\nVarious concentrations of Salmonella were detected to estimate the analytical performance of the immunosensor. As can be seen in a and S7, the temperature increase (\u0394T) increases with the concentration of Salmonella. A good linear relationship is observed between temperature increase (\u0394T) and concentration (C) of Salmonella (1.01 \u00d7 102 to 1.01 \u00d7 106 CFU/mL), which could be expressed as \u0394T = 6.065log(C) - 9.126 (R 2 = 0.976). According to 3 times the signal-to-noise ratio, the detection limit of the immunosensor was calculated as 93 CFU/mL. As shown in , this immunosensor exhibits higher sensitivity and shorter time compared to some reported methods for bacterial detection. The good performance of the immunosensor may be due to the following reasons: (1) the Fe-MOF/PtNPs were employed for dual-signal amplification due to large surface area of Fe-MOFs and strong synergistic effect between Fe-MOFs and PtNPs; (2) the microfluidic chip with a 3D micromixer was employed to enhance the mixing effect and achieve automatic operation; and (3) the smartphone-based thermal sensor was used with a strong exothermic reaction between CaO and H2O to achieve a rapid, sensitive, and contactless measurement of the detection signal. Besides, transmission electron microscopy was performed and shown in b to verify the successful formation of MNP-Salmonella-Fe-MOF/PtNPs sandwich complexes.\n\nTo further estimate the potential application of the immunosensor for Salmonella detection in food samples, chicken meat samples including Salmonella from 1.96 \u00d7 102 CFU/mL to 1.96 \u00d7 104 CFU/mL were detected. Table S1 shows that the recoveries for 1.96 \u00d7 102 to 1.96 \u00d7 104 CFU/mL are 115.81, 95.06, and 90.95%, respectively. These results demonstrated the feasibility of the immunosensor to detect Salmonella in chicken meats.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn summary, a microfluidic immunosensor using Fe-MOF/PtNPs as a nanozyme for signal amplification, the microfluidic chip with the 3D micromixer for automatic operations, and the smartphone-based thermal sensor for signal measurement was successfully developed.
