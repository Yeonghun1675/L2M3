When we used the PCN separator, the open-circuit\npotential dropped slightly and was maintained at 2.91 V after 2 h.\nThese results suggested the suppression of the diffusion of polyselenides\nby the PCN separator.

This initial process of \u223c100\ncycles was attributed to activation of the Li\u2013Se cells leading\nto a highly reversible and stable electrochemical performance, consistent\nwith the observation in Li\u2013S cells.

Here, we show that a cation-selective PCN separator of PCN-250(Fe) metal-organic frameworks coated on a porous polypropylene membrane suppresses polyselenide shuttle and enhances lithium-ion transport in lithium-selenium batteries. The Lewis acid sites of this PCN separator acted as selective barriers that immobilized polyselenides and provided uniform and stable lithium nucleation and growth during cycling. Lithium-selenium cells with the PCN separator had a stable and reversible electrochemical performance with a high discharge capacity of 423 mAh/g at C/5 and a Coulombic efficiency of >98% for 500 cycles. This work provides a guide for developing high-performance lithium-selenium batteries by a cation-selective separator strategy. This PCN separator can be applied to alkali-metal and alkali-metal chalcogenide battery systems.\n\nMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of porous solids with uniform pore structures and coordinated unsaturated sites. MOFs have narrow pore widths and interconnected pores that enable the diffusion of Li+ and function as a physical barrier to larger ions in an electrolyte. Moreover, MOFs have coordinated unsaturated sites (Lewis acid characteristics) that can capture Lewis bases, such as polyselenides and TFSI anions. Among various MOFs, PCN-250 (also known as MIL-127 and Fe-soc-MOF) is a class of MOFs constructed from trinuclear iron oxo clusters (Fe3-\u03bc3-oxo clusters) and tetratopic azobenzene-based linkers (3,3',5,5'-azobenzene tetracarboxylate) (Figure S1). PCN-250 has a small pore width of 5.9 \u00c5 and a high surface area of ~1500 m2/g. This MOF is robust and stable in solutions with pH 1 to 12. These characteristics make PCN-250 a good candidate as a separator modifier.\n\nPCN Separator Prevents Self-Discharge Process\n\nOne of the major challenges in the practical use of Li-Se batteries is their self-discharge caused by the diffusion of polyselenides. To determine the ability of the PCN separator to prevent self-discharging, we evaluated the open-circuit voltage (OCV) behavior of Li/Se cells with the PCN separator during 12 h (C). When we used polypropylene as a control, the open-circuit potential continually decreased and reached 2.72 V after 12 h. This continual decrease in the open-circuit voltage occurred because of the diffusion of soluble polyselenides and reaction with the lithium anode. When we used the PCN separator, the open-circuit potential dropped slightly and was maintained at 2.91 V after 2 h. These results suggested the suppression of the diffusion of polyselenides by the PCN separator. These OCV results corroborated the permeation test (B).\n\nPCN Separator as an Anionic Sieve to Enhance the Li+ Plating/Stripping Stability\n\nTo assess the relative Li+ transport in the cell with the PCN separator, we performed Li+ transference number measurements. As a control, the Li+ transference number of the cell with the polypropylene separator was 0.38 (A), similar to reported values. The cell with the PCN separator yielded a Li+ transference number of 0.72, much higher than that of the cell with the polypropylene separator. This substantial increase in the Li+ transference number indicated the facile and selective transit of Li+ through the PCN separator. Moreover, these results also implied that the PCN separator prevented the diffusion of TFSI anions to the anode side, in contrast to the property of the polypropylene separator. These results further explained the presence of TFSI- peaks after soaking PCN-250 in the electrolyte (C).\n\nNext, we determined the diffusion coefficients using the cyclic voltammograms at different scan rates (Figure S6). The calculated diffusion coefficients for the cell with the polypropylene separator were ~10-13 to 10-12 cm2/s (Table S4). These values agreed with the reported values. For the PCN separator, the calculated diffusion coefficients were 10-12-10-11 cm2/s. A higher diffusion coefficient of the cell with the PCN separator, compared with the polypropylene separator, suggested that the PCN separator had better electrochemical performance and corroborated the lower charge transfer resistance measured by impedance spectroscopy (B).\n\nElectrochemical Performance of the Cell with a PCN Separator\n\nTo better understand the cell redox behavior, we measured the electrochemical performance of Li/Se cells with the PCN separator at different charge/discharge rates (C-rates). The cell with a PCN separator had better performance than the cell with the polypropylene separator (A). When cycling at different C-rates, the capacities of the cell with the PCN separator remained relatively constant at 510 mAh/g for C/5, 360 mAh/g for C/2, 190 mAh/g for 2C, and 71 mAh/g for 4C. Then, the capacity returned to 482 mAh/g at C/5.\n\nThe Coulombic efficiency is a key indicator of cycling capability in a commercial cell. To evaluate the capacity of the cell, we initially performed galvanostatic charge-discharge of the cell with both separators at a C/10 rate for 50 cycles (B). The Li-Se cell with the polypropylene separator lost significant capacity and ended with 228 mAh/g after 50 cycles. Conversely, the cell with the PCN separator maintained a reversible capacity of 522 mAh/g after 50 cycles. These results demonstrated that the PCN separator improved electrochemical performance and capacity retention compared with the polypropylene separator.\n\nNext, we investigated the long-term cycle stability of the cell with the PCN separator. The cells were cycled at C/5 and 1C for 500 cycles (C,D). The cell with the PCN separator had a stable reversible capacity from an initial capacity of 661 mAh/g that became relatively stable (423 mAh/g) at C/5 after the 100th cycle. This initial process of ~100 cycles was attributed to activation of the Li-Se cells leading to a highly reversible and stable electrochemical performance, consistent with the observation in Li-S cells. The capacity retention rate of ~64% with a decay rate as low as 0.07% per cycle for 500 cycles suggested stable kinetics of the cells with the PCN separator. These results demonstrated reversible efficiency and kinetics of the cell using a PCN separator compared with the cell with a polypropylene separator, consistent with the stable electrochemical performance of the CV measurement.\n\nAs a control, the cell with the polypropylene separator had lower capacity than the PCN separator cell at both C/5 and 1C. Moreover, the cell with the polypropylene separator required an initial activation as shown in a progressive increase in CE at both C/5 and 1C. When cycled at C/5, the cell with the polypropylene separator demonstrated an initial discharge capacity of 350 mAh/g, followed by a progressive decrease in capacity to 102 mAh/g after 500 cycles. Thus, the capacity retention of the cell with polypropylene was 29% with an average decay rate of 0.14% per cycle for 500 cycles. Next, we cycled the cell at 1C. As expected, the discharge capacity of the cell with the polypropylene separator dropped rapidly to 107 mAh/g after 500 cycles, whereas the discharge capacity of the cell with the PCN separator remained relatively constant at 292 mAh/g with a >98% CE for 500 cycles. We did not observe any change in the morphology of the PCN separator after 500 cycles at 1C (Figure S7).\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe evaluated the efficacy of PCN separators to suppress the polyselenides shuttling between electrodes. The shuttling of polyselenides leads to severe self-discharge, capacity fade, low Coulombic efficiency, and cycling instability. The PCN separator eliminated these issues by blocking the diffusion of polyselenides. This blocking function enhanced Li+ transport, long-term cycling stability, and capacity retention as evidenced by a discharge capacity of 423 mAh/g at C/5 and 292 mAh/g with a >98% Coulombic efficiency at 1C over 500 cycles.\n\nConclusions\n\nShuttling of polyselenides limits the practical use of lithium-selenium batteries. We fabricated PCN separators that mitigated the shuttle effect of polyselenides. The cells demonstrated a high discharge capacity of 423 mAh/g at a C/5 current rate and 292 mAh/g at 1C with a Coulombic efficiency of >98% after 500 cycles. The PCN separator acted as a chemical sieve to suppress the shuttling of polyselenides and promote uniform Li+ transport. As a result, the cells could cycle at C/5 and 1C for 500 cycles with high-capacity retention and Coulombic efficiency.
