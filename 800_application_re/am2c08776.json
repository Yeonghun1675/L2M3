As shown in f and S8, the BET specific surface areas of Ni@CdS\u2282Zn/Co-ZIF composites are 551.2, 565.6, and 126.5 m2\u22c5g-1 with the Zn/Co ratio of 1:3, 1:1, and 3:1, respectively. Moreover, a promising CO2 uptake capacity of Ni@CdS\u2282Zn/Co-ZIF was obtained at 25 \u00b0C (g). Furthermore, UV-vis absorption diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were employed to explore the light-harvesting capacities of all of the samples. For Ni@CdS as a heterogeneous photosensitizer, Ni doping on the CdS nanoparticles broadened the visible-light response range and improved the light-harvesting ability of the hybrids (a). After the fabrication of the Zn/Co-ZIF shell on the Ni@CdS core, the light-harvesting abilities of the photocatalysts were further enhanced (b). Notably, adjusting the Zn/Co metal ratio in the matrix of the bimetallic MOF customized the light absorption capacity in the range of 550-650 nm, which benefitted from the characteristic visible-light absorption of ZIF-67-like structures. These results confirmed that both the doping of Ni on the CdS and the fabrication of the bimetallic MOF shell on the Ni@CdS core contributed to the synergistic improvement of the light-harvesting performance of the double-hybrid photocatalysts.\n\nPhotocatalytic Performance\n\nThe influence of Ni doping on the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 was evaluated first under visible light. As shown in c and Table S2, doping Ni on the surface of CdS nanoparticles improves the photocatalytic activity notably compared with that of pure CdS. Ni@CdS-3.5 exhibited the highest CO yield rate of 294.1 \u03bcmol\u22c5h-1\u22c5g-1 among all of the tested Ni@CdS nanoparticles with a moderate H2 yield rate of 1835.6 \u03bcmol\u22c5h-1\u22c5g-1, which was 18.2- and 9.2-fold higher than those of the pure CdS nanoparticles, respectively. Although prolonging the hydrothermal time could increase the content of Ni doping in Ni@CdS, Ni@CdS-5.5 did not show better selectivity for CO2 reduction (CO2RR) or higher CO yield rate than others because the formation of NiS on the surface of Ni@CdS-5.5 (c) promoted the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and simultaneously inhibited CO2RR. The results of the further control experiment shown in Figure S10 indicate that the Ni2+ metal sites in Ni@CdS mainly contribute to the hydrogen evolution reaction and thus influence the H2/CO ratio in the product via adjusting the content of Ni. Considering that Ni@CdS-3.5 exhibited highly efficient photogenerated electron transfer and superior catalytic activity in the thermodynamically and kinetically disadvantaged CO2 reduction reaction, it was chosen as the optimal sample to construct the hybrid photocatalyst. The performance of the double-hybrid Ni@CdS\u2282Zn/Co-ZIF in photocatalytic syngas production was evaluated under the same conditions. As shown in d and Table S4, all of the Ni@CdS\u2282Zn/Co-ZIF-x photocatalysts exhibit a significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance compared with that of Ni@CdS-3.5. The optimized production obtained on Ni@CdS\u2282Zn/Co-ZIF-1:3 with a CO yield rate of 948.5 \u03bcmol\u22c5h-1\u22c5g-1 of and an H2 yield rate of 2070.8 \u03bcmol\u22c5h-1\u22c5g-1. The ratio of H2/CO in syngas could be precisely adjusted from 2.2 to 2.8 with the Zn/Co ratio ranging from 1:3 to 3:1, which was hardly achieved by only Ni@CdS nanoparticles without the MOF shell. The Zn/Co-ZIF shell could automatically capture the CO2 molecules and the electronic sacrificial agents and increase their concentrations in the interface between the MOF shell and the Ni@CdS photosensitizer; furthermore, the abundant porosity of the double-hybrid photocatalyst ensured the efficient transportation of gas products.\n\nBand Structure Analyses\n\nTauc plot was conducted to investigate the band structure of Ni@CdS and Zn/Co-ZIF-1:3 catalytic systems. According to the Tauc plot of Ni@CdS-3.5 converted from the UV-vis DRS spectrum (Figure S14a), the band gap of Ni@CdS-3.5 was determined to be 2.17 eV and that of Zn/Co-ZIF-1:3 was 2.01 eV (Figure S14b). The Mott-Schottky plots calculated the flat-band potential of Ni@CdS-3.5 as -0.88 V (vs NHE), and the positive slopes of the linear parts of the Mott-Schottky plots implied that Ni@CdS-3.5 was an n-type semiconductor (Figure S15a). Generally, the flat-band potential was about 0.1 eV lower than the minimum of the conduction band (CBM) in n-type semiconductors, the whole band structure of the Ni@CdS could thus be figured out with a composition of a CBM at -0.98 V (vs NHE) and a valence band maximum (VBM) at 1.19 V (vs NHE). Similarly, the band structure of Zn/Co-ZIF-1:3 could be revealed as a flat-band potential of -0.82 V (vs NHE) (Figure S15b) with a CBM at -0.92 V (vs NHE) and a VBM at 1.09 V (vs NHE). Accordingly, the photogenerated electrons were transferred from Ni@CdS to Zn/Co-ZIF-1:3 with moderate driving power.\n\nCharge Dynamics and Mechanism Analyses\n\nTo explain the excellent activity of the composite photocatalyst in detail, the separation and transport efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes in Ni@CdS and Ni@CdS\u2282Zn/Co-ZIF, which are closely correlated to the photocatalytic activity of the hybrid catalysts, have been further studied with steady-state and transient photoluminescence (PL) spectra. As shown in a, an emission wavelength of around 535 nm with the excitation wavelength of 394 nm is observed for all of the tested samples, among which Ni@CdS exhibits the strongest PL emission, indicating that the construction of the core-shell structure of Ni@CdS\u2282Zn/Co-ZIFs readily suppresses the recombination of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs due to the highly efficient charge separation of the double-hybrid system. Furthermore, the transient PL decay spectra (b and S16) and the fitting results (Table S6) show that the average lifetime of Ni@CdS\u2282Zn/Co-ZIF-1:3 (\u03c4avg= 8.80 ns) is efficiently prolonged in comparison to that of Ni@CdS (\u03c4avg= 6.06 ns) owing to the precise manufacturing of the core-shell structure and the synergistic effect between the two hybrid compositions significantly improve the efficiency of photogenerated charge-carrier separation. The transient photocurrent response of Ni@CdS\u2282Zn/Co-ZIF further illustrates the function of bimetallic Zn/Co-ZIF in promoting electron transfer from Ni@CdS to the reaction active sites in the photocatalytic system under visible-light irradiation (c). The sharp peak appears at the beginning of lighting due to the transient accumulation and rapid recombination of photoinduced charges. It is worthy to note that adding bpy to the reaction system significantly improves the photocurrent response, which well agrees with the catalytic survey results (e) and should be attributed to the electron mediators formed by the coordination of bpy on the Co sites in the bimetallic Zn/Co-ZIF shell. \n\nNotably, according to the above experimental results shown in e, Ni@CdS\u2282Zn/Co-ZIF-1:3 with bpy also exhibited a moderate H2 yield rate of 1731.4 \u03bcmol\u22c5h-1\u22c5g-1 and the CO yield rate of 307.9 \u03bcmol\u22c5h-1\u22c5g-1 provided a higher CO yield than that of Ni@CdS-3.5 under normal conditions, which indicated that the additional bpy molecules coordinated with the Co2+ unsaturated sites in Zn/Co-ZIF to provide the active sites for CO2 conversion into CO. The proposition was further verified by a series of control recovery catalytic experiments with Ni@CdS\u2282Zn/Co-ZIF-1:3 as a typical sample (Figure S11). Furthermore, DFT calculations were also performed to further reveal the mechanism of the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. As surveyed by DFT calculations, the unit of Co2+ coordinated by two 2-methylimidazole molecules and one bpy was used to simulate the intermediate catalytic active sites on the surface of the MOF, which was compared with the commonly used [Co(bpy)3]2+ molecular catalyst (d). CO2 molecule first accepted one electron and one proton to *COOH, and the Gibbs free energy of both catalytic systems was increased, which should be regarded as the rate-determining step. The bpy coordinated MOF site showed a markedly lower energy barrier of 1.37 eV for CO2 hydrogenation to *COOH than that of [Co(bpy)3]2+ (1.52 eV), suggesting that the MOF shell promoted the activation of CO2 and the formation of crucial intermediate *COOH. In the next step, COOH* to CO* was favorable because this process was a typical \u0394G downhill reaction. In particular, the very negative \u0394G (-0.93 eV) on the hybrid MOF-bpy unit indicated that the formation and stabilization of CO* species were highly encouraged compared to those of [Co(bpy)3]2+ without the MOF support. Due to the steep uphill in \u0394G of the subsequent conversion to *CHO, the reaction tended to proceed along the relatively low \u0394G pathway to produce CO.
