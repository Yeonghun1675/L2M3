In this reaction, we hypothesize that the metal node adsorbs to the MOF template and reacts with free linkers to form a surface SBU, which then desorbs into the solution. To validate this hypothesis, we analyzed the spectra of UiO-66 during synthesis at various times using Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). a shows the complete FT-IR spectra with the carbon-oxygen double bond (C\ue5fbO 1670 cm-1) peak highlighted. The C\ue5fbO bond on the terephthalic acid must be broken for the formation of UiO-66. Hence, the absorbance intensity shows a negative value at various times of UiO-66 synthesis due to background subtraction. Furthermore, the rate of normalized intensity change of C\ue5fbO peak shows a rate increase, followed by a decrease as shown in b, which is similar to the rate increase and decrease seen in in-situ XRD (WAXS). The rate without autocatalysis does not match the rate profiles as seen in in-situ WAXS and FT-IR. The in-situ experiments validate the autocatalysis mechanism of UiO-66 formation.
