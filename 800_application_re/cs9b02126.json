As the ideal coordination number of Ag in Ag metal is 12, the larger coordination number in 80MA may suggest the elimination of the surface defect state of the Ag center after being deposited onto MIL-101(Cr). It has been shown previously that defects can serve as the recombination centers of photogenerated electrons and holes and thus prevent effective charge separation.

The electronic structure and coordination environment of Ag in MIL-101(Cr)-Ag hybrids were determined by XAS, where Ag in MIL-101(Cr)-Ag hybrids shows larger coordination number than that in Ag NPs, suggesting the reduction of defect states in the presence of the MOF. The photocatalytic activity of MIL-101(Cr)-Ag hybrids show strong dependence on the size of MOF MIL-101(Cr), where the sample with the smallest size (80MA) exhibits the highest CO2 photocatalytic reduction activity with remarkable rates of CO 808.2 \u03bcmol/g\u22c5h and CH4 427.5 \u03bcmol/g\u22c5h, which are 23 and 18 times larger than the yields catalyzed by 800MA.

UV-visible-near IR diffuse reflectance spectra (a and S7) show that the bare MIL-101(Cr) have broad absorption in the visible region (400-800 nm).

From the intersection, the potential was found to have a value of -0.94 V versus Ag/AgCl [that is -0.74 V vs normalized hydrogen electrode (NHE) or -3.76 V vs absolute vacuum scale (AVS)]. The potential (-0.74 V vs NHE) of MIL-101(Cr) is more negative than the reduction potential of CO2 to CO (-0.53 V vs NHE) as well as CH4 (-0.24 V vs NHE), suggesting the capability to reduce CO2 via electron transfer from MIL-101(Cr). Moreover, the positive slope of the obtained C -2 values (vs the applied potentials) agrees well with that of typical n-type semiconductors. To further elucidate the mechanism of electron transfer between Ag and MIL-101(Cr) under visible light irradiation, the work function of Ag (-4.26 V vs AVS), the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (-3.76 V vs AVS) (d) and highest occupied molecular orbital (-6.04 V vs AVS) (Figures S9) of MIL-101(Cr) were recorded (). The appropriate band positions of MIL-101(Cr) and Ag make it possible for photogenerated electron transfer in MIL-101(Cr)-Ag hybrids.\n\nWith the demonstration of the feasibility of these hybrid samples as photocatalysts for CO2 reduction, we proceed to evaluate their performance for CO2 reduction. Photocatalytic reactions were carried out on a glass fiber film containing the photocatalyst and triethanolamine in a Pyrex reaction vessel, which results in the production of CH4, CO, and H2 (Figure S10 with calibration curves and Figure S11). To verify the carbon origins of the CO and CH4 products, 13C-labeled 13CO2 was employed for the photocatalytic reaction. Under the same catalytic conditions, the reaction products 13CO (m/z = 29) and 13CH4 (m/z = 17) were identified by gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (Figure S13), which suggests that both CO and CH4 originate from CO2 reduction. It can be clearly seen from  that the CH4, CO, and H2 yields as well as reacted electrons' rate are dependent on the size of the catalyst. 80MA gives the highest CO, CH4, and H2 yields of 808.2, 427.5, and 82.1 \u03bcmol/g\u22c5h, which are 23, 18, and 35 times higher than those of 800MA, respectively. The sample with the smallest size (80M) has the highest photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance among the xM catalysts (Figure S12) but significantly decreased activity compared to the 80MA sample (). Furthermore, Al2O3 with the same Ag NP loading (denoted as Al2O3-Ag) only gave a very low CO rate (8.8 \u03bcmol/g\u22c5h) under the identical conditions (a). These results imply that there is a cooperative effect between the Ag NPs and MIL-101(Cr) in the hybrid catalysts, and the MOF size is crucial for photocatalysis, consistent with XAS, UV-visible-near IR, and photoresponse results described above. It should be noted that the CH4 production requires eight-electron (Scheme S1, eq 4), which could be promoted by a sufficient supply of electrons during the catalytic process. The reacted electrons' rate is the rate of photogenerated electrons involved in the overall reaction, which can be regarded as the electron transfer efficiency of the photocatalyst. As expected, the smaller hybrid catalyst shows a significantly enhanced reacted electrons' rate, which can efficiently trap the photogenerated electrons to improve electron transfer, and is also consistent with photocurrent and EIS measurements shown in b,c. More importantly, recycling experiments show that the sample 80MA gives almost the same activity after three cycles (Figure S14) and maintains its framework structure confirmed by SEM images (Figure S15) and PXRD data (Figure S16). The results imply that 80MA has enough stability and reusability for photocatalytic CO2 reduction under visible light irradiation. These rates are superior to those of semiconductors and MOF photocatalysts under visible light as summarized in Table S5.\n\nThe time-resolved PL decay spectra also confirmed the improvement of charge separation from reducing size. As shown in b, the average PL lifetime of 80MA (0.33 ns) was distinctly decreased as compared to that of 150MA (0.43 ns), 400MA (0.75 ns), and 800MA (0.90 ns). The obviously shortened lifetime of 80MA exhibits a much faster charge transfer rate. The results have the same trend with their photocatalytic behavior.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "MOF MIL-101\u00ad(Cr)\u2013Ag", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name":
