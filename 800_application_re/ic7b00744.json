The desorption part of\nthe isotherm do not trace the adsorption process, resulting in a large\nhysteresis loop. This peculiar phenomenon reveals that a breathing\nbehavior happens in the process of N<sub>2</sub> adsorption, giving\nrise to a significant increase in volume.</p><p>On the other side, <bold>JLU-Liu33L</bold> and <bold>JLU-Liu33H</bold> were also measured for N<sub>2</sub> adsorption at 77 K. <bold>JLU-Liu33L</bold> exhibits three distinct\nsteps, which are different from <bold>JLU-Liu33</bold>.

To our surprise, up to a relative\npressure of 0.89, a second abrupt increase is observed.

By contrast, <bold>JLU-Liu33H</bold> does not show breathing behavior up to 1 atm. As\nrevealed by the isotherms, the breathing behavior of <bold>JLU-Liu33</bold> can be tuned by introducing Co ions into Zn<sub>4</sub>O clusters.\nIn addition, to corroborate our hypothesis that the gate opening effect\nof the materials is caused by the removal of coordinated DMF, the\ncrystal was soaked in CH<sub>3</sub>CN for 5 days to remove excess\nDMF. However, the Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FT-IR) of the\nsample still shows a resonance at 1665 cm<sup>\u20131</sup>, which\ncan be attributed to the C\ue5fbO stretch of DMF (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b00744/suppl_file/ic7b00744_si_001.pdf\">Figure S5</ext-link> in the Supporting Information). This confirmed that\nsome coordinated DMF cannot be removed totally after solvent exchange.\nThe amounts of C, H, and N of the materials after solvent exchange\nand N<sub>2</sub> adsorption characterization are also performed (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b00744/suppl_file/ic7b00744_si_001.pdf\">Table S4</ext-link> in the Supporting Information). The\nresult indicates that the remaining coordinated DMF will be shifted\nduring the N<sub>2</sub> adsorption measurement. Upon removal of DMF,\na shift between two nets may happen and result in transformation of\nthe framework, which was indicated by the shift of the peaks and the\nchange of their intensity in the PXRD (see <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b00744/suppl_file/ic7b00744_si_001.pdf\">Figure S3</ext-link> in the Supporting Information). In parallel work, Jaheon\nKim\u2019s group also found that, upon removal and addition of coordinated\nDMF, the degree of interpenetration of the framework will be changed\nand the material shows a dynamic behavior upon N<sub>2</sub> adsorption.\nThose exhaustive parallel studies largely support our proposed mechanism. Some examples of interpenetrated MOFs that exhibit\na gate opening effect are also listed in <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b00744/suppl_file/ic7b00744_si_001.pdf\">Table S5</ext-link> in the Supporting Information.</p><p>The CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption\nproperties at 195 K were carried out to further investigate the breathing\nperformance. Similar to the N<sub>2</sub> adsorption isotherm, <bold>JLU-Liu33</bold> is also found to exhibit the breathing behavior\nupon CO<sub>2</sub> (a).

The analysis data indicates that the skeleton of <bold>JLU-Liu33H</bold> will not change during the gas sorption, but the\nframeworks of <bold>JLU-Liu33</bold> and <bold>JLU-Liu33L</bold> come\nto phase transition, which make the pores in the materials expand\nduring the process of adsorption.</p><p>In order to calculate the isosteric\nheat (<italic>Q</italic>\n<sub>st</sub>), the CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption\nisotherm of the materials were examined at 273 and 298 K.

In Zhu's work, CH2Cl2 was used as exchanged solvent, which make the activated sample partly collapse and result in classical type-I N2 adsorption isotherm. By contrast, the PXRD pattern of the activated JLU-Liu33 indicates that the sample will not collapse after soaking in CH3CN for 2 days (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Meanwhile, the solvent molecules can almost be removed, which can be seen from the TGA data (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). Interestingly, as shown in , JLU-Liu33 exhibits an unusual adsorption property, which shows two steps in the adsorption branch of the isotherm. At low pressure, the material adsorbs a small amount of N2. To our surprise, up to a relative pressure of 0.06, the amount of N2 adsorption suddenly increases to a saturated uptake of 319 cm3 g-1. The desorption part of the isotherm do not trace the adsorption process, resulting in a large hysteresis loop. This peculiar phenomenon reveals that a breathing behavior happens in the process of N2 adsorption, giving rise to a significant increase in volume.\n\nOn the other side, JLU-Liu33L and JLU-Liu33H were also measured for N2 adsorption at 77 K. JLU-Liu33L exhibits three distinct steps, which are different from JLU-Liu33. It shows slight N2 uptake at low pressure. Up to a relative pressure of 0.12, the amount of N2 adsorption suddenly increases up to 110 cm3 g-1, which is much lower than that of JLU-Liu33. To our surprise, up to a relative pressure of 0.89, a second abrupt increase is observed. The maximum adsorption amount reaches to 290 cm3 g-1, which is similar to JLU-Liu33. By contrast, JLU-Liu33H does not show breathing behavior up to 1 atm. As revealed by the isotherms, the breathing behavior of JLU-Liu33 can be tuned by introducing Co ions into Zn4O clusters. In addition, to corroborate our hypothesis that the gate opening effect of the materials is caused by the removal of coordinated DMF, the crystal was soaked in CH3CN for 5 days to remove excess DMF. However, the Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FT-IR) of the sample still shows a resonance at 1665 cm-1, which can be attributed to the C\ue5fbO stretch of DMF (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information). This confirmed that some coordinated DMF cannot be removed totally after solvent exchange. The amounts of C, H, and N of the materials after solvent exchange and N2 adsorption characterization are also performed (Table S4 in the Supporting Information). The result indicates that the remaining coordinated DMF will be shifted during the N2 adsorption measurement. Upon removal of DMF, a shift between two nets may happen and result in transformation of the framework, which was indicated by the shift of the peaks and the change of their intensity in the PXRD (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). In parallel work, Jaheon Kim's group also found that, upon removal and addition of coordinated DMF, the degree of interpenetration of the framework will be changed and the material shows a dynamic behavior upon N2 adsorption. Those exhaustive parallel studies largely support our proposed mechanism. Some examples of interpenetrated MOFs that exhibit a gate opening effect are also listed in Table S5 in the Supporting Information.\n\nThe CO2 adsorption properties at 195 K were carried out to further investigate the breathing performance. Similar to the N2 adsorption isotherm, JLU-Liu33 is also found to exhibit the breathing behavior upon CO2 (a). In the first step, the adsorption amount of CO2 is ~50 cm3 g-1 at P/P 0 = 0.04, then it reached up to 205 cm3 g-1 in the second step. Similarly, the desorption part of the isotherm does not coincide with the adsorption branch, resulting in a small hysteresis loop. As shown in b, JLU-Liu33L also exhibits a dynamic response to CO2 sorption, but it shows three distinct steps, which is consistent with its N2 adsorption isotherm. The gate opening pressures of JLU-Liu33L are P/P 0 = 0.02 and 0.3. However, JLU-Liu33H exhibits a highly reversible type-I isotherm, reaching a saturated uptake of 111 cm3 g-1, which is much lower than JLU-Liu33 and JLU-Liu33L (c). The analysis data indicates that the skeleton of JLU-Liu33H will not change during the gas sorption, but the frameworks of JLU-Liu33 and JLU-Liu33L come to phase transition, which make the pores in the materials expand during the process of adsorption.\n\nIn order to calculate the isosteric heat (Q st), the CO2 adsorption isotherm of the materials were examined at 273 and 298 K. The CO2 uptake at 273 and 298 K under 1 bar for JLU-Liu33, JLU-Liu33L, and JLU-Liu33H are 32 and 20 cm3 g-1, 48 and 32 cm3 g-1, and 61 and 39 cm3 g-1, respectively (see Figure S8 and Table S6 in the Supporting Information). Furthermore, at zero loading, the Q st of JLU-Liu33, JLU-Liu33L, and JLU-Liu33H are 33.9, 35.5, and 37.8 kJ mol-1, respectively (d). All these Q st values are impressive and exceed many MOFs with Lewis basic sites (LBSs), such as JLU-Liu20 and ZTF-1, similar to that of NH2-MIL-53(Al). Such high Q st values are attributed to the narrow pores, and this character may make a contribution to molecular sieving. The above analysis data fully indicates that the adsorption amount and isosteric enthalpy values of JLU-Liu33 for CO2 will be improved with the increasing amount of Co ions in the framework. Lots of parallel examples also confirmed the fact that Co ions could make a contribution to improving the capacity of CO2 adsorption. \n\nThe CH4, C2H6, and C3H8 isotherms for the three compounds then were also measured at 273 and 298 K. The CH4 uptake at 273 and 298 K under 1 bar for JLU-Liu33, JLU-Liu33L, and JLU-Liu33H are 14 and 7 cm3 g-1, 25 and 13 cm3 g-1, and 17 and 8 cm3 g-1, respectively. The C2H6 uptake at 273 and 298 K under 1 bar for JLU-Liu33, JLU-Liu33L, and JLU-Liu33H are 41 and 33 cm3 g-1, 39 and 30 cm3 g-1, and 42 and 35 cm3 g-1, respectively. The C3H8 uptake at 273 and 298 K under 1 bar for JLU-Liu33, JLU-Liu33L, and JLU-Liu33H are 44 and 38 cm3 g-1, 42 and 31 cm3 g-1, and 43 and 31 cm3 g-1, respectively (see , as well as Figures S9 and S10 and Table S6 in the Supporting Information). The amount of CH4, C2H6, and C3H8 adsorption changed inconspicuously as the amount of Co2+ in the framework increased. Interestingly, only JLU-Liu33 shows breathing behavior upon C2H6, and its gate opening pressures are P/P 0 = 0.24 and 0.48 at 273 and 298 K, respectively (). On the other hand, all these materials show breathing behavior upon C3H8 adsorption, and the gate opening pressures of JLU-Liu33, JLU-Liu33L, and JLU-Liu33H are as follows: P/P 0 = 0.03 and 0.06; P/P 0 = 0.039 and 0.264; P/P 0 = 0.033 and 0.302 at 273 and 298 K, respectively (see , as well as Figures S10a and S10b). The above analyses also indicated that the gate opening pressures of JLU-Liu33 for C2H6 and C3H8 could be tuned through doping Co ions into the framework.\n\nTo evaluate the affinity of the interpenetrated MOFs for small molecules, the Q st of the series of JLU-Liu33 for small gases, which possess normal gas adsorption behavior (CH4 and C2H6) were calculated. The Q st of CH4 for JLU-Liu33, JLU-Liu33L, and JLU-Liu33H is 25.50, 24.05, and 26.90 kJ mol-1, respectively. The Q st of C2H6 for JLU-Liu33L and JLU-Liu33H is 36.2 and 34.6 kJ mol-1 (Figures S11 and S12 in the Supporting Information).", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "JLU-Liu33", "symbol": "", "chemical
