All of the above results demonstrate that 2D CuO NSs are promising in underwater broadband photodetection.\n\nThe synthesized CuBDC MOF and CuO are further confirmed by the Raman spectrum. The Raman spectrum of the CuBDC MOF (Figure S2a) is the same as in the previous reports. Figure S2b shows three Raman peaks of 298, 348, and 630 cm-1, corresponding to the optical phonon Ag, B1g, and B2g modes of CuO, respectively. The peak intensity of 298 cm-1 is much stronger than those of the peaks at 348 and 630 cm-1, which indicates the good crystal quality of MOF-derived CuO. To observe the morphology and microstructure of the samples, SEM images of CuBDC MOF and CuO are recorded. Figure S3 shows the SEM image of CuBDC, which exhibits lateral dimensions of 0.6-2.7 \u03bcm. As shown in d, S4, and S5, CuO NSs with lateral sizes of 0.5-3.4 \u03bcm are obtained by annealing CuBDC NSs. 2D CuO NSs are composed of nanoparticles, as shown in the SEM image with larger magnification (e). Atomic-force microscopy (AFM) shows that the thicknesses of CuO NSs are in the range of 2-6 nm (f), demonstrating the 2D ultrathin feature of MOF-derived CuO NSs. g shows the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of CuO NSs, which demonstrates their good crystallinity. The lattice space is 0.23 nm, which corresponds to the (111) plane of CuO. As shown in h, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the CuO NSs, which agrees well with the XRD pattern, further demonstrates a good crystalline structure. The absorption spectrum of 2D CuO NSs is presented in i, which demonstrates the broadband light absorption of 2D CuO NSs. The optical band gap of 2D CuO NSs is determined using the Tauc equation of \u03b1(h\u03bd)2 = A(h\u03bd - E g), where \u03b1 is the absorption coefficient, A is a constant, h\u03bd is the incident photon energy, and E g is the optical band gap. The estimated band gap of 2D CuO NSs is approximately 1.39 eV, which is slightly larger than that of bulk CuO samples due to the confinement effect. \n\nThe photoresponse properties of 2D CuO NSs were investigated by the PEC system, as shown in a and Figure S7 (more details in the ). For an optoelectronic device, the photoresponse properties depend on the application of an external voltage. Therefore, we first studied the external voltage effect on the photoresponse of 2D CuO PEC PDs. a shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) of 2D CuO PEC PDs under pulsed 365 nm light irradiation with a power intensity of 2.85 mW/cm2, where the parts marked in pink indicate the periods under light irradiation and the parts marked in white correspond to the periods without irradiation. The photocurrent density (J ph, J ph = J light - J dark, where J light and J dark represent the current densities with and without irradiation) varies with the external voltage. Due to CuO being a p-type semiconductor, the J ph displays a negative value. To more accurately investigate the external voltage-dependent photoresponse, the current density-time (J-t) curves of 2D CuO PEC PDs were measured at various voltages using pulsed 365 nm light (b), and the corresponding J ph values with deviations are exhibited in c. The J ph gradually increases from -0.175 to -7.35 \u03bcA/cm2 as the external voltage sweeps from 0.2 to -0.4 V. The detailed J ph values for different bias voltages are exhibited in Table S1. The slight deviations verify that 2D CuO PEC PDs have good reproducibility for various devices. Although 2D CuO PEC PDs have self-powered capability, the devices show a better photoresponse at -0.4 V. Meanwhile, J dark rapidly increases as the external voltage is higher than -0.4 V due to undergoing the hydrogen evolution reaction. Therefore, we focus on investigating the photodetection performance of 2D CuO PEC PDs at a bias of -0.4 V.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "CuO", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "peak spectrum": [{"value": "298, 348, 630", "unit": "cm-1", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["peak_spectrum"]}, {"idx": "13, 15, 18", "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<p>2D CuO NSs exhibit strong\nlight absorption in the UV\u2013vis\nregion (i),\nindicating broadband photodetection capability.
