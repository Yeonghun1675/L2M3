Such an underestimate is often ascribed to orbital quenching due to covalency, and indicates the presence of only one unpaired spin per formula unit. Given the presence of three square-planar cobalt ions per unit cell, this is consistent with two-thirds of the Co adopting the trivalent state (S = 0) with one exhibiting a formal divalent (S = 1/2) state, which is significant because mixed oxidation states are often associated with charge delocalization. \n\nThe temperature-dependent resistivity of 1 was measured using a four-point Van der Pauw geometry on a pressed pellet of 1 with a thickness of 0.24(2) mm. Graphitic carbon paint (Alfa Aesar) was used to create Ohmic contacts, as verified by the linear I-V trace shown in Figure S5. InGa eutectic and silver paint were also used to create Ohmic contacts and gave qualitatively similar results; however, the carbon paint was the best at maintaining physical contact over the entire temperature range of interest. At 300 K, the bulk resistivity was determined to be 0.720(7) k\u03a9\u22c5cm, corresponding to a conductivity of 1.4 \u00d7 10-3 S\u22c5cm-1, which is in line with values reported for the platinum analogue. Given the highly anisotropic nature of the pressed pellet of 1, this relatively low value is likely associated with the random orientation of the powder and is exaggerated by grain-boundary scattering between the sheet-like particles.\n\nAn exponential rise in the resistivity of the pellet is seen between 300 and 170 K, as would be expected for a semiconducting sample where transport is dominated by thermally populated carriers that must overcome a hopping barrier for conduction (a). An Arrhenius fit to the data suggests an activation energy on the order of 173 meV (Figure S6). More interestingly, a decrease in the resistivity is subsequently seen between 130 and 50 K, suggesting a transition to a metallic phase where scattering of the carriers is dominated by lattice vibrations. The transition is fully reversible, with no signs of hysteresis as illustrated in Figure S7, suggesting it is second order in nature, unlike the metal-to-insulator transitions in materials like VO2 that are associated with structural deformations. To further confirm the absence of a coherent structural distortion, variable temperature synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction studies were performed between 300 and 100 K. As indicated in Figures S8-10, the only significant change to the diffraction patterns is a slight shift in the [001] reflection from 7.11\u00b0 (300 K) to 7.15\u00b0 (100 K), which corresponds to a 0.02 \u00c5 contraction of the interlayer spacing or a roughly 1% change.\n\nTo explore this transition further, films of 1 were deposited on glass supports with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images indicating smooth surfaces and good coverage (a inset and S11). The thicknesses of the films were determined using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and ranged from 0.1 and 0.2 \u03bcm (Figures S12 and 13) with the resistivity being measured in an identical fashion to the pellets described earlier ( and S14-18). For films with a thickness of 0.20 \u03bcm, the resistivity at 300 K was 31 \u03a9\u22c5cm, corresponding to a conductivity of 3.2 \u00d7 10-2 S\u22c5cm-1, which is a full order of magnitude higher than the conductivity of the pellet as expected when grain boundaries between the sheet-like particles are reduced. The temperature-dependent resistivity data of the films show a similar semiconductor-to-metal transition (a). Interestingly, the transition temperature exhibits a strong correlation with film thickness, with thinner films displaying a higher temperature transition to a metallic state and thicker films remaining semiconducting to lower temperatures (Table S1).\n\nThe nanoporous nature of MOFs is well-known to result in a significant amount of solvent being trapped within the channels. To investigate if the presence of trapped solvent has an influence on the transition temperature, the variable temperature resistivity data of a film of 0.5(1) \u03bcm thickness was measured before and after 2 h under vacuum at 90 \u00b0C (b, S19, and 20). These measurements clearly indicate that the films with less solvent display an increase in the metallic transition temperature from 105 to 130 K. XPS studies before and after the conductivity experiments show no significant changes suggesting that the films are not significantly altered by the thermal treatment (Figure S21).\n\nIn order to rationalize these observations in terms of the electronic structure of the framework, DFT calculations were performed (see SI). The calculated band dispersion and density of states (DOS; ) indicates the compound is actually a semimetal, with a small DOS at the Fermi energy (E F) in both spin channels. There is a large dispersion of ~2 eV along the \u0393-A line in the Brillouin zone, corresponding to the c-axis in real space. The smallest calculated carrier effective mass for the metallic bands of 0.29 me (see SI) suggests facile transport along this direction, and contrasts with a minimum effective mass of 1.27 me along the in-plane directions. The bands making up the metallic states correspond to \u03c0-type crystal orbitals centered on the metal ions and ligand S atoms, which explains the large dispersion and suggests that the primary mechanism for conductivity is through conductive pathways along the c-axis. This is despite fairly strong covalent bonding between the metal and ligand, as inferred from a Bader-charge analysis (see SI). \n\nMetallic conductivity has been suggested previously in a nickel benzenehexathiolate framework using first-principles band structure calculations; however, conductivity measurements on a single microflake revealed semiconducting behavior with a small activation energy (E a) of 26 meV. The discrepancy was attributed to structural disorder in the sample. Moreover, DFT calculations performed on Ni3(HITP)2 framework suggested that the bulk form is metallic, whereas the monolayer form showed a small band gap of 0.25 eV. The most energetically favored structure for Ni3(HITP)2 was reported to be an AB slipped-parallel stacking mode wherein one layer was slipped relative to the neighboring one by 1.8 \u00c5 along the a or b vectors. Additionally, metal substitution was shown by DFT studies to promote or change the electronic properties of these 2D frameworks from semiconducting to metallic. \n\nConclusions\n\nIn summary, we have investigated the temperature-dependent resistivity of a cobalt 2,3,6,7,10,11-triphenylenehexathiolate framework. Variable temperature resistivity studies performed on a pressed-powder pellet indicate a semiconducting phase between 300 and 170 K, followed by a transition to metallic behavior at temperatures below 130 K, which has been unprecedented in MOFs. A similar transition is observed for films, with the transition temperature being highly dependent on the film thickness. Electronic-structure calculations support the experimentally observed complex metallic conductivity, with the highest mobility pathways occurring between the sheets. The temperature-dependence of the resistivity exhibits multiple maxima, which suggests that contributions from stacking faults, local molecular vibrations, and the behavior of solvent molecules in the pores may all be convoluted together to produce a complex mechanism for scattering the charge carriers.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "resistivity": {"value": "0.720", "unit": "k\u03a9\u00b7cm", "condition": "300 K"}}, {"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "conductivity": {"value": "1.4 \u00d7 10^-3", "unit": "S\u00b7cm^-1", "condition": "300 K"}}, {"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "BET surface area": {"value": "370", "unit": "m^2/g", "condition": ""}}]], "include_properties": ["etc"]}, {"idx": 5, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Structure of the 2D cobalt dithiolene framework [Co<sub>3</sub>(THT)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>3\u2013</sup>, <bold>1</bold>, studied\nhere.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ja-2017-05742b_0001.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Structure of the 2D cobalt dithiolene framework [Co3(THT)2]3-, 1, studied here.
