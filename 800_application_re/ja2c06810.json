The DFT-predicted structures were used as starting models to fit the O2-saturated EXAFS data at high potentials where the adsorbates are observed. Furthermore, strongly adsorbed *OOH at high potentials was previously observed for CoSe2, where an uplift of the XANES whiteline corresponded to the strong adsorption of *OOH, similar to the uplift observed in the O2-saturated XANES at potentials \u22640.2 V (b). Oxygen-based adsorbates have been previously integrated into EXAFS fittings of ORR on SACs by a similar trial-and-error approach. Notably, the fitting results for the Ar-saturated EXAFS did not have the appearance of such a path at highly cathodic potentials but instead showed a changing intensity and systematic contraction of the Ni-N first-shell path (d). This further supports the hypothesis that the uplift of the new ~3 \u00c5 path in the O2-saturated EXAFS results from an oxygenate adsorbate. Even though there is also a small peak at ~3 \u00c5 in the Ar-saturated EXAFS (observed value of 2.91 \u00c5 at 0 V vs RHE, see Figure S18), its intensity does not change and it is clearly shifted by 0.12 \u00c5 at 0 V vs RHE from the position of the peak observed in the O2-saturated EXAFS (2.79 \u00c5 at 0 V vs RHE, see Figure S14), clearly indicating that it intrinsically originates from the Ni-HAB structure. The Ni-N (R eff = 1.838 \u00c5), Ni-C (R eff = 2.687 \u00c5), and Ni-N-C (R eff = 2.932 \u00c5) scattering paths all have predicted minor peaks at ~2.9 \u00c5, further validating the potential-independent peak observed in the Ar-saturated and (E > E redox O2-saturated EXAFS) spectra as originating from Ni-HAB, but the uplift and shift are indicative of a distinct potential-dependent peak that could not originate from Ni-HAB without other large structural perturbations. Linear combination analysis (LCA) fitting using the XANES spectrum for 0.8 V vs RHE in Ar-saturated electrolytes as a standard for 100% HABox and the XANES spectrum for the 0 V vs RHE in Ar-saturated electrolytes as a standard for 100% HABred (Figure S22) confirms that the speciation crossover corresponds to the red shift of the edge energy and that the oxygenate adsorbates become observable in EXAFS when the speciation is 100% HABred (for Ar-saturated electrolytes). The crossover point of the HABred and HABox fractions (0.34 V vs RHE) is also close to the E redox (0.29 V vs RHE). Additionally, LCA reveals that the primary speciation in an O2-saturated environment is HABred and further reaches 100% HABred at potentials \u22640.2 V vs RHE. The initially high fraction of HABred in the O2-saturated XANES is strange and could suggest some limitation of Ni K-edge XANES as an oxidation state probe in such a complex chemical environment.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 18, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>We further quantitatively extracted the Ni coordination numbers\nfrom both sets of EXAFS fittings using the amplitude reduction factor\ndetermined from the powder fittings (f).

Regardless of the method used for the selectivity measurement, a severe drop in H2O2 selectivity was observed when E < E redox (or approaching E redox), where the redox activity becomes prevalent.\n\nConsistent with the RRDE measurements, the bulk electrolysis performed at 0.5 V vs RHE showed the highest selectivity, with a Faradaic efficiency of 73% at the end of the measurement (d). Further increasing the overpotential to 0.4 V vs RHE results in a 39% Faradaic efficiency at the end of the measurement. The higher and more consistent selectivities over longer timescales at 0.5 or 0.6 V vs RHE are due to the minimization of linker charging during the measurement, as additionally evidenced by the much lower observed currents compared to that at 0.4 V vs RHE (a). Thus, electrolysis at 0.4 V vs RHE results in faster accumulation of H2O2 but at the cost of lower Faradaic efficiency. Longer operation at lower potentials could lead to a more ideal combination of Faradaic efficiency and total H2O2 accumulation. High concentrations (up to 213 ppm) of H2O2 could also be accumulated at 0.6 V vs RHE over ~6 h, with fairly constant high selectivity over the entire measurement (Figure S30). The full results of these electrolysis measurements are shown in Table S21 and compared to various other examples of catalysts measured in neutral electrolytes in Table S22. To ensure that the H2O2 originated entirely from the Ni-HAB catalyst, we conducted an electrolysis on CFP with no catalyst loading at 0.4 V vs RHE (Figure S31) and observed a very low current, confirming the negligible contribution from the CFP substrate. Additionally, structural characterization after treatment tests of Ni-HAB with pure H2O2 solutions (Figure S32) suggests that Ni-HAB remains crystalline and does not become significantly oxidized after exposure to up to 1 wt % of H2O2, suggesting that Ni-HAB could remain stable in optimized device architectures that allow for accumulation of reasonably high concentrations of H2O2.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "c", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "periodic structure", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "average distance between (100) planes", "value": "1.18", "unit": "nm", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "crystallinity along other planes", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "phase purity", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "Raman spectrum", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) Ni K-edge spectrum", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "ensemble averages of Ni\u2013N and Ni\u2013C bond distances", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "amplitude reduction factor (S0^2)", "value": "0.75", "unit": "", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "d", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "half-wave potential of the linker", "value": "0.29", "unit": "V vs RHE", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "e", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "Faradaic efficiency", "value": "73", "unit": "%", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["etc"]}, {"idx": 7, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Crystal structure and\nstructural characterization of Ni<sub>3</sub>HAB<sub>2</sub>.
