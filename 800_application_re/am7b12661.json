The central cluster of MOF-5 is zinc oxide, resulting from the combination of Zn2+ and carboxylic acid, and the Zn-O-C motifs are formed and linked with benzene struts. a indicates that at a 2\u03b8 value greater than 30\u00b0, the XRD pattern of the as-prepared MOF-5 displays peaks that match those of zincite. At lower angles, the positions of the peaks are in good agreement with those calculated for MOF-5. However, the measured intensities of the XRD peaks, especially at low angles, are different from those calculated and published. It has been reported that this discrepancy may result from species, e.g., Zn(OH)2, in the pores that can reduce the intensity of the diffraction at 6.9\u00b0 and split the peak, owing to a symmetry distortion from cubic to trigonal, at 9.7\u00b0. On pyrolysis of the as-formed MOF at 550 and 700 \u00b0C in an Ar atmosphere, denoted ZnO@C550 and ZnO@C700, respectively, composites containing zincite (ZnO) are obtained, as evidenced by the diffraction pattern in b and S2. The crystal size of ZnO in ZnO/C550, calculated by application of the Scherrer equation on the (103) peak, is 25 nm, resulting from the distorted metal cluster in the MOFs. When ZnO/C550 was placed in a glucose solution, hydrothermally treated, and the recovered solid calcined at 550 \u00b0C, the XRD pattern of the resultant solid, ZnO@CC, indicated that the zincite was maintained throughout the processing (Figure S2). Zincite is also observed in the XRD patterns obtained, as shown in b, when 2.7 nm SSQDs (Figure S3) are added to the glucose solution at Zn to Ag ratios in mass of 180:1 and 60:1 prior to processing, resulting in samples termed ZnO@CC/SSQDm and ZnO@CC/SSQD3m, respectively.

The device maintains a capacity of 332.3 mAh g-1 with an efficiency of nearly 100% after 100 cycles. At higher current density (500 mA g-1), the capacity of ZnO@C550 suffers fluctuations (200 mAh g-1 at the 500th cycle) that are ascribed to the activation of dispersed ZnO crystals; see Figure S14. ZnO@CC/SSQDm retains a capacity of 294 mAh g-1after 500 cycles, whereas ZnO@CC/SSQD3m only retains 136 mAh g-1 and suffers fluctuant capacities during cycling. The in situ high-frequency resistance (HFR) measurement tracing the 500 cycles of ZnO@CC/SSQD3m displays the point resistance at 1000 and 100 Hz. The up and down of the HFR correlate with the decrease and increase in the capacity, well indicating the HFR of the electrode is responsible for the fluctuations in capacity during cycling. h shows the rate performance of ZnO@CC/SSQDm at 1, 2, 5, and 10 A g-1, and each current has 100 cycles. The stable and average capacities are 208, 175, 118, and 81 mAh g-1, respectively, and after 400 cycles, the average value of 248 mAh g-1 is recovered at 1 A g-1. The long-term and high-rate cycling of ZnO@CC/SSQDm at 5 A g-1 is shown in i. The capacity is still 97 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles, with a high coulombic efficiency of 99.8%.

The metal nanoparticles act to shorten electron pathways and improve the connectivity of the matrix, and the partial sulfidation of the ZnO surface improves the cycling stability of the material. The electrochemical properties of ZnO@C, Ag2S QDs-treated ZnO@C, and the amorphous carbon in ZnO@C have been compared. The small weight ratio of Ag2S QDs to ZnO@C at 1:180 shows the best performance in lithium storage. The exhibited specific capacities are improved and retained remarkably in the cycling at high current rates. At low current densities (200 mA g-1), treatment of ZnO@C with Ag2S QDs results in a 38% increase in the specific capacity.\n\nN2 absorption/desorption isotherms of ZnO@C550, ZnO@CC, and ZnO@CC/SSQDm are shown in c-e, which are typical type IV curves.

The smaller areas under the CV curves of ZnO@C550 and ZnO@CC, in comparison to the samples ZnO@CC/SSQDm and ZnO@CC/SSQD3m, indicate a lower capacity for the former.

The upshift of the anodic peak with the scan rate for ZnO@C550 points to high internal resistance in the system. SSQDs' incorporation decreases the resistance, leading to lower distortion of the CV peaks for the ZnO@CC/QQSDm and ZnO@CC/SSQD3m systems.

The linear relationship between the anodic peak current (i p) and square root of scan rates resulting from the CV curves of ZnO@C550 and ZnO@CC/SSQD3m is depicted in Figure S12. Thus, the ion-diffusion coefficients are calculated using the Randle-Sevcik equation. It is found that the coefficients are 3.6 \u00d7 10-11 and 1.7 \u00d7 10-11 cm2 s-1 for anodic peaks I and II, respectively, of ZnO@C550 and increase to 9.9 \u00d7 10-10 and 4.7 \u00d7 10-10 cm2 s-1 for ZnO@CC/SSQD3m, respectively, demonstrating the facile lithium diffusion in the compound after sulfidation.\n\nAt 200 mA g-1, as shown in g, ZnO@C550 shows stable cycling performance in capacity and coulombic efficiency. The device maintains a capacity of 332.3 mAh g-1 with an efficiency of nearly 100% after 100 cycles. At higher current density (500 mA g-1), the capacity of ZnO@C550 suffers fluctuations (200 mAh g-1 at the 500th cycle) that are ascribed to the activation of dispersed ZnO crystals; see Figure S14. ZnO@CC/SSQDm retains a capacity of 294 mAh g-1after 500 cycles, whereas ZnO@CC/SSQD3m only retains 136 mAh g-1 and suffers fluctuant capacities during cycling. The in situ high-frequency resistance (HFR) measurement tracing the 500 cycles of ZnO@CC/SSQD3m displays the point resistance at 1000 and 100 Hz. The up and down of the HFR correlate with the decrease and increase in the capacity, well indicating the HFR of the electrode is responsible for the fluctuations in capacity during cycling. h shows the rate performance of ZnO@CC/SSQDm at 1, 2, 5, and 10 A g-1, and each current has 100 cycles. The stable and average capacities are 208, 175, 118, and 81 mAh g-1, respectively, and after 400 cycles, the average value of 248 mAh g-1 is recovered at 1 A g-1. The long-term and high-rate cycling of ZnO@CC/SSQDm at 5 A g-1 is shown in i. The capacity is still 97 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles, with a high coulombic efficiency of 99.8%. The ZnS layer out of ZnO crystal is able to buffer the volume change during lithiation and delithiation, and the performance in lithium-ion storage is comparable with that in the published works.
