Since water is critical in the hydrolytic decontamination, we expected that the decontamination of CWAs by Zr-MOFs would be greatly influenced by the amount of water adsorbed in MOFs. Due to the high risk of working with real nerve agents, only decontamination rates of DMNP by Zr-MOFs under different RHs were measured. As shown in b, all three Zr-MOFs showed enhanced hydrolysis rates toward DMNP when RH increased. At 20% RH, UiO-66-NH2 exhibited a faster kinetics than UiO-66. This is corresponding to the higher water content of UiO-66-NH2 at 20% P/P0 (12 wt % for UiO-66-NH2 versus 6 wt % for UiO-66). However, UiO-66 outperformed UiO-66-NH2 at 40, 60, and 80% RHs, consistent with the higher water uptake of UiO-66 than UiO-66-NH2 at these RHs. In comparison, NU-1000 exhibited slower hydrolysis rates than both UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2 under all of the RHs investigated. Since our experiments were designed in a way such that the weight ratio of MOF to CWA was kept constant, the slower hydrolysis rates of NU-1000 could be caused by the lower number of active sites present on NU-1000 (4 defects per node) than the defected UiO-66 (~4.9 defects per node) (Table S1). However, increasing the weight ratio of NU-1000 to DMNP to account for the number of moles of active sites hardly improved the hydrolytic activity (Figure S12). Although the slower hydrolysis rates from 20 to 60% RH can be explained by scarce amount of water present for hydrolysis, it is unclear why NU-1000 still exhibited a slower hydrolysis rate at 80% RH at which NU-1000 contained a significant amount of water.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 23, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig5\" position=\"float\">\n<label>5</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Water isotherms of UiO-66, UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub>,\nand NU-1000.\n(b) Solid-phase initial hydrolysis rate of DMNP by UiO-66, UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub>, and NU-1000 as a function of RH.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr6\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"am-2019-049279_0005.eps\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 5  (a) Water isotherms of UiO-66, UiO-66-NH2, and NU-1000.
