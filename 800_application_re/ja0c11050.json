This was confirmed by the shift of C\ue5fcN vibration peaks from 2218 to 2241 cm-1 in the FT-IR spectrum of the product. 13C NMR spectra of the model compounds are another evidence for the reduction of C\ue5fbC bond.

The dye absorption amount was determined by measuring the UV-vis spectra in THF (). As shown in c, remarkable size selectivity was observed for the dye uptake: the COFs had very significant uptake of dyes A-C (1.4-7.9 wt%) but had only negligible uptake of dye D (<0.3 wt%). The dye uptake experiment indicated that both the maximum pore diameter and opening of the two COFs were in the range of 2.4 to 3.2 nm, consistent with the crystal structures.\n\nPXRD patterns of the reduced CCOFs are almost the same with the pristine CCOFs, although decreases in signal-to-noise ratio of the peaks were observed, verifying that the crystalline structures of COFs were retained after reduction (c,d). The additional flexibility of C-C bond linkages compared to C\ue5fbC bond linkages prevents tight stacking between layers and leads to slightly decreased crystalline. When finishing the geometrical energy minimization based on the 2D net mode, the unit cell parameters of CCOF 17-R were obtained (a = 51.1 \u00c5, b = 40.8 \u00c5, c = 8.6 \u00c5, \u03b1 = 137.6\u00b0, \u03b2 = 91.1\u00b0, and \u03b3 = 89.0\u00b0). The experimental PXRD pattern for CCOF 17 with P1 space group exhibited main diffraction peaks at 3.55\u00b0, 6.08\u00b0, 7.15\u00b0, 9.32\u00b0, and 11.96\u00b0, which were assigned to the (110), (310), (220), (420), and (2-51) facets, respectively. This PXRD pattern was in good agreement with the simulated pattern based on AA stacking structure of CCOF 17-R. The lattice modeling and Pawley refinement provide good agreement factors (R p = 0.33% and R wp = 0.68%). For CCOF 18-R, the experimental PXRD pattern with P1 space group exhibited peaks at 3.36\u00b0, 6.23\u00b0, 7.07\u00b0, 7.97\u00b0, 10.48\u00b0, and 11.94\u00b0, which were assigned to the (110), (310), (220), (320), (330), and (040) facets, respectively. This PXRD pattern also agreed well with the simulated pattern based on the AA stacking structure of CCOF 18-R. The refinement results yield unit cell parameters that are nearly equivalent to the predictions that a = 50.7 \u00c5, b = 50.0 \u00c5, c = 9.7 \u00c5, \u03b1 = 144.1\u00b0, \u03b2 = 88.3\u00b0, and \u03b3 = 90.8\u00b0 (R p = 0.27% and R wp = 0.69%). So, CCOFs 17-R and 18-R are proposed to have the architectures as illustrated in .\n\nDye uptake experiments and the CFM results revealed that the maximum pore diameter of CCOFs 17-R and 18-R were in the range of 2.4 to 3.2 nm, indicating retention of porous structures of the parent frameworks (c and ). SEM and TEM images showed that both reduced frameworks had a uniform layered morphology (d and ), indicating that the crystal morphology remained unchanged after the solid-state conversion. In TGA curves of CCOF 17-R and 18-R, the weight loss was also observed in the temperature above 350 \u00b0C (), which is almost the same as the parent CCOFs.\n\nChemical Stability\n\nTo evaluate the chemical stability of CCOFs, we immersed them for 1 week in various solvents, including THF, DMF, MeOH, water, concentrated HCl (6 M), and aqueous KOH (14 M) solutions. From PXRD data (a,b and ), CCOFs 17 and 18 are stable and retained their crystallinity. Notably, 17 and 18 exhibited nearly no weight loss (<1 wt%) in common organic solvents, even under strong acidic (6 M HCl) and basic (14 M KOH) conditions; the residual weight percentages were as high as 93 and 88 wt% for 17 and 95 and 93 wt% for 18 (). Also, we did the dye A uptake experiment to check the preservation of pore structure. It was found that the dye absorption amount of 17 and 18 after treating with various solvents showed almost no decrease, indicating retention of their porous structures (c,d).\n\nAs expected, CCOFs 17-R and 18-R keep crystallinity and porosity after soaking in concentrated HCl (6 M) and aqueous KOH (14 M) solutions for 1 week, as indicated by PXRD (a,b). From the residual weight percentages, they exhibit nearly no weight loss (<1 wt%) in organic solvents and little weight loss (<10 wt%) under strong acid (6 M HCl) and base (14 M KOH; ). After these treatments, CCOF 17-R and 18-R can uptake 3-6 and 5-8 wt% of dye A, respectively, which are close to those of the as-synthesized samples (c,d). The present frameworks represent the most stable CCOFs that have been reported thus far (). Obviously, the good chemical stability of these CCOFs are attributed to the stable C\ue5fbC bond and C-C bond linkages.\n\nAs shown in , CCOFs 17, 17-R, 18, and 18-R absorb light in the UV and visible regions, with absorption maxima at 422, 396, 422, and 397 nm, respectively, which are red-shifted by 5-40 nm in comparison to that of the BINOL  2  -C monomer, due to the conjugation in the crystalline structures. Upon illumination with UV light, CCOFs 17 and 18 gave emission maxima at 527 and 511 nm with quantum yields (\u03d5PL) of 5.8% and 6.5%, respectively ( and ), different from P-BINOL  2  -C, which emitted around 495 nm with \u03d5PL of 17.5%. Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that 17 and 18 have a lifetime (\u03c4) of 0.83 and 0.88 ns, which is smaller than 1.65 ns of P-BINOL  2  -C (). The decreased \u03d5PL and \u03c4 values suggest that the \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between layers of sp2c-CCOFs facilitate the nonradiation energy transfer. Interestingly, after reduction, the emission maxima of 17-R and 18-R were blue-shifted to 507 and 493 nm with \u03d5PL of 19.0% and 20.5% and \u03c4 of 2.10 and 2.04 ns, respectively. Compared to the parent CCOFs, the reduced CCOFs show increased \u03d5PL and \u03c4 values. It is likely that the newly formed C-C bond linkages destroyed the \u03c0-conjugated structure of sp2c-CCOFs, leading to the decrease of \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between COF layers and limiting the nonradiation energy transfer. In addition, CD spectra of CCOFs made from the opposite enantiomers were mirror images of each other, suggesting their enantiomeric nature (), consistent with their UV-vis spectra (a,b).\n\nIn contrast, when treated with both d- and l-tryptophanol (TPL), the fluorescence of 17 was quenched and followed Stern-Vo\u0308lmer (S-V) behavior. The quenching rate caused by d-tryptophanol was faster than that by the l-enantiomer, and the fluorescence intensity was decreased to 43% and 66% of the original level, respectively. Based on the linear Stern-Vo\u0308lmer equation, the measured absorbance [I 0/I] varied as a function of [M] in a linear relationship (), where I 0 is the maximum fluorescence intensity before exposure to the analyte and I is the maximum intensity after exposure to the analyte, indicating 1:1 stoichiometry of the interaction between the crown ether of 17 and tryptophanol. The K sv constants were calculated to be 820.5 M-1 and 340.1 M-1 with the d- and l-enantiomers, respectively, affording the quenching ratio [QR = K sv(D-tryptophanol)/K sv(L-tryptophanol)] of 2.41.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "350", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "stable", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["decomposition_temperature"]}, {"idx": 4, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Synthesis\nof the COFs</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr9\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ja0c11050_0009.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Synthesis of the COFs   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 8, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a\u2013d) PXRD patterns of the four\nCCOFs with the experimental\nprofiles in red, Pawley refined in black, calculated in dark green,\nand the difference between the experimental and refined PXRD patterns\nin blue.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ja0c11050_0001.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  (a-d) PXRD patterns of the four CCOFs with the experimental profiles in red, Pawley refined in black, calculated in dark green, and the difference between the experimental and refined PXRD patterns in blue.
