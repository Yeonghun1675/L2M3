The separation between 2-cis-butene from the remaining butene isomers is due to the steric effects. We found a new site of adsorption shown by 2-trans-butene, which explains its higher saturation in the pure adsorption isotherm than for 1-butene. On the basis of these findings, we propose an adsorptive base separation process which explores the ability of MOF-74 to separate the diolefin and 2-cis-butene from the studied mixture. We propose the separation of remaining compounds (1-butene and 2-trans-butene) using zeolite RRO.
