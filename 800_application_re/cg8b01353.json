But Au NPs would tend to coagulate during the catalytic reactions and decreased the initial activities gradually during the catalytic cycles because of their high surface energies. Taking this into consideration, a new nanocatalyst with Au core and MIL-100(Fe) shell was fabricated to solve the above problem. As shown in A, the Au@MIL-100(Fe) core-shell catalyst was synthesized by repeatedly dispersing the Au NPs functionalized by mercaptoacetic acid (MAA) into an ethanol solution of Fe3+ and BTC linkers, respectively. B,C shows the mechanisms of the catalytic conversion of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) with both Au@MIL-100(Fe) core-shell nanoparticles and pure Au nanoparticles. By comparing their catalytic conversion of 4-NP, Au@MIL-100(Fe) core-shell NPs were found to show much higher catalytic activity than pure MIL-100(Fe) and Au NPs in the same reaction time. They attributed the excellent catalytic activity exhibited by Au@MIL-100(Fe) core-shell NPs to the synergistic effect of MIL-100(Fe) and Au NPs. However, it still lacked enough experimental and theoretical evidence to explain the exact mechanism of the synergistically enhanced activity even though the synergistic effect was similar to those reported in some literature. Besides, Au@MIL-100(Fe) core-shell NPs could retain their high catalytic activity after a number of the reaction cycles in the test of recyclability of the Au@MIL-100(Fe) catalyst.

Nowadays, activated carbons, zeolites,\nsilica gels, and polymers are important adsorbents and membranes in\nindustrial applications. With the development of porous materials,\nMOFs become new candidates for gases adsorption and separation due\nto the high thermal stability, chemical stability as well as large\nsurface area. With the above advantages\nand large Langmuir surface area more than 3000 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup>, MIL-100\u00ad(Cr) was reported\nto show a good performance in hydrogen storage. Under the reported experimental conditions, the process\nof adsorbing hydrogen onto MIL-100\u00ad(Cr) was very fast, and it reached\nthermodynamic equilibrium in a few seconds to reach a maximum capacity\nof 3.28 wt %. This value for MIL-100\u00ad(Cr) was compared with those for\nsome well-known MOFs in . The excellent performance on adsorbing hydrogen made MIL-100\u00ad(Cr)\na potential gas adsorbent for hydrogen. Besides that, MIL-100\u00ad(Cr)\ncould be used to adsorb hydrogen sulfide. In comparison, MIL-47\u00ad(V)\nas well as MIL-101\u00ad(Cr) was also tested under the same reported conditions. Similar to the structure of MIL-100, MIL-101\nwas also built from the octahedral trimers which were connected by\nterephthalate instead of trimesate. Accoding\nto their H<sub>2</sub>S adsorption isotherms (), MIL-101\u00ad(Cr) and MIL-100\u00ad(Cr) with a rigid\npore exhibited isotherms of monotypic type-I shape. The maximum adsorbed\namounts of H<sub>2</sub>S onto MIL-101\u00ad(Cr) and MIL-100\u00ad(Cr) at high\npressure (2 MPa) were 38.4 mmol g<sup>\u20131</sup> and 16.7 mmol\ng<sup>\u20131</sup>, respectively. Though both MIL solids showed\nexcellent adsorption performance, the adsorption for H<sub>2</sub>S was partially irreversible, which was attributed to the partial\ndestruction of MIL-100\u00ad(Cr) and MIL-101\u00ad(Cr) frameworks or the strong\ninteractions between their frameworks and the hydrogen sulfide molecules.\nTherefore, MIL-100\u00ad(Cr) was not suitable as recyclable hydrogen sulfide\nadsorbents under the reported conditions.\n</p><p>Besides the adsorption of hydrogen\nand hydrogen sulfide, MIL-100\u00ad(Cr)\nalso could adsorb huge amounts of two main greenhouse gases, carbon\ndioxide and methane. Infrared experiments\nas well as the use of a CO probe molecule showed that the relatively\nstrong interaction between Cr<sup>3+</sup> coordinatively unsaturated\nsites and gas molecules played an important role in gases adsorption.\nThe adsorption isotherm of CH<sub>4</sub> onto MIL-100\u00ad(Cr) showed\nno evidence of total pore filling for it increasing with pressure\ngradually. But the amount adsorbed onto MIL-100\u00ad(Cr) at 3.5 MPa and\n303 K was about 119 cm<sup>3</sup> of CH<sub>4</sub>(STP) per cm<sup>3</sup>, which was far below that of MIL-53 solids (\u223c150 cm<sup>3</sup>\n<sub>STP</sub> cm<sup>\u20133</sup>). For CO<sub>2</sub>, the amount adsorbed at 5.0 MPa and 304 K reached\n18 mmol g<sup>\u20131</sup>. This value for MIL-100\u00ad(Cr) was larger\nthan that of silicalite (\u223c2.5 mmol g<sup>\u20131</sup>),\nzeolite NaX (\u223c7.8 mmol g<sup>\u20131</sup>), MIL-53\u00ad(Al, Cr)\n(\u223c10 mmol g<sup>\u20131</sup>), and HKUST-1 (\u223c10.7\nmmol g<sup>\u20131</sup>) under the same conditions. More importantly, the isotherms obtained for\nMIL-100\u00ad(Cr) were reversible under certain conditions. The large amounts\nof CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> adsorbed together with reversible\nadsorption made MIL-100\u00ad(Cr) an attractive candidate for gases adsorbent.</p><title>MIL-100\u00ad(Fe)</title><p>With the further study\nof MIL-100, MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) was found to show a good performance in gas\nadsorption and separation. First, MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) with mesoporous cages\ncould be a potential water vapor adsorbent. According to its water sorption isotherm at 30 \u00b0C, MIL-100\u00ad(Fe)\nshowed outstanding water sorption uptakes up to 0.873 g H<sub>2</sub>O per g dry absorbent at partial pressures of over 0.5. This value\nfor MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) absorbent was much higher than those of representative\nMOFs including HKUST-1, UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub>, and MOF-74 and commercial adsorbents including NaX (0.336\ng g<sup>\u20131</sup>), SAPO-34 (0.330 g g<sup>\u20131</sup>),\nand silica gel (0.327 g g<sup>\u20131</sup>). In contrast to the\nconventional porous materials which needed to be dehydrated at high\ntemperature before use, the MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) adsorbent required a dehydration\ntemperature of 30 \u00b0C. The excellent performance in water vapor\nadsorption exhibited by MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) suggested commercially viable\napplication of energy-effcient desiccant dehumidification.</p><p>Second,\nduring the reported fabrication process of MIL-100\u00ad(Fe), the terminal H<sub>2</sub>O in the MIL-100\u00ad(Fe)\nframework were removable through a vacuum heating method, leading\nto many coordinatively unsaturated metal sites (CUSs) which could\nstrongly modify interactions with various gases. The amount of Fe<sup>III</sup>CUS and Fe<sup>II</sup>CUS\ncould be controlled under the different activation conditions, leading\nto the gases adsorbents with different selectivity. Through the comparison\nof gases adsorbed in MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) activated in different conditions,\nMIL-100\u00ad(Fe) with Fe<sup>II</sup>CUS showed better performance on CO\nadsorption than CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption while MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) with Fe<sup>III</sup>CUS showed higher adsorption capacity of propylene than\nthat of propane due to the different interaction of metal CUS with\ndifferent gases. Before long, the nature\nand role of the coordinatively unsaturated sites in the framework\nof MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) had been further studied and identified by getting\none family of sites poisoned selectively during the separation process. As the result, the Fe<sup>II</sup> sites were\nfound to play a vital role in the successful separation of propane\nand propene from their mixture due to their different affinity for\nthe C\ue5fbC bonds in propene. Besides, the coordination of the\nwater molecules on Lewis metal sites could influence the CO<sub>2</sub> uptake with MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) adsorbent. The\nadsorption capacities of MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) for CO<sub>2</sub> were tested\nunder different relative humidities. As the results, MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) showed\nremarkable 5-fold enhancement in CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption up to 105\nmg/g carbon dioxide at the relative humidities of 40%. Under the same\nconditions, the CO<sub>2</sub> uptake in UiO-66 remained similar,\nwhile HKUST-1 was unstable toward water vapor. The amount of CO<sub>2</sub> adsorbed in MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) was larger than that of UiO-66 (ca.\n27 mg g<sup>\u20131</sup>) and HKUST-1 (ca. 40 mg g<sup>\u20131</sup>) at the same tested pressure in other reports. The high CO<sub>2</sub> uptake in the MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) framework in the\npresence of humidity was attributable to the microporous pockets filled\nwith CO<sub>2</sub> formed in the mesoporous MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) (). However, the similar\nstronger adsorption sites in the presence of water vapor could not\nbe formed in UiO-66 and HKUST-1. Therefore, the enhanced carbon dioxide\nuptake in MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) with water-filled mesopores demonstrated that\nMIL-100\u00ad(Fe) was a good gas adsorbent.</p><p>Yoon et al. also researched the separation\nand purification of light hydrocarbons including methane, ethane,\nethylene, and acetylene with MIL-100\u00ad(Fe). To explore the adsorptive\nseparation properties of MIL-100\u00ad(Fe), single-component equilibrium\nadsorption experiments of methane and C<sub>2</sub> hydrocarbons with\nMIL-100\u00ad(Fe) were conducted under the same conditions. According to\ntheir adsorption isotherms at 293 and 313 K (), the amount of light hydrocarbons adsorbed\nonto MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) followed the order of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> &gt;\nC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> &gt; C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> &gt; CH<sub>4</sub>. And at 101 kPa and 293 K, the\namount\nof acetylene uptake in MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) reached 119 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup>. Though this value was lower than that of MIL-101\u00ad(Cr)\n(144 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> at 313 K) under similar\nconditions, MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) showed better\nphysicochemical and hydrothermal properties than those of MIL-101\u00ad(Cr). Furthermore, MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) was found to display\nhigh selectivity for acetylene over ethylene, which was attributed\nto strong interactions between surface OH sites and the Fe<sup>III</sup> sites of MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) with acetylene while weak interaction with\nethylene. However, MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) showed low selectivity\nfor acetylene over ethylene where Fe<sup>II</sup> sites existed due\nto the nonselective adsorption of both gases at the Fe<sup>II</sup> sites. Therefore, the unsaturated metal\nsites within the pores acted as the Lewis acids and made MIL-100\u00ad(Fe)\na good candidate for gases adsorbents with high adsorption selectivity.</p><p>The specific \ue5fcFeOH sites which were located\ninside the pores\nas well as the carbon \ue5fcC<sub>\n<italic>x</italic>\n</sub>OH<sub>2</sub> sites which were located on the surface also played important\nroles in arsenite [As\u00ad(III)] uptake in MIL-100\u00ad(Fe). According to the As\u00ad(III) adsorption experiments with MIL-100\u00ad(Fe),\nthe maximum adsorption capacity of As\u00ad(III) with MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) adsorbent\nreached 120 mg/g at pH 7\u20138. This value for MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) was\nfar higher than those for its carbonized products (\u223c21 mg g<sup>\u20131</sup>), which demonstrated the important part of Fe sites\nversus carbon sites in As\u00ad(III) uptake. Besides, the adsorptive capacity\nof MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) for the arsenite was also far higher than those of\nthe graphite/graphite oxide and activated carbon analogues, and comparable\nto the value for MIL-101\u00ad(Cr). After serving iron mesh as a substrate\nto provide the iron for in situ growth of MIL-100\u00ad(Fe), iron mesh-based\nMIL-100\u00ad(Fe) was obtained and could be used to remove arsenic from\ngroundwater efficiently. With this synthetic\nmethod, the iron mesh-based MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) could act as a dual-functional\nsystem to oxidize As\u00ad(III) to less-toxic As\u00ad(V) due to the Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Fe<sup>3+</sup> sites. Moreover, oxygen bubbling as well as Joule\nheating could improve the removal efficiency for As\u00ad(III) and achieve\nthe effect on removing As\u00ad(III) completely. Therefore, MIL-100\u00ad(Fe)\ncould be applied as an excellent As\u00ad(III) adsorbent with excellent\nstructural stability, high surface area, and abundant active adsorption\nsites.</p><p>Carbon monoxide (CO) has a wide range of applications\nin the chemical\nindustry, but it is generally mixed with some other gases, leading\nto great difficulty in separating CO from mixed gas before further\nutilization. MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) itself did not show\na good performce in CO adsorption capacities. To enhance the adsorption\ncapacity of carbon monoxide, Cu\u00ad(I)@\u00adMIL-100\u00ad(Fe), a new functionalized\nmaterial, was prepared because functionalizing MOFs with Cu\u00ad(I) could\nenhance the separation selectivity of MOFs in many reports. The adsorption capacity of CO on both Cu\u00ad(I)@\u00adMIL-100\u00ad(Fe) and\nparent MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) was measured under the same conditions. The adsorption\ncapacity of CO was found to be related to the content of Cu\u00ad(I), and\nthe highest CO adsorption capacity in Cu\u00ad(I)@\u00adMIL-100\u00ad(Fe) is showed\nin . In comparison,\nthe CO adsorption capacity with the synthesized Cu\u00ad(I)@\u00adMIL-100\u00ad(Fe)\nadsorbent was up to 2.78 mmol/g, which was not only 7 times that of\nMIL-100\u00ad(Fe) itself but also higher than conventional adsorbents. Furthermore,\nthe N<sub>2</sub> adsorption capacity of the synthesized Cu\u00ad(I)@\u00adMIL-100\u00ad(Fe)\ndecreased, and the selectivity of CO and N<sub>2</sub> became higher\ncompared to that of MIL-100\u00ad(Fe). They attributed the high adsorption\ncapacity of carbon monoxide to the strong \u03c0-complexation between\ncarbon monoxide and the Cu\u00ad(I)@\u00adMIL-100\u00ad(Fe). Therefore, with high CO/N<sub>2</sub> selectivity, Cu\u00ad(I)@\u00adMIL-100\u00ad(Fe)\nwas able to be applied as a new effective adsorbent for the separation\nof CO/N<sub>2</sub>.</p>", "clean_text": "Horcajada et al. had successfully synthesized a series of mesoporous and environmentally friendly iron(III) polycarboxylates including MIL-100 and MIL-101 that were isostructural and/or similar functionalization. Their free diameters, microporous windows, pore volumes, and surface areas were compared with each other. Concretely, MIL-100 solids exhibited giant pores whose free diameters were 25 and 29 \u00c5, while MIL-101 exhibited giant pores of 29 and 34 \u00c5. Their pore volumes and BET surface areas ranged from 1.2 to 2.0 cm3 g-1 and from 2500 to 4500 m2 g-1, respectively. These values for MIL-100 were comparable to the values for the reported MOFs with the largest mesopore sizes. Furthermore, MIL-100 showed a good thermal stability up to the temperature of 473 K and retained its structure in protic polar solvents at least 1 or 2 months. MIL-101 materials have been proved to show a superior catalytic performance in hydrogen sulfide adsorption and the oxidation of cyclohexane, aromatic compounds with  t BuOOH, or other heterogeneous reactions. Thus, the synthesis and potential applications of MIL-100 are also well worth studying.\n\nApplication of MIL-100\n\nAdsorbents\n\nMIL-100(Cr)\n\nIt is a significant and challenging work to find suitable porous materials for gases adsorption and separation in industry. Nowadays, activated carbons, zeolites, silica gels, and polymers are important adsorbents and membranes in industrial applications. With the development of porous materials, MOFs become new candidates for gases adsorption and separation due to the high thermal stability, chemical stability as well as large surface area. With the above advantages and large Langmuir surface area more than 3000 m2 g-1, MIL-100(Cr) was reported to show a good performance in hydrogen storage. Under the reported experimental conditions, the process of adsorbing hydrogen onto MIL-100(Cr) was very fast, and it reached thermodynamic equilibrium in a few seconds to reach a maximum capacity of 3.28 wt %. This value for MIL-100(Cr) was compared with those for some well-known MOFs in . The excellent performance on adsorbing hydrogen made MIL-100(Cr) a potential gas adsorbent for hydrogen. Besides that, MIL-100(Cr) could be used to adsorb hydrogen sulfide. In comparison, MIL-47(V) as well as MIL-101(Cr) was also tested under the same reported conditions. Similar to the structure of MIL-100, MIL-101 was also built from the octahedral trimers which were connected by terephthalate instead of trimesate. Accoding to their H2S adsorption isotherms (), MIL-101(Cr) and MIL-100(Cr) with a rigid pore exhibited isotherms of monotypic type-I shape. The maximum adsorbed amounts of H2S onto MIL-101(Cr) and MIL-100(Cr) at high pressure (2 MPa) were 38.4 mmol g-1 and 16.7 mmol g-1, respectively. Though both MIL solids showed excellent adsorption performance, the adsorption for H2S was partially irreversible, which was attributed to the partial destruction of MIL-100(Cr) and MIL-101(Cr) frameworks or the strong interactions between their frameworks and the hydrogen sulfide molecules. Therefore, MIL-100(Cr) was not suitable as recyclable hydrogen sulfide adsorbents under the reported conditions. \n\nBesides the adsorption of hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide, MIL-100(Cr) also could adsorb huge amounts of two main greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide and methane. Infrared experiments as well as the use of a CO probe molecule showed that the relatively strong interaction between Cr3+ coordinatively unsaturated sites and gas molecules played an important role in gases adsorption. The adsorption isotherm of CH4 onto MIL-100(Cr) showed no evidence of total pore filling for it increasing with pressure gradually. But the amount adsorbed onto MIL-100(Cr) at 3.5 MPa and 303 K was about 119 cm3 of CH4(STP) per cm3, which was far below that of MIL-53 solids (~150 cm3 STP cm-3). For CO2, the amount adsorbed at 5.0 MPa and 304 K reached 18 mmol g-1. This value for MIL-100(Cr) was larger than that of silicalite (~2.5 mmol g-1), zeolite NaX (~7.8 mmol g-1), MIL-53(Al, Cr) (~10 mmol g-1), and HKUST-1 (~10.7 mmol g-1) under the same conditions. More importantly, the isotherms obtained for MIL-100(Cr) were reversible under certain conditions. The large amounts of CH4 and CO2 adsorbed together with reversible adsorption made MIL-100(Cr) an attractive candidate for gases adsorbent.\n\nMIL-100(Fe)\n\nWith the further study of MIL-100, MIL-100(Fe) was found to show a good performance in gas adsorption and separation. First, MIL-100(Fe) with mesoporous cages could be a potential water vapor adsorbent. According to its water sorption isotherm at 30 \u00b0C, MIL-100(Fe) showed outstanding water sorption uptakes up to 0.873 g H2O per g dry absorbent at partial pressures of over 0.5. This value for MIL-100(Fe) absorbent was much higher than those of representative MOFs including HKUST-1, UiO-66-NH2, and MOF-74 and commercial adsorbents including NaX (0.336 g g-1), SAPO-34 (0.330 g g-1), and silica gel (0.327 g g-1). In contrast to the conventional porous materials which needed to be dehydrated at high temperature before use, the MIL-100(Fe) adsorbent required a dehydration temperature of 30 \u00b0C. The excellent performance in water vapor adsorption exhibited by MIL-100(Fe) suggested commercially viable application of energy-effcient desiccant dehumidification.\n\nSecond, during the reported fabrication process of MIL-100(Fe), the terminal H2O in the MIL-100(Fe) framework were removable through a vacuum heating method, leading to many coordinatively unsaturated metal sites (CUSs) which could strongly modify interactions with various gases. The amount of FeIIICUS and FeIICUS could be controlled under the different activation conditions, leading to the gases adsorbents with different selectivity. Through the comparison of gases adsorbed in MIL-100(Fe) activated in different conditions, MIL-100(Fe) with FeIICUS showed better performance on CO adsorption than CO2 adsorption while MIL-100(Fe) with FeIIICUS showed higher adsorption capacity of propylene than that of propane due to the different interaction of metal CUS with different gases. Before long, the nature and role of the coordinatively unsaturated sites in the framework of MIL-100(Fe) had been further studied and identified by getting one family of sites poisoned selectively during the separation process. As the result, the FeII sites were found to play a vital role in the successful separation of propane and propene from their mixture due to their different affinity for the C\ue5fbC bonds in propene. Besides, the coordination of the water molecules on Lewis metal sites could influence the CO2 uptake with MIL-100(Fe) adsorbent. The adsorption capacities of MIL-100(Fe) for CO2 were tested under different relative humidities. As the results, MIL-100(Fe) showed remarkable 5-fold enhancement in CO2 adsorption up to 105 mg/g carbon dioxide at the relative humidities of 40%. Under the same conditions, the CO2 uptake in UiO-66 remained similar, while HKUST-1 was unstable toward water vapor. The amount of CO2 adsorbed in MIL-100(Fe) was larger than that of UiO-66 (ca. 27 mg g-1) and HKUST-1 (ca. 40 mg g-1) at the same tested pressure in other reports. The high CO2 uptake in the MIL-100(Fe) framework in the presence of humidity was attributable to the microporous pockets filled with CO2 formed in the mesoporous MIL-100(Fe) (). However, the similar stronger adsorption sites in the presence of water vapor could not be formed in UiO-66 and HKUST-1. Therefore, the enhanced carbon dioxide uptake in MIL-100(Fe) with water-filled mesopores demonstrated that MIL-100(Fe) was a good gas adsorbent.\n\nYoon et al. also researched the separation and purification of light hydrocarbons including methane, ethane, ethylene, and acetylene with MIL-100(Fe). To explore the adsorptive separation properties of MIL-100(Fe), single-component equilibrium adsorption experiments of methane and C2 hydrocarbons with MIL-100(Fe) were conducted under the same conditions. According to their adsorption isotherms at 293 and 313 K (), the amount of light hydrocarbons adsorbed onto MIL-100(Fe) followed the order of C2H2 > C2H4 > C2H6 > CH4. And at 101 kPa and 293 K, the amount of acetylene uptake in MIL-100(Fe) reached 119 cm3 g-1. Though this value was lower than that of MIL-101(Cr) (144 cm3 g-1 at 313 K) under similar conditions, MIL-100(Fe) showed better physicochemical and hydrothermal properties than those of MIL-101(Cr). Furthermore, MIL-100(Fe) was found to display high selectivity for acetylene over ethylene, which was attributed to strong interactions between surface OH sites and the FeIII sites of MIL-100(Fe) with acetylene while weak interaction with ethylene. However, MIL-100(Fe) showed low selectivity for acetylene over ethylene where FeII sites existed due to the nonselective adsorption of both gases at the FeII sites. Therefore, the unsaturated metal sites within the pores acted as the Lewis acids and made MIL-100(Fe) a good candidate for gases adsorbents with high adsorption selectivity.\n\nThe specific \ue5fcFeOH sites which were located inside the pores as well as the carbon \ue5fcC x OH2 sites which were located on the surface also played important roles in arsenite [As(III)] uptake in MIL-100(Fe). According to the As(III) adsorption experiments with MIL-100(Fe), the maximum adsorption capacity of As(III) with MIL-100(Fe) adsorbent reached 120 mg/g at pH 7-8. This value for MIL-100(Fe) was far higher than those for its carbonized products (~21 mg g-1), which demonstrated the important part of Fe sites versus carbon sites in As(III) uptake. Besides, the adsorptive capacity of MIL-100(Fe) for the arsenite was also far higher than those of the graphite/graphite oxide and activated carbon analogues, and comparable to the value for MIL-101(Cr). After serving iron mesh as a substrate to provide the iron for in situ growth of MIL-100(Fe), iron mesh-based MIL-100(Fe) was obtained and could be used to remove arsenic from groundwater efficiently. With this synthetic method, the iron mesh-based MIL-100(Fe) could act as a dual-functional system to oxidize As(III) to less-toxic As(V) due to the Fe2+/Fe3+ sites. Moreover, oxygen bubbling as well as Joule heating could improve the removal efficiency for As(III) and achieve the effect on removing As(III) completely. Therefore, MIL-100(Fe) could be applied as an excellent As(III) adsorbent with excellent structural stability, high surface area, and abundant active adsorption sites.\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO) has a wide range of applications in the chemical industry, but it is generally mixed with some other gases, leading to great difficulty in separating CO from mixed gas before further utilization. MIL-100(Fe) itself did not show a good performce in CO adsorption capacities. To enhance the adsorption capacity of carbon monoxide, Cu(I)@MIL-100(Fe), a new functionalized material, was prepared because functionalizing MOFs with Cu(I) could enhance the separation selectivity of MOFs in many reports. The adsorption capacity of CO on both Cu(I)@MIL-100(Fe) and parent MIL-100(Fe) was measured under the same conditions. The adsorption capacity of CO was found to be related to the content of Cu(I), and the highest CO adsorption capacity in Cu(I)@MIL-100(Fe) is showed in . In comparison, the CO adsorption capacity with the synthesized Cu(I)@MIL-100(Fe) adsorbent was up to 2.78 mmol/g, which was not only 7 times that of MIL-100(Fe) itself but also higher than conventional adsorbents. Furthermore, the N2 adsorption capacity of the synthesized Cu(I)@MIL-100(Fe) decreased, and the selectivity of CO and N2 became higher compared to that of MIL-100(Fe). They attributed the high adsorption capacity of carbon monoxide to the strong \u03c0-complexation between carbon monoxide and the Cu(I)@MIL-100(Fe). Therefore, with high CO/N2 selectivity, Cu(I)@MIL-100(Fe) was able to be applied as a new effective adsorbent for the separation of CO/N2.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "MIL-100", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "119", "unit": "cm3", "temperature": "303 K", "pressure": "3.5 MPa", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "CH4", "adsorbed amount": "119", "unit": "cm3", "temperature": "101 kPa, 293 K", "pressure": "", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "18", "unit": "mmol g\u20131", "temperature": "5.0 MPa, 304 K", "pressure": "", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "MIL-100\u00ad(Cr)", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "H2", "adsorbed amount": "3.28", "unit": "wt%", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "H2S", "adsorbed amount": "16.7", "unit": "mmol g\u20131", "temperature": "2 MPa", "pressure": "", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "MIL-101", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "H2S", "adsorbed amount": "38.4", "unit": "mmol g\u20131", "temperature": "2 MPa", "pressure": "", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "MIL-100\u00ad(Fe)", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "CO", "adsorbed amount": "2.78", "unit": "mmol/g", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["gas_adsorption"]}, {"idx": "29, 34", "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<title>MIL-100\u00ad(Al)</title><p>MIL-100\u00ad(Al) was also\nstudied to adsorb gases because of its large BET surface area, high\nthermal/\u200bchemical stability, and three-dimensional mesoporous\nstructural feature.
