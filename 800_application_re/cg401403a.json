Apart from the conventional applications, MOFs have been used as\nphotoluminescent materials, owing to their higher stability compared\nto the organic materials and some typical advantages over inorganics. Generally, d<sup>10</sup> complexes are promising to exhibit the\nphotoluminescence properties. We have\ninvestigated the solid-state emission properties of both the ligands\nas well as complexes <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> (Figure ). The solid-state fluorescence maxima of 1,3-adaa\nand bpmh was observed at 406 and 403 nm excited at \u03bb<sub>ex</sub> = 280 nm, respectively (Figures S19 and S20 of the ). The emission spectra of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> resembles both ligands, but the intensity of\nboth the complexes were different. Complexes <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> exhibit an emission band with a maxima at 406 nm for an\nexcitation at \u03bb<sub>ex</sub> = 280 nm (Figures S21 and S22 of\nthe ). For d<sup>10</sup> complexes, no emission originates from metal-centered MLCT/LMCT\nexcited states, since the d<sup>10</sup> metal ions are difficult\nto be oxidized or reduced. Thus, the\nemission observed in the complexes is tentatively assigned to the\n(n \u2192 \u03c0* and \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0*) intraligand fluorescence\n(i.e., ligand-based emission). The difference in the intensity of\nthe emission band of compounds <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> from\nthe ligands may be attributed to a different rigidity of the crystal\npacking in the solid state. The slight\ndifferences in the positions of luminescent peaks in compounds <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> may be due to the different coordination\nmodes of the ligands. It is surprising to note that there is no emission\nband observed for compound <bold>3</bold> on excitation in the range\nof 280 to 372 nm, although intense fluorescent emissions were observed\nfor free ligands. [Fluorescence maxima was observed at 456 nm (\u03bb<sub>ex</sub> = 372 nm) for free 1,4-H<sub>2</sub>pdaa and at 402 nm (\u03bb<sub>ex</sub> = 208 nm) for free bpmh]. Although the reason for the absence\nof the emission band for complex <bold>3</bold> was not clear, it\nmight be attributed to the difference in the dicarboxylate ligand.\nSince in <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>, the 1,3-adaa ligand contains\na rigid adamantane ring which, upon coordination [Zn(II) for <bold>1</bold> and Cd(II) for <bold>2</bold>, respectively], increases\nthe rigidity of the ligand and reduces the loss of energy by radiationless\ndecay, thereby enhancing the luminescence in comparison to <bold>3</bold>. In compound <bold>3</bold>, the 1,4-pdaa\nligand does not have such a type of rigid moiety, which might contribute\nto the absence of the luminescence.</p><title>Magnetic Properties</title><p>For magnetic\ninvestigation, dc\nsusceptibility data was collected for compound <bold>4</bold> on the\npolycrystalline sample in the temperature range of 1.8\u2013300\nK at 0.1 T.

Compound 1 was stable up to 180 \u00b0C, and then a rapid weight loss of ~34% (exptl) was observed between 180 to 320 \u00b0C, which can be attributed to the loss of bpmh linkers (calcd = 39.8%) and then decomposes to an unidentified product. Compound 2 was found to be stable up to 260 \u00b0C; the first step weight loss of 31% (calcd = 37%) in the range of 260-350 \u00b0C could be due to the loss of the bpmh linker, and the second step weight loss of ~40% (calcd = 44%) in the temperature range of 350-500 \u00b0C is due to the decomposition of the 1,3-adaa ligand, and the remaining organic ligands start burning above 500 \u00b0C. Compound 3 was stable up to 120 \u00b0C, and a weight loss of 45% was observed between 120 and 320 \u00b0C and then gradually decomposed in the temperature range of 320-500 \u00b0C, whereas compound 4, also stable up to 120 \u00b0C, then started losing the 1,4-pdaa ligand, which was confirmed by 40% weight loss (calcd = 42%). The second step weight loss started at 270 \u00b0C probably due to decomposition.\n\nLuminescence Properties\n\nThe ligand-based luminescence in MOF's is an attractive research topic for the selective sensing and detection of the metal ions. Apart from the conventional applications, MOFs have been used as photoluminescent materials, owing to their higher stability compared to the organic materials and some typical advantages over inorganics. Generally, d10 complexes are promising to exhibit the photoluminescence properties. We have investigated the solid-state emission properties of both the ligands as well as complexes 1 and 2 (Figure ). The solid-state fluorescence maxima of 1,3-adaa and bpmh was observed at 406 and 403 nm excited at \u03bbex = 280 nm, respectively (Figures S19 and S20 of the ). The emission spectra of 1 and 2 resembles both ligands, but the intensity of both the complexes were different. Complexes 1 and 2 exhibit an emission band with a maxima at 406 nm for an excitation at \u03bbex = 280 nm (Figures S21 and S22 of the ). For d10 complexes, no emission originates from metal-centered MLCT/LMCT excited states, since the d10 metal ions are difficult to be oxidized or reduced. Thus, the emission observed in the complexes is tentatively assigned to the (n \u2192 \u03c0* and \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0*) intraligand fluorescence (i.e., ligand-based emission). The difference in the intensity of the emission band of compounds 1 and 2 from the ligands may be attributed to a different rigidity of the crystal packing in the solid state. The slight differences in the positions of luminescent peaks in compounds 1 and 2 may be due to the different coordination modes of the ligands. It is surprising to note that there is no emission band observed for compound 3 on excitation in the range of 280 to 372 nm, although intense fluorescent emissions were observed for free ligands. [Fluorescence maxima was observed at 456 nm (\u03bbex = 372 nm) for free 1,4-H2pdaa and at 402 nm (\u03bbex = 208 nm) for free bpmh]. Although the reason for the absence of the emission band for complex 3 was not clear, it might be attributed to the difference in the dicarboxylate ligand. Since in 1 and 2, the 1,3-adaa ligand contains a rigid adamantane ring which, upon coordination [Zn(II) for 1 and Cd(II) for 2, respectively], increases the rigidity of the ligand and reduces the loss of energy by radiationless decay, thereby enhancing the luminescence in comparison to 3. In compound 3, the 1,4-pdaa ligand does not have such a type of rigid moiety, which might contribute to the absence of the luminescence.\n\nMagnetic Properties\n\nFor magnetic investigation, dc susceptibility data was collected for compound 4 on the polycrystalline sample in the temperature range of 1.8-300 K at 0.1 T. The dc magnetic susceptibilities are shown in the form of the \u03c7M T (where \u03c7M is the molecular magnetic susceptibility) versus temperature (T) plot in Figure . The room temperature \u03c7M T value of 4.88 cm3 mol-1 K is higher than the expected spin-only value of 3.75 cm3 mol-1 K (for 2 isolated Co2+, g = 2.0) due to the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment. Once the temperature is lowered from 300 K, the \u03c7M T value decreases gradually, due to the antiferromagnetic interactions between metal centers and shows a plateaulike behavior between 20 to 10 K, probably owing to the spin-orbit coupling effect. With further decline of temperature, the \u03c7M T value decreases rapidly to reach the value of 2.55 cm3 mol-1 K at 1.8 K. The decline at a low temperature is probably due to zero-field splitting. \n\nThe magnetic susceptibility above 50 K nicely follow the Curie-Weiss law [\u03c7M T = C/(T - \u03b8)], giving C = 5.3 cm3 K mol-1 and \u03b8 = -29.6 K (Figure S23 of the ). The negative value of \u03b8 indicates antiferromagnetic coupling between the Co(II) ions. To understand the low-temperature behavior, the experimental data (Figure ) were fitted using the noncritical-scaling theory with the following simple phenomenological equation.     \u03c7   M   T = A \u2061 exp  ( -   E   1   / k T )  + B \u2061 exp  ( -   E   2   / k T )   where E 1 > 0 represents the activation energies corresponding to the spin-orbit coupling, E 2 signifies the antiferromagnetic exchange interactions, and (A + B) equals the Curie constant. The best fit to the above equation was obtained with the fitting value of E 1/k = 0.38 cm-1, E 2/k = 85.21 cm-1, and (A + B) = 5.4 cm3 K mol-1. Obtained A + B values agrees well with the fitting of the Curie-Weiss equation at high temperature. The low E 1 value suggests little contribution of the spin-orbit coupling, and a high value of E 1 indicates significant antiferromagnetic exchange between adjacent Co2+ centers.\n\nThe M/N\u03bcB verses H plots from 2 to 10 K (Figures S24 of the ) show a steady increase with the field that reaches up to 3.44 \u03bcB at 7 T and 2 K, which is inconsistent with the expected value of 6 \u03bcB (for 2 isolated Co2+, g = 2.0). This indicates the presence of antiferromagnetic interactions, even at the highest field of 7 T. The M/N\u03bcB verses the H/T plot (Figure S25 of the ) further confirms the presence of the little anisotropy of Co2+ centers, which prevents single molecular magnetic behavior from being shown.",
