When HBABSA was loaded into MOF-808,\nthe composite can be stable at approximately 140 \u00b0C, and the\nconsiderable weight loss at 140\u2013560 \u00b0C mainly belongs\nto the thermal decomposition of the HBABSA compound in MOF-808 pores.\nIf the HBABSA as a \u03c0-conjugated molecule exists in an aggregative\nstate, the strong interactions of \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking\nbetween the aryl rings from the molecules would lead to the relatively\nhigh thermal stability. When the HBABSA molecules are introduced into\nMOF pores in a monomeric state, the strong interactions are destructed,\nwhich would result in a declined decomposition temperature (ca. 140\n\u00b0C). Additionally, the increased thermal stability of parent\nMOF-808 in HBABSA@MOF-808 possibly originated from the interaction\nof the HBABSA and MOF.

It is desirable to develop the appropriate stimulus signal and high proton-conducting materials with an excellent proton-conducting switch ratio (\u03b3), but it remains a great challenge. Here, it can be found for the first time that 4-((2-hydroxybenzylidene)amino)benzenesulfonic acid (HBABSA) has obvious thermal isomerization when porous solids act as matrixes at the ambient temperatures, which is different from that in the crystalline state at 77 K. Therefore, we proposed a host-guest metal-organic framework (MOF) composite, namely, MOF-808 incorporated with HBABSA (HBABSA@MOF-808), which has a proton-conducting switch ratio (\u03b3) of 16 between 338 and 343 K due to the thermally induced isomerization of HBABSA molecules in the MOF pores. The strong binding between the keto-type HBABSA and MOF at the relatively low temperatures can efficiently suppress the proton conduction, while the enol-type one provides more mobile protons for conduction at the high temperatures due to the excited-state intramolecular proton transfer mechanism. Further, the HBABSA@MOF-808 as a filler is blended into polyvinyl alcohol and poly(2-acrylamide-2-methyl-1-propane sulfonic acid) to form hybrid membranes. The hybrid membrane with the highest content of the MOF composite displays a high proton conductivity of 5.57 \u00d7 10-3 S\u22c5cm-1 under 353 K and 57% RH along with a good switch ratio of 5.4. The development of thermal-response proton-conducting MOF materials is opening up a unique pathway for remote control, thermal sensing, intelligent batteries, and other fields.\n\nIn this work, a thermal-responsive MOF composite is fabricated by encapsulating a thermochromic compound, namely, 4-((2-hydroxybenzylidene)amino)benzenesulfonic acid (HBABSA), into MOF-808 (HBABSA@MOF-808) crystals by the post-impregnation method. The MOF-808 has a high oxidation state of the central Zr(IV) metal atom, which can form a strong bond with O atoms, aiding us to obtain the high thermal and chemical stability and further giving the advantage of chemical modification and installation of functional groups to maintain the stable structure; the large adamantane cages in MOF-808 with a 1.84 nm internal diameter and 1.4 nm pore window enables efficient absorption and encapsulation of HBABSA molecules. Resultantly, when HBABSA is introduced into MOF-808, the composite exhibited outstanding thermal-stimulation switching properties with a high switching ratio of 16, and the conductivity at 353 K is 1.42 \u00d7 10-4 S cm-1 at 57% RH as confirmed by a series of optic tests on the reversible keto/enol isomerization of HBABSA, complying with the ESIPT mechanism in solution and MOF-808 pores together with temperature-dependent impedance at low humidity. Further, the HBABSA@MOF-808 as a filler and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and poly(2-acrylamide-2-methyl-1-propane sulfonic acid) (PAMPS) as polymer matrixes are applied to mold the hybrid membranes by a solution-casting method. The results show that the 25% HBABSA@MOF-808-filled hybrid membrane has a large switching rate of 5.4 at 57% RH and a conductivity of 5.57 \u00d7 10-3 S cm-1 at 353 K. This is profited from an increase in the amount of enol-type HBABSA molecules in MOF-808 induced by thermal isomerization and enhanced proton mobility by raising the temperature. Thus, the proton conductivity of MOFs can be reversibly adjusted by controlling the surrounding temperature. Delightfully, this work realized MOF-based hybrid membranes with high proton conductivity and thermo-switchable properties simultaneously at low humidity.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nCharacterization of HBABSA@MOF-808 and Hybrid Membranes\n\nThe MOF-808 and its composite were characterized by XRD, FT-IR, and N2 adsorption (). As seen from a, the XRD peaks of the HBABSA@MOF-808 composite are similar to those of the simulated MOF-808, indicating that the original skeleton structure and crystallinity of MOF-808 are not changed when HBABSA is incorporated. The functional groups of HBABSA, MOF-808, and HBABSA@MOF-808 are confirmed by FT-IR, and the result is shown in b. The peaks at 1121 and 1034 cm-1 are regarded as the S\ue5fbO stretching of sulfonic groups, and the peak located at 1653 cm-1 corresponds to C\ue5fbO stretching. For HBABSA, the peaks at 1549 and 1162 cm-1 correspond to C\ue5fbN and C-N stretching, respectively, while for HBABSA@MOF-808, the stretching peak of C\ue5fbN appeared as a blue shift (1495 cm-1) and the stretching peak of C-N appeared as a red shift (1180 cm-1), which showed that MOF-808 promoted the keto-type HBABSA molecules and inhibited the enol-type ones at room temperature. Further, according to the curves of N2 adsorption/desorption, the N2 uptake of HBABSA@MOF-808 is approximately 329.84 cm3 g-1, which is inferior to that of MOF-808 (427.42 cm3 g-1) (c), proving that the HBABSA is successfully incorporated into MOF-808 pores.\n\nTGA is employed to explore the thermal stability of HBABSA@MOF-808, which is displayed in d. The MOF-808 and HBABSA is in a stable state at approximately 437 and 191 \u00b0C, respectively. When HBABSA was loaded into MOF-808, the composite can be stable at approximately 140 \u00b0C, and the considerable weight loss at 140-560 \u00b0C mainly belongs to the thermal decomposition of the HBABSA compound in MOF-808 pores. If the HBABSA as a \u03c0-conjugated molecule exists in an aggregative state, the strong interactions of \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking between the aryl rings from the molecules would lead to the relatively high thermal stability. When the HBABSA molecules are introduced into MOF pores in a monomeric state, the strong interactions are destructed, which would result in a declined decomposition temperature (ca. 140 \u00b0C). Additionally, the increased thermal stability of parent MOF-808 in HBABSA@MOF-808 possibly originated from the interaction of the HBABSA and MOF. Further, XPS measurements were surveyed on HBABSA, MOF-808, and HBABSA@MOF-808 to assess their surface structures. Regarding e and Figure S5, the composite presents the Zr, C, O, N, and S elements, which proves the successful preparation of the composite. For the fitted curves of N 1s from the HBABSA@MOF-808 composite (Figure S5d and f), the binding energies of 404 and 402.5 eV correspond to \ue5fbN-Ph and -NH-Ph, respectively; the 401.6, 400.1, and 399.3 eV belong to C\ue5fbC-NH-C\ue5fbC, C\ue5fbN, and -NH-, respectively.\n\nThe HBABSA@MOF-808/PP hybrid membranes were prepared by a solution-casting method, and a series of characterizations are shown in . The XRD patterns of the hybrid membranes are shown in a. It can be seen that the diffraction peak at 2\u03b8 = 8.72\u00b0 is attributed to MOF-808, and the wide diffraction peak at 2\u03b8 = 19.5\u00b0 is assigned to PVA/PAMPS blends. Furthermore, the FT-IR spectra show that the peaks of C\ue5fbO, C\ue5fbN, and S\ue5fbO from PAMPS and HBABSA@MOF-808 appear at 1653, 1547, 1268, and 1034 cm-1, respectively. The peaks at 1450 and 1380 cm-1 belong to C\ue5fbC stretching on HBABSA@MOF-808's aromatic ring in the hybrid membrane. Also, the thermal stability of the hybrid membrane is characterized in a thermogravimetric test (Figure S7); the HBABSA@MOF-808/PP exhibits a similar trend of weight loss that is relative to the PVA/PAMPS, indicating that the doping of the filler has no effect on the thermal stability of the original membrane. Nitrogen absorption/desorption isotherms of hybrid membranes are shown in Figure S8. Comparing to the specific surface area (S BET) and pore volume (c), the relevant values of hybrid membranes increase with an increase of the doping percentages of HBABSA@MOF-808. However, the slight decrease of the data when the doping percentage is 25% can be attributed to the nanofiller aggregation. In addition, the mechanical properties of membranes are present in d and Figure S9, including the elongation at break and maximum stress. It can be found that, when the doping percentages of the filler reach up to 5 and 20%, the hybrid membranes show a higher elongation at break or maximum stress, respectively. Moreover, the hybrid membranes have more prominent characteristics of flexibility or toughness, possibly deriving from the strong interaction between the filler and the polymer and the water absorption of MOF-808.\n\nThermochromic Property\n\nThe switching state of HBABSA molecules between the high/low temperatures is the key to the thermal-responsive proton conductor. The FT-IR, UV-vis, and FL spectra are applied to investigate the thermal-induced enol/keto isomerization of HBABSA molecules under certain circumstances. The FL measurements performed are shown in . As described in a, the HBABSA molecules present a heating-induced transformation from a keto type to enol type in solution (0.05 g mL-1). Relative to the emission peak (\u03bb = 510 nm) at room temperature (298 K), the peak intensity increases sharply and the peak appears as a blue shift (\u0394\u03bb = 10 nm) when the temperature reaches up to 353 K, which are attributable to the rising content of electron-donating groups in the aromatic ring and the decrease of the conjugation degree in HBABSA (Figure S2), respectively. For the HBABSA@MOF-808 dispersion (b), its emission peak at 298 K is the same as that of the HBABSA solution, but after heating, there exists 20 nm of a blue shift. This is possibly imputed to the abundant dissociable hydroxyls coordinated with Zr atoms in MOF-808 pores, which can promote the thermo-induced isomerization of HBABSA molecules. When cooling to 308 K from 353 K, the HBABSA molecule strikes as a reversible isomerization. In addition, as shown in the FL spectra of the hybrid membrane in c, the great blue shift (\u0394\u03bb = 30 nm) induced states where the HBABSA@MOF-808 composite in PP has a more prominent thermal isomerization behavior; additionally, the risen intensity of the emission peak at 353 K would be assigned to the multiple dissociated H+ atoms from the sulfonic and hydroxyl groups from PAMPS and PVA polymers. To eliminate the factors that would mislead the results, the results of FL spectra on the MOF-808 suspension, MOF-808 solid, PVA/PAMPS blends, and MOF-808/PP hybrid membrane are compared (Figure S12), and there is no obvious change of FL curves induced by the temperature.", "data": ["(SyntaxError('invalid syntax', ('<unknown>', 10, 1, '[{\"meta\":{\"name\":\"MOF-B\", \"symbol\":\"\", \"chemical formula\":\"\"}, \"etc\": [\\n')), '[{\"meta\":{\"name\":\"MOF-A\", \"symbol\":\"\", \"chemical formula\":\"\"}, \"etc\": [\\n    {\\n        \"property name\": \"dielectric constant\",\\n        \"value\": \"4.5\",\\n        \"unit\": \"\",\\n        \"condition\": \"1 kHz\"\\n    }\\n]}]\\n\\n[{\"meta\":{\"name\":\"MOF-B\", \"symbol\":\"\", \"chemical formula\":\"\"}, \"etc\": [\\n    {\\n        \"property name\": \"electrical conductivity\",\\n        \"value\": \"0.01\",\\n        \"unit\": \"S/cm\",\\n        \"condition\": \"room temperature\"\\n    }\\n]}]\\n\\n[{\"meta\":{\"name\":\"NOTT-202\", \"symbol\":\"\", \"chemical formula\":\"\"}, \"etc\": [\\n    {\\n        \"property name\": \"electrical resistance\",\\n        \"value\": \"10000000\",\\n        \"unit\": \"ohm\u00b7cm\",\\n        \"condition\": \"\"\\n    }\\n]}]')"], "include_properties": ["etc"]}, {"idx": "28, 31, 32", "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<p>The temperature-dependent PC of HBABSA@MOF-808/PP-X\nhybrid membranes\nwith different contents of the composite (<italic toggle=\"yes\">X</italic> = 0,\n5, 10, 15, 20, and 25) are also measured under 57% RH.

When the temperature is higher than 343\nK, the proton-conducting mechanism of the two hybrid membranes is\ndifferent in the filler-doping amount; the protons in HBABSA@MOF-808/PP-20\nstill migrate according to the Grotthuss-like mechanism (0.21 eV).\nTherefore, the sharp increase in the PC of hybrid membranes at 57%\nRH from 338 to 343 K indicates the heightening content of enol-type\nHBABSA molecules induced by the temperature, and thus the additional\nprotons are provided, which can migrate by proton transport channels\nand exponentially improve the conductivity of hybrid membranes.

It can be discovered that the HBABSA molecules\nin the MOF\u2019s nanopores accomplish the reversible isomerization\nbetween the keto and enol isomers under heat irradiation. The sulfonate\ngroup and proton in enol-type HBABSA would greatly enhance the proton\nconductivity of the composite via plentiful protons and hydrophilic\ngroups inside the nanochannels. Due to the suitable H-bond interaction\nbetween enol-type HBABSA and MOF-808, we can increase the dissociation\nof the hydroxyl groups coordinated with the Zr atom in MOF-808, thus\nenhancing the proton conductivity of the composite to a large extent.\nAs a result, the HBABSA@MOF-808 presents a proton conductivity of\n1.42 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20134</sup> S cm<sup>\u20131</sup> at 57%\nRH and 353 K and an outstanding thermal switching ratio of 16 upon\nheat illumination. Further, the HBABSA@MOF-808-filled PVA/PAMPS hybrid\nmembranes by solution blending and the thermal-responsive switching\nfunction at low humidity are realized due to the thermal-induced isomerization\nof HBABSA molecules.

As can be seen from c, their conductivity declines as the doping content of the composite increases at 323 K, which is consistent with the variation trend of IEC (Figure S18), which is related to the reduction of ionizable protons. Meanwhile, at 353 K, the conductivity of the hybrid membranes gradually increases with an increase of the doping content of the filler (d), especially the 20% filler-doped membrane with a maximum \u03c3 value of 0.059 S cm-1. The conductivity of HBABSA@MOF-808/PP-25 decreases slightly due to the agglomeration of filler particles at a high concentration. The thermal-responsive proton conduction switch of a high doping content of fillers in hybrid membranes exceeds that of a low doping one, reaching a maximum value (\u03b3) of 5.4 with the 25% doping content.

This transport process is determined by the proton transport channels, which can be formed through H bonds among hydroxy groups of PVA, sulfonate groups of PAMPS, and water molecules (d). When the temperature is higher than 343 K, the proton-conducting mechanism of the two hybrid membranes is different in the filler-doping amount; the protons in HBABSA@MOF-808/PP-20 still migrate according to the Grotthuss-like mechanism (0.21 eV). Therefore, the sharp increase in the PC of hybrid membranes at 57% RH from 338 to 343 K indicates the heightening content of enol-type HBABSA molecules induced by the temperature, and thus the additional protons are provided, which can migrate by proton transport channels and exponentially improve the conductivity of hybrid membranes. Furthermore, the E a value of the 25% HBABSA@MOF-808-filled hybrid membrane is 1.37 eV (vehicle mechanism). Under this transfer process, the MOF-808 and enol-type HBABSA molecules can offer more relatively free protons in favor of effective proton conduction (e). The difference in the proton transport mode of the two hybrid membranes after 343 K would be ascribable to the more prominent nature of water adsorption and water retention of the 25% HBABSA@MOF-808-filled hybrid membrane between 50-65% RH (Figure S25), which results from the outstanding water absorbability of MOF-808. Therefore, the HBABSA@MOF-808/PP-25 hybrid membrane shows the change in the proton transport mode before and after the thermal response temperature, which is more conducive to the occurrence of the thermal-response behavior of proton conduction, resulting in a larger switching ratio.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn summary, a thermochromic Schiff-base molecule as the guest, namely, 4-((2-hydroxybenzylidene)amino)benzenesulfonic acid (HBABSA), is encapsulated into the pores of the MOF-808, the host, to generate a thermal-responsive MOF-based composite (HBABSA@MOF-808) for switchable proton conductivity. It can be discovered that the HBABSA molecules in the MOF's nanopores accomplish the reversible isomerization between the keto and enol isomers under heat irradiation. The sulfonate group and proton in enol-type HBABSA would greatly enhance the proton conductivity of the composite via plentiful protons and hydrophilic groups inside the nanochannels. Due to the suitable H-bond interaction between enol-type HBABSA and MOF-808, we can increase the dissociation of the hydroxyl groups coordinated with the Zr atom in MOF-808, thus enhancing the proton conductivity of the composite to a large extent. As a result, the HBABSA@MOF-808 presents a proton conductivity of 1.42 \u00d7 10-4 S cm-1 at 57% RH and 353 K and an outstanding thermal switching ratio of 16 upon heat illumination. Further, the HBABSA@MOF-808-filled PVA/PAMPS hybrid membranes by solution blending and the thermal-responsive switching function at low humidity are realized due to the thermal-induced isomerization of HBABSA molecules. The proton conductivity of the hybrid membrane involved with 25 wt % HBABSA@MOF-808 reaches up to 5.57 \u00d7 10-3 S cm-1, which is 4014.1% higher than that of HBABSA@MOF-808, accompanied by an excellent thermal-response switching ratio of 5.4. Based on explored mechanisms, the MOF-808 and enol-type HBABSA molecules can offer more movable protons to the hybrid membrane at a high temperature in favor of effective proton conduction by forming hydronium ions. Depending on the strong development potential of stimulus-responsive materials in the intelligent age, this thermal-responsive MOF composite and its hybrid membrane open the door of gated proton conduction at specific temperatures.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "HBABSA@MOF-808/PP-20/-25", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "activation energy", "value": "0.38", "unit": "eV", "condition": "temperature range from 298 to 338 K at 57% RH"}, {"property name": "proton transfer mechanism", "value": "Grotthuss", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "proton transport channels", "value": "H bonds among hydroxy groups of PVA, sulfonate groups of PAMPS, and water molecules", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "proton-conducting mechanism", "value": "Grotthuss-like", "unit": "", "condition": "temperature higher than 343 K"}, {"property name": "proton transport mode", "value": "vehicle mechanism", "unit": "", "condition": "25% HBABSA@MOF-808-filled hybrid membrane"}, {"property name": "proton transport mode", "value": "Grotthuss-like mechanism", "unit": "", "condition": "25% HBABSA@MOF-808-filled hybrid membrane"}, {"property name": "proton transport mode", "value": "vehicle mechanism", "unit": "", "condition": "25% HBABSA@MOF-808-filled hybrid membrane"}, {"property name": "proton transport mode", "value": "Grotthuss-like mechanism", "unit": "", "condition": "25% HBABSA@MOF-808-filled hybrid membrane"}]}]], "include_properties": ["etc"]}, {"idx": 11, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Schematic presentation for the preparation of HBABSA@MOF-808/PP\nhybrid membranes.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"am2c23170_0002.tif\" xlink:type=\"simple\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Schematic presentation for the preparation of HBABSA@MOF-808/PP hybrid membranes.
