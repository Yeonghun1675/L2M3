However, the complexity and inefficiency of the\ncurrent fabrication approaches have hindered their further development.\nHerein, we demonstrate a facile one-pot solvent crystal template strategy\nto efficiently fabricate ZIF-8/polyurethane (PU) composites. This\nmethod eliminated the pre-synthesis and purification of MOFs, thus\ngreatly simplifying the fabrication process. Moreover, the solvent\ncrystal template introduced macropores in the polymer matrix, which\ngenerated a hierarchically porous structure to facilitate the molecular\ndiffusion in the composite. The obtained ZIF-8/PU composites exhibited\nan accelerated dye adsorption rate constant of 1.89 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20133</sup> g mg<sup>\u20131</sup> min<sup>\u20131</sup>,\nwhich was 2.6 times higher than that of MOF powders.

MOF precursors and polymers were dissolved\nin the solvent, which was then frozen and exchanged with iced water.\nMacropores in the polymer matrix were formed by the solvent crystal\ntemplate, while micropores came from MOF particles crystalized during\nthe process. This unique one-pot strategy not only avoided a time-consuming\nstepwise synthesis for the hierarchical architecture but also guaranteed\na uniform MOF distribution within the polymer matrix. The obtained\nZIF-8/PU composite showed good mechanical properties and enhanced\nadsorption performance. Compared with pristine MOF particles, the\ncomposite displayed a 2.61 times higher dye adsorption rate constant\nand a high equilibrium uptake of 6.42 mg g<sup>\u20131</sup>. Moreover,\nthe adsorption isotherm study confirmed its behavior in accordance\nwith the Langmuir adsorption model having a maximum adsorption capacity\nof 18.1 mg g<sup>\u20131</sup>.</p><title>Results\nand Discussion</title><p>The hierarchically porous ZIF-8/PU composites\nwere fabricated by\na one-pot solvent crystal template strategy, as shown in a. In brief, ZIF-8\nprecursors and PU were dissolved in DMSO with a mass ratio of Zn\u00ad(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\u00b76H<sub>2</sub>O/2-MeIM/PU/DMSO = 0.67:1.33:1:15,\nwhich was then frozen at \u221225 \u00b0C. The solvent crystallized\nand the polymer was expelled and solidified under this temperature,\nleading to a bi-continuous network. The solvent crystals were leached\nout by soaking in iced water, and finally, the composite was obtained\nafter vacuum-drying. It is worth mentioning that this one-pot strategy\n(i) alleviated the MOF aggregation and sedimentation problem since\nit started from a uniform mixture of MOF precursors and the polymer,\n(ii) eliminated the need to prepare and disperse MOF particles separately\nsince the growth of MOFs occurred during the fabrication process,\nand (iii) efficiently introduced macropores since it applied a solvent\ncrystal template that could be easily removed.

However, the complexity and inefficiency of the current fabrication approaches have hindered their further development. Herein, we demonstrate a facile one-pot solvent crystal template strategy to efficiently fabricate ZIF-8/polyurethane (PU) composites. This method eliminated the pre-synthesis and purification of MOFs, thus greatly simplifying the fabrication process. Moreover, the solvent crystal template introduced macropores in the polymer matrix, which generated a hierarchically porous structure to facilitate the molecular diffusion in the composite. The obtained ZIF-8/PU composites exhibited an accelerated dye adsorption rate constant of 1.89 \u00d7 10-3 g mg-1 min-1, which was 2.6 times higher than that of MOF powders. The Langmuir isotherm study further confirmed favorable adsorption of dye molecules with a maximum adsorption capacity of 18.1 mg g-1.\n\nHerein, we propose a facile one-pot solvent crystal template strategy to prepare ZIF-8/polyurethane (PU) composites with a hierarchically macro-/microporous structure. MOF precursors and polymers were dissolved in the solvent, which was then frozen and exchanged with iced water. Macropores in the polymer matrix were formed by the solvent crystal template, while micropores came from MOF particles crystalized during the process. This unique one-pot strategy not only avoided a time-consuming stepwise synthesis for the hierarchical architecture but also guaranteed a uniform MOF distribution within the polymer matrix. The obtained ZIF-8/PU composite showed good mechanical properties and enhanced adsorption performance. Compared with pristine MOF particles, the composite displayed a 2.61 times higher dye adsorption rate constant and a high equilibrium uptake of 6.42 mg g-1. Moreover, the adsorption isotherm study confirmed its behavior in accordance with the Langmuir adsorption model having a maximum adsorption capacity of 18.1 mg g-1.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nThe hierarchically porous ZIF-8/PU composites were fabricated by a one-pot solvent crystal template strategy, as shown in a. In brief, ZIF-8 precursors and PU were dissolved in DMSO with a mass ratio of Zn(NO3)2\u22c56H2O/2-MeIM/PU/DMSO = 0.67:1.33:1:15, which was then frozen at -25 \u00b0C. The solvent crystallized and the polymer was expelled and solidified under this temperature, leading to a bi-continuous network. The solvent crystals were leached out by soaking in iced water, and finally, the composite was obtained after vacuum-drying. It is worth mentioning that this one-pot strategy (i) alleviated the MOF aggregation and sedimentation problem since it started from a uniform mixture of MOF precursors and the polymer, (ii) eliminated the need to prepare and disperse MOF particles separately since the growth of MOFs occurred during the fabrication process, and (iii) efficiently introduced macropores since it applied a solvent crystal template that could be easily removed. The obtained composite monolith was labeled as ZIF-8/PU(2). XRD results confirmed the formation of ZIF-8 in the composite, matching well with the simulated XRD pattern (b). Additionally, the FTIR spectrum of ZIF-8/PU(2) showed peaks at 1565, 1145, and 421 cm-1, attributed to the C\ue5fbN stretching and aromatic C-N stretching from 2-MeIM and the Zn-N stretching, respectively (c). The composite morphology was characterized by SEM, as shown in d. It can be observed that ZIF-8 particles were randomly dispersed in the macroporous polymer matrix. The average sizes of MOF particles and polymer macropores were estimated to be ~34 nm and ~0.64 \u03bcm, respectively (Figure S3). MOF loading was determined by TGA and calculated to be 30.4%, corresponding to a MOF conversion of 89.8% (Figure S4 and Table S1). Besides, the composite exhibited a specific surface area of 187 m2 g-1, as determined by the nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis (Figure S5).\n\nNext, the effect of the initial ZIF-8 precursor amount on ZIF-8/PU composite properties was systematically investigated. ZIF-8/PU(x) represents the composites prepared with x mass portions of the initial MOF precursor (Table S1). In all the cases, PU and DMSO were kept at 1 portion and 15 portions, respectively. As the mass potion of the ZIF-8 precursor increased from 0.5 to 3, the surface of the PU matrix became rougher because more MOF particles were formed (Figure S6). The corresponding MOF loading increased from 10.4 to 37.0% with an average conversion of 85.6% (Figure S4 and Table S1).
