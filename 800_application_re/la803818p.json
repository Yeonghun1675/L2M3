It should be noted that, even after exposure to a significant amount of water at approximately P/P 0 = 0.6, the unique \"gate\" phenomenon, which is characteristic of an abrupt increase in adsorption at the adsorption branch and a sudden decrease at the desorption branch, was still observed in the rehydrated form, although the isotherm shows a slight decrease in the amount of adsorption and a milder \"gate opening\". This kind of hysteresis reflects a dynamic structure transformation from the initial dehydrated structure to a guest-occupied structure. This suggests that the basic layer structure still exists after rehydration so that the interaction between CO2 and the structure is sufficiently strong to cause an expansion of the layers and to allow the incorporation of CO2 molecules.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 23, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig6\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>6</label>\n<caption>\n<p>CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption isotherms at 273K: (\u25fc, \u25fb) after heating LPC<sub>1</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O) to 373 K, (\u25b2, \u25b3) after heating LPC<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O) to 373 K, and (\u25cb, \u25cf) after heating LPC<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O) to 403 K.
