This wavelength was chosen because L1 has a strong absorption at 300 nm but L2 remains silent.

UiO-67-1.8% had the highest quantum yield (50%) of the UiO-67-X% series (Figure S3). A similar excimer formation and the concentration-based quenching phenomenon have been previously reported for a naphthalene-based MOF. \n\nThe tunable fluorescent properties and inherent porosity of the UiO-67-X% series enabled their utilization as a platform for the fabrication of gas sensors. Bulk UiO-67-X% samples were directly utilized for gas sensing without the fabrication of thin films. The highly porous structure of the framework allowed for the efficient diffusion of gas molecules, enabling rapid access to the fluorophore. As a proof of concept, UiO-67-X% MOFs were optimized for the detection of oxygen in the gas phase (a). The fluorescent emission spectra of UiO-67-1.8 and UiO-67-0.35% were recorded in a gas mixture with various O2/N2 ratios at 1 bar under 300 nm light irradiation. The sensitivity (R) of the fluorophores was defined as the quenching of the emission intensity in pure O2 divided by the inherent emission intensity in pure N2. UiO-67-1.8% was demonstrated to be the top-performing material with the highest sensitivity among the UiO-67-X% MOFs. The PL spectra of UiO-67-1.8% quickly changed upon exposure of O2/N2 gas, reaching equilibrium within seconds. This supported the idea that fast diffusion of the gas within the framework was possible because of the high porosity of the material. The PL spectra clearly showed that both the monomer and excimer emissions of UiO-67-1.8% were sensitive to O2, but the excimer emission peak possessed higher sensitivity (R = 70%) than the monomer (58%) (b). It may be because the interactions between the triplet and ground states may lower the energy of the upper triplet slightly. Thus, the energy of the excimer is almost equal to the second triplet state, resulting in higher sensitivity of the excimer. The limit of detection is 5%. The stabilities of UiO-67-1.8 and UiO-67-0.35% were also tested via exposure to 100% O2 and N2 alternately. The performance and structure of both sensors maintained the same during five cycles, indicating the good recyclability of them as O2 sensors (c and S4). The fluorescent quenching by O2 is attributed to the energy transfer from the triplet state in the perylene unit to the ground-state oxygen. This transition has previously been well-investigated. As a control, the sensitivity of the perylene linkers both in aqueous solution and in the solid state was tested (Figure S5). The perylene linker showed almost no fluorescence in the solid state because of severe ACQ, resulting in low sensitivity. The sensitivity of the L1 solutions (10%) was also much lower than that of the MOF. Additionally, each solution required up to 30 min of O2/N2 gas exposure to equilibrate. The oxygen gas needed to be predissolved in the solution to quench the fluorophore adequately as a positive control.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "porosity": {"value": "0.87", "unit": "", "condition": ""}}, {"meta": {"name": "UiO-67", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "porosity": {"value": "38.2", "unit": "%", "condition": ""}, "surface area": {"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "2120", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}, "peak spectrum": {"value": "445, 275", "unit": "nm", "condition": ""}}, {"meta": {"name": "UiO-67-100%", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": {"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "1168", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}, "porosity": {"value": "38.2", "unit": "%", "condition": ""}, "peak spectrum": {"value": "445, 275", "unit": "nm", "condition": ""}}, {"meta": {"name": "UiO-67-1.8%", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "peak spectrum": {"value": "400, \u223c520", "unit": "nm", "condition": ""}}, {"meta": {"name": "UiO-67-<italic>X</italic>%", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "porosity": {"value": "1.2", "unit": "nm", "condition": ""}, "surface area": {"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "2120", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}}, {"meta": {"name": "UiO-67-100%", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "porosity": {"value": "1.0", "unit": "nm", "condition": ""}, "surface area": {"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "1168", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}}, {"meta": {"name": "UiO-67-1.8%", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "porosity": {"value": "1.2", "unit": "nm", "condition": ""}, "surface area": {"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "2120", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}}, {"meta": {"name": "UiO-67-0.35%", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "porosity": {"value": "1.2", "unit": "nm", "condition": ""}, "surface area": {"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "2120", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}}, {"meta": {"name": "UiO-67-1.8%", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "peak spectrum": {"value": "400, \u223c520", "unit": "nm", "condition": ""}}, {"meta": {"name": "UiO-67-0.35%", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "peak spectrum": {"value": "400, \u223c520", "unit": "nm", "condition": ""}}]], "include_properties": ["gas_adsorption", "surface_area", "porosity", "peak_spectrum"]}, {"idx": 3, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Design-isolated\nperylene fluorophores in a solid MOF.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"am0c05512_0001.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Design-isolated perylene fluorophores in a solid MOF.
