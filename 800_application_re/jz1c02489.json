Considering this, the results reveal two additional surprising characteristics. First, some degree of orientation is preserved even after irradiation with nonpolarized light, both visible and UV. However, every additional irradiation does reduce the degree of orientation. This is seen by the difference of the cyan and the black curve, between which an additional switching step with nonpolarized UV and visible light was performed. Furthermore, an intermediate step of irradiation with visible light was not always needed for the alignment. The state of preferred alignment of the AB molecule in the vertical direction (orange) was turned around directly toward a preferential orientation in the horizontal (blue).", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 21, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The strength of the alignment effects\ncan be estimated by comparison\nwith the total photochemical changes.
