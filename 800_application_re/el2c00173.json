The nonlinear I-V curves indicate the existence of asymmetric Schottky barriers at the GrB/MOF and MOF/GrT interfaces. The mechanism responsible for asymmetric I-V curves is mainly because of the polarization effect of the ferroelectric PVDF layer below the bottom graphene, which enables one to induce polarization in the bottom graphene with respect to the top graphene and changes the density of states of GrB as compared to GrT.

The fill factor for our graphene sandwich GrT/MOF/GrB/PVDF multifunctional white light-emissive vertical phototransistor is much higher compared to the fill factor of a previously reported WLED fabricated by using a GrT/MOF/ZnO/Ag heterostructure. Multiple aspects behind the observation of high fill factor include (a) the short channel length of a graphene sandwich vertical phototransistor reduces the channel resistance compared to the long channel length of MOF/ZnO heterojunctions, (b) asymmetric Schottky junctions at GrT/MOF and MOF/GrB interfaces due to the utilization of piezoelectric PVDF provide less resistance compared to junctions at Ag/ZnO and MOF/Gr interfaces of a GrT/MOF/ZnO/Ag heterostructure, and (c) direct charge transformations between interligand, intermetal, and metal to a ligand by an external applied electric field inside the MOF complex compared to the indirect charge transformations of MOF/ZnO heterostructure. We demonstrated the device's flexibility in electroluminescence under the application of bending strain (ca. <20%), as shown in c. This investigation reveals that the emitted light intensity is higher under the application of downward bending strain as compared to upward bending strain, which is in stark contrast with the investigation of photocurrent under the application of mechanical bending strain. The underlying mechanism can also be interpreted by the Dirac point modulation of graphene through the piezoelectric field created by the PVDF film under bending. Additionally, we investigated applied voltage-dependent light emission under mechanical bending conditions, as shown in d. At a lower injection current, we observed the green emission band dominates in the EL spectrum. Spectacularly, with the enhancement of applied potential, a blue emission peak centered at ~430 nm appears in the EL spectrum. At the application of a higher injected current, the blue emission band dominates over the green emission band in the EL spectrum. The mobile photographs of emitted light at different injected currents are provided in the inset of d, and the corresponding CIE diagram of emitted light at different injection currents is shown in e. These fascinating features can be explained by the band alignment between MOF and graphene through the Dirac point modulation by applied potential, strain, and the charge-transfer mechanism inside the MOF complex, as shown in f. As mentioned earlier, an MOF can cover a wide range of light emissions because of several charge transitions inside the MOF complex. As shown in the PL spectrum of Figure S6, the band gap of the intermetallic charge transformation is much lower than the band gap of interligand charge transformation. Because of the lower band gap effect, at a lower injection current intermetallic and metal-ligand charge transformations dominate in the electroluminescence, which provides the green and yellow emission bands, respectively. However, at a higher injection current, interligand charge transformation is dominant over the metal-ligand charge transformation, which provides the blue emission peak over the yellow emission in the EL spectrum. The different exciton lifetime associated with the different charge-transformation mechanisms provides multiple emission bands in the EL spectrum. For further confirmation of the existence of multiple light emission bands in the EL spectrum, we measured the exciton lifetime from the time-resolved PL study, as shown in Figure S16. This investigation reveals different exciton lifetimes for multiple charge-transfer mechanisms in the MOF complex. All these investigations reveal that the color of the emitted light from our fabricated vertical phototransistor can be tuned by the modulation of the Dirac point of graphene and the charge transfer mechanism inside the MOF complex. Previously, Dirac point modulated light emission has been reported by sandwiching quantum dots between the graphene on a solid substrate of SiO2/Si. In this work, for the first time, we demonstrated the Dirac point-controlled color-tunable light emission by sandwiching MOFs between the graphene on a flexible substrate of PVDF/PDMS.

This investigation indicates the generation\nof positive photocurrent from our fabricated vertical phototransistor\ndevice. The observed positive photoresponse from the phototransistor\ncan be explained by the energy band diagram shown in c. The energy band is bent\nwith a created band slope due to the mismatch between the Fermi energy\nof photon-absorbing MOF (\u22125.0 eV) and single-layer graphene\n(\u22124.6 eV). As described earlier, because of the asymmetric\nSchottky junction formations due to the polarization-induced effect\nof PVDF, the work function of Gr<sub>B</sub> is higher as compared\nto that of Gr<sub>T</sub>, which bends the energy band toward the\nbottom graphene, and the effective built-in electric field drives\nthe photogenerated electrons toward the top graphene and generates\na positive photocurrent. It is notable that there is the presence\nof asymmetry in the Schottky barriers at Gr<sub>T</sub>/MOF and MOF/Gr<sub>B</sub>/PVDF interfaces because of the different doping levels of\nthe top and bottom graphene due to the utilization of the piezoelectric\nPVDF layer at the bottom of the Gr<sub>B</sub>.

In their\ndevice, the Schottky barrier height in the Gr<sub>B</sub>/MoS<sub>2</sub> contact is higher than that of the Gr<sub>T</sub>/MoS<sub>2</sub> contact, probably due to a p-type doping effect to the graphene\nby the substrate oxide.

The bending strain-dependent photoresponse under\ndownward bending and upward bending conditions is shown in e,f, respectively.\nEvidently, the decrease of photocurrent with the enhancement of downward\nbending strain phenomenon is reversed for the application of upward\nbending strain. This interesting observation can be mainly ascribed\nto the induced polarization effect of the underlying PVDF layer of\nthe bottom graphene. The application of mechanical strain electromechanically\nmodulates not only the Schottky barrier of Gr<sub>B</sub>/PVDF and\nGr<sub>T</sub>/MOF heterojunctions but also the Dirac point of graphene.\nUnder downward bending strain, the electric field corresponding to\nthe induced polarization of the PVDF layer is reversed to the built-in\nelectric field of the Gr<sub>B</sub>/MOF/Gr<sub>T</sub> heterojunction,\nwhich is responsible for a decrease in photocurrent under downward\nbending strain.

The details of the synthesis process of the MOF compound is discussed in the Supporting Informations. The structural analysis of the MOF compound was performed by a single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) study, as shown in Figure S2. To utilize the MOFs for device fabrication, the rectangular-shaped single crystal of the MOF compound was first ground to the size of nanoparticles, and then these nanoparticles were dispersed into an ethanol solvent. For good dispersion of the MOF compound into the ethanol solution, the solution containing the MOF was stirred with a magnetic stirrer. For a morphological analysis by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image, we used the solution of dispersed MOFs. The microstructural analysis of the MOF compound was performed by SEM, as shown in Figure S3. From the SEM micrograph, we observed strong uncontrolled agglomeration behavior with random shapes in the crystalline MOF due to nanocrystal formation. Because of this uncontrolled agglomeration effect, they look like an amorphous thin film in the SEM image. The optical properties of the MOF compound were investigated by photoluminescence and absorption measurements, as shown in Figure S4a,b. The optical investigations reveal strong white light emission from the MOF compound having photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) for light emission of ~58%. The PL spectrum covers the whole visible regime indicating the broadband light emission from the MOF compound. The PL spectrum having a CIE color coordinate (0.34, 0.35), as shown in Figure S5, with color rendering index (CRI) of 88 and color correlated temperature (CRT) of 5200, clearly reveals the white-light emission from this MOF compound. The broad emission spectra of the MOF compound mainly originated from the superimposition of multiple emissions from different radiative transitions because of the charge transformations between interligand, intermetallic, and metal to the ligand or vice versa. For a more precise analysis of the broadband emission spectrum from the MOF compound, we deconvoluted the PL spectrum, which contains the different emission blocks, as shown in Figure S6a. The strong blue emission block having an emission peak centered around ~455 nm corresponds to a \u03c0-\u03c0* interligand charge transformation. For further clarification of the emission of the free ligand, the PL spectrum of the ligand was measured, as shown in Figure S6b. The other emission blocks containing the emission peaks centered around ~405, 640, and 548 nm are associated with the charge transfer between intermetallic and metal to ligand, respectively. Broad emission from the MOF compound is also possibly due to our unique synthesis by a judicious choice of strontium metal in combination with a suitable organic linker. Because of its isotropic behavior, strontium itself has several strong radiative transitions that provide the emission spectrum covering the wide wavelength. The single-layer graphene was grown on copper foil by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique and transferred on polymer PVDF. The monolayer of the synthesized CVD graphene on PVDF has been confirmed from a Raman spectroscopy study. The synthesis and Raman investigation details of graphene have been provided in the Supporting Information and Figure S7. The light-emissive self-powered vertical phototransistor was fabricated by sandwiching the MOF between graphenes on flexible substrate PVDF/PDMS as shown in the schematic of a. The details of the device fabrication procedure are provided in the  section. The corresponding SEM image of our fabricated vertical GrT/MOF/GrB/PVDF phototransistor device is shown in b. From the SEM micrograph, the estimated thickness of the MOF layer for optimized performance is ~300 nm. An optical microscope image of the top view of the actual fabricated device and a mobile photograph of the fabricated flexible device is shown in b and Figure S8, respectively. We measured the current-voltage (I-V) curve of our fabricated vertical phototransistor in the dark and under excitation from a 530 nm laser with a power density of 50 nW cm-2 on the device area of 2 mm \u00d7 300 nm, as shown in c. The nonlinear I-V curves indicate the existence of asymmetric Schottky barriers at the GrB/MOF and MOF/GrT interfaces. The mechanism responsible for asymmetric I-V curves is mainly because of the polarization effect of the ferroelectric PVDF layer below the bottom graphene, which enables one to induce polarization in the bottom graphene with respect to the top graphene and changes the density of states of GrB as compared to GrT. The optimized performance of the device was obtained by several photocurrent measurements through the thickness variation of the MOF compound, as shown in Figure S9. To investigate the induced polarization effect of the PVDF layer, we measured the I-V curves of the phototransistor device with and without a PVDF layer, as shown in Figure S10. The asymmetric Schottky junctions at different interfaces produce a strong built-in electric field, which facilitates generation of the photocurrent from this device without the application of an external electric bias. The built-in electric field produces a large depletion region, which can assist the dissociation of photogenerated excitons and the transport of electrons and holes to the electrodes. The Schottky barrier efficiently prolongs the lifetime of photogenerated excitons due to reduced recombination, which results in rapid exciton separation and their transport to the electrodes. d shows a dynamic photoresponse from our fabricated photodetector device without applications of electric bias having switched on/off under the illumination of a 530 nm laser. This clearly indicates that our fabricated device is a self-powered photodetector. The excellent self-powered photoresponse performance was confirmed through ultrahigh and ultrafast photoresponse (the photoresponsivity under 0 bias is ~1.3 \u00d7 103 A W-1 with response time of ~220 \u03bcs), reduced noise, and large detectivity. The observed self-powered photoresponse performance from our fabricated device is ~103 times higher than that of a reported similar device using silicon, versatile two-dimensional (2D) materials, and metal oxides. Such a self-powered photodetector has tremendous demand in next-generation IoT (Internet of things) technology, space exploration, and wireless environmental monitoring.\n\nThe photodetection performance of our fabricated vertical GrT/MOF/GrB/PVDF phototransistor was investigated under light illumination and application of electric bias through photoresponsivity (Rph), photocurrent gain (G), EQE, and detectivity (D*). The estimation details of all these optical parameters related to photodetection with a physical formula and their variation with illuminated light power are discussed in the Supporting Information. In order to investigate the photoresponse performance of our fabricated device, we measured the light power-dependent I-V characteristics and transient photoresponse curves, shown in a,b, respectively, under the illumination from a 530 nm laser on the device active area of 2 mm \u00d7 300 nm. This investigation indicates the generation of positive photocurrent from our fabricated vertical phototransistor device. The observed positive photoresponse from the phototransistor can be explained by the energy band diagram shown in c. The energy band is bent with a created band slope due to the mismatch between the Fermi energy of photon-absorbing MOF (-5.0 eV) and single-layer graphene (-4.6 eV). As described earlier, because of the asymmetric Schottky junction formations due to the polarization-induced effect of PVDF, the work function of GrB is higher as compared to that of GrT, which bends the energy band toward the bottom graphene, and the effective built-in electric field drives the photogenerated electrons toward the top graphene and generates a positive photocurrent. It is notable that there is the presence of asymmetry in the Schottky barriers at GrT/MOF and MOF/GrB/PVDF interfaces because of the different doping levels of the top and bottom graphene due to the utilization of the piezoelectric PVDF layer at the bottom of the GrB. It is expected that the Schottky potential of the MOF/GrB interface is higher than that of the GrT/MOF interface because of the doping effect from PVDF, which may bend the MOF layer band slope downward toward the top graphene contact, and the resultant built-in electric field drives the photogenerated electrons toward the GrT. A similar concept of the photoresponse from a GrT/MOS2/GrB heterojunction on a SiO2/Si substrate has been reported by Yu et al. for a GrT/MOS2/GrB heterojunction. In their device, the Schottky barrier height in the GrB/MoS2 contact is higher than that of the GrT/MoS2 contact, probably due to a p-type doping effect to the graphene by the substrate oxide. The variations of Rph, G, and EQE with illumination light-power density are shown in Figure S11a-c, respectively. We estimated the Rph, G, and EQE values are ~1.2 \u00d7 108 A W-1, 4.7 \u00d7 108, and 3 \u00d7 1010%, respectively, under the illumination power density of 12.7 nW cm-2 from a 530 nm laser and applied bias voltage 2 V, which are comparable with those of recently reported graphene-organometallic perovskite heterostructure phototransistors and 104 times higher than those of previously reported graphene-nanomaterials hybrid photodetectors. We measured the laser power from a 530 nm laser source by utilizing a power meter. We took into account the beam spot size in the calculation of laser power density falling into the vertical phototransistor device. We consider the maximum beam spot diameter 2 mm in our calculation to get minimum photoresponsivity. The actual laser beam spot size from the 530 nm laser source is smaller than this, which can give a higher value of photoresponsivity than our present reported results. In addition to its ultrahigh photosensitivity, our fabricated vertical phototransistor also shows ultrafast photoresponse, as shown in Figure S11d. This observed ultrahigh photoresponse from our fabricated vertical phototransistor can be explained by multiple aspects associated with our design and fabrication processes, which are provided in the Supporting Information. The estimated D* and noise equivalent power (NEP) are ~2.9 \u00d7 1015 cm Hz1/2 W-1 and 8.6 \u00d7 10-19 W, respectively. Such a high D* is 103 times higher than that of reported flexible hybrid photodetectors by using recently emerged hybrid perovskites, versatile two-dimensional materials, and similar architecture of Schottky contact-based graphene sandwich vertical photodetectors. The high detectivity is mainly attributed to the suppression of noise due to the decrease in dark current because of efficient charge separation and reduced trap-state occupancy. The estimated NEP is 103 times lower than that of the recently reported hybrid 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs)-graphene and hBN/graphene/hBN heterojunction photodetectors. Such a low NEP (NEP < pW Hz-1/2) is advantageous for the detection of low-frequency (THz) light, which has multiple applications including quantum optics, imaging, biomedicine, tomography, and security. \n\n a represents a schematic of a PVDF/GrB/MOF/GrT/PMMA vertical flexible photodetector under downward bending conditions. Because of its highly polarized unit cells and a strong concentration of \u03b2-phase having a trans-torsional distribution, PVDF possesses high piezoelectricity. Because of the different polarization effects of the piezoelectric PVDF layer below the bottom graphene under different applied mechanical strains, we investigated the device flexibility under upward and downward bending and measured the transient photoresponse characteristic curves, as shown in b. This investigation clearly reveals the different photoresponse under different bending conditions due to the induced polarization effect of PVDF, which can control the effective built-in electric field in the device. The schematic of the cross-sectional view of the device with the direction of the effective built-in electric field under different bending conditions is shown in c,d. We estimated the bending strain by using the following equation, bending      strain  ( % )  =   L - L '   L   \u00d7 100    , where L is the radius of curvature when the device is under the unbending condition, and L' is the radius of curvature under the bending condition, as shown in Figure S12. Figure S13 shows the photoresponse curve with a variation in bending diameter. The bending strain-dependent photoresponse under downward bending and upward bending conditions is shown in e,f, respectively. Evidently, the decrease of photocurrent with the enhancement of downward bending strain phenomenon is reversed for the application of upward bending strain. This interesting observation can be mainly ascribed to the induced polarization effect of the underlying PVDF layer of the bottom graphene. The application of mechanical strain electromechanically modulates not only the Schottky barrier of GrB/PVDF and GrT/MOF heterojunctions but also the Dirac point of graphene. Under downward bending strain, the electric field corresponding to the induced polarization of the PVDF layer is reversed to the built-in electric field of the GrB/MOF/GrT heterojunction, which is responsible for a decrease in photocurrent under downward bending strain. For upward bending strain, the induced piezoelectric field due to the deformation of the PVDF layer acts in the same direction as the built-in electric field of vertical GrB/MOF/GrT heterojunction, which enhances the photocurrent. More importantly, our investigation of the strain-dependent photoresponse from the flexible vertical GrT/MOF/GrB/PVDF photodetector clearly reveals that the magnitude and polarity of the photocurrent can be controlled by the induced piezoelectric field of the underlying PVDF layer, which shows an excellent potential of strain sensor performance of our designed vertical phototransistor device. The induced piezoelectric field produces different barrier heights of Schottky junctions at GrT/MOF and MOF/GrB interfaces. The sensitivity of the strain sensor in photoconduction under mechanical bending strain can be evaluated by a standard gauge factor estimation. The estimation details of the gauge factor are provided in the Supporting Information. The calculated gauge factors for upward and downward bending are ~4 and 1.2, respectively, under the application of large bending strain (66%), and they are comparable with the recently reported sensitivities (13.5 and 4.02 for compressive and tensile strain, respectively) of a piezoelectric-based graphene/GaN/PDMS strain sensor under the application of very small bending strain (0.1%).

By applying a suitable electrical\nbias, the barrier potential of asymmetric Schottky junctions is inversed\nas compared to the mode of photodetection operation. The Schottky\nbarrier at the Gr<sub>T</sub>/MOF interface can become higher than\nthe Schottky barrier at the MOF/Gr<sub>B</sub> interface at a suitable\nelectrical bias. Under this circumstance, the electrons transferred\nfrom Gr<sub>T</sub>, and the holes transferred from Gr<sub>B</sub> into the MOF layer, which creates the radiative recombination between\nelectrons and holes from the multiple energy states of MOFs and generates\nthe white light emission.

This investigation reveals that the emitted\nlight intensity is higher under the application of downward bending\nstrain as compared to upward bending strain, which is in stark contrast\nwith the investigation of photocurrent under the application of mechanical\nbending strain. The underlying mechanism can also be interpreted by\nthe Dirac point modulation of graphene through the piezoelectric field\ncreated by the PVDF film under bending. Additionally, we investigated\napplied voltage-dependent light emission under mechanical bending\nconditions, as shown in d. At a lower injection current, we observed the green emission\nband dominates in the EL spectrum.

As shown\nin the PL spectrum of <ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsaelm.2c00173/suppl_file/el2c00173_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S6</ext-link>, the band\ngap of the intermetallic charge transformation is much lower than\nthe band gap of interligand charge transformation. Because of the\nlower band gap effect, at a lower injection current intermetallic\nand metal\u2013ligand charge transformations dominate in the electroluminescence,\nwhich provides the green and yellow emission bands, respectively.\nHowever, at a higher injection current, interligand charge transformation\nis dominant over the metal\u2013ligand charge transformation, which\nprovides the blue emission peak over the yellow emission in the EL\nspectrum. The different exciton lifetime associated with the different\ncharge-transformation mechanisms provides multiple emission bands\nin the EL spectrum. For further confirmation of the existence of multiple\nlight emission bands in the EL spectrum, we measured the exciton lifetime\nfrom the time-resolved PL study, as shown in <ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsaelm.2c00173/suppl_file/el2c00173_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S16</ext-link>. This investigation reveals different exciton lifetimes\nfor multiple charge-transfer mechanisms in the MOF complex. All these\ninvestigations reveal that the color of the emitted light from our\nfabricated vertical phototransistor can be tuned by the modulation\nof the Dirac point of graphene and the charge transfer mechanism inside\nthe MOF complex. Previously, Dirac point modulated light emission\nhas been reported by sandwiching quantum dots between the graphene\non a solid substrate of SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si. In this work, for the\nfirst time, we demonstrated the Dirac point-controlled color-tunable\nlight emission by sandwiching MOFs between the graphene on a flexible\nsubstrate of PVDF/PDMS.

We measured the electroluminescence spectrum (EL) of our device under the applications of different forward injection currents, as shown in a. Our fabricated flexible vertical phototransistor device possesses a continuous and broad electroluminescence spectrum identical to the observed photoluminescence spectrum covering the whole visible regime under different injection currents from 0.7 to 3 mA. The CRI and the CCT of emitted light are 85 and 5620 K for the CIE color coordinates (0.33, 0.34), respectively. For further clarification of broad-spectrum light emission from our fabricated device, we compared our EL spectrum with the commercial white LED (b) and the solar emission spectrum of AM0 (Figure S14). Surprisingly, our device can provide emission matching the solar-spectrum white light very well, which is very rare in conventional LEDs. The principle of the electroluminescence of our fabricated phototransistor can be explained by the energy-band diagram, as shown in Figure S15. By applying a suitable electrical bias, the barrier potential of asymmetric Schottky junctions is inversed as compared to the mode of photodetection operation. The Schottky barrier at the GrT/MOF interface can become higher than the Schottky barrier at the MOF/GrB interface at a suitable electrical bias. Under this circumstance, the electrons transferred from GrT, and the holes transferred from GrB into the MOF layer, which creates the radiative recombination between electrons and holes from the multiple energy states of MOFs and generates the white light emission. The estimated EQE in the electroluminescence from the light-emissive vertical phototransistor is ~1%. The fill factor for our graphene sandwich GrT/MOF/GrB/PVDF multifunctional white light-emissive vertical phototransistor is much higher compared to the fill factor of a previously reported WLED fabricated by using a GrT/MOF/ZnO/Ag heterostructure. Multiple aspects behind the observation of high fill factor include (a) the short channel length of a graphene sandwich vertical phototransistor reduces the channel resistance compared to the long channel length of MOF/ZnO heterojunctions, (b) asymmetric Schottky junctions at GrT/MOF and MOF/GrB interfaces due to the utilization of piezoelectric PVDF provide less resistance compared to junctions at Ag/ZnO and MOF/Gr interfaces of a GrT/MOF/ZnO/Ag heterostructure, and (c) direct charge transformations between interligand, intermetal, and metal to a ligand by an external applied electric field inside the MOF complex compared to the indirect charge transformations of MOF/ZnO heterostructure. We demonstrated the device's flexibility in electroluminescence under the application of bending strain (ca. <20%), as shown in c. This investigation reveals that the emitted light intensity is higher under the application of downward bending strain as compared to upward bending strain, which is in stark contrast with the investigation of photocurrent under the application of mechanical bending strain. The underlying mechanism can also be interpreted by the Dirac point modulation of graphene through the piezoelectric field created by the PVDF film under bending. Additionally, we investigated applied voltage-dependent light emission under mechanical bending conditions, as shown in d. At a lower injection current, we observed the green emission band dominates in the EL spectrum. Spectacularly, with the enhancement of applied potential, a blue emission peak centered at ~430 nm appears in the EL spectrum. At the application of a higher injected current, the blue emission band dominates over the green emission band in the EL spectrum. The mobile photographs of emitted light at different injected currents are provided in the inset of d, and the corresponding CIE diagram of emitted light at different injection currents is shown in e. These fascinating features can be explained by the band alignment between MOF and graphene through the Dirac point modulation by applied potential, strain, and the charge-transfer mechanism inside the MOF complex, as shown in f. As mentioned earlier, an MOF can cover a wide range of light emissions because of several charge transitions inside the MOF complex. As shown in the PL spectrum of Figure S6, the band gap of the intermetallic charge transformation is much lower than the band gap of interligand charge transformation. Because of the lower band gap effect, at a lower injection current intermetallic and metal-ligand charge transformations dominate in the electroluminescence, which provides the green and yellow emission bands, respectively. However, at a higher injection current, interligand charge transformation is dominant over the metal-ligand charge transformation, which provides the blue emission peak over the yellow emission in the EL spectrum. The different exciton lifetime associated with the different charge-transformation mechanisms provides multiple emission bands in the EL spectrum.
