To confirm\nthe latter, we calculated Henry\u2019s coefficient for water, <italic toggle=\"yes\">K</italic>\n<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> = 2.3 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20136</sup> mol/kg/Pa for UiO-66, which was lower than the corresponding value\nof a well-known moisture stable ZIF-8, <italic toggle=\"yes\">K</italic>\n<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> = 5.0 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20136</sup> mol/kg/Pa. Therefore, UiO-66 is expected to preserve its\nstability during wet flue gas separation under real operating conditions. a shows that the\nML-predicted CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> selectivity of pristine\nUiO-66 strongly agrees with the simulated ones. Theoretical reasons\nfor selecting UiO-66 as the host material of the composite were obtained\nfrom the detailed feature importance analysis of ML models given in . Pore volume and\nporosity are the two important features that determine the gas adsorption\nproperties of the IL/MOF composites. b shows that a good CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> selectivity in the range of 8\u201315 can be achieved if\nthe [BMIM]\u00ad[BF<sub>4</sub>]/UiO-66 composite with an IL loading of\n10.4 wt % is generated, leading to a porosity of 0.35 and a pore volume\nof 0.51 cm<sup>3</sup>/g. The PLD of this new composite was calculated\nas 3.66 \u00c5, so that both CO<sub>2</sub> (3.3 \u00c5) and N<sub>2</sub> (3.64 \u00c5) molecules can adsorb into the pores of the\ncomposite. It is important to note that the new composite has a large\nenough PLD for the entrance of both gas molecules, independent of\ntheir corresponding solubilities in the IL, so that molecular simulations\ncan compute the adsorption of gas molecules, which are modeled as\nhard spheres.</p><p>The integrity of the crystalline structure\nof [BMIM]\u00ad[BF<sub>4</sub>]/UiO-66 composite was investigated by XRD\nanalysis, and no significant change in the XRD data of pristine UiO-66\nwas observed, as shown in a, indicating that the crystalline structure of UiO-66\nremained mostly intact upon IL incorporation, consistent with the\nprevious studies. Similarly, no alterations were\nobserved in the SEM images of the [BMIM]\u00ad[BF<sub>4</sub>]/UiO-66 composite\nobtained at two different magnifications, 50 k\u00d7 and 10 k\u00d7,\nas presented in b,c and <ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.3c02130/suppl_file/am3c02130_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">S6</ext-link>, respectively, verifying the\nintegrity of the surface morphology upon the incorporation of IL molecules.\nMoreover, the presence of boron (B) and fluorine (F) elements, inherited\nfrom [BMIM]\u00ad[BF<sub>4</sub>] molecules, was verified by the EDX analysis\n(<ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.3c02130/suppl_file/am3c02130_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S7</ext-link>). The nature of the molecular\ninteractions between bulk [BMIM]\u00ad[BF<sub>4</sub>] and UiO-66 was elucidated\nusing IR spectroscopy, as presented in d. In summary, the characteristic IR bands\nof pristine UiO-66 illustrated blue shifts for the vibrational modes\nof Zr\u2013(OC) and Zr\u2013O, and the cation of the IL, [BMIM]<sup>+</sup>, showed red shifts upon the incorporation of IL into UiO-66. Hence, these shifts confirm the presence of the\nintermolecular interactions between the [BMIM]<sup>+</sup> cation\nof [BMIM]\u00ad[BF<sub>4</sub>] and the Zr metal nodes of UiO-66.

Because\nthe [BMIM]\u00ad[BF<sub>4</sub>]/UiO-66 composite was selected based on\nthe multivariate analysis obtained from the ML models that predict\ngas uptakes, we compared the experimentally measured, GCMC-simulated\nand ML-predicted CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> uptakes and CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> selectivities of the [BMIM]\u00ad[BF<sub>4</sub>]/UiO-66\ncomposite at 1 bar and 298 K. e shows that while the experimental, simulation, and\nML results are in good agreement for CO<sub>2</sub> uptake of [BMIM]\u00ad[BF<sub>4</sub>]/UiO-66, simulations and ML overestimate the experimentally\nmeasured N<sub>2</sub> uptake, leading to a slight underestimation\nof the CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> selectivity by ML compared to\nthe experimental results. The ML-predicted and simulated CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> selectivities (8.8 and 7.9, respectively) of [BMIM]\u00ad[BF<sub>4</sub>]/UiO-66 are lower than the experimental selectivity (14),\nas shown in e.

Parts c and d of  illustrate the scatter plots with marginal histograms for the relationships between the ML-predicted and GCMC-simulated gas adsorption data of IL/MOF composites. The ML-predicted CO2 and N2 uptakes of the composites have a good correlation with the GCMC results, supported by the high R 2 values in the range of 0.71-0.87 and low RMSE (3.3 \u00d7 10-2-0.55) and MAE (2.3 \u00d7 10-2-0.38) values for the test sets. In c,d, the RMSE values are higher than the MAE values because our data set includes some IL/MOF composites that exhibit a higher gas uptake relative to the nearest data point. Since the maximum gas uptake values used to train tree-based ML algorithms also affect the upper limits of ML predictions, we kept these structures in our database. Our work mainly aims to predict the CO2/N2 separation performances of IL/MOF composites. Therefore, ML predictions for pristine MOFs that we considered in this work are provided in the SI. The correlation map of the feature distribution and models' accuracy are presented in Figure S3. A total of 19 features that we described above were used as inputs of ML models to predict gas adsorption in MOFs, shown in Figures S3a,b, and the feature distribution in the training and test sets were similar. Parts c and d of Figure S3 show that the calculated R 2 (0.77-0.89), RMSE (3.3 \u00d7 10-2-0.59), MAE (2.14 \u00d7 10-2-0.36), and SRCC (0.92-0.94) values of the ML models developed for MOFs were similar to the values calculated for the IL/MOF composites.\n\nML-Guided Generation of a New IL/MOF Composite\n\nThe main target of this work is to integrate ML into the molecular simulations of IL/MOF composites to precisely direct experimental efforts to the synthesis of new composites for CO2/N2 separation. To achieve this, we first focused on the CO2/N2 selectivity of pristine MOFs to identify a host material for IL incorporation. a shows that the ML-predicted selectivities of pristine MOFs strongly agree with the GCMC-simulated ones at 1 bar and 298 K, suggesting that ML models are useful to accurately assess the gas separation performances of pristine MOFs that exist in our database. We compared the ML-predicted selectivities of Cu-BTC and ZIF-8, two hosts that were previously used to make [BMIM][BF4]/MOF composites, with the GCMC-based selectivities, and the good agreement confirmed the validity of ML models to accurately estimate the CO2/N2 selectivity of any type of MOF. To further show the consistency between ML predictions and the results of simulations and experimental measurements, we identified the top three MOFs (refcodes: QOVDEL, REQBAS, and FUSMEM) exhibiting the highest CO2/N2 selectivity in the test set. Table S4 shows CO2 and N2 uptakes and the corresponding CO2/N2 selectivities of these MOFs obtained from simulations and ML models. These MOFs exhibit high CO2/N2 selectivity in the range of 38-50, and they are good candidates for making [BMIM][BF4]-incorporated composites. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of these MOFs are commercially available. Hence, we specifically aimed to focus on a commercially available MOF (i) to avoid potential reproducibility problems in synthesizing these materials and (ii) to prove the transferability of our ML models and the validity of our methodology by studying a MOF that was not present in our original data set yet commercially available at a certain quality through reliable vendors. Thus, we chose a zirconium-based MOF, UiO-66, as the host material for the following practical and theoretical reasons: UiO-66 is robust and offers high chemical stability and moisture resistance. To confirm the latter, we calculated Henry's coefficient for water, K H2O = 2.3 \u00d7 10-6 mol/kg/Pa for UiO-66, which was lower than the corresponding value of a well-known moisture stable ZIF-8, K H2O = 5.0 \u00d7 10-6 mol/kg/Pa. Therefore, UiO-66 is expected to preserve its stability during wet flue gas separation under real operating conditions. a shows that the ML-predicted CO2/N2 selectivity of pristine UiO-66 strongly agrees with the simulated ones. Theoretical reasons for selecting UiO-66 as the host material of the composite were obtained from the detailed feature importance analysis of ML models given in . Pore volume and porosity are the two important features that determine the gas adsorption properties of the IL/MOF composites. b shows that a good CO2/N2 selectivity in the range of 8-15 can be achieved if the [BMIM][BF4]/UiO-66 composite with an IL loading of 10.4 wt % is generated, leading to a porosity of 0.35 and a pore volume of 0.51 cm3/g. The PLD of this new composite was calculated as 3.66 \u00c5, so that both CO2 (3.3 \u00c5) and N2 (3.64 \u00c5) molecules can adsorb into the pores of the composite. It is important to note that the new composite has a large enough PLD for the entrance of both gas molecules, independent of their corresponding solubilities in the IL, so that molecular simulations can compute the adsorption of gas molecules, which are modeled as hard spheres.\n\nThe integrity of the crystalline structure of [BMIM][BF4]/UiO-66 composite was investigated by XRD analysis, and no significant change in the XRD data of pristine UiO-66 was observed, as shown in a, indicating that the crystalline structure of UiO-66 remained mostly intact upon IL incorporation, consistent with the previous studies. Similarly, no alterations were observed in the SEM images of the [BMIM][BF4]/UiO-66 composite obtained at two different magnifications, 50 k\u00d7 and 10 k\u00d7, as presented in b,c and S6, respectively, verifying the integrity of the surface morphology upon the incorporation of IL molecules. Moreover, the presence of boron (B) and fluorine (F) elements, inherited from [BMIM][BF4] molecules, was verified by the EDX analysis (Figure S7). The nature of the molecular interactions between bulk [BMIM][BF4] and UiO-66 was elucidated using IR spectroscopy, as presented in d. In summary, the characteristic IR bands of pristine UiO-66 illustrated blue shifts for the vibrational modes of Zr-(OC) and Zr-O, and the cation of the IL, [BMIM]+, showed red shifts upon the incorporation of IL into UiO-66. Hence, these shifts confirm the presence of the intermolecular interactions between the [BMIM]+ cation of [BMIM][BF4] and the Zr metal nodes of UiO-66. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm of the [BMIM][BF4]/UiO-66 composite (Figure S8) showed a reduction in both the surface area and pore volume (Table S5) compared to that of pristine UiO-66, indicating the successful incorporation of IL molecules into the MOF pores, consistent with the studies of previously reported IL/MOF composites. Moreover, conductor-like screening model for realistic solvents (COSMO-RS) solubility calculations (Figure S9) demonstrated that N2 has almost negligible solubility in [BMIM][BF4] at the BET measurement conditions.\n\nWe finally measured the CO2 and N2 adsorption isotherms by using a volumetric gas sorption analyzer. The CO2 adsorption isotherm for pristine UiO-66 was fitted to the dual-site Langmuir model, while the N2 isotherm of pristine UiO-66 and the CO2 and N2 adsorption isotherms of the [BMIM][BF4]/UiO-66 composite were fitted to the dual-site Langmuir-Freundlich model. The corresponding fitting parameters are given in Table S6. Because the [BMIM][BF4]/UiO-66 composite was selected based on the multivariate analysis obtained from the ML models that predict gas uptakes, we compared the experimentally measured, GCMC-simulated and ML-predicted CO2 and N2 uptakes and CO2/N2 selectivities of the [BMIM][BF4]/UiO-66 composite at 1 bar and 298 K. e shows that while the experimental, simulation, and ML results are in good agreement for CO2 uptake of [BMIM][BF4]/UiO-66, simulations and ML overestimate the experimentally measured N2 uptake, leading to a slight underestimation of the CO2/N2 selectivity by ML compared to the experimental results. The ML-predicted and simulated CO2/N2 selectivities (8.8 and 7.9, respectively) of [BMIM][BF4]/UiO-66 are lower than the experimental selectivity (14), as shown in e. We note that this underestimation does not change our final judgment about the materials' separation performance because a selectivity on the order of 10 is achieved by both experiments and computations. The results also demonstrate that the experimentally measured CO2/N2 selectivity of the composite is in the range of mediocre selectivity (8-15), as expected from ML predictions in b. We compared the CO2/N2 selectivity of the [BMIM][BF4]/UiO-66 composite with the selectivities of the previously synthesized [BMIM][BF4]-based composites [BMIM][BF4]/ZIF-8 (7.5 wt %), [BMIM][BF4]/ZIF-8 (28.3 wt %), [BMIM][BF4]/Cu-BTC (30 wt %), and [BMIM][BF4]/Cu-BTC (2.2 wt %). The new composite showed a comparable/higher separation potential than these previously reported [BMIM][BF4]/MOF composites having selectivities of 7.89, 11.60, 13.04, and 15.17 at 1 bar and 298 K.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "35.6", "unit": "wt%", "temperature": "25\u00b0C", "pressure": "1 atm", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "MOF-B", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "27.8", "unit": "wt%", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "1 atm", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["gas_adsorption"]}, {"idx": 6, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Data-driven design of\na new IL/MOF composite.
