The biomimetically synthesized ZIF-8 coating (in the ECM-MOF composite) shifted the denaturation temperature to 64.8 \u00b0C, offering a mild benefit in structure stabilization.\n\nMOF composites are commonly characterized with respect to the crystal structure, thermal stability, and porosity, whereas the mechanical properties are rarely accounted for. In this study, the viscoelastic properties of the ECM-MOF composite were investigated by DMA (). A repeated-measures ANOVA with a Greenhouse-Geisser correction determined that the complex modulus (E*) means differed significantly between time points [F(1.917, 13.420) = 70.945, p < 0.001]. Post hoc analysis with a Bonferroni adjustment revealed that E* increased from pre-treatment (baseline) to any time points of the post-treatment: immediate (p < 0.01), 10 d (p < 0.01), 30 d (p < 0.01), and 90 d (p < 0.01). Immediately after the biomimetic growth of the MOF coating, the E* mean increased to 17.1 \u00b1 2.4 MPa (A), representing a twofold increase over the baseline (8.8 \u00b1 1.3 MPa). Another significant increment (p = 0.002) occurred from post-treatment (immediate) to 10 d (E* = 24.2 \u00b1 4.7 MPa). Then, a plateau was maintained during the simulated physiological aging (10-90 d), and the means differences were not significant (p > 0.2). The relatively higher E* means indicate an improvement in the stiffness of the ECM after the MOF formation. Thus, enhanced mechanical strength was imparted to the dentin ECM by the ZIF-8 coating.\n\nThe increment in mechanical strength provided by the ZIF-8 coating is relatively low compared to that of natural collagen cross-linkers or the native mineral phase. Nevertheless, the increment is enough to sustain a crystalline framework that withstands stress, including destructive enzymes. A primary goal of this study was to verify if protective ZIF-8 coatings can improve the biostability of fibrillar collagen, preventing its degradation due to hydrolysis and enzyme action. The results of the collagen degradation assay () suggest that MOF-modified collagen (ECM-MOF) degrades nearly twice less than unmodified collagen (ECM) under physiological conditions. Furthermore, when exposed to collagen-degrading enzymes to accelerate the proteolysis, the ECM-MOF composite degraded significantly less (205.1 \u00b1 37.3 \u03bcg mL-1) than the unprotected ECM (480.2 \u00b1 22.8 \u03bcg mL-1).\n\nSurface roughness, a critical parameter for adhesion in dentin, should be considered in modifications of the dentin matrix with hybrid materials. The roughness of the ECM-MOF composite was estimated from AFM images (). The arithmetic average roughness (R a) was 12.0 \u00b1 3.7 and 78.4 \u00b1 6.7 nm for the ECM and EM-MOF, respectively. The considerably rougher texture that the frameworks impart to the dentin matrix creates extended surface area, beneficial to dentin bonding. Furthermore, the hydrophobic and microporous nature of ZIF-8 could favor the infiltration of apolar resin monomers, commonly used in dentin bonding procedures. \n\nBiomedical applications often require biomaterials to be engineered with crucial biocompatible characteristics, including low toxicity. When integrating the dentin ECM with MOFs, the resulting composite must maintain good compatibility with cells relevant to the tooth tissues. A shows the viability of DPSCs cultured on ECM and ECM-MOF substrates. A Tukey post hoc test (on a one-way ANOVA) revealed no statistically significant differences between the ECM and ECM-MOF groups after 1 d (p = 0.959) and 3 d (p = 0.546). However, after 7 d of culture, the cell viability was higher on the ECM surface than the ECM-MOF (p < 0.001). Overall, the cell proliferation followed a similar trend on both substrates (Supporting Information, Figure S2), but the MOF coating led to a lower proliferation rate compared to the uncoated scaffolds (ECM). Except for a slower proliferation, cytotoxic effects were not substantiated by the results. For instance, the ECM-MOF group's viability reached 434.9% by the end of the experiment (A). In addition, strong evidence of the viability of attached DPSCs is presented in C, where primarily live cells are observed on the composite's surface. The DPSCs on the ECM-MOF samples exhibited elongated shapes similar to the control group (B).", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "59.7", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "start of denaturation of collagen protein", "condition": ""}, {"value": "64.8", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "shifted denaturation temperature", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["decomposition_temperature"]}, {"idx": 30, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Schematic model\nproposes the growth of ZIF-8 crystals as a protective\ncoating for fibrillar collagen.
