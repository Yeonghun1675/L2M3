As can be seen in C, the 15N MAS NMR spectrum of 15NO3 -@1 displays a nonsymmetrical signal attributed to the 15NO3 - guests residing in different environments within the pores. After exhaustive exchange achieved using solutions of (n-Bu4N)ClO4 in DMF at room temperature, the intensity of the 15N MAS NMR resonance decreased to ca. 65% of that due to 15NO3 -@1, indicating that ca. 35% of the nitrate anions were exchanged (see Supporting Information). Based on this result and considering the formula of 1, the exchanged ClO4 -@1 can be formulated as [Cu2(L)(H2O)2](NO3)1.3(ClO4)0.7\u22c55.5H2O. The incomplete exchange of nitrate with perchlorate anions within 1, even after several hours of soaking in fresh solutions of (n-Bu4N)ClO4, can presumably be related to different environments surrounding the nitrate anions inside the pores. In fact, 1 presents at least two nonequivalent vicinities imposed by the two types of cages observed in the structure that are alternately stacked in a 1:1 ratio. The spherical cage (Cu12L12) is about 13.2 \u00c5 in diameter, while the large rod-shaped cage (Cu24L6) is about 10.1 \u00d7 31.8 \u00c52 (Figure S8). The small shift of the single 15N NMR resonance from 327 to 330 ppm may be indicative of such preferential exchange imposed by the nitrate environment. Unfortunately, the exact location of the nitrate anions could not be determined during structural refinement; thus, they were removed by the SQUEEZE routine of PLATON, along with several guest solvent molecules. However, the homogeneous distribution of ClO4 - guests in the material ClO4 -@1 was demonstrated through Cl mapping using microanalysis/scanning electron microscopy (EDS/SEM) on a flat piece of crystal of the material (Figure S9).", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 12, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of all anion-exchanged\nsamples\nwere conducted under a nitrogen atmosphere, except for ClO<sub arrange=\"stack\">4</sub>\n<sup arrange=\"stack\">\u2013</sup>@<bold>1</bold> due to its energetic potential (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.0c19212/suppl_file/am0c19212_si_001.pdf\">Figure S10</ext-link>).
