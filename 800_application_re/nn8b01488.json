For comparison, the GC350 and GCP250 were also tested (Figure S13) to understand the structure-property relationship. The electrochemical performance of GCP350 was first investigated by galvanostatic discharge-charge tests between 0.01 and 3 V at 0.2 A g-1. As shown in a, GCP350 anodes delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1978 mAh g-1 (calculated on the whole electrode) and a reversible charge capacity of 1198 mAh g-1 with a relatively low initial Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 60.6%, caused by electrolyte decomposition and formation of a solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI). Meanwhile, the discharge-charge curves almost overlapped for the second, fifth, and 10th cycles, demonstrating the excellent cycling stability of GCP350. Cycling performance was further tested at 0.2 A g-1 (b). The capacity of GCP350 was 1201 mAh g-1 with a CE above 95% in the second cycle. After 100 cycles, the capacity of GCP350 anodes still retained 1192 mAh g-1 with a CE of ~99%, which is much better than that of GCP250 and GC350. The rate performance of GCP350 anodes was evaluated at current densities from 0.1 to 40 A g-1. c shows the typical galvanostatic discharge-charge curves of GCP350 under different current densities, and the reversible capacities of GCP350 are 1301, 1188, 1060, 987, 906, 801, 701, and 596 mAh g-1 at current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 A g-1, respectively, far surpassing those of GCP250 and GC350 (d). Even at a superhigh current density of 40 A g-1, which has never been reported for MOF-based anodes, the GCP350 can still achieve an impressive capacity of 494 mAh g-1, demonstrating the superior rate performance of GCP350. Moreover, the reversible capacity of GCP350 anodes recovered to 1255 mAh g-1 when the current density returned to 0.1 A g-1, indicating excellent structural stability of GCP350. To the best of our knowledge, the capacity and the rate performance of GCP350 are significantly higher than all MOF-based anodes for LIBs reported recently (e and Table S1). In addition, we have also tested the control sample without Co-MOFs (Figure S14) and confirmed the extraordinary electrochemical performance of GCP350 was mainly due to the ultrasmall Co-MOF nanocrystals. The electrochemical processes of these electrodes were further investigated and compared by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

This strategy involves a feasible mechanism: calcination of Co-MOFs at proper temperature in air induces the partial thermal collapse/distortion of the framework, while the uniform coating of a conducting polymer can significantly improve the decomposition temperature and maintain the component stability of Co-MOFs, thus leading to the pulverization of bulk Co-MOF particles into ultrasmall nanocrystals without oxidation. The pulverization of Co-MOFs significantly increases the contact area between Co-MOFs with electrolyte and shortens the electron and ion transport pathway. Therefore, the sub-5 nm ultrasmall MOF nanocrystals-based composites deliver an ultrahigh reversible capacity (1301 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1), extraordinary rate performance (494 mAh g-1 at 40 A g-1), and outstanding cycling stability (98.6% capacity retention at 10 A g-1 after 2000 cycles), which is the best performance achieved in all reported MOF-based anodes for lithium-ion batteries.", "data": [{"meta": {"name": "ultrasmall metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "processes": [{"synthesis method": "thermal pulverization", "precursor": [{"name": "bulk Co-MOF particles", "amount": "", "unit": ""}], "solution": [{"name": "conducting polymer coated Co-MOFs/graphene oxide", "amount": "", "unit": ""}], "pressure": "", "temperature": "", "time": ""}, {"synthesis method": "calcination", "temperature": "proper temperature", "atmosphere": "air"}, {"synthesis method": "coating", "coating material": "conducting polymer"}], "yield": "", "other properties": ["ultrahigh reversible capacity (1301 mAh g\u20131 at 0.1 A g\u20131)", "extraordinary rate performance (494 mAh g\u20131 at 40 A g\u20131)", "outstanding cycling stability (98.6% capacity retention at 10 A g\u20131 after 2000 cycles)"]}], "include_properties": ["chemical_synthesis"]}, {"idx": "3, 9, 11, 16", "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<p>Herein, we report a simple and environmentally\nfriendly spatially\nconfined pulverization method to fabricate sub-5 nm ultrasmall MOF\nnanocrystals through calcination in air.
