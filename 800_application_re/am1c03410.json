Note that each measurement was made 5 min after adding N2H4 to ensure the establishment of equilibrium between N2H4 and the SNNU-153 MOF sensor (vide supra). As a result, a straight-line behavior was obtained within the added N2H4 concentration of 0-700 ppm. The linear relationship was then fitted by the Stern-Volmer relationship, i.e., I 543/I 450 = A + K SV[N2H4], and a K SV value of 406.4 M-1 was deduced. The detection limits (DLs) or limit of detection (LOD) can be estimated by the relationship DL = 3\u03c3/k, where \u03c3 denotes the standard deviation of 10 blank tests and k is the slope of the linear relationship, which is equivalent to K SV. As a result, the detection limit was calculated to be 0.0595 ppm or 1.86 \u03bcM. Upon increasing the concentration up to 700 ppm, the deviation from the linearity gradually appeared, accompanied by the decrease of the titration slope, i.e., the ratio of I 543/I 450 versus [N2H4] (c). Nevertheless, in the [N2H4] range of 700-5500 ppm, if we qualitatively impose a linear plot, a Stern-Volmer plot with K SV of 37.76 M-1 can be obtained. The cause of perturbation in the high concentration of [N2H4] will be discussed in the later section. It is noted that the detection limit of the SNNU-153 MOF probe is superior when compared with that reported in the literature, such as BTP-LB (2.74 \u03bcM), HFP (2 \u03bcM), and CD2 (4.5 \u03bcM). Nevertheless, it is also slightly inferior to some probes, such as phthalimide-UIO-66 (0.87 \u03bcM) and 2-Ac (0.96 \u03bcM). Furthermore, the K SV value is comparable with some N2H4 probes such as BTP-LB (3.81 \u00d7 103 M-1) and BTP-LN (5.53 \u00d7 103 M-1).

The emission has a small Stokes shift of ~2000 cm-1 with respect to the lowest-lying absorption peak and is considered as a normal emission. A normal emission of SNNU-153 was also observed in solid samples (Figure S2). The lack of ESIPT, i.e., the proton transfer from -OH to the carboxylate oxygen, can be rationalized by the weak basicity of the coordinated carbonyl oxygen where its electron density has been shifted to the metal (In) center upon coordination.\n\nThe absorption and emission spectra of SNNU-153 in DMF as a function of the added N2H4 concentration were then studied. Despite the smooth change of the N2H4 absorption titration spectra (Figure S1), drastic changes in ratiometric emission were observed. As shown in a, upon adding N2H4, the strong 450 nm blue emission drastically decreased, accompanied by a long wavelength shoulder that became obvious with a peak wavelength at 543 nm at a N2H4 concentration of, e.g., 100 ppm. After continually adding N2H4 from 100 to 5500 ppm, the emission intensity at 543 nm dominated the spectra with the disappearance of the 450 nm emission band. The titration established a ratiometric fluorescence pattern for hydrazine detection. The fluorescence quantum yield (QY) of the SNNU-153 450 nm band and its saturated 543 nm emission with N2H4 was measured to be as high as 18 and 49%, respectively, in DMF (Table S2). Due to the strong fluorescence intensity for both 450 and 543 nm bands, amid the N2H4 titration, SNNU-153 showed an apparent emission color change from blue to yellow that can be clearly visualized by the naked eyes under a conventional 366 nm UV light (inset of a). The sensitive fluorescence emission changes match well with the CIE chromaticity diagram (Figure S3a).\n\nSNNU-153 acts as a molecular sieve; therefore, the kinetic domain, i.e., the time course of reaching equilibrium for luminescence intensity at 450 and 543 nm amid N2H4 titration, is important, which was measured by in situ monitoring the real-time fluorescence intensity (b). It can be seen that the fluorescence intensity at emission 450 nm sharply decreased and quickly reached a minimum constant value in 7 and 88 s with the addition of 3.2 ppm (0.1 mM) and 1000 ppm (31.25 mM) of N2H4, respectively, showing an extraordinarily fast response for MOF-based sensors. For a fair comparison, we summarize the performance data of other reported sensors in Table S3, where the response time for most N2H4 sensing probes always exceeds 10 min. For example, the MOF sensor phthalimide-UIO-66 showed a response time of 18 min for 2.25 mM N2H4, and a common molecule sensor, EPH, exhibited a response time of 60 min when adding 1 mM N2H4.\n\n c shows the plot for the emission intensity at 543 nm (I 543) versus that at 450 nm (I 450) as a function of the added N2H4 concentration ([M]). Note that each measurement was made 5 min after adding N2H4 to ensure the establishment of equilibrium between N2H4 and the SNNU-153 MOF sensor (vide supra). As a result, a straight-line behavior was obtained within the added N2H4 concentration of 0-700 ppm. The linear relationship was then fitted by the Stern-Volmer relationship, i.e., I 543/I 450 = A + K SV[N2H4], and a K SV value of 406.4 M-1 was deduced. The detection limits (DLs) or limit of detection (LOD) can be estimated by the relationship DL = 3\u03c3/k, where \u03c3 denotes the standard deviation of 10 blank tests and k is the slope of the linear relationship, which is equivalent to K SV. As a result, the detection limit was calculated to be 0.0595 ppm or 1.86 \u03bcM. Upon increasing the concentration up to 700 ppm, the deviation from the linearity gradually appeared, accompanied by the decrease of the titration slope, i.e., the ratio of I 543/I 450 versus [N2H4] (c). Nevertheless, in the [N2H4] range of 700-5500 ppm, if we qualitatively impose a linear plot, a Stern-Volmer plot with K SV of 37.76 M-1 can be obtained. The cause of perturbation in the high concentration of [N2H4] will be discussed in the later section. It is noted that the detection limit of the SNNU-153 MOF probe is superior when compared with that reported in the literature, such as BTP-LB (2.74 \u03bcM), HFP (2 \u03bcM), and CD2 (4.5 \u03bcM). Nevertheless, it is also slightly inferior to some probes, such as phthalimide-UIO-66 (0.87 \u03bcM) and 2-Ac (0.96 \u03bcM). Furthermore, the K SV value is comparable with some N2H4 probes such as BTP-LB (3.81 \u00d7 103 M-1) and BTP-LN (5.53 \u00d7 103 M-1). Overall, taking the ultrafast response performance into account, the SNNU-153 MOF probe is very promising for sensing N2H4.\n\nThe time-resolved experiments for the SNNU-153 probe in DMF with and without N2H4 were also conducted (Figure S4). The average lifetime of the SNNU-153 probe in DMF (\u03bbem = 450 nm) is 3.21 ns. After addition of 10, 50, 100, 200, and 500 ppm of N2H4 to SNNU-153 in the DMF solution (\u03bbem = 450 nm), the average times are 2.94, 2.96, 2.99, 3.03, and 3.32 ns, respectively. The average lifetime at \u03bbem = 543 nm of SNNU-153 is 6.40 ns; after addition of 10, 50, 100, 200, 300, and 500 ppm of N2H4 to SNNU-153 in the DMF solution, the average times at \u03bbem = 543 nm are 8.06, 8.56, 9.49, 9.50, and 9.65 ns, respectively. Within the experimental error, the essentially unchanged average lifetime indicates that the fluorescence response of SNNU-153 for N2H4 originates from the ground state.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "SNNU-153", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "peak spectrum": [{"value": "410", "unit": "nm", "condition": "in dimethylformamide (DMF)"}, {"value": "450", "unit": "nm", "condition": "upon excitation"}, {"value": "543", "unit": "nm", "condition": "at a N2H4 concentration of, e.g., 100 ppm"}]}]], "include_properties": ["peak_spectrum"]}, {"idx": 9, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>The synthetic routes and structures of SNNU-153\nand SNNU-152 MOFs.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"am1c03410_0002.tif\" xlink:type=\"simple\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  The synthetic routes and structures of SNNU-153 and SNNU-152 MOFs.
