To investigate this possibility, confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) with a 405 nm laser was used to better control pattern formation. A lower amount of pyranine (0.033 equiv) was added to a solution of 1.1 mM (C  12  RhMOP)(bix)  12  in order to minimize ambient light triggering the gel formation in the CLSM experimental setup. Without light irradiation, TR-DLS analysis of the solution shows that 32 h is necessary for gelation (b), indicating the long-term stability of the solution. For this purpose, aliquots of the solution were collected at two different points of the reaction, after 60 min (stage I) and 20 h (stage II), and these fractions were irradiated under the CLSM with the 405 nm laser for 30 min to form a \"smiley\" pattern. At stage I, which corresponds to the nucleation step of the supramolecular polymerization reaction, the sample shows a low amount of gel formed and the pattern was barely visible (a, left inset picture). In contrast, at stage II, which corresponds to the colloid formation, clearly showed the patterned \"smiley\" gel (a, right insert picture). Therefore, the timing of the light irradiation during the reaction is important, and the solution must be aged until the fusion of nuclei of MOP network into colloidal particles (~20-30 nm) before applying the light irradiation in order to obtain a spatially well-defined gel. To rule out the possibility that irradiation causes local heating which triggers gelation, a control sample of the coordination-trapped phase without pyranine was irradiated for 30 min; however, no gelation was observed (Figure S15a and b).
