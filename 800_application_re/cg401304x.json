A large amount of sulfur\n(40 wt %) has been incorporated in HKUST-1 pore metrics to achieve\nHKUST-1\u2283S composite whose structure has been established by\nboth single and powder X-ray diffraction studies. The strong confinement\nof HKUST-1 for sulfur attributed to the suitable pore spaces and open\nCu<sup>2+</sup> sites has enabled the resulting Li\u2013S\u2282HKSUT-1\nbattery to show excellent performance with a capacity of about 500\nmAh/g after 170 cycles.</p><p>Although porous metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) for\nthe confinement of different substrates such as metal nanoparticles, small molecules, dyes, and drugs have\nbeen extensively explored for their diverse applications including\nheterogeneous catalysis, gas storage\nand separation, photonics, and drug delivery, their confinement of sulfur and thus their potential as cathode\nsulfur host materials for Li\u2013S batteries were only recently\npioneered by Tarascon who explored a\nmesoporous MIL-100 (Cr) for the enhanced cycling life of the resulting\nLi\u2013S battery. This result is really encouraging.

In addition, the pore surfaces can be straightforwardly\nfunctionalized for further stronger interactions with sulfur. These\nunique structural and functional characteristics have provided the\nbright promise of MOF materials as cathode additives for high-performing\nLi\u2013S batteries.

The crystal\nstructure (Figure a) of HKUST-1\u2283S has been established by both single and powder\nX-ray diffraction studies, indicating that HKUST-1 does confine a\nlarge amount of sulfur inside the pores attributed to the suitable\npore spaces and open Cu<sup>2+</sup> sites.

HKUST-1/S is just\nmixture of the HKUST-1 and sulfur in which the strong (222) reflection\nof the crystalline sulfur at 22.8\u00b0 has been clearly demonstrated\nin its PXRD pattern (Figure b). Furthermore,\nthe surfaces of HKUST-1\u2283S crystals are clean, and no residual\nsulfur particles can be observed on the crystal surfaces under the\noptical microscope (Figure S1, ).

Herein we utilize HKUST-1 as the host material to trap sulfur and thus to diminish the dissolution problem. A large amount of sulfur (40 wt %) has been incorporated in HKUST-1 pore metrics to achieve HKUST-1\u2283S composite whose structure has been established by both single and powder X-ray diffraction studies. The strong confinement of HKUST-1 for sulfur attributed to the suitable pore spaces and open Cu2+ sites has enabled the resulting Li-S\u2282HKSUT-1 battery to show excellent performance with a capacity of about 500 mAh/g after 170 cycles.\n\nAlthough porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for the confinement of different substrates such as metal nanoparticles, small molecules, dyes, and drugs have been extensively explored for their diverse applications including heterogeneous catalysis, gas storage and separation, photonics, and drug delivery, their confinement of sulfur and thus their potential as cathode sulfur host materials for Li-S batteries were only recently pioneered by Tarascon who explored a mesoporous MIL-100 (Cr) for the enhanced cycling life of the resulting Li-S battery. This result is really encouraging. Porous MOFs have much more variable pore structures than other types of porous materials, so the pore and cage sizes and window apertures can be systematically tuned for confinement of sulfur substrate. In addition, the pore surfaces can be straightforwardly functionalized for further stronger interactions with sulfur. These unique structural and functional characteristics have provided the bright promise of MOF materials as cathode additives for high-performing Li-S batteries. We speculate that those porous MOFs as the additives with stronger confinement effects for sulfur should further extend the cycling life of the Li-S batteries. Herein we report HKUST-1 with moderate pore spaces and open metal sites for the enhanced confinement of sulfur and thus for the Li-S battery of a very long cycling life over 170 times at a capacity of about 500 mAh/g.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nSynthesis of HKUST-1\u2283S composite material is illustrated in Figure . HKUST-1 was synthesized following the procedure reported, and its purity was confirmed by PXRD patterns, as shown in Figure b. The PXRD pattern of the HKUST-1\u2283S (Figure b) shows that the sulfur has been completely incorporated into the pores of HKUST-1 with no trace of the crystallized sulfur. The crystal structure (Figure a) of HKUST-1\u2283S has been established by both single and powder X-ray diffraction studies, indicating that HKUST-1 does confine a large amount of sulfur inside the pores attributed to the suitable pore spaces and open Cu2+ sites. HKUST-1\u2283S is completely different from the mechanically mixed HKUST-1/S. HKUST-1/S is just mixture of the HKUST-1 and sulfur in which the strong (222) reflection of the crystalline sulfur at 22.8\u00b0 has been clearly demonstrated in its PXRD pattern (Figure b). Furthermore, the surfaces of HKUST-1\u2283S crystals are clean, and no residual sulfur particles can be observed on the crystal surfaces under the optical microscope (Figure S1, ). As shown in Figure S2, , after the sulfur encapsulation, the BET surface area significantly drops from 1500 to 97 m2/g. The sulfur content in HKUST-1\u2283S has been determined to be 39.61 wt % by EA, which matches with the added amount inside the sealed glass tube. The amount of the encapsulated sulfur can be controlled by adding different amounts of free sulfur with the highest one up to 55 wt %.\n\nElectrochemical studies have been carried out on HKUST-1\u2283S and HKUST-1/S. They were coated with 20% Ketjenblack by ball milling at 300 rpm for 1 h to improve electroconductivity and achieve uniform particles. The carbon coated materials were further mixed with another 15% Ketjenblack and 25% PVDF and dispersed in N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) as the cathode slurry. Aluminum foil was used as the current collector and 1 M LiTFSI with 2 wt % LiNO3 in DOL/DME (v:v, 1:1) was chosen as the electrolyte. Figure a shows the first three charge and discharge curves of Li-S\u2282HKUST-1 battery at a charge rate of 0.1 C and discharge rate of 0.05 C. The first discharge curve shows two typical S8 discharge platforms at ~2.35 and ~2.05 V, corresponding to the cathode reactions of S8 \u2192 Li2S x  (x \u2265 4) and Li2S x  (x \u2265 4) \u2192 Li2S x  (x < 4), respectively. There exist two additional small shoulders at ~1.4 and ~1.7 V, which might be attributed to those strongly confined sulfur inside the pores of HKUST-1. During charging, the first charge curve exhibits two platforms at ~2.7 and ~2.45 V, and the first one disappears in the subsequent cycles. Such electrochemical behaviors have been exclusively confirmed by the cyclic voltammogram (CV) (Figure c), which was collected at a step of 0.1 mV/s. A single anodic peak occurs at ~2.45 V as the potential scans to the charging voltage, which is attributed to the conversion of Li2S and polysulfides into elemental S. No peak corresponding to the charging platform at ~2.7 V can be seen in first cycle, which we speculate is caused by the dynamic factors when conducting the CV test. In the subsequent cycles, the current density of the two reduction peaks at 2.35 and 2.05 V drop, indicating that the capacity of HKUST-1\u2283S cathode irreversibly fades. The fact that the oxidation peak shifts to lower potential range after the first cycle demonstrates a discharge overpotential after recharging.\n\nAs shown in Figure b, HKUST-1\u2283S composite material displays much better cycling performance than the mechanically mixed HKUST-1/S. HKUST-1\u2283S and HKUST-1/S reveal large initial discharge capacity of 1498 and 1507 mAh/g, respectively, attributed to the excellent electroconductivity of Ketjenblack. Although the HKUST-1\u2283S cathode suffers a continuously irreversible capacity fade during the first 50 cycles, which is typically observed in other types of cathode materials, its capacity stays nearly unchanged at ~500 mAh/g even over 170th cycle. The capacity of HKUST-1/S declines faster to a lower one of about 350 mAh/g after 50 cycles. The cyclability of HKUST-1/S is also much worse than HKUST-1\u2283S as a result of severe dissolution of polysulfides.\n\nCrystallographic data of HKUST-1\u2283S, photographs of HKUST-1 and HKUST-1\u2283S, and N2 sorption data.
