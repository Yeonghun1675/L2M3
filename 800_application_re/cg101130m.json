Thus incubation step b associated with nucleation step d in our strategy plays an important role for the high crystallinity of IRMOF crystals. The relative intensity of the first two PXRD peaks at 6.7\u00b0 and 9.6\u00b0 can be used for quality assessment of the nanocrystals, with the peak at lower angles being higher in intensity for highly crystalline materials. Several researchers show that there is a decrease of the relative intensity of PXRD peaks at 6.7\u00b0 vs 9.6\u00b0 compared with the simulated PXRD pattern from an IRMOF-1 single crystal depending on the preparation procedure. For example, Huang et al. reported that nanoparticles that were obtained without thermal treatment show an intensity reversion of the first two PXRD peaks. Bulk IRMOF-1 particles gained by Long et al. under 80 \u00b0C heating for 10 h also show a similar PXRD phenomenon. In our work, the nano-IRMOF-1 material does not exhibit the intensity reversion of the first two PXRD peaks. However, we observed the intensity reversion of the first two peaks when the thermal treatment is insufficient, that is, omission of either a sufficiently long incubation or nucleation phase, and the reversion will increase with the decrease of the thermal treatment (Figure S9, ). Lillerud and co-workers reported that this peak intensity reversion is related to pore-filling effects. In our work, elemental analysis data of two typical samples showed that the materials with peak intensity inversion contain more residual species from the synthesis solution, which agrees well with Lillerud\u2019s finding (Table S4, ). Materials with poor crystallinity and thereby compromised crystalline ordering will trap more guest molecules inside the pores, which is detrimental for the applications of these materials.

Thus, the combination of the incubation (b) and nucleation step (d) not only dissects the kinetic processes of SBUs formation and crystal nucleation but also effectively increased the crystallinity of nano-IRMOFs.</p>", "clean_text": "In accordance with previous studies, direct mixing of the organic amine with a typical IRMOF-1 solution (i.e., step e follows directly after step a) will rapidly precipitate nanoparticles but with poor monodispersity and crystallinity. Samples gained by first heating to 105 \u00b0C for 1.5 h before mixing of the organic amine with the IRMOF-1 solution (i.e., without step b) do not show improved monodispersity and crystallinity (Figure S8, ). Thus incubation step b associated with nucleation step d in our strategy plays an important role for the high crystallinity of IRMOF crystals. The relative intensity of the first two PXRD peaks at 6.7\u00b0 and 9.6\u00b0 can be used for quality assessment of the nanocrystals, with the peak at lower angles being higher in intensity for highly crystalline materials. Several researchers show that there is a decrease of the relative intensity of PXRD peaks at 6.7\u00b0 vs 9.6\u00b0 compared with the simulated PXRD pattern from an IRMOF-1 single crystal depending on the preparation procedure. For example, Huang et al. reported that nanoparticles that were obtained without thermal treatment show an intensity reversion of the first two PXRD peaks. Bulk IRMOF-1 particles gained by Long et al. under 80 \u00b0C heating for 10 h also show a similar PXRD phenomenon. In our work, the nano-IRMOF-1 material does not exhibit the intensity reversion of the first two PXRD peaks. However, we observed the intensity reversion of the first two peaks when the thermal treatment is insufficient, that is, omission of either a sufficiently long incubation or nucleation phase, and the reversion will increase with the decrease of the thermal treatment (Figure S9, ). Lillerud and co-workers reported that this peak intensity reversion is related to pore-filling effects. In our work, elemental analysis data of two typical samples showed that the materials with peak intensity inversion contain more residual species from the synthesis solution, which agrees well with Lillerud's finding (Table S4, ). Materials with poor crystallinity and thereby compromised crystalline ordering will trap more guest molecules inside the pores, which is detrimental for the applications of these materials.
