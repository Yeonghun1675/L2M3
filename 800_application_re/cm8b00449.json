Along with the expected 12 \u00c5 micropore, the density functional theory (DFT)-calculated pore size distribution (b) shows a 27 \u00c5 mesopore with a smaller pore volume compared to the micropore. The presence of this mesopore suggests two possibilities: (1) the obtained NU-901-RT is phase impure, where a small fraction of NU-1000, a MOF constructed from identical building blocks but with large mesoporous channels (~31 \u00c5), is present or (2) the crystals have defect sites (i.e., missing linkers/nodes) creating larger mesopores, analogous to the case of UiO-67. The PXRD pattern of NU-901-RT (Figure S2) does not exhibit a detectable peak characteristic of the (100) plane in NU-1000 (2\u03b8 = 2.5\u00b0). The cumulative pore size distribution of NU-901-RT (Figure S3b) suggests a minimum of 16 mol % NU-1000 impurity if all the apparent mesopores are from NU-1000. Yet, the PXRD pattern of a physical mixture of 16/84 mol % NU-1000/NU-901 shows a sharp peak at 2\u03b8 = 2.5\u00b0 (Figure S2). Thus, we conclude that NU-901-RT may contain defect sites, presumably creating significantly larger pores due to a missing Zr6 node making the resulting mesopore comparable in dimensions to that of NU-1000 (). It is worth noting that a similar phenomenon has been observed for UiO-66 synthesized at room temperature. Supporting evidence accrues from the diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (DRIFTS) of NU-901-RT, nondefective NU-901, and the H4TBAPy organic linker (Figure S4). The C\ue5fbO stretches at 1700 and 1736 cm-1 observed for NU-901-RT suggest the presence of some carboxylic groups on the linker that are not coordinated to the Zr6 node. Note that whereas the same stretches were observed for the H4TBAPy linker, that of nondefective NU-901 did not exhibit the C\ue5fbO stretches.\n\nRoom temperature synthesis of MOFs is ideal for encapsulating NPs as thermally induced aggregation of nanoparticles can effectively be mitigated. Pt NPs, synthesized according to a reported procedure, were dispersed in 10 mL of the acetic acid/DMF/Zr6 node solution under the same conditions as listed previously. The concentration of Pt NPs in this solution is ~700 ppm. The remaining protocol of the MOF synthesis is identical to that without the NPs. The resulting composite (Pt@NU-901) possesses a slightly lower BET surface area (1650 \u00b1 40 m2/g) when compared to NU-901-RT due to mass gain from the Pt NPs, but it retains a similar DFT pore size distribution, suggesting that the encapsulation of Pt NPs does not significantly affect the pore structure of the MOF (Figure S3c). Approximately 70% of the volumetric surface area of NU-901-RT was retained in Pt@NU-901 (i.e., from 1500 \u00b1 40 to 1050 \u00b1 30 m2/cm3, see the SI for details), further suggesting the retention of the porous network upon the NP encapsulation. Through an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) measurement, 11 \u00b1 1 wt % loading of Pt was confirmed in Pt@NU-901. Similar wt % loading was determined through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Figure S7). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show no difference in the crystallite morphology of NU-901-RT versus Pt@NU-901 (300-500 nm tear-shaped crystals), and the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image shows that in Pt@NU-901, most Pt NPs are encapsulated within MOF crystals while small amount are perhaps physisorbed onto the surface of the crystals (Figures S8 and S9). The size distribution of the NPs in the composite was confirmed to be similar to that of bare NPs, with an average diameter of 4.0 \u00b1 0.5 nm (Figures S9 and S10). A diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectrum of Pt@NU-901 shows significant enhancement of extinction in the 500-800 nm region as compared to that of NU-901-RT (Figure S10). This is presumably a result of close packing between the NPs and the framework, resulting in high scattering. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to verify that the oxidation state of Pt in Pt@NU-901 is Pt0 (Figure S11).\n\nAs Pt NPs are known as effective alkene hydrogenation catalysts, we chose to test the propensity of Pt@NU-901 to perform hydrogenation reactions (for details in experimental, see the SI). Namely, we chose cis-stilbene as the substrate; given the 7.8 \u00c5 kinetic diameter, it should readily diffuse through the pores of NU-901 (ca. 12 \u00d7 26 \u00c5). Indeed, when Pt@NU-901 was subjugated to the reaction condition for 1 h, a conversion of 31 \u00b1 1% was confirmed (see Figures S13 and S14 for 1H NMR and GC-MS spectra that were used to identify the substrate/product). PXRD patterns confirm that the framework retained its crystallinity after the NP encapsulation and after the catalysis (Figure S15). N2 isotherm of the composite after catalysis also reveals that much of its porosity has been retained (Figure S16). A TEM image of the composite after catalysis (Figure S17) shows no significant agglomeration of NPs and ICP-OES measurements confirmed no detectable loss of Pt. In comparison, bare Pt NPs undergo rapid agglomeration in the reaction mixture, as shown by SEM and TEM images (Figures S18 and S19). Consequently, after 1 h, no detectable catalysis was observed. When a composite with Pt NPs only on the exterior of the crystals (named Pt/NU-901; for synthesis and characterization, see the SI) was instead used as a catalyst, conversions ranging from 25 to 42% were detected. The high variability is attributed to the uncontrolled MOF crystal agglomeration induced due to the low solubility of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) surfactants on the NPs in the reaction mixture, as shown by the TEM image (Figure S20). We note that the individual NPs retain their 3-4 nm size after catalysis (Figure S20). Pt/NU-901 also retained its crystallinity as shown by the PXRD pattern in Figure S21. Control reactions, without the Pt NPs and without the parent framework, show no catalytic behavior, thus confirming that both the MOF and the Pt NPs are necessary to achieve hydrogenation.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "NU-901-RT", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": {"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "2130 \u00b1 50", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}}, {"meta": {"name": "NU-901-RT", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": {"type": "DFT", "probe": "", "value": "27", "unit": "\u00c5", "condition": ""}}, {"meta": {"name": "NU-901-RT", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": {"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "1500 \u00b1 40", "unit": "m2/cm3", "condition": ""}}]], "include_properties": ["surface_area"]}, {"idx": 5, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Structure of <bold>NU-901</bold> viewed through\nthe <italic>c</italic>-axis (left) and the inorganic node and the\norganic linker (right).\nHydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cm-2018-004498_0001.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Structure of NU-901 viewed through the c-axis (left) and the inorganic node and the organic linker (right).
