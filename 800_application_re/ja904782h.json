Additionally, there are eight small pockets of 5.3 \u00c5 (yellow sphere) around each cage after the terminal water molecules are removed after the activation (Figure a).

MOF-5 has stronger interactions with acetylene than ZIF-8, partly because of the stronger C\u2212H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interactions between acetylene and phenyl groups in MOF-5. The open Cu<sup>2+</sup> sites within HKUST-1 and MOF-505 significantly enhance their interactions with acetylene molecules, as clearly demonstrated by the comparison of their adsorption enthalpies with those in MIL-53 whose pore sizes (7.7 \u00c5) are in the same range with those in HKUST-1 and MOF-505 (5.3\u221210.8 \u00c5).

To locate the acetylene binding sites within HKUST-1, neutron powder diffraction studies on acetylene loaded HKUST-1 were carried out and have conclusively established the significant contribution of open Cu2+ sites for acetylene storage by their strong preferred interactions with acetylene molecules. The binding properties of acetylene gas at different sites were further investigated by first-principles calculations.\n\nResults and Discussions\n\nVariable MOF Structures, Porosities, and Acetylene Adsorption Capacities\n\nFor comparison, six prototype microporous MOFs, namely HKUST-1, MOF-505, MOF-508, MIL-53, MOF-5, and ZIF-8, were examined for their acetylene storage. They can be classified into three types of pore structures featuring open metal sites (HKUST-1 and MOF-505), small pores (MOF-508 and MIL-53), and large pores (MOF-5 and ZIF-8), respectively, as shown in Figure . HKUST-1 has 3D intersectional pores with a window size of 6.9 \u00c5 and cage size of 10.8 \u00c5 (purple sphere). Additionally, there are eight small pockets of 5.3 \u00c5 (yellow sphere) around each cage after the terminal water molecules are removed after the activation (Figure a). MOF-505 features 1D pores in which a small cage of 6.0 \u00c5 (yellow sphere) and large cage of 9.0 \u00c5 (purple sphere) are alternately stacked along the c axis (Figure b). MOF-508 and MIL-53 are doubly interpenetrated and rod-packing MOFs, exhibiting a 1D straight channel of 4.0 \u00d7 4.0 and 7.7 \u00d7 7.7 \u00c52, respectively (Figure c, d). MOF-5 (or IRMOF-1) is one of the most highly porous MOFs with very large open 3D pores of ~11.5 \u00c5 (Figure e). The representative zeolitic MOF, ZIF-8, has a pore aperture of 3.4 \u00c5 and cage size of 11.6 \u00c5 (Figure f). These microporous MOFs were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and then activated and examined by N2 adsorption to establish their permanent porosity. HKUST-1, MOF-505, MOF-508, MIL-53, MOF-5, and ZIF-8 have a Langmuir surface area of 2095, 1694, 946, 1233, 3610, and 1758 m2/g, respectively.\n\nCoverage-Dependent Adsorption Enthalpies\n\nThe coverage-dependent adsorption enthalpies of the MOFs to acetylene were calculated based on a virial method, a well established and reliable methodology from fits of their adsorption isotherms at 273 and 295 K. As shown in Figure , HKUST-1 exhibits the largest adsorption enthalpies of C2H2 (30.4 kJ/mol at a coverage of 1 mmol/g), while ZIF-8 has the smallest one (13.3 kJ/mol at a coverage of 0.02 mmol/g). As investigated before, the smaller pores favor the stronger interactions between acetylene molecules and pore surfaces. Therefore, MIL-53 has higher adsorption enthalpies than MOF-5. MOF-5 has stronger interactions with acetylene than ZIF-8, partly because of the stronger C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions between acetylene and phenyl groups in MOF-5. The open Cu2+ sites within HKUST-1 and MOF-505 significantly enhance their interactions with acetylene molecules, as clearly demonstrated by the comparison of their adsorption enthalpies with those in MIL-53 whose pore sizes (7.7 \u00c5) are in the same range with those in HKUST-1 and MOF-505 (5.3-10.8 \u00c5). The smaller pocket of 5.3 \u00c5 (yellow sphere, Figure a) and more dense open Cu2+ sites within HKUST-1 might contribute to its stronger interactions with acetylene than MOF-505.\n\nBinding Sites within HKUST-1 for Acetylene Storage\n\nInterestingly, the amount of acetylene gas adsorbed in HKUST-1 at room temperature is 201 cm3/g at 1 atm corresponding to 1.67 C2H2 per Cu. If we assume that each open Cu2+ site and the entrance window of a small cage can adsorb one acetylene molecule, as previously established in HKUST-1 as initial hydrogen adsorption sites, the theoretical maximum amount of stored acetylene gas by these two sites exactly corresponds to 1.67 C2H2 per Cu. To experimentally determine these adsorption sites, we have measured the activated HKUST-1, 0.62 C2D2 per Cu and 1.5 C2D2 per Cu loaded HKUST-1, respectively. The data are analyzed with difference Fourier map and Rietveld refinement methods to locate acetylene adsorption sites. \n\nAdsorption data, detailed experimental procedures, structure cif file.
