One of the reasons is that the addition of NH2-MIL-53(Al) particles can cover the large pores of the Nylon substrate (Figure S2a in the Supporting Information) to reduce the subsequent defects of the PA layer of the TFC membranes. Another reason may be that the additional -NH2 groups of the NH2-MIL-53(Al) particles and the -OH groups of CNFs react with TMC, thereby improving the cross-linking degree of the selective layer of TFC membranes. The TFC-CM0 membrane without the NH2-MIL-53(Al) particles shows a water permeance of 4.19 LMH/bar and a NaCl rejection of 88.3%.
