The resulting yellow powder was washed with water or MeOH and analyzed by PXRD, FTIR-ATR, and TGA, with an isolated amount of 111 mg.\n\nWater-Assisted Milling Synthesis of MOF-801 from 1 \n\nCompound 1 (89.5 mg, 0.0263 mmol), fumaric acid (36.66 mg, 0.315 mmol), and 50 \u03bcL of H2O were placed into a plastic jar (10 mL) with two stainless steel balls (1.38 g each). The reaction mixture was milled using the IST-500 mixer mill at 25 Hz for 90 min. The resulting white powder was washed with water or MeOH and analyzed by PXRD, FTIR-ATR, and TGA, with an isolated amount of 87 mg.\n\nWater-Assisted Milling Synthesis of MOF-804 from 1 \n\nCompound 1 (89.5 mg, 0.0263 mmol), 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid (62.58 mg, 0.315 mmol), and 50 \u03bcL of H2O were placed into a plastic jar (10 mL) with two stainless steel balls (1.38 g each). The reaction mixture was milled using the IST-500 mixer mill at 25 Hz for 90 min. The resulting yellow powder was washed with water or MeOH and analyzed by PXRD, FTIR-ATR, and TGA, with an isolated amount of 108 mg.\n\nTwo-Step Water-Assisted Milling Synthesis of UiO-66 from 1 \n\nUiO-66 was synthesized in two reaction steps. First, terephthalic acid (52.47 mg, 0.315 mmol), triethylamine (63.80 mg, 0.631 mmol), and 50 \u03bcL of H2O were placed into a Teflon jar (10 mL) and milled for 30 min at 25 Hz using two stainless steel balls (1.38 g each) and an InSolido Technologies IST-500 mixer mill. Zr12 precursor 1 (89.5 mg, 0.0263 mmol) was added afterward to this mixture and stirred for an additional 90 min. The resulting white powder (isolated 95 mg) was washed with methanol (MeOH), dried in air, and analyzed by PXRD, FTIR-ATR, and TGA.\n\n10 g Scale Mechanochemical Synthesis of UiO-66-NH2 in a Planetary Mill\n\nGram-scale mechanochemical synthesis of UiO-66-NH2 was conducted using a Fritsch Pulverisette 6 planetary mill operating at 500 rpm. Compound 1, 7.16 g, was mixed with 4.58 g of 2-aminoterephthalic acid in a 50 mL reaction vessel made of ZrO2 with three ZrO2 balls (each weighing 3 g), followed by the addition of 4 mL of water. After 90 min of milling, pale-yellow product was isolated and washed three times with a small volume of methanol, with an isolated amount of 11.3 g of UiO-66-NH2.\n\nA slightly milder technique using supercritical CO2 drying was performed for activation of UiO-66 sample using a TousimisTM Samdri PVT-30 critical point dryer (Tousimis, Rockville, MD). Supercritically dried samples were prepared in the following manner. The solvent is exchanged with absolute ethanol overnight. The ethanol-dispersed sample was transferred into the sample holder with a glass pipet and allowed to settle down overnight. The next day, excess of EtOH was pipetted out, and the sample holder was placed into a Tousimis Samdri-PVT-3D supercritical CO2 dryer. The temperature was lowered to 0 \u00b0C, and the chamber was filled with liquid CO2 (ultra-high-grade CO2 with a siphon from Air-Gas Inc. was used). The sample was soaked for 8 h total, with 5 min venting for every 2 h. The chamber was then heated to 40 \u00b0C, and the supercritical CO2 was bled off at a rate of 0.5 mL/min until the chamber reached close-to-ambient pressure. The chamber was opened, and the sample was quickly transferred into a preweighed glass sample tube which was sealed and quickly transferred to a system providing 10-4 Torr dynamic vacuum. The sample was kept under vacuum at 50 \u00b0C for 2 h and was then used for N2 adsorption measurements using a Micromeritics Tristar II instrument at 77 K.", "data": [{"meta": {"name": "[Zr6O4(OH)4(CH3COO)12]2", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "C28H52O40Ca3Er2"}, "processes": [{"synthesis method": "chemical synthesis", "precursor": [{"name": "Zirconium\u00ad(IV) propoxide", "amount": "1", "unit": "g"}, {"name": "acetic acid", "amount": "3.50", "unit": "mL"}], "solution": [{"name": "1-propanol", "amount": "70", "unit": "wt %"}, {"name": "H2O", "amount": "", "unit": ""}], "pressure": "", "temperature": "room temperature", "time": "overnight"}, {"synthesis method": "washing", "washing solution": "acetic acid", "amount": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "UiO-66-NH2", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "processes": [{"synthesis method": "mechanochemical synthesis", "precursor": [{"name": "Zr12 precursor", "amount": "64.8", "unit": "mg"}, {"name": "2-aminoterephthalic acid", "amount": "50.77", "unit": "mg"}], "solution": [{"name": "H2O", "amount": "50", "unit": "\u03bcL"}], "pressure": "", "temperature": "25 Hz", "time": "90 min"}, {"synthesis method": "washing", "washing solution": "water or MeOH", "amount": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "MOF-801", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "processes": [{"synthesis method": "mechanochemical synthesis", "precursor": [{"name": "Zr12 precursor", "amount": "89.5", "unit": "mg"}, {"name": "fumaric acid", "amount": "36.66", "unit": "mg"}], "solution": [{"name": "H2O", "amount": "50", "unit": "\u03bcL"}], "pressure": "", "temperature": "25 Hz", "time": "90 min"}, {"synthesis method": "washing", "washing solution": "water or MeOH", "amount": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "MOF-804", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "processes": [{"synthesis method": "mechanochemical synthesis", "precursor": [{"name": "Zr12 precursor", "amount": "89.5", "unit": "mg"}, {"name": "2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid", "amount": "62.58", "unit": "mg"}], "solution": [{"name": "H2O", "amount": "50", "unit": "\u03bcL"}], "pressure": "", "temperature": "25 Hz", "time": "90 min"}, {"synthesis method": "washing", "washing solution": "water or MeOH", "amount": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "UiO-66", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "processes": [{"synthesis method": "two-step mechanochemical synthesis", "precursor": [{"name": "terephthalic acid", "amount": "52.47", "unit": "mg"}, {"name": "triethylamine", "amount": "63.80", "unit": "mg"}, {"name": "Zr12 precursor", "amount": "89.5", "unit": "mg"}], "solution": [{"name": "H2O", "amount": "50", "unit": "\u03bcL"}], "pressure": "", "temperature": "25 Hz", "time": "30 min, 90 min"}, {"synthesis method": "washing", "washing solution": "methanol", "amount": ""}]}], "include_properties": ["ball_milling", "washing"]}, {"idx": "17, 18, 22", "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<p>The product after the first pass\nwas pale yellow, consistent with the color expected of UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub>.

Interestingly, UiO-66-NH2 prepared by TSE on a 100 g scale showed the best catalytic activity among all tested samples (t 1/2 is ~5 min), which is possibly due to the good dispersibility of the loosely bound particles (b) in water. The UiO-66-NH2 sample obtained from the planetary mill formed large agglomerates in the solid-state (please check the Supporting Information) and the solution, which would not disperse despite the long sonication, and that was the only tested UiO-66-NH2 sample that showed moderate hydrolytic activity under these experimental conditions.
