Both MOFs exhibit strong fluorescence, and their fluorescence responses to 12 PCBs (listed in ) have been studied. The fluorescence of BUT-174 and -175 could be quenched by all of the selected PCBs, and the fluorescence quenching is especially profound for three highly toxic non-ortho-substituted PCBs (PCB-77, -126, and -169). The limits of detection (LODs) of BUT-174 and -175 to PCB-77, -126, and -169 are estimated to be 59, 79, and 92 ppb and 70, 86, and 90 ppb, respectively.\n\nPowder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the as-synthesized MOFs matched well with the simulated patterns from single-crystal data (Figure S6), indicative of their pure phase. After being immersed in DMF, ethyl acetate (EA), and dichloromethane (DCM) for 2 days, or immersed in water for 24 h, the structures of the two MOFs remained unchanged, as suggested by the PXRD patterns (Figure S6), indicating high stability of the MOFs to the solvents. N2 adsorption measurements at 77 K were performed for BUT-174 and -175 after their as-synthesized samples were guest-exchanged with acetone and degassed under high vacuum at 90 \u00b0C for 10 h. The adsorption isotherms showed negligible N2 uptakes and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of the MOFs (Figure S7). PXRD measurements revealed that after activation the MOFs retained high crystallinity but the PXRD peaks shifted (Figure S6), which implies that the MOFs changed into pore-closed phases due to the well-known structural flexibility of interpenetrated MOFs. The TGA curves of BUT-174 and -175 showed that they started to decompose as the temperature reached 350 \u00b0C (Figure S5).\n\nFluorescence quenching titration experiments were carried out with the incremental addition of the PCB solutions to the MOF suspensions. With the addition of PCBs, the fluorescence of BUT-174 and -175 was gradually quenched (a-f and S11-S16). The fluorescence response to the analytes is instantaneous, and the process of addition of the analyte to the MOF suspension and the measurement of fluorescence spectra takes about 10 s. Noteworthily, the three highly toxic PCBs (PCB-77, -126, and -169) had higher quenching efficiencies than the other PCBs (g). The quenching efficiencies of PCB-77, -126, and -169 on BUT-174 reached 91, 88, and 92%, and those on BUT-175 were 90, 87, and 87%, respectively. The quenching efficiencies of the tested PCBs on BUT-174 followed the order PCB-169 > -77 > -126 > -4 > -14 > -118 > -28 > -101 > -52 > -153 > -138 > -180, and those on BUT-175 followed the order PCB-77 > -126 > -169 > -4 > -14 > -118 > -153 > -52 > -28 > -138 > -101 > -180 (Table S2). Meanwhile, it was confirmed that the addition of pure DMF had a limited influence on the fluorescence intensities of the two MOFs (Figure S17).\n\nTo evaluate the reproducibility and stability of sensing experiments, three sets of fluorescence titration experiments of BUT-174 for PCB-169 were carried out. The results showed that the fluorescence quenching efficiencies were close, and the standard deviations were 0.0036, 0.0014, 0.0033, and 0.0108 for each of the three measurements with 50, 100, 150, and 200 \u03bcL addition of PCB-169, respectively (Figure S18). These data suggest good reproducibility and stability of the detection method.\n\nFluorescence quenching was quantitatively fitted with the Stern-Volmer (SV) equation: (I 0/I) = 1 + K sv[Q] to better understand the relationship between the concentration of PCBs and the fluorescence intensity of MOFs, where I 0 is the fluorescence intensity of the initial MOF suspension, I is the fluorescence intensity of the MOF suspension after the addition of the PCBs, K sv is the quenching constant (M-1), and [Q] is the molar concentration of the PCBs. At low concentration ranges, the SV plots for PCB-77, -126, and -169 were nearly linear, but as the concentration of PCBs got higher, the SV plots deviated from linearity to nonlinearity (Figures S19-S21). The nonlinearity of SV plots might be attributed to the self-absorption or energy-transfer process. As shown in Table S3, the K sv values of PCB-77, -126, and -169 on BUT-174 and -175 were high, ranging from 34420 to 52280 M-1. Based on the K sv values and the standard deviations (S b) for three repeated fluorescent measurements of blank MOF suspensions (Figure S22), the LODs (3S b/K sv) of BUT-174 toward PCB-77, -126, and -169 were estimated to be 59, 79, and 92 ppb and those of BUT-175 were 70, 86, and 90 ppb, respectively.\n\nThe PCB detection experiments were also carried out in a prepared pollution sample. The waste etching solution often contained high concentrations of PCBs after the etching of printed circuit boards. A waste etching solution containing PCB-169 was prepared according to the literature; then, PCB-169 in the waste etching solution was extracted with EA and concentrated to 18 mL. The concentration of PCB-169 in the concentrated solution was estimated to be 32.1 ppb by GC-MS (Figure S46a,b). After evaporating all of the EA, 1 mL of DMF suspension of BUT-175 was added to the residue of the waste etching solution, and the fluorescence intensity of BUT-175 was quenched due to the presence of PCB-169 (Figure S46c). According to the Stern-Volmer (SV) equation mentioned above, the concentration of PCB-169 in 1 mL of DMF was calculated to be 562 ppb, close to the concentration obtained by GC-MC analysis (32.1 \u00d7 18 = 577.8 ppb), indicating the great potential of the MOFs in the detection of highly toxic PCBs in real samples.

It was found that the PCBs could quench the fluorescence of the MOFs, especially the highly toxic non-ortho-substituted or so-called \"coplanar\" PCBs.
