Thus, it was suggested that the amine-functionalized materials U6N and CE (functionalized with EDA) showed enhanced FA removal over their counterparts. In contrast, the considerable reduction in sorption capacity of amine-functionalized CD toward FA suggests that, apart from the influence of -NH2, there should be other factors, such as steric hindrance (because of the longer side chain) and pore properties, that play an important role in determining the sorption performance of MOFs and COPs.

noted that adsorption\ncapacity is significantly affected by the initial loading concentration\nof target chemicals. For the same material, adsorption capacities\nincrease in relation to increasing loading conditions. For comparison\nof the sorption capacities between different studies (or tested under\ndifferent loading conditions), we also calculated the partition coefficient\n(PC: mg g<sup>\u20131</sup> mM<sup>\u20131</sup>) for various\nadsorbents by dividing the adsorption capacity by the final concentration\nleft in the solution (). Specifically, the PCs for a solid\u2013liquid system\nindicate the ratio in the analyte concentration between solid sorbent\n[after (or before) adsorption] and the liquid phase (at equilibrium). Because the PC terms balance the concentration\neffect, the capacities can be assessed more meaningfully in terms\nof PC. Accordingly, the PC values of\nthe selected MOFs and COPs were found to be highly superior to other\ntraditional, as well as modern adsorbents tested by other researchers.\nFor instance, the test results for alumina nanoparticles coated with\nDNPH and 3D nanoporous MOF expressed in adsorption capacities were\nfar higher, by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude, than those of the MOFs/COPs\ntested in this study. However, the comparison based on PC showed completely\nreversed patterns to support that U6N or CD/CE are superior to those\nmaterials. More specifically, the calculated PC value for U6N was\n1143 mg g<sup>\u20131</sup> mM<sup>\u20131</sup>, while those\nof the modified alumina nanoparticles and 3D nanoporous MOF were only\n1.96 and 41.7 mg g<sup>\u20131</sup> mM<sup>\u20131</sup>, respectively\n().

For the same material, adsorption capacities increase in relation to increasing loading conditions. For comparison of the sorption capacities between different studies (or tested under different loading conditions), we also calculated the partition coefficient (PC: mg g-1 mM-1) for various adsorbents by dividing the adsorption capacity by the final concentration left in the solution (). Specifically, the PCs for a solid-liquid system indicate the ratio in the analyte concentration between solid sorbent [after (or before) adsorption] and the liquid phase (at equilibrium). Because the PC terms balance the concentration effect, the capacities can be assessed more meaningfully in terms of PC. Accordingly, the PC values of the selected MOFs and COPs were found to be highly superior to other traditional, as well as modern adsorbents tested by other researchers. For instance, the test results for alumina nanoparticles coated with DNPH and 3D nanoporous MOF expressed in adsorption capacities were far higher, by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude, than those of the MOFs/COPs tested in this study. However, the comparison based on PC showed completely reversed patterns to support that U6N or CD/CE are superior to those materials. More specifically, the calculated PC value for U6N was 1143 mg g-1 mM-1, while those of the modified alumina nanoparticles and 3D nanoporous MOF were only 1.96 and 41.7 mg g-1 mM-1, respectively ().

From the\nresults, a pseudo-second-order kinetic model was found to show the\nbest fit with a correlation coefficient (<italic>R</italic>\n<sup>2</sup>) value &lt;0.998. In addition, the predicted <italic>q</italic>\n<sub>e</sub> value from the pseudo-second-order kinetic model was almost\nequal to the experimentally derived maximum adsorption capacity values\n().

In contrast, the\ndecrease in rate constant value of another amine-functionalized COP\n(CD: 1.33 g mg<sup>\u20131</sup> h<sup>\u20131</sup>) should be\nascribable to the rigidity of the aliphatic chains of DETA. In summary,\nan increase in chain length of COPs could reduce the probability of\ninteraction between the \u2212NH<sub>2</sub> group of COPs with\nthe oxygen group of FA.\n</p><p>Although the observed equilibrium capacities of U6\n(0.43 mg g<sup>\u20131</sup>) and CD (0.44 mg g<sup>\u20131</sup>) were comparable to each other, the predicted <italic>k</italic>\n<sub>2</sub> value was higher in U6 (1.90 g mg<sup>\u20131</sup> h<sup>\u20131</sup>) than in CD (1.33 g mg<sup>\u20131</sup> h<sup>\u20131</sup>). This discrepancy between the k<sub>2</sub> values of U6 and CD could be explained based on their removal efficiencies\nwith respect to the time/loading rate. As shown in , U6 showed faster adsorption\nkinetics even at the initial time of the adsorption (3 h). This might\nbe possible because of its larger available surface area (1328 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup>) along with its extended pore volume\n(0.79 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup>). On the other hand, the\nactive sites on the surface of U6N gradually decreased as time passed,\nwhich stabilized the sorption capacity at higher loading conditions\n(6 and 48 h). In contrast, the sorption behavior of CD was mainly\ndependent on \u2212NH<sub>2</sub> functionalization. The rigidity\nof the longer aliphatic side chain slowed the interaction of FA with\nthe \u2212NH<sub>2</sub> groups of CD at lower loading conditions.\nHowever, at a higher loading of FA, the formation of hydrogen bond\nshould have taken place on the surface of CD. Thus, hydrogen bond formation appeared to help enhance the RE of\nCD at higher loading conditions (3 and 6 h: 35.6 and 60.8%, respectively).\nOn the basis of a study by Xiao et al., it was not possible to predict this kind of time dependent change\nin adsorption capacities from the pseudo second order kinetic model;\nthus, we concluded that U6 was able to rapidly remove aqueous phase\nFA even at a shorter contact (3 h) time than CD. For example, CD required\nat least 2 times longer contact time (i.e., 6 h: 60.8%) to reach the\nRE of U6 at 3 h (55.4 mg g<sup>\u20131</sup>).</p><p>Furthermore,\nthe <italic>C</italic> values obtained from the intraparticle diffusion\nmodel for U6N, U6, CE, and CD were 0.068, 0.003, 0.019, and 0.012,\nrespectively. It should be noted that, in the intraparticle diffusion\nmodel plot, the initial portion of the <italic>q</italic>\n<sub>\n<italic>t</italic>\n</sub> versus <italic>t</italic>\n<sup>1/2</sup> plot was\nattributed to the liquid film mass transfer, while the linear portion\nwas associated with intraparticle diffusion.

Accordingly,\nthe higher <italic>C</italic> values of U6N (0.068) and CE (0.019)\nindicated the greater contribution from the surface sorption phenomenon.\nThis result was in accordance with the corresponding <italic>K</italic>\n<sub>ID</sub> values of 0.20 and 0.19 mg/g/h<sup>0.5</sup>. Similarly,\nthe lower <italic>C</italic> value of U6 (0.003) compared to CD (0.012)\nconfirmed that the slower mass transfer of U6 should have taken place\nat a higher loading rate (linear portion). This result was also in\naccordance with the higher \u03b1 (initial adsorption rate) value\nof U6 (0.65 mg g<sup>\u20131</sup> min<sup>\u20131</sup>) than\nof CD (0.59 mg g<sup>\u20131</sup> min<sup>\u20131</sup>).

Nonetheless,\namong all of those models, the one based on the pseudo-second order\nwas found to have the best fit (&gt;<italic>R</italic>\n<sup>2</sup> = 0.995). Thus, adsorption of FA on the selected material should\nbe based on the chemical bond formation between the adsorbent and\nadsorbate.</p><p>Accordingly, the <italic>q</italic>\n<sub>max</sub> values\nfor U6N and U6 derived using the Langmuir model were 0.75 and 0.56\nmg g<sup>\u20131</sup>, respectively. However, the <italic>q</italic>\n<sub>max</sub> values for CD and CE were 1.80 and 1.26 mg g<sup>\u20131</sup>, respectively. These values were almost 3.3 and 2.9 times larger\nthan the experimentally calculated <italic>q</italic>\n<sub>e</sub> values.\nOn the other hand, the estimated <italic>R</italic>\n<sub>L</sub> values\nfor CE (0.17) and CD (0.39) were larger than those for U6 (0.14) and\nU6N (0.04). This comparison confirmed that the monolayer adsorption\nof FA on U6N was highly spontaneous and more favorable than other\nmaterials (<italic>R</italic>\n<sub>L</sub> &lt; 1). This result was\nalso verified with the obtained 1/<italic>n</italic> values from the\nFreundlich isotherm. For instance, the calculated 1/<italic>n</italic> values of U6N (0.25), U6 (0.41), CE (0.58), and CD (0.65) were between\n0 and 1 (1/<italic>n</italic> \u226a 1). On the other hand, their\ncalculated <italic>E</italic> values from the Dubinin\u2013Radushkevich\nisotherm model were 10\u2009000, 7071, 7071, and 5000 kJ mol<sup>\u20131</sup>, respectively. In this study, the E value represents\nthe transfer of free energy for 1 mol of solute from the solution\nto the adsorbent\u2019s surface. An <italic>E</italic> value &gt;8 kJ mol<sup>\u20131</sup> indicates that\nchemisorption was the predominant mechanism in accordance with the\nkinetic studies.

As such, this indicated\nthat physisorption was also responsible for the adsorption of FA on\nMOFs and COPs. Overall, according to\nthe isotherm model, adsorption of FA on the selected solid sorbent\nwas accompanied by both physisorption and chemisorption.</p>", "clean_text": "Porous materials have been identified as efficient sorbent media to remove volatile organic compounds. To evaluate their potential as adsorbents, the adsorptive removal of formaldehyde (FA) in aqueous environments was investigated using four materials, two water-stable metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) of UiO-66 (U6) and U6-NH2 (U6N) and two covalent organic polymers (COPs) with amine-functionality, CBAP-1-EDA (CE) and CBAP-1-DETA (CD). U6N exhibited the highest removal capacity of 93% (0.56 mg g-1) of the tested materials [e.g., CE (81.1%, 0.53 mg g-1) > CD (67.2%, 0.43 mg g-1) > U6 (66.9%, 0.42 mg g-1)], which was 2 times higher than that of the reference sorbent, activated carbon (AC: 50%, 0.30 mg g-1). The results of Fourier transform infrared and powder X-ray diffraction analyses confirmed the interactions between FA molecules and the amine components of the materials (U6N, CD, and CE). According to density functional theory calculations, the formation of hydrogen bonds between FA molecules and amine components was apparent and was further verified by FA/amine distance (CD: 2.83, CE: 2.88, and U6N: 2.66 \u00c5) along with enthalpy values (CD: -32.4, CE: -45.5, and U6N: -272 kJ mol-1). In case of U6, the major interactions occurred in the metal-clusters (-19.3 kJ mol-1) via electrostatic interactions (distance: 5.49 \u00c5). Furthermore, the sorption by amine-functionalized materials such as U6N is suggested to be dominated by hydrogen bonding which ultimately led to the formation of imine. If the performance of the tested materials is evaluated in terms of partition coefficient, U6N (1153 mg g-1 mM-1) is found as the outperformer in all tested subjects. Regeneration of spent MOFs/COPs was also plausible in the presence of ethanol to maintain their structural integrity even after 10 adsorption-desorption cycles. Overall, the selected MOFs/COPs were seen to have very high removal capacity for hazardous FA molecules in aqueous phase.\n\nTGA curve of U6 (Figure S3a; blue curve) showed two weight-loss steps. An initial solvent and water weight loss of ca. 20% was detected in the broad initial temperature range of 100-300 \u00b0C. The second weight-loss step of ca. 30% was observed in the temperature range of 500-600 \u00b0C, which can be ascribed to the decomposition of organic linkers. However, the TGA pattern of U6N (Figure S3a; red curve) was characterized by a relatively slow weight-loss process. Except for the water or solvent lost, the U6N MOFs did not exhibit any substantial weight loss patterns until 350 \u00b0C. Likewise, two COPs materials (CE and CD) exhibited similar weight-loss steps throughout the TGA measurements (Figure S3b). Both COPs showed evaporation of solvent and water molecules around 100 \u00b0C, and the majority of the weight-loss took place between 350 and 500 \u00b0C due to decomposition/network collapse. \n\nThe BET surface area and pore volume of U6/U6N were 1328/963 m2 g-1 and 0.79/0.58 cm3 g-1, respectively (Table S3). In the case of COPs, CE (674 m2 g-1 and 0.23 cm3 g-1) showed higher BET surface area and pore volume than CD (667 m2 g-1 and 0.32 cm3 g-1). In addition, it should be noted that the pore sizes of all four synthesized materials were similar. For instance, the adsorption average pore diameter (4V/A) of U6, U6N, CD, and CE was 1.56, 1.55, 1.90, and 1.69 nm, respectively. More specifically, the two selected MOFs followed the type I adsorption isotherm, indicating the microporous nature of the MOFs. In the type I model, the rate limiting step for sorption of guest molecules on these MOFs should be based on micropore volume rather than surface area. In short, adsorption in the MOFs was mainly monolayer adsorption. In contrast, although COPs followed the type I isotherm pattern, the adsorption track was different from that of desorption at an increased P/P 0 value (Figure S6). This result clearly indicates the heterogeneity of the pores, that is, a mixture of micro- and mesopores. In this case, at a relatively high P/P 0 value, the rate limiting factor for adsorption was capillary condensation rather than the pore filling phenomenon.\n\nFA Adsorption Studies\n\nThe adsorption performance of four porous materials tested in this study [i.e., two MOFs (U6, U6N) and two COPs (CE, CD)] was explored for aqueous FA in reference to AC. The RE (%) and adsorption capacity (mg g-1) of adsorbents are compared and presented in  and . The maximum adsorption capacity values of U6 and U6N were 0.42 and 0.56 mg g-1, respectively, while their RE values were 67 and 94%. In the case of COPs, the corresponding RE [adsorption capacity (mg g-1)] values of CE and CD were 81% (0.53) and 67% (0.43), respectively. The results indicated that the RE of FA by U6N was higher than those of U6 and CD by almost 1.4 times and was 1.8 times higher than that of AC. Overall, the sequence of adsorption capacities of the various porous materials tested for FA sorption was in the order of U6N > CE > CD > U6 > AC. Thus, it was suggested that the amine-functionalized materials U6N and CE (functionalized with EDA) showed enhanced FA removal over their counterparts. In contrast, the considerable reduction in sorption capacity of amine-functionalized CD toward FA suggests that, apart from the influence of -NH2, there should be other factors, such as steric hindrance (because of the longer side chain) and pore properties, that play an important role in determining the sorption performance of MOFs and COPs. In order to clearly understand the sorption mechanism of the selected sorbents, the acquired kinetic data were fitted to various kinetic models.\n\nResults of Kinetic Modeling Studies\n\nThe results obtained from various kinetic models are summarized in  and Figure S7. From the results, a pseudo-second-order kinetic model was found to show the best fit with a correlation coefficient (R 2) value <0.998. In addition, the predicted q e value from the pseudo-second-order kinetic model was almost equal to the experimentally derived maximum adsorption capacity values (). For instance, the estimated q e (mg g-1) values for U6N, U6, CE, and CD were 0.57, 0.43, 0.54, and 0.44 mg g-1, respectively, which were similar to the obtained q exp values of 0.56, 0.42, 0.53, and 0.43. In addition, the rate constant (k 2) value of U6N (3.13 g mg-1 h-1) was higher than that of others, which represents the effectiveness of the amine functionalization of the framework. In contrast, the decrease in rate constant value of another amine-functionalized COP (CD: 1.33 g mg-1 h-1) should be ascribable to the rigidity of the aliphatic chains of DETA. In summary, an increase in chain length of COPs could reduce the probability of interaction between the -NH2 group of COPs with the oxygen group of FA. \n\nAlthough the observed equilibrium capacities of U6 (0.43 mg g-1) and CD (0.44 mg g-1) were comparable to each other, the predicted k 2 value was higher in U6 (1.90 g mg-1 h-1) than in CD (1.33 g mg-1 h-1). This discrepancy between the k2 values of U6 and CD could be explained based on their removal efficiencies with respect to the time/loading rate. As shown in , U6 showed faster adsorption kinetics even at the initial time of the adsorption (3 h). This might be possible because of its larger available surface area (1328 m2 g-1) along with its extended pore volume (0.79 cm3 g-1). On the other hand, the active sites on the surface of U6N gradually decreased as time passed, which stabilized the sorption capacity at higher loading conditions (6 and 48 h). In contrast, the sorption behavior of CD was mainly dependent on -NH2 functionalization. The rigidity of the longer aliphatic side chain slowed the interaction of FA with the -NH2 groups of CD at lower loading conditions. However, at a higher loading of FA, the formation of hydrogen bond should have taken place on the surface of CD. Thus, hydrogen bond formation appeared to help enhance the RE of CD at higher loading conditions (3 and 6 h: 35.6 and 60.8%, respectively). On the basis of a study by Xiao et al., it was not possible to predict this kind of time dependent change in adsorption capacities from the pseudo second order kinetic model; thus, we concluded that U6 was able to rapidly remove aqueous phase FA even at a shorter contact (3 h) time than CD. For example, CD required at least 2 times longer contact time (i.e., 6 h: 60.8%) to reach the RE of U6 at 3 h (55.4 mg g-1).\n\nFurthermore, the C values obtained from the intraparticle diffusion model for U6N, U6, CE, and CD were 0.068, 0.003, 0.019, and 0.012, respectively. It should be noted that, in the intraparticle diffusion model plot, the initial portion of the q  t  versus t 1/2 plot was attributed to the liquid film mass transfer, while the linear portion was associated with intraparticle diffusion. This smaller deviation of C with respect to the origin indicated the boundary layer effect, that is, the greater the C value, the larger the boundary layer effect. Accordingly, the higher C values of U6N (0.068) and CE (0.019) indicated the greater contribution from the surface sorption phenomenon. This result was in accordance with the corresponding K ID values of 0.20 and 0.19 mg/g/h0.5. Similarly, the lower C value of U6 (0.003) compared to CD (0.012) confirmed that the slower mass transfer of U6 should have taken place at a higher loading rate (linear portion). This result was also in accordance with the higher \u03b1 (initial adsorption rate) value of U6 (0.65 mg g-1 min-1) than of CD (0.59 mg g-1 min-1). Apparently, all of the selected models were useful to meaningfully predict the adsorption kinetics of FA. Nonetheless, among all of those models, the one based on the pseudo-second order was found to have the best fit (>R 2 = 0.995). Thus, adsorption of FA on the selected material should be based on the chemical bond formation between the adsorbent and adsorbate.\n\nAccordingly, the q max values for U6N and U6 derived using the Langmuir model were 0.75 and 0.56 mg g-1, respectively. However, the q max values for CD and CE were 1.80 and 1.26 mg g-1, respectively. These values were almost 3.3 and 2.9 times larger than the experimentally calculated q e values. On the other hand, the estimated R L values for CE (0.17) and CD (0.39) were larger than those for U6 (0.14) and U6N (0.04). This comparison confirmed that the monolayer adsorption of FA on U6N was highly spontaneous and more favorable than other materials (R L < 1). This result was also verified with the obtained 1/n values from the Freundlich isotherm. For instance, the calculated 1/n values of U6N (0.25), U6 (0.41), CE (0.58), and CD (0.65) were between 0 and 1 (1/n \u226a 1). On the other hand, their calculated E values from the Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm model were 10000, 7071, 7071, and 5000 kJ mol-1, respectively. In this study, the E value represents the transfer of free energy for 1 mol of solute from the solution to the adsorbent's surface. An E value >8 kJ mol-1 indicates that chemisorption was the predominant mechanism in accordance with the kinetic studies. In contrast, the values of B from the Temkin isotherm were in the range of 0.09, 0.11, 0.31, and 0.34 kJ mol-1, respectively (except for U6, the R 2 values for this model were satisfactory). As such, this indicated that physisorption was also responsible for the adsorption of FA on MOFs and COPs. Overall, according to the isotherm model, adsorption of FA on the selected solid sorbent was accompanied by both physisorption and chemisorption.", "data": ["This model's maximum context length is 4097 tokens.

It should be noted that, although a fairly\nlarge number of studies are available on the adsorption of FA in gas\nphase, only a limited number of studies were conducted on the sorption\nof FA in aqueous phase. In light of this limitation in the database,\nwe narrowed our discussion with recognition of this constraint. The\ncommon traditional adsorbent of untreated AC (U-AC) was treated and\nmodified with amino groups (N1-AC and N2-AC). The equilibrium (after 72 h) sorption capacities of N1-AC, N2-AC,\nand U-AC were 0.14, 0.2, and 0.13 mg g<sup>\u20131</sup>, respectively.\nThe enhanced adsorption capacity of novel materials (MOFs/COPs) over\nthat of AC clearly indicated the effectiveness of amine functionalization. Nonetheless, we obtained 0.56 mg g<sup>\u20131</sup> of FA adsorption on U6N with shorter equilibration time (6 h). Accordingly,\nthe superiority of MOFs over traditional sorbents in FA removal can\nbe confirmed.

The results of our study support the significantly\nhigh potential of U6N MOF and COPs for the removal of FA in aqueous\nphase.</p>", "clean_text": "Performance Comparison of FA Sorption Capacities between Different Studies\n\nTo assess the adsorption efficiency of the selected materials in this study, we performed a comparative analysis of the sorption capacity of materials tested between different studies (). It should be noted that, although a fairly large number of studies are available on the adsorption of FA in gas phase, only a limited number of studies were conducted on the sorption of FA in aqueous phase. In light of this limitation in the database, we narrowed our discussion with recognition of this constraint. The common traditional adsorbent of untreated AC (U-AC) was treated and modified with amino groups (N1-AC and N2-AC). The equilibrium (after 72 h) sorption capacities of N1-AC, N2-AC, and U-AC were 0.14, 0.2, and 0.13 mg g-1, respectively. The enhanced adsorption capacity of novel materials (MOFs/COPs) over that of AC clearly indicated the effectiveness of amine functionalization. Nonetheless, we obtained 0.56 mg g-1 of FA adsorption on U6N with shorter equilibration time (6 h). Accordingly, the superiority of MOFs over traditional sorbents in FA removal can be confirmed. Recently, Afkhami et al. reported that alumina nanoparticles coated with DNPH could be used as a sorbent for removal of FA from water. At an initial FA concentration of 250 ppm, the RE was 97% (411 mg g-1) (after 1 h). They conducted experiments at a significantly higher concentration than ours (0.2 ppm) to observe a much shorter duration of removal than that of the present study. It should be noted that DNPH has been commonly used as a capture medium for FA, because it exhibits excessive affinity toward FA. As such, the performance was studied at significantly high concentrations of FA. Likewise, a 3D nanoporous MOF [[Zn4O(C24H15N6O6)2(H2O)2]\u22c56H2O\u22c5DMF] n  (called: 1) was synthesized and used for absorptive removal of FA at an initial concentration of 100 ppm. The adsorption capacity of 1 was 75 mg g-1 for aqueous FA.\n\nRecycling of Adsorbents\n\nThe reusability of adsorbents is considered as one of the most important criteria for commercial application of sorbents. In fact, this aspect is directly related to the cost effectiveness of adsorbents or adsorption processes. To learn more about this issue, we performed and investigated the sorption behavior of aqueous FA over 10 adsorption-desorption cycles. The results were then used to evaluate the regenerability of the selected adsorbents. It is worth mentioning that the main mechanism for the adsorption of FA tested at low concentrations in this work (0.2 ppm) by amine functionalized materials should be the hydrogen bond formation. (Refer to adsorption mechanism section.) Therefore, the regeneration of the spent material was found to be easier. Accordingly, U6N was shown to have a better regeneration capability than all of the other materials. For instance, the regenerability of sorbents, if assessed in terms of FA sorption efficiency, indicated the superiority of U6N, because its values for the 1st and 10th cycles were 92 and 80%, respectively. Apart from U6N, the values were CE [82% (1st)-70% (10th)] < U6 [70 (1st)-55% (10th)] < CD [65% (1st)-55% (10th)] (CD) ().\n\nThe linear plot of RE versus number of regeneration cycles indicated that COPs maintain good consistency in RE relative to MOFs (Figure S11). This can be easily verified from the slope values, that is, the smaller the slope value, the smaller the change in RE. For instance, the slope value of CD was -0.9918 whereas that for U6 was -1.1204; thus, compared to U6, CD showed lesser change in the RE between the 1st and 10th adsorption-desorption cycles. Here, the negative value indicates the RE decreases with increase in the number of regeneration cycles. From the intercept values of the linear plot, the overall variations in RE of all tested materials (i.e., U6, U6N, CD, and CE) toward FA, when measured over ten regeneration cycles, can be estimated as 68, 92, 67, and 80%, respectively.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe adsorption-based removal of FA in aqueous phase was investigated using two classes of novel porous materials, MOFs and COPs, at ambient conditions. All of these tested materials were found to be significantly powerful sorbents to capture FA efficiently from water. In particular, comparison of the adsorption capacities for the four tested materials confirmed that U6N (amino-U6) had the best adsorption capacity (93% and 0.56 mg g-1) of the materials tested concurrently [e.g., CE (81.1%, 0.53 mg g-1) > CD (67.2%, 0.43 mg g-1) > U6 (66.9%, 0.42 mg g-1)] at 24 h. Comparison of the adsorption capacity data showed that some materials tested previously by others (e.g., modified alumina nanoparticles and 3D nanoporous MOF) had the maximum values. However, evaluation of the adsorption potential, in terms of the PC, confirmed that U6N was the best sorbent with the highest PC value of 1143 mg g-1 mM-1, while those of modified alumina nanoparticles and 3D nanoporous MOF were only 1.96 and 41.7 mg g-1 mM-1, respectively. The bifunctional acid-base characteristics [e.g., Lewis acid (Zr-sites) and Bronsted base (-NH2 sites)] of U6N should be responsible for its superior FA removal performance. In summary, metal-clusters were able to form electrostatic interactions (>5 \u00c5) with FA molecules, while the NH2 portions of ligands were capable of forming hydrogen bonding (>2.6 \u00c5) with them. On the other hand, as the loading of FA on the U6 was found to be less favorable (-19.3 kJ mol-1), further loading of FA on the metal-clusters resulted in lattice distortion (+93.4 kJ mol-1). The pseudo-second-order model showed the best fit for the sorption processes of FA (R 2 = >0.99) for all of the selected adsorbents. The Temkin and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm models indicated that adsorption of FA on the selected adsorbents was accompanied by both physisorption and chemisorption. This synergetic mechanism was also verified with the help of DFT calculations. Finally, regeneration of the spent sorbent was found to be easy, confirming their potential for practical application in removal of FA in water.
