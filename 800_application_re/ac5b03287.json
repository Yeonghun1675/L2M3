As shown in A, the diffraction peaks around 9.18\u00b0, 18.43\u00b0, 23.72\u00b0 and 31.11\u00b0 were observed, which corresponded to the (100), (200), (111), and (121) planes, respectively. This result was coincident with that of the previously reported MOF, indicating the synthesized (Fe-P) n -MOF exhibited well-recognized crystalline diffraction patterns. The N2 adsorption-desorption cueves of (Fe-P) n -MOF showed the typical type I isotherm (B), which sharply increased at low relative pressure, suggesting that the micropores were dominant. The surface area of (Fe-P) n -MOF was determined to be 279 m2 g-1 by the Brunanuer-Emmer-Teller (BET) method, which was beneficial to the formation of the catalytic interface. The structure of (Fe-P) n -MOF was characterized with FT-IR (C). Compared to TCPP (curve a), (Fe-P) n -MOF showed a downshift of the C\ue5fbO stretch from 1701 to 1675 cm-1, an intense fingerprint of Fe-N stretching at 1008 cm-1 and the disappearance of N-H in-plane bending vibration at 967 cm-1 (curve b), reflecting the metalation of porphyrin ring with iron. Meanwhile, (Fe-P) n -MOF, similar to TCPP, exhibited the characteristic peaks for big ring skeleton absorption at 1606, 1562, and 1401 cm-1, and benzene ring at 866 and 796 cm-1. This result indicated the (Fe-P) n -MOF maintained the pyrrole ring structure of TCPP. The modification of (Fe-P) n -MOF with AuNPs was characterized with UV-vis absorption spectra (D). The absorption spectrum of (Fe-P) n -MOF showed an intense Soret band at 426 nm (curve b), which was attributed to the coordination reaction between iron atoms and porphyrin. After further modification with AuNPs, an absorption peak at 520 nm appeared (curve c), suggesting the successful modification of AuNPs on (Fe-P) n -MOF.\n\nThe steady-state kinetic assay of the (Fe-P) n -MOF in the catalytic system of TMB and H2O2 showed a Michaelis constant (K m) value of 1.27 mM with H2O2 as the substrate (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), which was smaller than 3.70 mM of HRP and 2.74 mM of hemin, suggesting that the (Fe-P) n -MOF had higher affinity to H2O2 than HRP and hemin. Moreover, the K m value of (Fe-P) n -MOF with TMB as the substrate was calculated to be 0.63 mM, which was close to 0.434 mM of HRP and much smaller than 4.84 mM of hemin, suggesting that the (Fe-P) n -MOF had also a high affinity to TMB mediator. \n\nStability of (Fe-P) n -MOF\n\nA favorable mimic enzyme should process good catalytic ability in broad conditions. After the natural enzyme (HRP), common mimic (hemin) and (Fe-P) n -MOF modified SPCEs were exposed to different pHs ranging from 3 to 10 (A) and temperatures ranging from 4 to 60 \u00b0C (B) for 2 h, their relative activities were measured in the detection solution. After exposure to pH 3.0 and 10.0 solution for 2 h, the catalytic activity of (Fe-P) n -MOF could remain of 62.3% and 41.9%, respectively (curve a), while the HRP and hemin remained only 1.3% and 18.6% of their activity at pH 3.0, and 11.6% and 20.8% of their activity at pH 10.0, respectively (curves b and c). The effect of the temperature on its stability showed similar phenomena. In the temperature range of 4-60 \u00b0C, the (Fe-P) n -MOF was stable and remained at 87% of its activity at 60 \u00b0C (curve a), but HRP and hemin showed narrow temperature ranges for their remaining activity and remained at 22% and 47% of their activity at 60 \u00b0C, respectively (curves b and c). Obviously, (Fe-P) n -MOF was more favorable in a wider range of pH and temperature than HRP and hemin that were very sensitive to pH and temperature, suggesting that (Fe-P) n -MOF had a great potential application in bioanalysis.\n\nFeasibility of Sensing Method\n\nIn the presence of 100 nM Pb2+, the electrochemical sensor showed a decay curve for the plot of current (I) vs time (t) in 0.1 M pH 5.5 HAc-NaAc buffer containing 0.89 mM TMB and 0.61 mM H2O2 at +100 mV (vs Ag/AgCl reference electrode), which rapidly reached the steady-state current (~672 nA) within 20 s, and the steady-state current was ~24 times higher than that in the absence of Pb2+ (~28 nA) (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). This result could be contributed to the fact that the Pb2+ activated GR-5 to cleave the substrate strand into two DNA fragments at the ribonucleotide (rA) site, and the short (Fe-P) n -MOF-linked oligonucleotide fragment hybridized with the immobilized HP at the sensor surface, which led to the linkage of the (Fe-P) n -MOF to the sensor surface to catalyze the oxidation of TMB by H2O2 and the electrochemical reduction of the oxidation product on the sensor surface, as shown in . The catalytic current increased greatly the sensitivity for detection of Pb2+.\n\nDetection of Pb2+ \n\nUnder optimal sensing conditions, the chronoamperometric response of the obtained sensor in 0.1 M pH 5.5 HAc-NaAc buffer containing 0.89 mM TMB and 0.61 mM H2O2 at +100 mV increased with the increasing concentration of Pb2+ (A). The calibration plot showed a good linear relationship between the chronoamperometric response and the logarithm (log) value of Pb2+ concentration ranging from 0.05 to 200 nM with a correlation coefficient of 0.9994. The detection limit for Pb2+ was experimentally found to be 0.034 nM (3\u03b4), which was at least 350 times lower than that of 10 \u03bcg L-1 in drinking water permitted by World Health Organization. The detection limits of the proposed and previously reported sensors were compared in Table S1.
