The adsorption amount of d- and l-methyl-lactate for d-SURchirMOF-4 was ~2.08 (M D) and ~3.54 (M L) \u03bcg/cm2, respectively (a). The different adsorption showed an important enantioselective adsorption for one enantiomer methyl-lactate in SURchirMOF-4. When we applied the equation \"ee % = (M L - M D)/(M D + M L) \u00d7 100\" for analyzing the enantioselectivity, the enantioselectivity ee % of SURchirMOF-4 for methyl-lactate was found to be 26%.

Recently, scientists have reported a ligand-exchange approach\nto form a chiral zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) powder for CPL. However, such a ligand-exchange approach usually\ncannot exchange the ligand completely and the powder form of ZIF is\nalso not convenient in the practical CPL application. Therefore, the\nin-situ epitaxial growth of MOF thin films for CPL is a promising\nmaterial for CPL application. Herein, we investigate the CPL of the <sc>d</sc>- and <sc>l</sc>-SURMOF-4 grown on quartz glasses. Different\nhandedness CPL signals () could be observed and the relative CPL signals were at \u223c330\nnm.

The photoluminescence (b and S6) showed that SURchirMOF-4 displayed a similar intense fluorescence with the maximum emissions at 390, 410, and 432 nm when it was excited at 365 nm, which were similar to the UV-vis absorption spectra (Figures S7 and S8). The CD data recorded for SURchirMOFs [Zn2(Dcam)2DAP] n  (d-SURchirMOF-4) and [Zn2(Lcam)2DAP] n  (l-SURchirMOF-4) were shown in c. The CD spectra showed four negative bands at 243, 271, 335, and 395 nm and two positive bands at 249 and 307 nm for d-SURchirMOF-4 fabricated exclusively with enantiopure Dcam and DAP. Moreover, the enantiomeric pairs show dichroic absorption of an equal in magnitude but opposite signal.\n\nCPL is a unique property used to evaluate the chirality of chiral materials. Recently, scientists have reported a ligand-exchange approach to form a chiral zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) powder for CPL. However, such a ligand-exchange approach usually cannot exchange the ligand completely and the powder form of ZIF is also not convenient in the practical CPL application. Therefore, the in-situ epitaxial growth of MOF thin films for CPL is a promising material for CPL application. Herein, we investigate the CPL of the d- and l-SURMOF-4 grown on quartz glasses. Different handedness CPL signals () could be observed and the relative CPL signals were at ~330 nm. The results display that the CPL signals of d- and l-SURchirMOF-4 were opposite. The corresponding g lum factors (Figure S9) were ~3 \u00d7 10-3 and -8 \u00d7 10-3 for d- and l-SURchirMOF-4, respectively.\n\nTo further study the chiral recognition of d- and l-SURchirMOF-4, the adsorption performance of enantiomers can be carried out in this work. A gas phase QCM technology has been developed for investigating the enantioselectivity of homochiral MOF thin films, which can monitor mass changes with nanogram by detecting the change of resonance frequency. The d- and l-SURchirMOF-4 thin films were grown on Au-coated QCM sensors. The thickness of d-SURchirMOF-4 was measured by cross-section SEM and was about 320 nm (Figure S10). A pair of enantiomers d- and l-methyl-lactate was selected as the chiral probe molecules for studying their enantioselectivity. The related adsorption amount of d and l-methyl-lactate for d-SURchirMOF-4 and l-SURchirMOF-4 were carried out respectively, which were shown in . The adsorption amount of d- and l-methyl-lactate for d-SURchirMOF-4 was ~2.08 (M D) and ~3.54 (M L) \u03bcg/cm2, respectively (a). The different adsorption showed an important enantioselective adsorption for one enantiomer methyl-lactate in SURchirMOF-4. When we applied the equation \"ee % = (M L - M D)/(M D + M L) \u00d7 100\" for analyzing the enantioselectivity, the enantioselectivity ee % of SURchirMOF-4 for methyl-lactate was found to be 26%. With the same measurement, the probe enantiomers of d/l-methyl-lactate were used for studying the enantioselective adsorption of l-SURchirMOF-4. The recorded data (b) showed that the adsorption amounts of d- and l-methyl-lactate were ~3.62 (M D) and ~2.02 (M L) \u03bcg/cm2 for l-SURchirMOF-4, respectively.
