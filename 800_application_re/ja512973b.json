In this series, NU-1103 has a pore volume of 2.91 cc g-1 and a geometrically calculated surface area of 5646 m2 g-1, which is the highest value reported to date for a zirconium-based MOF and among the largest that have been reported for any porous material. Successful activation of the MOFs was proven based on the agreement of pore volumes and BET areas obtained from simulated and experimental isotherms. Critical for practical applications, NU-1103 combines for the first time ultrahigh surface area and water stability, where this material retained complete structural integrity after soaking in water. Pressure range selection for the BET calculations on these materials was guided by the four so-called \"consistency criteria\". The experimental BET area of NU-1103 was 6550 m2 g-1. Insights obtained from molecular simulation suggest that, as a consequence of pore-filling contamination, the BET method overestimates the monolayer loading of NU-1103 by ~16%.\n\nOne key limitation in exploiting ultrahigh surface area in practical applications of MOFs has been their lack of water (or moisture) stability. For example, it is often advantageous for materials to be stable toward oxygen and moisture during material processing (e.g., pellet formation). To date, ultrahigh surface area MOFs have been based exclusively on Zn4O or Cu2 metal-based clusters with linkers containing carboxylate groups, which unfortunately lose crystallinity and surface area when exposed to moisture. Herein, we utilize the isoreticular expansion approach to synthesize a series of water stable zirconium-oxo/hydroxo cluster-based MOFs, NU-1101 through NU-1104, based on the ftw topology. One of these MOFs, NU-1103, which has a geometric surface area of 5646 m2 g-1 (and BET area of 6550 m2 g-1), exhibits the highest geometric surface area (and BET area) reported for any zirconium oxocluster containing MOF.\n\nIt is noteworthy that inconsistencies in the application of the consistency criteria, for comparison of materials based on their reported BET areas, may be problematic for these and other materials with ultrahigh surface areas. In order to circumvent this issue and benchmark target materials properly, we have calculated surface areas geometrically using a rolling-probe method, which is independent of the nitrogen isotherm and the BET theory. The calculated geometric surface areas for NU-1101 through NU-1104 are shown in Table , along with the calculated geometric surface areas for other ultrahigh surface area MOFs. Somewhat pleasingly, NU-1103 exhibits a calculated geometric surface area of 5646 m2 g-1, a value which is only 10% lower than the current record holder (NU-110).\n\nThe thermal stability of NU-1101 through NU-1104 was assessed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results revealed that all the materials are stable at elevated temperature, having decomposition temperatures around 470 \u00b0C (see  section S8.). The TGA of the solvated samples all show significant weight loss due to guest solvent molecules in the cavity prior to 200 \u00b0C, consistent with the highly porous nature of these materials.\n\nThe porosity of the NU-110x series rises as the linker length increases, and the observed pore volumes are 1.72, 2.00, 2.91, and 2.79 cc g-1 for NU-1101, NU-1102, NU-1103, and NU-1104, respectively. The pore size distribution, calculated from nitrogen isotherms with the BJH desorption model, also agrees well with the simulated data. Each MOF showed two types of pores, which were anticipated from the crystal structures, i.e., a larger pore centered at (1/2,1/2,1/2) and a smaller centered at (1/2,0,0). Similar to the pore volume, the pore sizes also become larger with increasing linker length. The size of the larger pore was found to increase from 17.2 to 24.2 \u00c5 throughout the series, while the size of the smaller pore is 9.5-13.5 \u00c5. These pore sizes range from microporous (<20 \u00c5) to mesoporous (\u226520 \u00c5) and are consistent with the observed steps in the N2 isotherms of NU-1103 and NU-1104.\n\nSimilar deviations from the consistency criteria were observed when applying BET calculations to simulated isotherms, with similar tolerances needed to satisfy the criteria. Therefore, to calculate an apparent BET area for each of these materials, we chose the pressure range that satisfied the largest number of criteria and minimized the error for any criterion not satisfied (see  Table S9.1). From the measured (simulated) isotherms we obtained BET areas of 4340 (4350), 4830 (4730), 6550 (6860), and 6230 (6262) m2 g-1. Notice that the application of the consistency criteria as guidelines to select the pressure range for BET calculation allowed a consistent comparison between measured and simulated values. On these grounds, the agreement of the BET areas obtained from simulated versus measured isotherms (in addition to pore volumes and PXRDs) indicates the successful activation of the materials and further confirms that it is possible to achieve ultrahigh surface areas in water-stable zirconium-based MOFs, as demonstrated by the isoreticular expansion in the NU-110x series.\n\nWith 5646 m2g-1, NU-1103 possesses the highest geometric surface area (and a BET area of 6550 m2 g-1) yet reported for a water-stable MOF. This record-breaking property renders NU-1103 attractive for practical applications such as hydrogen storage, as it simultaneously addresses the well-known need for high capacity and the much less well appreciated, but equally important, issue of stability in the presence of contaminants.
