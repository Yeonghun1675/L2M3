In this study, an efficient carbon-supporting strategy is developed to enhance the ORR efficiency of the ZIF-derived Fe/N/Carbon catalysts by increasing the accessible active site density. The enhancement lies in (i) improving the accessibility of active sites via converting dodecahedral particles to graphene-like layered materials and (ii) enhancing the density of FeNx active sites via suppressing the formation of nanoparticles as well as providing extra spaces to host active sites. The optimized and efficient Fe/N/Carbon catalyst shows a half-wave potential (E 1/2) of 0.834 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in acidic media and produces a peak power density of 0.66 W cm-2 in an air-fed PEMFC at 2 bar backpressure, outperforming most previously reported Pt-free ORR catalysts. Finally, the general applicability of the carbon-supporting strategy is confirmed using five different commercial carbon blacks. This work provides an effective route to derive Fe/N/Carbon catalysts exhibiting a higher power density in PEMFCs.\n\nIn the current work, we introduced an effective and facile carbon-supporting strategy to convert the dodecahedral particles to graphene-like layered structures to expose the interior active sites. This was realized by adding carbon black, for example, KJ600, in ZIF-8 synthesis. The KJ600 carbon black prevents the reassembling of cracked ZIF fragments and thus promotes the formation of dispersive graphene-like layered structures in the pyrolysis process. Additionally, the addition of porous KJ600 carbon black suppresses the formation of nanoparticles and provides extra spaces to host the active sites. Owing to the aforementioned advantages, the density of accessible active sites of the as-prepared catalytic materials (denoted as KJ-Fe/N/Carbon) increased to 4.8-fold of the reference sample, thus nearly 4-fold improvement of ORR mass activity was attained at 0.85 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The optimized KJ-Fe/N/Carbon cathode produced a peak power density (PPD) of 1.28 and 0.66 W cm-2 in oxygen and an air-fed PEMFC at 2 bar backpressure, respectively, outperforming most of previously reported PGM-free ORR catalysts. Finally, the general applicability of the carbon-supporting strategy was confirmed using five different commercial carbon blacks.\n\nFe/N/Carbon and KJ-Fe/N/Carbon catalysts were then analyzed via Ar adsorption/desorption isotherms. a shows that the Fe/N/Carbon catalyst exhibits a type-I profile, indicating a large number of micropores and relatively small external surfaces. In comparison, the KJ-Fe/N/Carbon catalyst shows a typical type-IV isotherm along with a H3-type hysteresis loop, indicating the existence of mesopores. The decreased adsorption dose at a smaller relative pressure region (0 < P/P 0 < 0.05) displays the decreased micropore volume, while the quick increase of Ar adsorption at a greater relative pressure region (0.9 < P/P 0 < 1) implies the characteristics of macropores and large outer surfaces (multi-layer adsorption). The mesopore and macropore analyses are further confirmed by detailed Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore structure analysis between 2 and 100 nm (Figure S4). Quantitatively, compared with the Fe/N/Carbon catalyst, KJ-Fe/N/Carbon manifests a lower micropore (125 vs 435 m2 g-1, b) but a higher mesopore surface area (405 vs 216 m2 g-1). These obtained results are in good agreement with TEM observations. Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy and XRD were conducted to analyze the defect of the carbon matrix and crystal structures (phase information) of as-synthesized catalysts. The two peaks located at ca. 1350 and 1590 cm-1 could be allocated to the D band (defects) and G band (graphitization), respectively. KJ-Fe/N/Carbon has a higher I D/I G ratio of 1.02 than Fe/N/Carbon of 0.76 (Figure S5). The 34% higher I D/I G ratio indicates more defects. Carbon defects are considered to be active to the ORR and benefit the formation of active sites, for example, FeN x . Figure S6 compares the XRD patterns of the two catalysts; both manifest two broad peaks at ca. 26 and 44\u00b0, associated with graphitic carbon. No prominent peaks associated with Fe nanoparticles are observed. This is because the lower quantity of Fe in the Fe/N/Carbon catalyst (1.71 wt %, measured by ICP-OES, Table S2) is insensitive to the XRD. The Fe content in the KJ-Fe/N/Carbon catalyst increases to 2.82 wt %. However, most Fe species have a FeN x  structure rather than nanoparticles, which are evidenced by HR-TEM images (Figure S7).\n\nFor investigating the catalyst's surface chemistry, an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study was conducted. Figure S8 displays the XPS spectra of KJ-Fe/N/Carbon and Fe/N/Carbon catalysts. The element contents of C, N, O, Fe, and Zn are calculated and presented in Table S3. The Fe quantity in the KJ-Fe/N/Carbon catalyst is calculated as 4.82 wt % in the XPS survey, much higher than that calculated in the reference Fe/N/Carbon sample (2.63 wt %). XPS is a surface-sensitive characterization method with a detected depth of only several nanometers. The higher Fe quantity on the catalyst surface suggests a higher density of FeNx active sites. Nitrogen species on the surface can be deconvoluted into pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, and graphitic-N at 398.5, 400.2, and 401.2 eV, respectively (c). The deconvolution parameters are shown in Table S4. The surface element content is estimated to be 3.45, 1.34, and 2.26 wt % in the synthesized Fe/N/Carbon catalyst, respectively (d). The KJ-Fe/N/Carbon catalyst shows a 21% higher pyridinic-N content (4.18 wt %), 33% higher pyrrolic-N (1.78 wt %), and 24% lower graphitic-N content (1.71 wt %). In previous literature, researchers believed that pyridinic-N constitutes FeNx active sites. The greater pyridinic-N portion in the KJ-Fe/N/Carbon sample further suggests more intensive active sites.\n\nTo verify the increased performance of catalysts, the electrochemical properties of the resulting catalytic materials were estimated by rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) measurements in Ar- and O2-saturated (0.1 M H2SO4) electrolytes at 30 \u00b0C. As expected, the KJ-Fe/N/Carbon catalyst fabricated at 950 \u00b0C shows the best ORR activity (Figure S9). a shows that the KJ-Fe/N/Carbon catalyst displays an E 1/2 of 0.834 V, higher than the Fe/N/Carbon (E 1/2 = 0.793 V), suggesting a greater ORR efficiency of the KJ-Fe/N/Carbon catalyst. b compares the ORR selectivity of two catalyst samples with the hydroperoxide (H2O2) yield and the number of electron transfer (n) as the indicators. Both the catalysts remain below 2% of the H2O2 yield in the potential range 0.2-0.9 V, and the relatively lower H2O2 yield and higher number of electron transfers of KJ-Fe/N/Carbon indicate a greater proportion of the 4e-ORR process. Figure S10 displays the Tafel slope of KJ-Fe/N/Carbon and Fe/N/Carbon catalysts. The similar Tafel slope of ca. 60 mV/dec indicates the same reaction mechanism and active site moieties, consistent with the EXAFS analyses. The intrinsic ORR efficiency of Fe/N/Carbon catalysts is mainly examined through active site structure and density. Owing to the similar active site structure, the observed higher ORR efficiency of the KJ-Fe/N/Carbon catalyst could be attributed to the higher ASD. To confirm the hypothesis, the ASD of catalysts was quantified by the previously reported nitrite stripping method, in which the integrated charge of nitrite reduction is utilized for calculating the number of accessible active sites. c,d shows the cyclic voltammetry curves of KJ-Fe/N/Carbon and Fe/N/Carbon catalysts in the absence and presence of nitrite adsorption. The KJ-Fe/N/Carbon catalyst represents a higher integrated charge of nitrite reduction and thus has a higher ASD. Quantitatively, the ASD of the KJ-Fe/N/Carbon catalyst reaches 58.5 \u03bcmol g-1 (e), which is 4.8-fold of the Fe/N/Carbon catalyst (12.3 \u03bcmol g-1). This result agrees well with the enhanced ORR mass activity of KJ-Fe/N/Carbon than with that of the Fe/N/Carbon catalyst (f, 5.02 vs 1.01 A g-1 at 0.85 vs RHE, calculated by the K-L equation).", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "Fe/N/Carbon", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "density of accessible active sites", "value": "4.8", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "ORR mass activity", "value": "5.02", "unit": "A g^\u20131", "condition": "at 0.85 vs RHE"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "Fe/N/Carbon", "symbol": "KJ", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "density of accessible active sites", "value": "12.3", "unit": "\u03bcmol g^\u20131", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "ORR mass activity", "value": "1.01", "unit": "A g^\u20131", "condition": "at 0.85 vs RHE"}]}]], "include_properties": ["etc"]}, {"idx": "18, 20", "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<p>To evaluate the practical performance of the catalysts in the real-world\nenergy devices, the H<sub>2</sub>\u2013O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>-air PEMFC tests were carried out. a plots the polarization and the power density\ncurves (without iR-free) of the two catalysts in the H<sub>2</sub>\u2013O<sub>2</sub> PEMFC.
