The morphology evolution in the synthetic process upon reaction time and amount of raw materials were investigated in detail. The as-synthesized starfish-shaped porous Co3O4/ZnFe2O4 composites were studied as an electrode material for supercapacitors showing good capacitive performances. Their specific capacitance can reach as high as 326 F g-1 at 1 A g-1. The rational combination of components with different potential windows in a composite material enables a wide overall potential range resulting in the highest energy density of 82.5 Wh kg-1, significantly larger than that of the single components. Magnetic measurements show that the system presents a large coercivity and high squareness (at 1.8 K, H c = 884 Oe and M r/M s = 0.52) with respect to the individual components, which may be attributed to the unique morphology of Co3O4/ZnFe2O4, as well as surface and interface exchange coupling effects. Materials with this novel design and fabrication may show promise for potential applications in electrochemical energy storage and magnetic devices.\n\nIn the past decade, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have received intensive attention because of their large specific area, ultrahigh porosity, and various applications, including gas storage/separation, in catalysis, as chemical sensors, and so on. Inspired by their diverse configurations, scientists have utilized MOF materials as precursors or templates to explore a novel path preparing porous nanomaterials for energy storage systems. For example, Guo et al. prepared porous Co3O4 material by a simple solid-state thermolysis of the Co-based MOF, which displayed a specific capacitance of 150 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 in 2 M KOH electrolyte. Moreover, porous ZnO/ZnFe2O4/C octahedra can be fabricated using MOF as both the precursor and the self-sacrificing template showed greatly enhanced performance of Li+ storage when tested as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. \n\nHerein we report a stepwise strategy to design and fabricate novel starfish-shaped porous Co3O4/ZnFe2O4 hollow nanocomposites from MOF precursors as supercapacitor electrode material forming a wide potential window from -0.85 to 0.50 V (vs Hg/HgO in 6 M KOH). In the starfish-shaped structure, the Co3O4 nanocages act as the \"starfish head\" and porous nanotubes composed of ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles from the partial Fe(III) substituted MOF-5 (FeIII-MOF-5) act as the \"starfish arms\". The nanocomposite showed the specific capacitance as high as 326.7 F g-1, while its energy density reached 82.5 Wh K g-1 at the power density of 675 W kg-1 due to the enlarged potential window. All these results are significantly promoted from those of the individual components. Meanwhile, we ran the magnetic measurements for the as-synthesized Co3O4/ZnFe2O4 composites revealing it to be with much larger magnetic hysteresis loops at 1.8 K compared with ZnFe2O4. On account of these discoveries, our starfish-shaped porous Co3O4/ZnFe2O4 hollow nanocomposites are believed to have potential applications in electrochemical energy storage and magnetic devices.\n\nThe nitrogen adsorption and desorption measurements were performed to estimate the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and pore size distribution of the porous Co3O4/ZnFe2O4 hollow nanostructures. As shown in Figure , the isotherm of the porous Co3O4/ZnFe2O4 nanocomposites exhibits a hysteresis loop at p/p 0 of 0.6, indicating the presence of mesopores. The BET specific surface area of the starfish-shaped porous Co3O4/ZnFe2O4 nanostructure was calculated to be 46.2 m2 g-1. The pore-size distribution (Figure , inset) reveals a narrow unimodal distribution centered at 10 nm, which can be attributed to the porous shell. The results are in good agreement with the value determined from the high-magnification TEM images, as discussed above.\n\nTo learn about the charge storage capacity of the electrodes, galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements were carried out at current densities from 1 to 10 A g-1, as shown in Figure . Both Co3O4 and ZnFe2O4 curves are quite symmetric during charge and discharge process, indicating reversible redox reactions and good pseudocapacitive feature. In Figure c, the discharge curve of Co3O4/ZnFe2O4 electrode is significantly longer than the previous two electrodes, representing a higher specific capacitance. All the platforms in the charge and discharge curves match well with the peaks shown in the CV (Figure ).\n\nThe highest specific capacitance obtained for Co3O4/ZnFe2O4 is 326.7 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, which is much higher than that of the Co3O4 (142 F g-1) and ZnFe2O4 (112 F g-1). The rate performances for electrodes at various current densities from 1 to 10 A g-1 are shown in Figure d. The specific capacitance of Co3O4/ZnFe2O4 from the discharge curves at larger current density of 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 A g-1 can be further calculated to be 254.5, 211.4, 189, 169 F g-1, respectively. The capacitance of Co3O4, ZnFe2O4, and Co3O4/ZnFe2O4 electrodes exhibit 42.2%, 50%, and 51.8% retention from 1 to 10 A g-1, due to the relatively slow faradic reactions.\n\nWith all these data, we calculate the single electrode energy density (E) and power density (P) from the energy density equation mentioned in introduction and following power density equation:    P =   E   \u0394 t     where \u0394t represents the electrode discharge time. The resulting energy and power densities ranging from 1 to 10 A g-1 are displayed in the Ragone plots of Figure a. With the potential window enlarged to 1.35 V, the energy density of the Co3O4/ZnFe2O4 electrode can reach 82.5 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 675 W kg-1, significantly enhanced from the pure Co3O4 (17.8 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 250 W kg-1) and ZnFe2O4 (40.4 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 722.5 W kg-1) electrodes. Notably, the energy density of Co3O4/ZnFe2O4 still retained 44.3 Wh kg-1 with the power density as high as 6750 W kg-1. The high power density with no massive energy density loss indicates that Co3O4/ZnFe2O4 has potential application in the smart supercapacitor field. \n\nThe long-term cycle stability of supercapacitors is another key factor in practical use. As shown in Figure b, the cycling lifetime tests of 1000 cycles for Co3O4, ZnFe2O4 and Co3O4/ZnFe2O4 electrodes were carried out at 10 A g-1. We can see the specific capacitance retention of 67.5%, 84.7%, and 80.7% was achieved after 1000 cycles. ZnFe2O4 showed the best retention among the three electrodes. With the presence of ZnFe2O4, Co3O4/ZnFe2O4's cycling ability was dramatically improved from the pure Co3O4 electrode. It is worth noting that the charge/discharge curves are still symmetric after 1000 cycles test, indicating no significant structural changes of the Co3O4/ZnFe2O4 electrode during the charge/discharge processes.\n\nElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to further monitor the supercapacitors electrodes made of Co3O4, ZnFe2O4, and Co3O4/ZnFe2O4 in the frequency range from 105 to 10-2 Hz.\n\nIn Figure , the Nyquist plots of all electrodes are composed of a semicircle in the high frequency range and an oblique line in the low frequency range. Generally, the intercept in the Z' axis represents the solution resistance, R s, composed of the resistance of the electrolyte solution, the contact resistance at the interface between the current collector and the electroactive materials; and the diameter of the semicircle is approximately equal to the charge transfer resistance, R ct, through the electrode/electrolyte interface. Electrode equivalent circuits can be simulated from the EIS data shown in the inset of Figure , and besides R s and R ct, it also includes a capacitor, C p, and a constant phase element CPE. In this equivalent circuit mode, the R s of the three electrodes are close to each other due to the same test conditions. However, the R ct of the Co3O4/ZnFe2O4 electrode can be calculated to be 7.88 \u03a9, lying between the control Co3O4 and ZnFe2O4 electrodes. We suggest that the presence of ZnFe2O4 improves the charge transfer efficiency in the composite electrode.
