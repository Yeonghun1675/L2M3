Nonbonded interactions between adsorbates and the framework atoms were calculated using a Lennard-Jones (L-J) potential truncated at a spherical cutoff distance of 13 \u00c5. Cross terms are specified using Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rules with L-J parameters taken from the DREIDING force field for the framework atoms and the TraPPE force field for adsorbates. To calculate Coulombic forces, electrostatic charges on atoms in the MOFs were assigned on the entire periodic framework using the DDEC methods.
