The ZIF67@GF patterns reveal the reproduction of intensity of all the ZIF67 peak patterns, and their presence proves the successful inheritance of ZIF67 crystals in the glass fiber separator. FT-IR spectroscopy results deal with the chemical environments and interactions of the substrate and nanoparticles, which are demonstrated in b. The characteristic asymmetric stretching vibration of Si-O-Si observed at the wavenumber 985 cm-1, representing the glass fiber separator, is also present in the ZIF67@GF spectrum. In the case of ZIF67 particles, the peaks were primarily attributable to the 2-methylimidazole ligand. The stretching and bending of the imidazole group caused peaks, ranging from 600 to 1500 cm-1. The stretching mode of C\ue5fbN bonding in 2-methylimidazole caused a small peak at 1448 cm-1. In addition, the ZIF67@GF spectrum holds the typical signals for ZIF67 particles and the glass fiber separator but with slightly reduced intensity.

Prior to the GITT measurement, the coin cells were activated by allowing them to run three cycles of charge-discharge at 0.1C. The current was applied for 10 min per titration throughout the discharge/charge process, with an open-circuit stand for 40 min to allow the cell potential to reach the new steady-state potential. To calculate the D Li+  value, it was presumed that the electrode-bound lithium diffusion adheres to Fick's law. a,b shows the GITT profiles and corresponding Li+ diffusion coefficients. The GITT voltage-capacity profiles matched well with the GCD profiles in this section.

From the TGA\ncurves, it is obvious that the GF separator is stable up to 800 \u00b0C.\nThe ZIF67 particles are thermally stable up to 200 \u00b0C. The initial\n3.5% weight loss at nearly 130 \u00b0C was caused by the complete\nevaporation of tiny water crystals and moisture captured by the glass\nfiber separator. Eliminating excess particles from the fillers and\nunreacted linker species generated a steady weight loss from 150 to\n450 \u00b0C. After 450 \u00b0C, the ZIF67 particles begin to decompose.\nThe framework started to disintegrate due to the disappearance of\n2-methyilimidazole after 450 \u00b0C.</p><p>The total weight loss\nof the ZIF67 particles is estimated to be 15%, which is also the mass\nloading of ZIF67 in the glass fiber separator. The TGA results show\nthat ZIF-67 particles are relatively thermally stable; thus, these\nparticles will improve the thermal characteristics by adsorbing thermal\nenergy. Hence, it prevents thermal assault and makes the battery system\nmore stable. These findings suggested that operating our Li-SPAN corresponding\nbatteries at elevated temperatures would be possible.</p><title>Ionic Conductivity and Separator Compatibility</title><title>Ionic Conductivity</title><p>Ionic conductivity\nis a crucial parameter when estimating the ion regulating properties\nof ZIF67 nanoparticles. Here, the ionic conductivities were measured\nwith the help of AC impedance spectroscopy by sandwiching the separators\nbetween stainless-steel electrodes, followed by the addition of the\nliquid electrolyte inside the glovebox. The ionic conductivity value\nwas analyzed at 25\u201360 \u00b0C to obtain the Arrhenius plot,\ndisplayed in a. The ionic conductivities and the activation energies of bare and\nZIF67@GF separators are given in <ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsaem.3c00163/suppl_file/ae3c00163_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Table S2</ext-link>. At room temperature (25 \u00b0C), the ionic conductivities of bare\nand ZIF67@GF separators are <italic toggle=\"yes\">ca.</italic> 9 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20133</sup> S cm<sup>\u20131</sup> and 1.08 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20132</sup> S\ncm<sup>\u20131</sup>, respectively. When the temperature is increased\nto 60 \u00b0C, there seems to be an improvement in the ionic conductivity\nof both separators. For the bare separator, the conductivity is <italic toggle=\"yes\">ca.</italic> 1.36 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20132</sup> S cm<sup>\u20131</sup>, and for the ZIF67@GF, it is <italic toggle=\"yes\">ca.</italic> 1.78 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20132</sup> S cm<sup>\u20131</sup>. The slight improvement\nof ionic conductivities of the ZIF67@GF separators is attributed to\nthe abundant porosity of ZIF67, and the compact nature of the as-grown\nZIF67 particles supplies handfuls of ion transport channels with shorter\nion diffusion lengths. The activation\nenergy (<italic toggle=\"yes\">E</italic>\n<sub>a</sub>) was not affected by the presence\nof ZIF67 particles. The <italic toggle=\"yes\">E</italic>\n<sub>a</sub> values are <italic toggle=\"yes\">ca.</italic> 3.8 and 5.0 kJ mol<sup>\u20131</sup> for bare GF and\nZIF67@GF separators, respectively. The difference is not that much\nbetween both cases. A lower activation energy means a lower energy\nbarrier for the Li<sup>+</sup> ion transport, which eventually increases\nthe ionic mass transport rate and reduces the overpotential.</p><title>Wettability and Electrolyte Uptake</title><p>The\nwettability of the separator is a notable parameter for maintaining\nthe electrolyte during the charge/discharge process. The contact angle measurements were conducted to examine\nthe wettability of the separator. A drop of the liquid electrolyte\nis added to the separator surface, and the angle that the drop formed\nwith the surface is measured. The contact angles of the bare GF separator\nand the ZIF67@GF separator are almost zero (<ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsaem.3c00163/suppl_file/ae3c00163_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S3</ext-link>), which means that it can immediately uptake the electrolyte,\nhold a large amount of the electrolyte, and keep the separator wet\nfor a prolonged time. The perfect wettability of the glass fiber separator\ngenerated a well-distributed lithium-ion flux, which lowered the increasing\nlithium-ion concentration polarization locally and contributed to\nthe lithium dendrite suppression. Moreover, it reduces the surface\ntension, causing a smooth separator/electrolyte interface. The wettability\nof a separator is related to its electrolyte uptake tendency. The\nelectrolyte uptake was calculated by . The electrolyte uptake of the bare glass fiber and\nZIF67@GF separators is calculated to be 87 and 89%, respectively,\nproving a good interaction between the ZIF67 particles in the separator\nwith the liquid electrolyte.</p><title>Electrochemical\nPerformance Studies</title><p>The galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD)\nprofiles of the Li/SPAN\ncells with the bare GF and ZIF67-modified separators are demonstrated\nin a,b, characterized\nat 0.1C between the voltages in the range of 1\u20133 V (<italic toggle=\"yes\">vs</italic> Li/Li<sup>+</sup>). The upper potential is decreased\nto 2.5 V for the second and third cycles for the cells containing\nboth the bare GF and ZIF-grown GF separators, with the lithiation\nprocess starting at 1.8 V in the first discharge step. The Li/SPAN\ncell displayed considerable voltage hysteresis (polarization) during\nthe initial discharge, resulting in a significant buildup of irreversible\ncapacity loss. This voltage hysteresis may be due to the inadequate\nelectrical contact at the original grain boundaries between the SPAN\nand the conducting carbon particles. The discharging and charging\nprofile of the Li/SPAN cell, in contrast to typical Li/S batteries,\nexhibited only a single voltage plateau. This behavior suggested that\nthe SPAN underwent a single-phase direct solid-to-solid reaction without\nforming any soluble polysulfides. The\ninitial discharge capacity of the Li/SPAN cell assembled with the\nZIF67@GF separator was <italic toggle=\"yes\">ca.</italic> 1591 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup>, and for the cell with the bare glass fiber separator, the capacity\nwas <italic toggle=\"yes\">ca.</italic> 1469 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup> at 0.1C at\nroom temperature. It is noted that the initial discharge capacity\nof the full cell was increased by 8% and the overpotential (\u03b7)\nwas reduced from 0.45 to 0.37 V after incorporating ZIF67 nanoparticles\non the GF separator. This is because the active sites in the ZIF67\nparticles strongly regulated the Li<sup>+</sup> ion transport flux\nat the electrolyte\u2013separator interface and markedly reduced\nthe overpotential. The high Li<sup>+</sup> ion transfer number permits\nfast reaction kinetics throughout the Li nucleation and lithium growth\nprocesses at the Li anode; it may be responsible for the decreased\noverpotential. It should be emphasized that the increased overpotential\nin the cells with bare glass fiber separators is also caused by ongoing\nSEI generation. The higher capacities\nof the cells associated with the SPAN cathode may be due to the rough\nand porous nature of the electrode surface, which has more room for\nthe Li<sup>+</sup> ion interaction.\n</p><p>The oxidation peak potential was noted at approximately 2.31 V.\nThe single reduction and oxidation peaks resembled the single voltage\nplateau in the GCD profile, suggesting the direct conversion of S\nto Li<sub>2</sub>S without forming any of the soluble intermediate\npolysulfides responsible for the shuttle reaction. In the Li/SPAN\ncells incorporating the ZIF67@GF separator, the sharp and highly intense\noxidation and reduction peaks appeared with an enhanced peak current.\nThis is due to the redox nature of ZIF67 nanoparticles and their compatibility\nwith the electrolyte interface. Notably, the overpotential in the\nfirst scan significantly drops from 1.01 to 0.75 V when ZIF67 nanoparticles\nare present. The extended cycle performance of the cell would be favored\nby the rapid reaction kinetics resulting from the lower peak potential\ndifference (\u0394<italic toggle=\"yes\">E</italic>).</p><p>To explain the Li insertion behavior,\nthe reaction\nmechanism involves\nproducing Li<sub>2</sub>S and a lithiated polymer backbone through\nthe cleavage of the S\u2013S bonds and the formation of Li\u2013C\u2013N\u2013Li\nbonding. Because of the existence of the S<sub>2</sub> and S<sub>3</sub> chains, no polysulfide production occurred. Nevertheless, the complete\ndesulfurization of SPAN during the discharging has not been proven\nand is still disputed. It has been proposed that the lithiated polymeric\nbackbone would resist delithiation and stay lithiated after recharging.\nFollowing the initial discharging, it has been suggested that Li-SPAN\nand Li<sub>2</sub>S would undergo a reversible redox reaction. The Li<sup>+</sup> diffusion coefficient trend was found to be higher\nin the cells with the ZIF67@GF separator, as shown in b. As a result of the conversion\nof the lithiated SPAN into desulfurized SPAN, there is an increase\nin electronic conductivity, which is consistent with the electronic\nstructure of SPAN during the discharging/charging process.

The anode and cathode exhibited better compatibility with the separator. The Li//Li symmetrical cells based on the ZIF67@GF separator exhibited low polarization and were stable for up to 600 h. A Li/ZIF67@GF/SPAN full cell also showed a small voltage polarization effect and had a starting capacity of 1590 mAh g-1 at 0.1C rate. The improved high-rate capability (ca. 714 mAh g-1 at 10C) of Li/ZIF@GF/SPAN cells was better than that of the Li/bare GF/SPAN cells. The long-term cycling performance was improved significantly, with a decay rate of 0.05% per cycle at 2C over 600 cycles and the ability to perform 1000 cycles at a rate of 5C with 75.3% capacity retention. Thus, our findings support that the Li-SPAN cell equipped with a GF separator with in situ grown ZIF67 nanoparticles substantially improved the electrochemical performance.\n\nIn this study, we generated ZIF-67 nanoparticles in situ onto a GF and then employed the ZIF67@GF as a separator for a cell containing a SPAN cathode and a Li metal anode. Here, we chose a GF separator because of its excellent wettability and good electrolyte uptake. One discharge plateau was found while employing the SPAN cathode, and the dissolving of the polysulfide was inhibited completely. Our modified ZIF67@GF separators to the system increased the transference number to 0.49 because the active sites in the ZIF67 particles interacted with the anions in the electrolyte, thereby decreasing cell polarization. The analysis of symmetrical cells demonstrated that the catalytic activity and stable morphology of the ZIF67 nanoparticles inhibited the growth of Li dendrites and limited the buildup of dead Li. Our Li//Li symmetrical cells equipped with the ZIF67@GF separator survived for more than 600 h without undergoing shorting. Compared with cells featuring bare GF separators, the cells with ZIF67@GF separators have displayed superior high-rate capabilities (notably at higher rates of 36.5% at 2C and 36.8% at 5C) and more excellent discharge capacity retention. Furthermore, the ZIF-67@GF separator-equipped cells had discharge capacities of 961.2 mAh g-1 after the first cycle and 670.71 mAh g-1 after 600 cycles at 2C; the capacity attenuation was approximately 0.05% per cycle. Finally, our Li-SPAN batteries incorporating ZIF67@GF separators markedly improved the transport and kinetic characteristics, enhanced the electrochemical operation, and protected the Li anode.\n\nThermal Behavior of Separators\n\nGF separators are known for their excellent thermal stability. c presents the TGA profiles of the GF separator and ZIF67@GF separators. From the TGA curves, it is obvious that the GF separator is stable up to 800 \u00b0C. The ZIF67 particles are thermally stable up to 200 \u00b0C. The initial 3.5% weight loss at nearly 130 \u00b0C was caused by the complete evaporation of tiny water crystals and moisture captured by the glass fiber separator. Eliminating excess particles from the fillers and unreacted linker species generated a steady weight loss from 150 to 450 \u00b0C. After 450 \u00b0C, the ZIF67 particles begin to decompose. The framework started to disintegrate due to the disappearance of 2-methyilimidazole after 450 \u00b0C.\n\nThe total weight loss of the ZIF67 particles is estimated to be 15%, which is also the mass loading of ZIF67 in the glass fiber separator. The TGA results show that ZIF-67 particles are relatively thermally stable; thus, these particles will improve the thermal characteristics by adsorbing thermal energy. Hence, it prevents thermal assault and makes the battery system more stable. These findings suggested that operating our Li-SPAN corresponding batteries at elevated temperatures would be possible.\n\nIonic Conductivity and Separator Compatibility\n\nIonic Conductivity\n\nIonic conductivity is a crucial parameter when estimating the ion regulating properties of ZIF67 nanoparticles. Here, the ionic conductivities were measured with the help of AC impedance spectroscopy by sandwiching the separators between stainless-steel electrodes, followed by the addition of the liquid electrolyte inside the glovebox. The ionic conductivity value was analyzed at 25-60 \u00b0C to obtain the Arrhenius plot, displayed in a. The ionic conductivities and the activation energies of bare and ZIF67@GF separators are given in Table S2. At room temperature (25 \u00b0C), the ionic conductivities of bare and ZIF67@GF separators are ca. 9 \u00d7 10-3 S cm-1 and 1.08 \u00d7 10-2 S cm-1, respectively. When the temperature is increased to 60 \u00b0C, there seems to be an improvement in the ionic conductivity of both separators. For the bare separator, the conductivity is ca. 1.36 \u00d7 10-2 S cm-1, and for the ZIF67@GF, it is ca. 1.78 \u00d7 10-2 S cm-1. The slight improvement of ionic conductivities of the ZIF67@GF separators is attributed to the abundant porosity of ZIF67, and the compact nature of the as-grown ZIF67 particles supplies handfuls of ion transport channels with shorter ion diffusion lengths. The activation energy (E a) was not affected by the presence of ZIF67 particles. The E a values are ca. 3.8 and 5.0 kJ mol-1 for bare GF and ZIF67@GF separators, respectively. The difference is not that much between both cases. A lower activation energy means a lower energy barrier for the Li+ ion transport, which eventually increases the ionic mass transport rate and reduces the overpotential.\n\nWettability and Electrolyte Uptake\n\nThe wettability of the separator is a notable parameter for maintaining the electrolyte during the charge/discharge process. The contact angle measurements were conducted to examine the wettability of the separator. A drop of the liquid electrolyte is added to the separator surface, and the angle that the drop formed with the surface is measured. The contact angles of the bare GF separator and the ZIF67@GF separator are almost zero (Figure S3), which means that it can immediately uptake the electrolyte, hold a large amount of the electrolyte, and keep the separator wet for a prolonged time. The perfect wettability of the glass fiber separator generated a well-distributed lithium-ion flux, which lowered the increasing lithium-ion concentration polarization locally and contributed to the lithium dendrite suppression. Moreover, it reduces the surface tension, causing a smooth separator/electrolyte interface. The wettability of a separator is related to its electrolyte uptake tendency. The electrolyte uptake was calculated by . The electrolyte uptake of the bare glass fiber and ZIF67@GF separators is calculated to be 87 and 89%, respectively, proving a good interaction between the ZIF67 particles in the separator with the liquid electrolyte.\n\nElectrochemical Performance Studies\n\nThe galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) profiles of the Li/SPAN cells with the bare GF and ZIF67-modified separators are demonstrated in a,b, characterized at 0.1C between the voltages in the range of 1-3 V (vs Li/Li+). The upper potential is decreased to 2.5 V for the second and third cycles for the cells containing both the bare GF and ZIF-grown GF separators, with the lithiation process starting at 1.8 V in the first discharge step. The Li/SPAN cell displayed considerable voltage hysteresis (polarization) during the initial discharge, resulting in a significant buildup of irreversible capacity loss. This voltage hysteresis may be due to the inadequate electrical contact at the original grain boundaries between the SPAN and the conducting carbon particles. The discharging and charging profile of the Li/SPAN cell, in contrast to typical Li/S batteries, exhibited only a single voltage plateau. This behavior suggested that the SPAN underwent a single-phase direct solid-to-solid reaction without forming any soluble polysulfides. The initial discharge capacity of the Li/SPAN cell assembled with the ZIF67@GF separator was ca. 1591 mAh g-1, and for the cell with the bare glass fiber separator, the capacity was ca. 1469 mAh g-1 at 0.1C at room temperature. It is noted that the initial discharge capacity of the full cell was increased by 8% and the overpotential (\u03b7) was reduced from 0.45 to 0.37 V after incorporating ZIF67 nanoparticles on the GF separator. This is because the active sites in the ZIF67 particles strongly regulated the Li+ ion transport flux at the electrolyte-separator interface and markedly reduced the overpotential. The high Li+ ion transfer number permits fast reaction kinetics throughout the Li nucleation and lithium growth processes at the Li anode; it may be responsible for the decreased overpotential. It should be emphasized that the increased overpotential in the cells with bare glass fiber separators is also caused by ongoing SEI generation. The higher capacities of the cells associated with the SPAN cathode may be due to the rough and porous nature of the electrode surface, which has more room for the Li+ ion interaction. \n\nThe oxidation peak potential was noted at approximately 2.31 V. The single reduction and oxidation peaks resembled the single voltage plateau in the GCD profile, suggesting the direct conversion of S to Li2S without forming any of the soluble intermediate polysulfides responsible for the shuttle reaction. In the Li/SPAN cells incorporating the ZIF67@GF separator, the sharp and highly intense oxidation and reduction peaks appeared with an enhanced peak current. This is due to the redox nature of ZIF67 nanoparticles and their compatibility with the electrolyte interface. Notably, the overpotential in the first scan significantly drops from 1.01 to 0.75 V when ZIF67 nanoparticles are present. The extended cycle performance of the cell would be favored by the rapid reaction kinetics resulting from the lower peak potential difference (\u0394E).\n\nTo explain the Li insertion behavior, the reaction mechanism involves producing Li2S and a lithiated polymer backbone through the cleavage of the S-S bonds and the formation of Li-C-N-Li bonding. Because of the existence of the S2 and S3 chains, no polysulfide production occurred. Nevertheless, the complete desulfurization of SPAN during the discharging has not been proven and is still disputed. It has been proposed that the lithiated polymeric backbone would resist delithiation and stay lithiated after recharging. Following the initial discharging, it has been suggested that Li-SPAN and Li2S would undergo a reversible redox reaction. The Li+ diffusion coefficient trend was found to be higher in the cells with the ZIF67@GF separator, as shown in b. As a result of the conversion of the lithiated SPAN into desulfurized SPAN, there is an increase in electronic conductivity, which is consistent with the electronic structure of SPAN during the discharging/charging process. The Li+ ion diffusion coefficient of the Li/SPAN cells incorporating the ZIF@67-modified GF separators increased; it is ca. 1.64 \u00d7 10-8 cm2 s-1 from initial SOC(%). We assumed that the effective active sites, high surface area, and nanoscale size of the ZIF-67 particles shortened the Li+ ion diffusion length and immobilized most large anions (PF6 -) in the liquid electrolyte to improve the Li+ ion transport rate. In comparison, the Li+ ion diffusion coefficients of the Li/SPAN cell featuring the bare GF separator were calculated to be ca. 5.82 \u00d7 10-9 cm2 s-1 from initial SOC(%).

They also\nhelp understand the polarization degree on the surface of the lithium\nfoil. The stability and the short-circuit\nfailure are frequently and qualitatively correlated with the Li plating/stripping\nvoltage shape. These voltage changes are significantly influenced\nby the electrolyte composition, depth of charge/discharge, and current\ndensity. Symmetrical cells were made\nwith bare GF and ZIF67@GF separators to examine the electrochemical\ncapabilities of the bare glass fiber and ZIF67@GF separators with\nlithium metal anodes. 1 M lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF<sub>6</sub>) in ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC) was used\nas the electrolyte. Each cell was treated with an optimized amount\n(100 \u03bcL) of the electrolyte. As shown in a\u2013d, the comparisons were made between\nthe cells with ZIF67@GF and bare GF separators regarding their rate\nperformance, plating/stripping voltage profiles, and current density.\nTo measure the consistency and endurance of the electrolyte/electrode\nstability, the symmetrical cells operated at an extremely high current\ndensity, namely, the critical current density (CCD). The CCD profiles\nof the Li//SPAN cells with the bare GF and ZIF67@GF separators are\ndisplayed in a,c, respectively. In contrast to the spike-like voltage profiles\nof the cell with the bare glass fiber separators, the voltage plateau\nformed by the symmetry cells containing ZIF67@GF separators is flat\nand stable and features a slight polarization. The polarization difference\ncompletely diminished when the current density reached 2 and 5 mA\ncm<sup>\u20132</sup>. However, the symmetrical cells with the bare\nGF separator showed overpotentials of <italic toggle=\"yes\">ca.</italic> 41, 66,\nand 171 mV at 0.2, 0.5, and 1 mA cm<sup>\u20132</sup>, respectively.\nIn contrast, the overpotential of symmetrical cells with ZIF67@GF\nseparators displayed approximately 36, 60, and 123 mV for 0.2, 0.5,\nand 1 mA cm<sup>\u20132</sup>, respectively. The cells were instructed\nto return to the lowest current density of 0.2 mA cm<sup>\u20132</sup> after the highest current density of 5 mA cm<sup>\u20132</sup>. In both cases, the voltage profiles were accurately reproduced,\nand the bare one\u2019s voltage profile became smoother after a\nhigh current rate. The presence of ZIF67 nanoparticles on the GF separator\nis responsible for the reduced overpotential and smooth voltage profiles,\nwhich effectively enable the substantial amount of lithium to get\nfully utilized during the stripping and plating and prevent the formation\nof Li dendrites and dead lithium. b,d shows the voltage profiles of the symmetry\ncell at 1 mA cm<sup>\u20132</sup> with an areal capacity of 1 mAh\ncm<sup>\u20132</sup> for the bare GF and the ZIF67@GF separators.\nThe plating/stripping profile shows no difference in cells with the\nbare GF and ZIF67@GF separators.

During the final hours of cycling, the cells\nprovided spiking or arcing voltage profiles. However, the arcing behavior\nof the cells with a bare GF separator is severe. This arcing profile\nfeatured a distinctive arc that plateaued at the halfway point of\nthe half cycle. This change in the voltage curve suggested that its\nvoltage shape, following prolonged cycling, could not be captured\nfully by morphology-driven reaction kinetics, implying that the dead\nLi layer continued to accumulate and that the diffusion length through\nthe dead Li layer continued to increase. Thus, during cell cycling,\nthis buildup of dead Li resulted in restricted mass transport. The interfacial stability of the symmetry cells\nincorporating the bare GF separators and the ZIF67@GF separators is\ninvestigated using the EIS measurements.

At rates of\n0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, 2C, 5C, and 10C, the Li/SPAN cell assembled with the\nZIF-67@GF separator offered high initial capacities of 1420, 1375,\n1278, 1192, 960, and 714 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup>, respectively.\nA high reversible capacity of 1395 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup> occurred\nwhen we switched the current density from 10C to 0.2C.

When we reversed the current density to 0.2C from\n10C, the discharge capacity returned to 1273 mAh g<sup>\u20131</sup>. At low current densities, the cells assembled with the ZIF-67@GF\nseparator produced 9.8% (0.2C) and 16.7% (0.5C) more capacity than\nthat of the cell with the bare GF counterpart. When the current density\nwas much higher, however, the situation was more drastic, with the\ncells containing ZIF-67@GF separators achieving 36.5% (2C) and 36.8%\n(5C) more capacity than that of the cell with the bare GF separators.\nThe lower overpotential and enhanced ionic conductivity that arose\nafter modifying the GF with the ZIF-67 particles were primarily responsible\nfor the increased discharge capacity and more reversibility after\napplying the high current density. The overpotential or polarization\nhas the most detrimental effect at higher current densities. The use\nof GF separators in SPAN systems, capable of adapting to temperature\nvariations inside the cell and withstanding even higher current densities,\nis noteworthy.</p><p>We used EIS to analyze the interfacial\nstability; b shows the Nyquist\nplots.\nA depressed semicircle in the medium- to high-frequency range and\nan inclined line in the low-frequency range make up each Nyquist plot\nbefore cycling.

The interfacial contact between the electrode\u2013electrolyte\nand the separator was also increased by the higher wettability of\nthe separator, thereby promoting the ionic conductivity and increasing\nthe discharge capacity.</p><p>The cells were evaluated at 0.5C and\n2C at room temperature, as\nshown in c,d,\nto examine the electrochemical performance of the separators at various\ncurrent densities.

They also help understand the polarization degree on the surface of the lithium foil. The stability and the short-circuit failure are frequently and qualitatively correlated with the Li plating/stripping voltage shape. These voltage changes are significantly influenced by the electrolyte composition, depth of charge/discharge, and current density. Symmetrical cells were made with bare GF and ZIF67@GF separators to examine the electrochemical capabilities of the bare glass fiber and ZIF67@GF separators with lithium metal anodes. 1 M lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) in ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC) was used as the electrolyte. Each cell was treated with an optimized amount (100 \u03bcL) of the electrolyte. As shown in a-d, the comparisons were made between the cells with ZIF67@GF and bare GF separators regarding their rate performance, plating/stripping voltage profiles, and current density. To measure the consistency and endurance of the electrolyte/electrode stability, the symmetrical cells operated at an extremely high current density, namely, the critical current density (CCD). The CCD profiles of the Li//SPAN cells with the bare GF and ZIF67@GF separators are displayed in a,c, respectively. In contrast to the spike-like voltage profiles of the cell with the bare glass fiber separators, the voltage plateau formed by the symmetry cells containing ZIF67@GF separators is flat and stable and features a slight polarization. The polarization difference completely diminished when the current density reached 2 and 5 mA cm-2. However, the symmetrical cells with the bare GF separator showed overpotentials of ca. 41, 66, and 171 mV at 0.2, 0.5, and 1 mA cm-2, respectively. In contrast, the overpotential of symmetrical cells with ZIF67@GF separators displayed approximately 36, 60, and 123 mV for 0.2, 0.5, and 1 mA cm-2, respectively. The cells were instructed to return to the lowest current density of 0.2 mA cm-2 after the highest current density of 5 mA cm-2. In both cases, the voltage profiles were accurately reproduced, and the bare one's voltage profile became smoother after a high current rate. The presence of ZIF67 nanoparticles on the GF separator is responsible for the reduced overpotential and smooth voltage profiles, which effectively enable the substantial amount of lithium to get fully utilized during the stripping and plating and prevent the formation of Li dendrites and dead lithium. b,d shows the voltage profiles of the symmetry cell at 1 mA cm-2 with an areal capacity of 1 mAh cm-2 for the bare GF and the ZIF67@GF separators. The plating/stripping profile shows no difference in cells with the bare GF and ZIF67@GF separators. A marked difference arose, however, at 500 h. Even the symmetrical cells with bare glass fiber separators underwent a short circuit at 547 h, revealing a trend of increasing polarization. In contrast, the symmetrical cell with the ZIF67@GF separator prevented the cell from undergoing a short circuit. Notably, around 300 h, a sharp voltage drop is observed at the cells containing bare GF and ZIF67@GF separators. This happened due to the unstable power supply/shutdown during the measurement.\n\nThe enlarged voltage profiles are shown in Figure S4. The calculated values of polarizations are ca. 577 and 300 mV for the cells with the bare GF and ZIF67@GF separators, respectively. During the final hours of cycling, the cells provided spiking or arcing voltage profiles. However, the arcing behavior of the cells with a bare GF separator is severe. This arcing profile featured a distinctive arc that plateaued at the halfway point of the half cycle. This change in the voltage curve suggested that its voltage shape, following prolonged cycling, could not be captured fully by morphology-driven reaction kinetics, implying that the dead Li layer continued to accumulate and that the diffusion length through the dead Li layer continued to increase. Thus, during cell cycling, this buildup of dead Li resulted in restricted mass transport. The interfacial stability of the symmetry cells incorporating the bare GF separators and the ZIF67@GF separators is investigated using the EIS measurements. In Figure S5, the AC impedance spectra are illustrated. The AC impedance was measured for the fresh Li//Li symmetry cells and cells that had undergone five cycles of polarization at 1 mA cm-2 with an areal plating capacity of 1 mAh cm-2. In the higher frequency region, one semicircle was observed with charge transfer resistance (R ct) and conductance (C 1). For the cells with the bare GF separator and the ZIF67@GF separator, the R ct values are around 138 and 96.2 \u03a9, respectively, before cycling, and they drop to 97.8 and 73.6 \u03a9 after five cycles. The ZIF67 particles with a high surface area provided more free void or space for better lithium mass transport. They decreased the interfacial polarization, which resulted in lower charge transfer resistance for the cells using ZIF67@GF separators.\n\nRate Capability and Electrochemical Performance\n\nThe GCD measurements at various current densities ranging from 0.2C to 10C were used to study the rate capabilities for the cells with two separators. a displays the GCD profiles of the rate capabilities. The cells are generally activated for 2 to 3 cycles prior to performing the rate capability test to form some stable SEI layer. At rates of 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, 2C, 5C, and 10C, the Li/SPAN cell assembled with the ZIF-67@GF separator offered high initial capacities of 1420, 1375, 1278, 1192, 960, and 714 mAh g-1, respectively. A high reversible capacity of 1395 mAh g-1 occurred when we switched the current density from 10C to 0.2C. At 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, 2C, 5C, and 10C, the cells built with the bare GF separators had capacities of 1293, 1188, 1102, 874, 702, and 297 mAh g-1, respectively. When we reversed the current density to 0.2C from 10C, the discharge capacity returned to 1273 mAh g-1. At low current densities, the cells assembled with the ZIF-67@GF separator produced 9.8% (0.2C) and 16.7% (0.5C) more capacity than that of the cell with the bare GF counterpart. When the current density was much higher, however, the situation was more drastic, with the cells containing ZIF-67@GF separators achieving 36.5% (2C) and 36.8% (5C) more capacity than that of the cell with the bare GF separators. The lower overpotential and enhanced ionic conductivity that arose after modifying the GF with the ZIF-67 particles were primarily responsible for the increased discharge capacity and more reversibility after applying the high current density. The overpotential or polarization has the most detrimental effect at higher current densities. The use of GF separators in SPAN systems, capable of adapting to temperature variations inside the cell and withstanding even higher current densities, is noteworthy.\n\nWe used EIS to analyze the interfacial stability; b shows the Nyquist plots. A depressed semicircle in the medium- to high-frequency range and an inclined line in the low-frequency range make up each Nyquist plot before cycling. The former is related to the charge transfer resistance (R ct) at the electrode-electrolyte interface as well as the bulk resistance (R b) from the electrolyte, with the latter being the Warburg diffusion impedance (Wo) of lithium-ion diffusion in the bulk of the electrode. In this case, the charge transfer resistance of the cell prepared with ZIF67@GF (ca. 23.6 \u03a9) was slightly lower than that of the cell with the bare GF (ca. 27.8 \u03a9). Here, we can state conclusively that the separator prepared with the in situ grown ZIF-67 nanoparticles did not increase the impedance and enabled fast charge transfer kinetics. The interfacial contact between the electrode-electrolyte and the separator was also increased by the higher wettability of the separator, thereby promoting the ionic conductivity and increasing the discharge capacity.\n\nThe cells were evaluated at 0.5C and 2C at room temperature, as shown in c,d, to examine the electrochemical performance of the separators at various current densities. The cells incorporating the bare glass fiber separator had an initial capacity of 1283 mAh g-1 at 0.5C; after 200 cycles, its capacity was ca. 921 mAh g-1. Here, the capacity retention was ca. 82% and the capacity attenuation was 0.08% per cycle (from the second cycle). The ZIF67@GF separator-equipped cell delivered a high initial capacity of 1414 mAh g-1; after 200 cycles, its capacity was ca. 1019 mAh g-1 again, with a capacity retention of 82% and a capacity decay per cycle of 0.08%. The cells fabricated with the bare GF and ZIF67@GF separators had initial coulombic efficiencies of 86 and 97.9%, respectively. In both cases, the coulombic efficiencies reached a stable value of 100% throughout the cycles. The cell with the ZIF67@GF separator had a high initial coulombic efficiency because the catalytic activity of the ZIF67 nanoparticles increased the sulfur conversion efficiency, starting from the first cycle. The cell with the bare GF delivered an initial capacity of 821.6 mAh g-1 at a high current density 2C; after 600 cycles, it attenuated by 0.05% per cycle, resulting in 567.6 mAh g-1. Furthermore, the ZIF67@GF separator-equipped cell had a higher initial capacity of 961.2 mAh g-1 and a capacity of 674.71 mAh g-1 after 600 cycles, giving a capacity attenuation of 0.05% per cycle.\n\nHigher Current Density and Long-Term Cycling Examination\n\nAs shown in Figure S7, the cells were evaluated at 5C for 1000 cycles. After 669 cycles at this rate, the cell with the bare GF separator no longer functioned. The cell with the ZIF67@GF separator, on the other hand, completed 1000 cycles successfully; its initial capacity of 394 mAh g-1 decreased to 297 mAh g-1 at the 1000th cycle, with a capacity retention of 75.3%. The survival of the cells with the ZIF67@GF was due to the distinctive porous structure of the GF separator, leading to a high ionic conductivity when placed in the electrolyte and facilitated rapid ionic transport; furthermore, the SPAN cathode, in which S atoms were covalently attached to the polymeric backbone of the PAN, prevented the shuttle mechanism. This rationale also explains why the cells containing the bare GF separators also functioned well. Most significantly, the long-range order and high porosity of the ZIF-67 particles facilitated directional Li+ ion conduction, which resulted in faster reaction kinetics and stable long cycle life.",
