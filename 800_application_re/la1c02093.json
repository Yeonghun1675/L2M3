The saturation magnetization (M s) values of MNP@aZIF-90 and GOx/MNP@aZIF-90 were lower than the M s values of MNP (C,D), which could be attributed to the encapsulation in the aZIF-90 resulting in a reduction in the surface moments of individual particles. However, magnetic composites could still show a quick response to a magnetic field while lowering of the M s values.\n\nAnalytical Performance\n\nKinetic constants of enzymes have been determined and are listed in Table S2; the V max value of GOx/MNP@aZIF-90 is 4.54 \u03bcM/min, and the K m value of GOx/MNP@aZIF-90 is 0.265 \u03bcM (methodology detailed in Supplementary Methods, eq 2). Compared to other approaches, amorphous ZIF-90 showed the potential to be a powerful tool compared to other materials. As shown in A, the absorbance of samples increases as the concentrations of glucose increase. The linear relationship could be established from 0.038 to 34 \u03bcM, and the limit of detection (LOD) of 0.319 \u03bcM was obtained following the 3\u03c3/slope rule (methodology detailed in Supplementary Methods, eq 3). Crystalline GOx/HRP@ZIF-8 shows good selectivity toward glucose, and the nanocomposites GOx/FeNi-MOF also performed well in the detection of glucose. However, compared with other approaches, GOx/MNP@aZIF-90 showed a lower limit of detection, which could be ascribed to the expanded pore size of aZIF-90 that could facilitate substrate transportation and the internal voids that could provide sufficient space for multienzymes (, methodology detailed in Supplementary Methods).\n\nStorage Stability and Recyclability of Nanocomposites (GOx/MNP@aZIF-90)\n\nLong-term storage stability and recyclability are two important aspects for developing a reliable biosensor. Thus, to analyze the storage stability and recyclability, nanocomposites were stored for 12 days and reused 6 times, respectively. As shown in C, GOx/MNP@aZIF-90 retained ~70% of the initial overall activity for 12 days at 4 \u00b0C, while GOx/MNP@aZIF-90 retained ~65% of the initial overall activity after 6 cycles of reuse (D). The significant enhancement of stability might be attributed to the rigid structure of MOF, which restrains the enzyme structure from unfolding and avoids the leakage of enzymes through rigid restriction. \n\nConclusions\n\nIn this research, amorphous ZIF-90 was utilized to encapsulate the mimic enzyme (MNP) and natural enzyme (GOx) together to fabricate an enzymatic cascade system. It was found that aZIF-90 not only provided a shell to confine the cascade reaction but also enhanced the catalytic ability of the GOx and MNP cascade. GOx/MNP@aZIF-90 exhibits almost 4 times higher catalytic activity than that of the crystalline composite (GOx/MNP@ZIF-90), and the residual activity was higher than 80% after the biosensor was stored for 9 days. Compared with ZIF-90, which exhibits micropores ranging from 1 to 2 nm, aZIF-90 showed mesopores ranging from 5 to 20 nm, which significantly facilitate the delivery of the substrate, thus enhancing the activity of confined enzymes. Additionally, it was reasoned that the internal voids in aZIF-90 provide sufficient space for multienzymes and minimize the activity loss of confined enzymes. In summary, a biocompatible, stable, simple, and low-cost strategy has been developed to synthesize amorphous ZIF-90 for the package of enzymes and nanozymes, which might be a potential tool for enzymatic catalysis in industries.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "peak spectrum": [{"value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["peak_spectrum"]}, {"idx": 36, "type": "table", "classification": ["Property"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Summary\nof General Approaches for\nDetection of Glucose with a Linear Range and Detection Limit</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"5\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">method</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">enzyme immobilization</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">linear range</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">detection\nlimit (\u03bcM)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">references</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>Cu<sub>2</sub>O/GNs</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>not needed</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.3\u20133.3\u00a0mM</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>3.3</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref47\" specific-use=\"ref-style=base-text\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>GOx/HRP@ZIF-8</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>encapsulation</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.008\u20135\u00a0mM</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>8</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref48\" specific-use=\"ref-style=base-text\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-OMC/glucose\u00a0oxidase</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>not needed</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.01\u20134\u00a0mM</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>3.3</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref49\" specific-use=\"ref-style=base-text\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>GOx@Mn<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)\u00b73H<sub>2</sub>O</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>covalent\nconjugation</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.05\u201320\u00a0mM</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>10</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref50\" specific-use=\"ref-style=base-text\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>GOx/MHRP-Cu<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>covalent conjugation</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0\u20130.3\u00a0mM</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>15.6</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref51\" specific-use=\"ref-style=base-text\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>GOx/FeNi-MOF</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>encapsulation</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.3\u201335\u00a0mM</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.3</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref52\" specific-use=\"ref-style=base-text\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>GOx/MNP@aZIF-90</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>encapsulation</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.38\u201334\u00a0\u03bcM</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.319</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>this work</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "Table 1.
