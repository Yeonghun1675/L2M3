As an alternative, we developed a cluster expansion model that allowed efficient lattice-based MC simulations of metal orderings in specific materials. Simulations of M-TPCB with this approach suggest that nonrandom orderings of metal tetramers along the c axis may exist in real materials. This observation indicates that future development of methods that can quantify short- and long-range ordering of metals in heterometallic MOFs would be useful in gaining a complete understanding of this diverse class of materials.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 48, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information\nis available free of charge at <ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.2c15638?goto=supporting-info\" xlink:type=\"simple\">https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.2c15638</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Crystal structure information, details of cluster expansion\nmodels, and additional information on structures used in DFT calculations\n(<ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.2c15638/suppl_file/am2c15638_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>CIF\nfiles for crystals, sample DFT input files (<ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.2c15638/suppl_file/am2c15638_si_002.zip\" xlink:type=\"simple\">ZIP</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.2c15638.
