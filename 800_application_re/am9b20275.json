the dominant active radicals in the C-CoCu-HNC/PMS system, quenching tests were conducted. Methanol has a high rate constant for both SO4 \u22c5- (k = 2.5 \u00d7 107 M-1 s-1) and \u22c5OH (k = 9.7 \u00d7 108 M-1 s-1); tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) has a higher rate constant for \u22c5OH (k = 3.8-7.6 \u00d7 108 M-1 s-1) and a much lower constant for SO4 \u22c5- (k = 4 \u00d7 107-9.1 \u00d7 107 M-1 s-1). Therefore, methanol can be used as scavenger for both radicals of SO4 \u22c5- and \u22c5OH, and TBA as a scavenger for \u22c5OH in the PMS-based AOPs. As shown in Figure S11, when TBA was introduced into the C-CoCu-HNC/PMS system, RhB degradation efficiency decreased from 99.7 to 87.9% after 20 min reaction. The k app decreased from 0.235 to 0.108 min-1. When methanol was introduced, the RhB degradation efficiency and k app decreased to 65.4% and 0.053 min-1, respectively. These results indicated that both SO4 \u22c5- and \u22c5OH radicals were involved in the PMS activation process.

This tighter connection between O2 and CuCo2O4 facilitates electron transfer from the Co/Cu to the antibonding \u03c0* orbital of O2, weakening the O-O bond in O2. Measuring the O-O distances (l O-O) of absorbed O2, both the l O-O on Co3O4 and CuCo2O4 are elongated compared to free O2 (1.23 \u00c5). The CuCo2O4 offers a longer l O-O (Table S7), suggesting that CuCo2O4 is more favorable to dissociate O2 to produce O adatoms and can subsequently snatch hydrogen from the surrounding substrate to complete the substrate oxidation. The adsorption energy (E ads) is a convenient descriptor to estimate the relative catalytic activity because of the good correlation between E ads and activation energies for small-molecule superficial reactions. In this work, the more negative value of E ads(O2) in CuCo2O4 explains its higher catalytic reactivity for O2 and better oxidase-like activity.

As expected, CuCo2O4 shows more negative E ads and Q e (Figure S12), as well as longer l O-O compared to Co3O4.
