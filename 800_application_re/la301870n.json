The Ni/DOBDC and HKUST-1 can selectively adsorb Xe and Kr from air even at ppm level concentrations. The Ni/DOBDC has a Xe capacity of 9.3 mmol/kg when the concentration of Xe is 1000 ppm in air. More importantly, for the first time our experimental results show that the Ni/DOBDC is able to separate 400 ppm Xe from 40 ppm Kr mixture in air with a Xe/Kr overall selectivity of 7.3. These results show that the Ni/DOBDC is a promising MOF to be used in radioactive air stream treatments.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "Ni/DOBDC", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "Xe", "adsorbed amount": "9.3", "unit": "mmol/kg", "temperature": "25 \u00b0C", "pressure": "1000 ppm", "condition": "using the breakthrough method"}, {"adsorbate": "Kr", "adsorbed amount": "1.8", "unit": "mmol/kg", "temperature": "25 \u00b0C", "pressure": "1000 ppm", "condition": "using the breakthrough method"}, {"adsorbate": "Xe", "adsorbed amount": "4.8", "unit": "mmol/kg", "temperature": "", "pressure": "400 ppm", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "Kr", "adsorbed amount": "0.066", "unit": "mmol/kg", "temperature": "", "pressure": "40 ppm", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["gas_adsorption"]}, {"idx": 5, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Crystal structures for MOFs after removing solvent molecules.\nLeft:\nNi/DOBDC; right: HKUST-1.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"la-2012-01870n_0002.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Crystal structures for MOFs after removing solvent molecules.
