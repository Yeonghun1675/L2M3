Considering eqs 1 and 2, this can be the result of a higher number of adsorption sites or a lower loss of entropy for the aromatics or even a combination of both. Concerning the contribution of entropy, it can be stated that both aromatics and linear alkanes only retain one degree of translational freedom, corresponding to a movement along the longitudonal axis of the one-dimensional pore. With respect to rotation, it is not easy to differentiate between alkanes and alkylaromatics. It could be speculated that for n-octane, only the rotation along the longest axis of the alkane chain is not sterically hindered and allows close contact between the alkane hydrogen atoms and the oxygen atoms of the framework. For the aromatics, more degrees of rotational freedom could be retained, but an independent study would be needed to verify this hypothesis. Regarding the number of adsorption sites, it is observed that the adsorption capacity of n-octane is only half of that of the alkylaromatics (vide infra).

In the Henry region, at negligible pore occupancy, the separation factor is close to 1. The average selectivity increases with increasing degree of pore filling in favor of pX. The occurrence of the three stages in the breakthrough profiles can therefore be rationalized as follows. In the initial stage, when the \u201cempty\u201d MIL-47 material in the adsorption column is contacted with the pX/mX mixture, both components are adsorbed equally, as their Henry adsorption constants are comparable. Under these conditions, the aromatic molecules have enough free space in the empty pores to adopt their ideal configuration and optimize host\u2212guest interactions, not hindered by the presence of nearby molecules. Thus in this stage, pX and mX travel at comparable velocity through the column and reach the column outlet simultaneously. As adsorption in the column continues, the pores of the material gradually become filled with C8 alkylaromatic molecules. From a certain point on, available free space in the pores becomes critical. Efficient stacking of the molecules is required to fully occupy the available pore volume. As evidenced by Rietveld refinement of MIL-47 samples loaded with xylene isomers and the isotherm experiments, pX is stacked more efficiently and is capable of filling the pores at a lower energy cost as compared to mX. pX will be adsorbed selectively at the expense of mX when the degree of pore filling increases. This explains the change in shape of the breakthrough curves, where elution of pX is slowed down (phase II in Figure ). This process continues until the pores are completely filled.

In the Henry region, at negligible pore occupancy, the separation factor is close to 1. The average selectivity increases with increasing degree of pore filling in favor of pX. The occurrence of the three stages in the breakthrough profiles can therefore be rationalized as follows. In the initial stage, when the \"empty\" MIL-47 material in the adsorption column is contacted with the pX/mX mixture, both components are adsorbed equally, as their Henry adsorption constants are comparable. Under these conditions, the aromatic molecules have enough free space in the empty pores to adopt their ideal configuration and optimize host-guest interactions, not hindered by the presence of nearby molecules. Thus in this stage, pX and mX travel at comparable velocity through the column and reach the column outlet simultaneously. As adsorption in the column continues, the pores of the material gradually become filled with C8 alkylaromatic molecules. From a certain point on, available free space in the pores becomes critical. Efficient stacking of the molecules is required to fully occupy the available pore volume. As evidenced by Rietveld refinement of MIL-47 samples loaded with xylene isomers and the isotherm experiments, pX is stacked more efficiently and is capable of filling the pores at a lower energy cost as compared to mX. pX will be adsorbed selectively at the expense of mX when the degree of pore filling increases. This explains the change in shape of the breakthrough curves, where elution of pX is slowed down (phase II in Figure ). This process continues until the pores are completely filled. At this point, no additional molecules from the feed are adsorbed and outlet concentrations evolve rapidly to the inlet concentrations (phase III).", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 51, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig11\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>11</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Effect of loading on the average separation factor (\u03b1) for the separation of equimolar <italic toggle=\"yes\">m</italic>-xylene/<italic toggle=\"yes\">p</italic>-xylene (closed symbols) and ethylbenzene/<italic toggle=\"yes\">p</italic>-xylene (open symbols) mixtures at 70 and 110 \u00b0C respectively using MIL-47.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr12\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ja-2008-00686c_0008.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 11  Effect of loading on the average separation factor (\u03b1) for the separation of equimolar m-xylene/p-xylene (closed symbols) and ethylbenzene/p-xylene (open symbols) mixtures at 70 and 110 \u00b0C respectively using MIL-47.
