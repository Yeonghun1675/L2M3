The carceplex nature of [(G7-G12)\u2282MOC 96/97]6+ was studied in solution by NMR techniques. \n\nHunter and Ward reported a range of organic molecules with acidic or basic groups that exhibit strong pH-dependent binding inside the cavity of a polyhedral coordination cage, MOC 105 (h). Guest binding in aqueous solution is dominated by a hydrophobic contribution, which is compensated by stronger solvation when the guests become cationic (by protonation) or anionic (by deprotonation). pH-dependent binding was observed for a range of guests with different functional groups (primary and tertiary amines, pyridine, imidazole, and carboxylic acids) so that the pH range can be tuned anywhere in the range of 3.5-11. Among the MOCs, 106 has the largest overall (i) peripheral diameter of 5.4 nm and an internal cavity of 2.7 nm. After treatment with supercritical CO2, a single-crystal sample of MOC 106 transformed into amorphous material with the retention of the cage skeleton, which demonstrated good adsorption properties toward a small drug molecule, ibuprofen (Ibu, G16). An Ibu release experiment in phosphate-buffered saline solution (pH 7.4) revealed that MOC 106 exhibited slow drug release behavior.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "MOC 1", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": []}, {"meta": {"name": "MOC 2", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": []}, {"meta": {"name": "MOC 96", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": []}, {"meta": {"name": "MOC 97", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": []}, {"meta": {"name": "MOC 98", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": []}, {"meta": {"name": "MOC 99", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": []}, {"meta": {"name": "MOC 100", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": []}, {"meta": {"name": "MOC 105", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": []}, {"meta": {"name": "MOC 106", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "ibuprofen", "adsorbed amount": "", "unit": "", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": "phosphate-buffered saline solution (pH 7.4)"}]}]], "include_properties": ["gas_adsorption"]}, {"idx": 3, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>(Top) Diverse MOCs for Biochemical and Biomedical\nApplications; (Bottom,\nLeft) Metal Centers in MOCs for Biomedical Applications;<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"sch1-fn1\"></xref> (Bottom, Middle) Shape Effect of Various MOCs\nfor Biomedical Applications; and (Bottom, Right) Different Biological\nAreas Involving MOCs<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"sch1-fn2\"></xref>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ja9b06222_0007.tif\"></graphic>\n<p>\n<fn id=\"sch1-fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>Re-, Cu-, and Mn-containing\nheterometallic complexes are not counted.</p>\n</fn>\n<fn id=\"sch1-fn2\">\n<label>b</label>\n<p>Note: the statistical data is based on the selected\n119 MOCs in this Perspective.</p>\n</fn>\n</p>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  (Top) Diverse MOCs for Biochemical and Biomedical Applications; (Bottom, Left) Metal Centers in MOCs for Biomedical Applications; (Bottom, Middle) Shape Effect of Various MOCs for Biomedical Applications; and (Bottom, Right) Different Biological Areas Involving MOCs      a Re-, Cu-, and Mn-containing heterometallic complexes are not counted.   b Note: the statistical data is based on the selected 119 MOCs in this Perspective.
