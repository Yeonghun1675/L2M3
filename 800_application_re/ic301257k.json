The experiments were performed on samples consisting of numerous single crystals of 1-4 under N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min (). The networks remain intact for these compounds until about 280 \u00b0C, and then begin to collapse. For 1, the weight loss between 280 and 630 \u00b0C is attributed to decomposition of the organic components and As2O3 (obsd 48.9%, calcd 47.7%). Compound 2 loses its organic components and As2O3 from 270 to 800 \u00b0C (obsd 49.2%, calcd 49.0%). In the case of 3, weight loss of 51.3% (calcd 50.2%) between 270 and 715 \u00b0C is also attributed to the organic components and As2O3. For 4, the weight loss in the temperature range of 290-730 \u00b0C corresponds to the departure of organic components and As2O3 (obsd 41.4%, calcd 40.5%).\n\nOptical Band Gap\n\nThe UV-vis absorption spectra of compounds 1-4 were measured in the crystalline state at room temperature (). The energy bands from 200 to 300 nm for 1, 200 to 320 for 2, 200 to 300 nm for 3, and 200 to 310 nm for 4 may be assigned to the O\u2192Mo charge transfers. \n\nTo study the conductivity of compounds 1-4, the diffuse reflectivities for powder samples were conducted to obtain their band gaps (E g). The band gaps (E g) were confirmed as the intersection point between the energy axis and the line extrapolated from the linear portion of the adsorption edge in a plot of the Kubelka-Munk function F against E. The optical absorption related to E g can be assessed at 2.6 eV for 1, 2.7 eV for 2, 2.1 eV for 3, and 1.9 eV for 4, respectively (Figure ). The reflectance spectra show the presence of optical band gaps and the nature of semiconductivities for compounds 1-4. Thus, compounds 1-4 have potential for photocatalytic activities. \n\nPhotocatalysis Properties\n\nPhotocatalytic properties of POMs have attracted much attention because of their potential applications in purifying air and water. The introduction of POMs into MOFs can enrich their potential applications, such as catalysis, nonlinear optics, and electrical conductivity. Herein, compounds 1, 3, and 4 have been tested for photocatalytic degradation of MB. The experimental details have been described in our previous work. In a typical experiment, a 200 mL MB (5.0 \u00d7 10-5 mol L-1) solution was taken along with the catalyst (1, 3, and 4) (70 mg) and exposed to UV light. As illustrated in Figure , the concentrations of MB versus irradiation time of 1, 3, and 4 were plotted. It can be seen that the photocatalytic activities increase from 35% (without catalysts) to 76% for 1, 93% for 3, and 97% for 4 after 120 min of irradiation. Obviously, the degradation efficiency of 4 under UV light is higher than those of 1 and 3. In ref , the concentration of the MB solution is 2.7 \u00d7 10-5 mol L-1 and the volume of the solution is 90 mL. Compared with ref , we used the UV mercury lamp with the same power (125 W) and MB solution with higher concentration (5.0 \u00d7 10-5 mol L-1). After 90 min of irradiation, the photocatalytic activity increased from 24% (without catalysts) to 66% for 1, 88% for 3, and 94% for 4 (Figure d). It shows that the photocatalytic activity for 1 is similar to that reported by ref  (ca. 70%), while for 3 and 4, the photocatalytic activities are much higher than that reported by ref . These results demonstrate that compounds 1, 3, and 4 may be good potential photocatalysts with photocatalytic activities in the degradation of some organic dyes.\n\nCyclic Voltammetry\n\nRedox properties of compounds 1, 3, and 4 were studied in 1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. The electrochemical behaviors of the 1-, 3-, and 4-CPE (Figure ) are similar except for some slight potential shift, and the behavior of 3-CPE has been taken as an example. The cyclic voltammograms for 3-CPE at different scan rates are presented in Figure c in the potential range of -250 to 500 mV. There exist two reversible redox peaks I-I' and II-II' with the half-wave potentials E 1/2 [= (E pa + E pc)/2] at -28(I-I') and 279(II-II') mV (scan rate: 40 mV\u22c5s-1), respectively. The redox peaks I-I' and II-II' might be ascribed to the As2Mo6 cluster. When the scan rates were varied from 20 to 200 mV\u22c5s-1, the peak potentials change gradually: the cathodic peak potentials shift slightly toward negative potential values and the corresponding anodic peak potentials shift toward positive potential values with increasing scan rates.
