Their sensitivity was evaluated by the maximum |\u0394R| of sensors in the wavelength range of 325-500 nm on exposure to ethanol at saturated pressure (Figure S11). As shown in a, the maximum |\u0394R| values are 22.34, 18.78, 18.71, 18.53, 15.26, 12.78, and 10.12% for CS380/0.49, CS466/0.19, CS468/0.26, CS506/0.26, CS641/0.15, CS755/0.27, and CS1057/0.41, respectively, indicating that the increase of the size of building crystals lowers the sensitivity due to the decrease in reflectance signals of sensors as discussed above. Based on the reflectance resolution of our spectrometer (3\u03c3 = 0.10%) and \u0394R at the relative pressure of 0.05, the potential detection limit to ethanol was estimated as 33 ppm for CS380/0.49. As revealed by the dynamic studies (Figures S14-19 and Table S4), all CSs show fast response to ethanol. Their response times (2.00-2.50 s) seem to increase roughly with the sizes of building crystals, but further analysis was frustrated by the data acquisition speed (2 spectra per second). In contrast, CSs display the relatively long recovery times (3.00-14.00 s), which basically decrease as downsizing the MOF crystals except for CS466/0.19 and CS641/0.15. By determining the first moment of an experimental recovery curve via integration, the time constant (\u03c4) for desorption of ethanol molecules in UiO-66 frameworks could be obtained. For spherical particles, the time constant could be described by  3    \u03c4 =     r   2     15 D   +   r   3 \u03b1     where r, D, and \u03b1 are the crystal radius (half of the crystal sizes), the intracrystal diffusivity, and the surface permeability of MOF crystals, respectively. Assuming the identical D and \u03b1 for ethanol molecules desorption in MOF crystals with defect numbers of 0.26 and 0.27, the time constants for CS468/0.26, CS506/0.26, and CS755/0.27 were fitted as the function of crystal sizes according to  (b). This yielded D of 5.01 \u00d7 10-14 m2 s-1 and \u03b1 of 7.46 \u00d7 10-8 m s-1 for the ethanol desorption in these MOF crystals. On the other hand, the time constants for CS380/0.49 and CS1057/0.41 deviate obviously from the fitted data negatively, whereas those for CS466/0.19 and CS641/0.15 deviate positively, suggesting that D or/and \u03b1 will change with the defect number in the building crystals of CSs and that the increase of (missing-linker) defects in MOF promotes the diffusion of analyte dramatically.\n\nTo evaluate the effects of the mesoporous structures in MOF films on the sensing performances, a sensor (DS) configured with a dense UiO-66 film, which was fabricated by the solvothermal growth method, was used for comparison. As shown in a, the deposited MOF film in DS possesses an intergrown surface morphology and a uniform thickness of ~462 nm that is close to the size of building crystals in CS468/0.26. The TGA results indicate that the MOF material in DS bears more missing-linker defects (x = 0.50) than that in CS468/0.26 (Figure S21). The nitrogen sorption measurements at 77 K (Figure S22a) reveal the absence of 0.92 nm micropore but the presence of a larger one (1.56 nm) in the MOF of DS, which are not observed in that of CS468/0.26 (b) and can be attributed to the increased defect number (0.50) in the former according to previous reports. Nevertheless, the dense MOF film in DS has a higher n than that of the mesoporous sensing film of CS468/0.26 as indicated by its red-shifted interference peaks (Figure S23). On exposure to the saturated ethanol vapor, the DS shows a small maximum |\u0394R| (15.02%) relative to that of CS468/0.26 (18.71% as indicated in a), suggesting the lower sensitivity of the former. The \u0394R-derived optical adsorption isotherm of DS for ethanol deviates slightly from that of CS468/0.26 in the relative pressure range of 0.25-0.45 (c). Interestingly, the similar deviation was also observed for their normalized nitrogen sorption isotherms at 77 K in the relative pressure range of 0.01-0.3 (Figure S22b), which could be attributed to the presence of larger micropores in MOF of DS. The dynamic sensing studies (to ethanol analyte at saturated pressure) reveal the much slower response (3.50 s) and recovery (15.50 s) of DS462/0.50 (d) as compared to those of CS468/0.26 (2.00 and 6.00 s, respectively, see above). If only defect number was taken into account, this observation would apparently be in contradiction with the above statement that high defect number results in faster response and recovery. Accordingly, the enhanced response and recovery performances of CS468/0.26 could be attributed to the intercrystal mesoporous structures in the sensing MOF films that facilitate greatly the diffusion of analyte molecules.
