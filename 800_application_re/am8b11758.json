On the basis of these data, an average structural\nmodel for CYCU-3\u2032 50_50 was built (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.8b11758/suppl_file/am8b11758_si_001.pdf\">Figure S6</ext-link>).

For this purpose, the images of the CYCU-3' 50_50 material were obtained using a transmission electron microscope, and the ED data of a selected area were recorded. The crystals have long ribbon-like morphology (Figure S3), as previously observed in the corresponding SEM images (Figure S2). The 3D reciprocal lattice of CYCU-3' 50_50 was reconstructed from the ED frames (Figure S4) and used for the determination of the unit cell parameters (a = 16.35 \u00c5, b = 62.15 \u00c5, c = 6.73 \u00c5, \u03b1 = 89.7\u00b0, \u03b2 = 94.5\u00b0, and \u03b3 = 88.1\u00b0). These values showed some differences, particularly in the a-axis and \u03b2 angle, in comparison to those of pristine CYCU-3 (a = 34.067 \u00c5, b = 60.07 \u00c5, c = 6.312 \u00c5, \u03b1 = 90.0\u00b0, \u03b2 = 90.0\u00b0, and \u03b3 = 90.0\u00b0), which may suggest that CYCU-3' 50_50 is a new structure of the original MOF. Unfortunately, the CYCU-3' 50_50 structure is disordered along the b axis, as severe diffraction streaks along this direction were observed in the reconstructed 3D reciprocal lattice (Figure S4). Thus, this disorder, together with the flexible behavior of the crystals (bending, twisting, and coiling) (Figure S4a-c), avoids a direct structure solution using the CRED data. For this reason, the Pawley fit was applied to the PXRD data to confirm and refine the unit cell parameters (Figure S5). The refinement was conducted using a Pearson VII-type peak profile function, followed by the refinement of the unit cells and zero-shift. The R-value was converged to R p = 0.110, R wp = 0.0634, R exp = 0.267, and goodness of fit (GOF) = 0.237. The high R exp and low GOF values are due to the broad peaks caused by the disorder and preferred orientation.

On the basis of these data, an average structural model for CYCU-3' 50_50 was built (Figure S6). The crystal structure is based on the corner-shared AlO6 octahedra, leading to 1D chains, as in CYCU-3. However, there are more Al chains in the unit cell of CYCU-3' 50_50 than in CYCU-3, as the a axis of the former is halved (a = 16.35 and 34.067 \u00c5, respectively).

In addition, the new CYCU-3' 50_50 structure has 1D channels that represent the small pores of CYCU-3.

The pore size distribution of the different porous frameworks was also determined (Figure S9).\n\nEvaluation of ALF794@CYCU-3 Hybrid Materials as Potential CORMAs\n\nTo test the potential biological application as CORMAs of ALF794@CYCU-3 50_5 and ALF794@CYCU-3' 50_50, their photoinduced CO release properties were first investigated in solution (10 mM PBS, 37 \u00b0C) by UV-vis spectroscopy using the myoglobin assay. Although both the hybrid materials released appreciable amounts of CO (0.46 and 0.24 mmol of CO per mmol of CORM, respectively, upon 24 h of irradiation with visible light, Figure S12), molybdenum leaching was also detected (94 and 25%, respectively, after 6 h of incubation with no further leaching in the next 72 h) (Table S1). The high extent of metal leaching from ALF794@CYCU-3 50_5 might be attributed to its smaller particle size, which unfortunately leads to a high degradation of the framework in PBS. In contrast, ALF794@CYCU-3' 50_50 shows a significantly lower metal leaching (25% of Mo) related to its less porous structure and larger particle size. Taking into account the latter fact, ALF794@CYCU-3' 50_50 is the only hybrid material that can be considered as a real CORMA in solution.\n\nTo further explore the ability of these hybrid systems as CORMAs, we decided to study their CO delivery properties in the solid state, envisaging their potential use for topical applications (i.e., anti-inflammatory bandages). In this context, the previously reported innovative application of photoactive CORMs for topical treatment of epidermal cancer should be highlighted. Indeed, CORM-2, [Ru2Cl4(CO)6], lotions were shown to reduce the acute and chronic inflammation and tumor multiplicity in hairless mice with induced photocarcinogenesis. Thus, an in-line CO detector was customized to measure the CO released from the ALF794@CYCU-3 50_5 and ALF794@CYCU-3' 50_50 solid matrixes (Figure S13). In particular, both hybrid materials were spin-coated and irradiated at 250-385 nm with 50 mW cm-2 of light power to promote the CO release. The delivered CO was transferred using N2 as the carrier gas to the in-line detector. The CO release efficiencies of the ALF794-loaded materials were compared to that of free CORM (). Thus, pristine ALF794 behaves also as a photoCORM in the solid state, releasing 0.42 mmol of CO per mmol of CORM after 220 min (photo-releasing efficiency: 42%). In addition, both hybrid materials retain the photoactive properties of the molybdenum tricarbonyl complex, showing an average CO delivery of 0.44 and 0.35 mmol of CO per mmol of CORM (44 and 35% of CO release efficiency) for ALF794@CYCU-3 50_5 and ALF794@CYCU-3' 50_50, respectively.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "CYCU-3\u2032", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "lattice parameters": [{"value": {"a": "16.35", "b": "62.15", "c": "6.73", "alpha": "89.7\u00b0", "beta": "94.5\u00b0", "gamma": "88.1\u00b0", "condition": ""}}], "density": [{"value": "0.731", "unit": "g/cm^3", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "CYCU-3", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "lattice parameters": [{"value": {"a": "34.067", "b": "60.07", "c": "6.312", "alpha": "90.0\u00b0", "beta": "90.0\u00b0", "gamma": "90.0\u00b0", "condition": ""}}], "density": [{"value": "0.453", "unit": "g/cm^3", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "CYCU-3\u2032 50_50", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "lattice parameters": [{"value": {"a": "16.35", "b": "62.15", "c": "6.73", "alpha": "89.7\u00b0", "beta": "94.5\u00b0", "gamma": "88.1\u00b0", "condition": ""}}], "density": [{"value": "0.731", "unit": "g/cm^3", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "ALF794@CYCU-3 50_5", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "lattice parameters": [], "density": []}, {"meta": {"name": "ALF794@CYCU-3\u2032 50_50", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "lattice parameters": [], "density": []}]], "include_properties": ["lattice_parameters", "density"]}, {"idx": 7, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Incorporation of the Model CO-Prodrug\nALF794 inside\nthe CYCU-3 Porous Matrix and CO Release upon Photoactivation</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr8\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"am-2018-117583_0008.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Incorporation of the Model CO-Prodrug ALF794 inside the CYCU-3 Porous Matrix and CO Release upon Photoactivation   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 21, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch2\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Preparation of Different CYCU-3 Materials Using CMM</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr9\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"am-2018-117583_0009.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 2  Preparation of Different CYCU-3 Materials Using CMM   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 23, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Powder X-ray diffractograms\nand (b\u2013f) SEM images of CYCU-3 materials prepared in the absence\nof a modulator [CYCU-3 <italic>x</italic>_<italic>y</italic>, <italic>x</italic>: reagent concentration (mM), <italic>y</italic>: modulator/ligand\nratio].</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"am-2018-117583_0001.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  (a) Powder X-ray diffractograms and (b-f) SEM images of CYCU-3 materials prepared in the absence of a modulator [CYCU-3 x_y, x: reagent concentration (mM), y: modulator/ligand ratio].
