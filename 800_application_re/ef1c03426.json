UiO-66 gels can also be converted\nto layered porous monomers as xerogels and aerogels, with surface\nareas and pore volumes (1459 m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup>, 2.09 cm<sup>3</sup>\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup>, and 1255 m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup>, 1.66 cm<sup>3</sup>\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup>, respectively) that far exceed that of UiO-66 powders. MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) aerogel with a permanent porosity\nand pore volume was synthesized by Lohe et al. According to the nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms,\naerogels were obtained with a single-point BET surface area of 1618\nm<sup>2</sup>\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup>, which is much higher than\nthe powdered sample value of 1183 m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup>. It is clear from the pore size distribution\nthat the aerogel has a relatively wide range of micropores and mesopores\ndistribution, with the pore volume maximum at 1.3 nm. However, the mechanical strength was not discussed\nin the research, which is essential for practical applications such\nas adsorption and catalytic processes.</p><title>Granules and Tablets</title><p>Mechanical compression\nof powder is a traditional shaping method, and the density of the\ntablets can be adjusted by changing the compression conditions. Pressure is applied to a specific amount of MOF powder through a\nmechanical device, such as a tablet press, to obtain the shaped sample. MOF-177 powder was compressed into a monolith (<italic toggle=\"yes\">D</italic> = 5 mm) using a mechanical technique without any binders, resulting\nin a 78% increase in the maximum excess volumetric hydrogen storage\ncapacity at 6 MPa and 77 K. However,\nthe monolith showed a diminishing micropore volume due to the gradual\ncollapse of MOF-177 crystals to an amorphous phase during densification. This is a natural consequence of mechanical\ncompression depending on the rigidity and the strength of the MOFs\nframework, where densification may lead to decomposition of the crystallite\nor interpenetration of particulate (). HKUST-1 was\nalso molded by simple mechanical compression, whereby a 1 mL syringe\nwas filled with powder, which was pressed hard (by hand) during loading\n(). The CH<sub>4</sub> adsorption capacity of the\ncompressed sample was reduced by half compared to that of the HKUST-1\npowder. An attempt was made to increase\nthe bulk density by pressing the MOFs onto a wafer at pressures of\n0.5, 2, and 5 tons, and the results showed that the total micropore\nvolumes were dramatically reduced. CPO-27-Ni\ntablets (<italic toggle=\"yes\">D</italic> = 1 cm, thickness = 0.1 cm) were prepared\nby pressing (100 MPa) a 0.5 g powder sample with barely a reduction\nin the specific surface area, and the adsorption of methane was reduced\nfrom 157 to 129 N cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> at 303 K. Another representative MOF (ZIF-8) was compressed\nby a universal testing machine, and the impact of compression on the\ncatalytic performance was evaluated. The BET surface area of the compressed ZIF-8 pellets at 5 kN (<italic toggle=\"yes\">m</italic> = 0.05 g, <italic toggle=\"yes\">D</italic> = 10 mm) was less than that\nof the native powder, whereas it was significantly reduced in the\ncompressed HKUST-1, reaching only 25% of the powder sample.\n</p><p>Ribeiro et al. experimentally verified\nthat the specific surface area and CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption properties\nof the ZIF-8 pellets (0.5 g, <italic toggle=\"yes\">D</italic> = 10 mm, <italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic> = 62 and 125 MPa) were slightly affected by the compression molding.\nThe CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption isotherm of ZIF-8 pellets overlaps with\npowder up to 8 bar and a loss of capacity less than 6% at 29 bar.\nThis is related to the large retention of the specific surface area\nand pore volume of the pellets. The BET surface area of ZIF-8 pellets\nshows a loss of 7% and 12% compared to powder at a compression of\n62 and 125 MPa, respectively. However, the compression molding of\nthe flexible MOF MIL-53\u00ad(Al) at the same pressure was less effective,\nwith a 46% and 32% loss of the specific surface area compressed at\n62 and 125 MPa, respectively. The BET\nsurface area and pore volume of the powder and pressed samples of\nZIF-8 and MIL-53\u00ad(Al) are listed in . To verify that the molded MOFs can be applied\nto industrial CO<sub>2</sub> capture and separation, such as PSA processes,\nthey measured the pellet mass loss rate during pressure change cycles\n(1, 3, 10, and 13 bar) and demonstrated that both ZIF-8 and MIL-53\u00ad(Al)\npellets ()\nhad a mass loss of less than 5%, while MIL-53\u00ad(Al) had better mechanical\nproperties. The hydrogen storage capacity\nof the MIL-101 compressed pellets were investigated, and the optimum\nhydrogen adsorption capacity (40 g/L) was obtained for pellet densities\nof 0.45\u20130.47 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, which is comparable to that\nof MOF-5 and MOF-177 under the same conditions.\n</p><title>Inorganic Binders</title><p>Inorganic binders\nare considered for the MOFs molding process because of their excellent\nthermal stability and environmental friendliness. Clay-based binders, such as bentonite and kaolinite, are\nthe most commonly used binders for zeolite shaping, which can yield\nstrength zeolite granules after sintering. However, because calcination degrades MOF materials and destroys\ntheir structure at high temperatures, clay-based binders that need\nhigh-temperature calcination to gain strength are rarely used alone\nfor the direct formation of MOFs pellets. Binders that can work without requiring calcination are preferred.\nValekar et al. effectively prepared\nMIL-100\u00ad(Fe), MIL-101\u00ad(Cr), UiO-66\u00ad(Zr), and UiO-66\u00ad(Zr)_NH<sub>2</sub> in millimeter-sized pellets using 5 wt % \u03c1-alumina as the\nbinder and investigated the fundamental property changes and mechanical\nstrength of the MOF monoliths. Their schematic diagrams () show that MOFs\nand \u03c1-alumina are combined by the interaction of hydroxyl groups\non the particle surface to form a monolithic structure with a certain\nstrength. On the basis of the nitrogen\nadsorption and desorption isotherms at 77 K and applying the BET method,\nthe specific surface area of all four MOFs particles was found to\nbe overproportionally reduced, but it is noteworthy that the CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption capacity of MIL-101\u00ad(Cr) and UIO-66\u00ad(Zr)_NH<sub>2</sub> after spheroidization was basically the same as the weight\nratio compared to the pristine MOFs. The mechanical strength of the four molded MOFs containing 5 wt\n% binders was measured and gave an average crushing strength of 6.7\nN (MIL-100\u00ad(Fe)), 4.1 N (MIL-101\u00ad(Cr)), 4.7 N (UiO-66\u00ad(Zr)), and 2.5\nN (UiO-66\u00ad(Zr)_NH<sub>2</sub>), respectively. This is still insufficient for application in packed adsorption\nbeds, though it can also be improved by increasing the binder content.\n</p><p>Kim et al. fabricated MIL-100\u00ad(Fe)\ngranules with a size of 1.18\u20131.70 mm by adding 10% silica sol\nas a binder. The adsorption and desorption isotherms at 77 K showed\nthe BET surface area of 1619 m<sup>2</sup>/g for MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) granule,\nwhich is about 90% of the powders without additional reduction. In\naddition, the MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) granules had a better SF<sub>6</sub> adsorption\ncapacity, and the breakthrough time is 40 min faster at 1 bar than\nthat of commercial zeolite 13X granules, which offers greater possibilities\nfor practical industrial applications. Moreira et al. have used 1% graphite and 99% UiO-66 powder pressed\ninto a tablet composite (), but the BET surface area was reduced by 22% compared\nto that of pristine UiO-66, which is unfavorable for the gas adsorption\nprocess. In most cases, the properties\nof MOFs with inorganic binders are retained (), but there is still a need for extensive\nresearch on the mechanical properties and stability performance of\nthe composite monoliths.</p><p>Inspired by the earlier works of printing structural\nadsorbents, Thakkar et al. first applied\n3D printing technology to MOFs shaping and successfully printed MOF-74\u00ad(Ni)\nand UTSA-16\u00ad(Co) monoliths (1.5 cm in height and 1.5 cm in diameter).\nThe process of fabricating MOFs monoliths using 3D printing through\ndirect ink writing is shown in , where bentonite clay and PVA were used\nas the binder and plasticizer, respectively. CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption\nexperiments showed that the working capacities of MOF-74\u00ad(Ni) and UTSA-16\u00ad(Co)\nmonoliths were 4.0 and 3.0 mmol/g, respectively, corresponding to\n5.7 and 3.5 mmol/g for the powder sample. The compressive strengths of the MOF-74\u00ad(Ni) and UTSA-16\u00ad(Co) blocks\nexhibited in the mechanical tests were approximately 0.48 and 0.56\nMPa, respectively. Although the mechanical\nstrengths are lower compared to that of the ceramic architecture obtained\nby 3D printing, typically showing strengths on the order of 1\u20135\nMPa, they can also be applied well in adsorption devices. Lawson et al. systematically investigated the kinetics of 3D printed\nMOF-74\u00ad(Ni) monolith by varying parameters such as feed velocity and\nadsorption time and pressure. It was\ndemonstrated that the adsorption kinetics was affected by multiple\nfactors, and the MOF-74\u00ad(Ni) monolith showed the best separation performance\nof CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub> at low CO concentration, high pressure,\nlow feed velocity, and short adsorption time. Bible et al. printed acrylonitrile\nbutadiene styrene (ABS) metal and MOF (ZIF-8 and HKUST-1) composites\nusing a commercial 3D printer, and the structure was retained even\nafter immersion in water. The specific surface area of the mixture\nwas close to the theoretically calculated specific surface area; therefore,\nit is reasonable that the N<sub>2</sub> adsorption capacity was also\npreserved. However, the MOFs content\nwas only 10%, and the authors proposed the necessity for improving\nthe fabrication process to increase the MOFs content and improve the\napplication efficiency. Another study also demonstrated the potential\nof 3D printed MOFs (ZIF-67) in organic dye removal applications, with\nan average removal rate of 97\u201398% for rhodamine B after 10\ncontinuous degradation cycles. The differences\nin performance for 3D-printed MOFs do not merely relate to additives;\nthey also depend heavily on the process conditions and structure of\nmonoliths. Denayer\u2019s group printed\nZIF-8 monoliths for the biobutanol recovery by layer-by-layer printing\nusing 16.7 wt % bentonite and 16.7 wt % methylcellulose as an additive. The advanced selectivity of the block for butanol recovery was verified\nfrom dynamic breakthrough experiments.\n</p>", "clean_text": "In terms of gas adsorption, Rezaei et al. investigated the coating of MOF-74(Ni) and UTSA-16(Co) onto the surface of commercial cordierite and optimized the properties such as the crystal growth and film thickness to produce a monolith wrapped with 55 wt % MOFs ().

MIL-100(Fe) aerogel with a permanent porosity and pore volume was synthesized by Lohe et al. According to the nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms, aerogels were obtained with a single-point BET surface area of 1618 m2\u22c5g-1, which is much higher than the powdered sample value of 1183 m2\u22c5g-1. It is clear from the pore size distribution that the aerogel has a relatively wide range of micropores and mesopores distribution, with the pore volume maximum at 1.3 nm. However, the mechanical strength was not discussed in the research, which is essential for practical applications such as adsorption and catalytic processes.\n\nGranules and Tablets\n\nMechanical compression of powder is a traditional shaping method, and the density of the tablets can be adjusted by changing the compression conditions. Pressure is applied to a specific amount of MOF powder through a mechanical device, such as a tablet press, to obtain the shaped sample. MOF-177 powder was compressed into a monolith (D = 5 mm) using a mechanical technique without any binders, resulting in a 78% increase in the maximum excess volumetric hydrogen storage capacity at 6 MPa and 77 K. However, the monolith showed a diminishing micropore volume due to the gradual collapse of MOF-177 crystals to an amorphous phase during densification. This is a natural consequence of mechanical compression depending on the rigidity and the strength of the MOFs framework, where densification may lead to decomposition of the crystallite or interpenetration of particulate (). HKUST-1 was also molded by simple mechanical compression, whereby a 1 mL syringe was filled with powder, which was pressed hard (by hand) during loading (). The CH4 adsorption capacity of the compressed sample was reduced by half compared to that of the HKUST-1 powder. An attempt was made to increase the bulk density by pressing the MOFs onto a wafer at pressures of 0.5, 2, and 5 tons, and the results showed that the total micropore volumes were dramatically reduced. CPO-27-Ni tablets (D = 1 cm, thickness = 0.1 cm) were prepared by pressing (100 MPa) a 0.5 g powder sample with barely a reduction in the specific surface area, and the adsorption of methane was reduced from 157 to 129 N cm3 g-1 at 303 K. Another representative MOF (ZIF-8) was compressed by a universal testing machine, and the impact of compression on the catalytic performance was evaluated. The BET surface area of the compressed ZIF-8 pellets at 5 kN (m = 0.05 g, D = 10 mm) was less than that of the native powder, whereas it was significantly reduced in the compressed HKUST-1, reaching only 25% of the powder sample. \n\nRibeiro et al. experimentally verified that the specific surface area and CO2 adsorption properties of the ZIF-8 pellets (0.5 g, D = 10 mm, P = 62 and 125 MPa) were slightly affected by the compression molding. The CO2 adsorption isotherm of ZIF-8 pellets overlaps with powder up to 8 bar and a loss of capacity less than 6% at 29 bar. This is related to the large retention of the specific surface area and pore volume of the pellets. The BET surface area of ZIF-8 pellets shows a loss of 7% and 12% compared to powder at a compression of 62 and 125 MPa, respectively. However, the compression molding of the flexible MOF MIL-53(Al) at the same pressure was less effective, with a 46% and 32% loss of the specific surface area compressed at 62 and 125 MPa, respectively. The BET surface area and pore volume of the powder and pressed samples of ZIF-8 and MIL-53(Al) are listed in . To verify that the molded MOFs can be applied to industrial CO2 capture and separation, such as PSA processes, they measured the pellet mass loss rate during pressure change cycles (1, 3, 10, and 13 bar) and demonstrated that both ZIF-8 and MIL-53(Al) pellets () had a mass loss of less than 5%, while MIL-53(Al) had better mechanical properties. The hydrogen storage capacity of the MIL-101 compressed pellets were investigated, and the optimum hydrogen adsorption capacity (40 g/L) was obtained for pellet densities of 0.45-0.47 g/cm3, which is comparable to that of MOF-5 and MOF-177 under the same conditions. \n\nInorganic Binders\n\nInorganic binders are considered for the MOFs molding process because of their excellent thermal stability and environmental friendliness. Clay-based binders, such as bentonite and kaolinite, are the most commonly used binders for zeolite shaping, which can yield strength zeolite granules after sintering. However, because calcination degrades MOF materials and destroys their structure at high temperatures, clay-based binders that need high-temperature calcination to gain strength are rarely used alone for the direct formation of MOFs pellets. Binders that can work without requiring calcination are preferred. Valekar et al. effectively prepared MIL-100(Fe), MIL-101(Cr), UiO-66(Zr), and UiO-66(Zr)_NH2 in millimeter-sized pellets using 5 wt % \u03c1-alumina as the binder and investigated the fundamental property changes and mechanical strength of the MOF monoliths. Their schematic diagrams () show that MOFs and \u03c1-alumina are combined by the interaction of hydroxyl groups on the particle surface to form a monolithic structure with a certain strength. On the basis of the nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms at 77 K and applying the BET method, the specific surface area of all four MOFs particles was found to be overproportionally reduced, but it is noteworthy that the CO2 adsorption capacity of MIL-101(Cr) and UIO-66(Zr)_NH2 after spheroidization was basically the same as the weight ratio compared to the pristine MOFs. The mechanical strength of the four molded MOFs containing 5 wt % binders was measured and gave an average crushing strength of 6.7 N (MIL-100(Fe)), 4.1 N (MIL-101(Cr)), 4.7 N (UiO-66(Zr)), and 2.5 N (UiO-66(Zr)_NH2), respectively. This is still insufficient for application in packed adsorption beds, though it can also be improved by increasing the binder content. \n\nKim et al. fabricated MIL-100(Fe) granules with a size of 1.18-1.70 mm by adding 10% silica sol as a binder. The adsorption and desorption isotherms at 77 K showed the BET surface area of 1619 m2/g for MIL-100(Fe) granule, which is about 90% of the powders without additional reduction. In addition, the MIL-100(Fe) granules had a better SF6 adsorption capacity, and the breakthrough time is 40 min faster at 1 bar than that of commercial zeolite 13X granules, which offers greater possibilities for practical industrial applications. Moreira et al. have used 1% graphite and 99% UiO-66 powder pressed into a tablet composite (), but the BET surface area was reduced by 22% compared to that of pristine UiO-66, which is unfavorable for the gas adsorption process. In most cases, the properties of MOFs with inorganic binders are retained (), but there is still a need for extensive research on the mechanical properties and stability performance of the composite monoliths.\n\nInspired by the earlier works of printing structural adsorbents, Thakkar et al. first applied 3D printing technology to MOFs shaping and successfully printed MOF-74(Ni) and UTSA-16(Co) monoliths (1.5 cm in height and 1.5 cm in diameter). The process of fabricating MOFs monoliths using 3D printing through direct ink writing is shown in , where bentonite clay and PVA were used as the binder and plasticizer, respectively. CO2 adsorption experiments showed that the working capacities of MOF-74(Ni) and UTSA-16(Co) monoliths were 4.0 and 3.0 mmol/g, respectively, corresponding to 5.7 and 3.5 mmol/g for the powder sample. The compressive strengths of the MOF-74(Ni) and UTSA-16(Co) blocks exhibited in the mechanical tests were approximately 0.48 and 0.56 MPa, respectively. Although the mechanical strengths are lower compared to that of the ceramic architecture obtained by 3D printing, typically showing strengths on the order of 1-5 MPa, they can also be applied well in adsorption devices. Lawson et al. systematically investigated the kinetics of 3D printed MOF-74(Ni) monolith by varying parameters such as feed velocity and adsorption time and pressure. It was demonstrated that the adsorption kinetics was affected by multiple factors, and the MOF-74(Ni) monolith showed the best separation performance of CO2/H2 at low CO concentration, high pressure, low feed velocity, and short adsorption time. Bible et al. printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) metal and MOF (ZIF-8 and HKUST-1) composites using a commercial 3D printer, and the structure was retained even after immersion in water. The specific surface area of the mixture was close to the theoretically calculated specific surface area; therefore, it is reasonable that the N2 adsorption capacity was also preserved. However, the MOFs content was only 10%, and the authors proposed the necessity for improving the fabrication process to increase the MOFs content and improve the application efficiency. Another study also demonstrated the potential of 3D printed MOFs (ZIF-67) in organic dye removal applications, with an average removal rate of 97-98% for rhodamine B after 10 continuous degradation cycles. The differences in performance for 3D-printed MOFs do not merely relate to additives; they also depend heavily on the process conditions and structure of monoliths. Denayer's group printed ZIF-8 monoliths for the biobutanol recovery by layer-by-layer printing using 16.7 wt % bentonite and 16.7 wt % methylcellulose as an additive. The advanced selectivity of the block for butanol recovery was verified from dynamic breakthrough experiments.
