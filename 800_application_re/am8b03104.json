The R ct of CGB-Se was higher than that of NPC/GCB-Se after 50 cycles owing to the low bulk Se activation in CGB-Se.

Mesoporous CGBs obtained by one-pot spray pyrolysis are\nused as a highly conductive matrix for uniform polyhedral ZIF-8 growth.\nDuring carbonization, ZIF-8 polyhedrons on mesoporous CGBs are converted\ninto N-doped carbon polyhedrons showing abundant micropores, forming\na high-surface-area, high-pore-volume hierarchically porous NPC/CGB\ncomposite whose small unique pores effectively confine Se during melt\ndiffusion, thereby providing conductive electron pathways.

Notably, the NPC/CGB composite\nisotherm displays large uptake in the low <italic>PP</italic>\n<sub>o</sub>\n<sup>\u20131</sup> range, which is attributed to the composite\nmicropores. As confirmed in the Barrett\u2013Joyner\u2013Halenda\n(BJH) pore size distributions (b), the sharp peak at \u223c4 nm in the NPC/CGB composite\nisotherm showed higher intensity, indicating that the small mesopores\nwere more developed when the CGBs were combined with the NPC polyhedrons.\nThe Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) surface areas of NPC/CGB\nand CGB were 541.6 and 235.8 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup>,\nrespectively.

Meanwhile,\nCGB-Se showed a larger surface area than NPC/CGB owing to the agglomeration\nof Se nanoparticles generating empty mesopores in the CGB matrix.</p><p>To investigate the C and Se structural\ncharacteristics of NPC/CGB-Se\nand CGB-Se composites, Raman spectra were obtained, as shown in a,b. The NPC/CGB-Se\ncomposite exhibited a broad band at 259 cm<sup>\u20131</sup>, which\nwas attributed to the combination of chainlike Se (c-Se, 257 cm<sup>\u20131</sup>) and ringlike Se (r-Se, 267 cm<sup>\u20131</sup>) short-range ordered band modes. In addition, the Raman spectra did not show any peaks\ncorresponding to trigonal Se (t-Se, 237 cm<sup>\u20131</sup>), indicating\nthat the composites only contained short-range ordered Se. The Raman\nspectrum for the CGB-Se composite is similar to that for the NPC/CGB-Se\ncomposite except for the weak peak corresponding to t-Se, suggesting\nthat the unique NPC/CGB composite pore structure had facilitated the\nformation of short-range ordered Se, thereby resulting in high Se\nutilization and excellent electrochemical performance for Li\u2013Se\nbatteries. In b, the Raman spectra show two major peaks at 1360 and 1590 cm<sup>\u20131</sup>, correlating with the D- and G-bands of defected\ngraphitic carbon materials, respectively. The G-band\nis attributed to sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized bonded C atoms, whereas\nthe D-band is assigned to the defects in carbon materials. The relative intensity ratio (<italic>I</italic>\n<sub>D</sub>/<italic>I</italic>\n<sub>G</sub>) of the two bands correlates\nwith the degree of sample graphitization. The <italic>I</italic>\n<sub>D</sub>/<italic>I</italic>\n<sub>G</sub> values of NPC/CGB-Se and CGB-Se were calculated as 0.99 and 1.08,\nrespectively. The lower <italic>I</italic>\n<sub>D</sub>/<italic>I</italic>\n<sub>G</sub> value for NPC/CGB-Se was due to graphitic layers produced\nin NPC and CGB during high-temperature annealing at 900 \u00b0C. The\nthermal behaviors of NPC/CGB-Se and CGB-Se were investigated by thermogravimetric\nanalysis (TGA) under an inert Ar atmosphere (c). The considerable weight losses of both\nsamples occurred in the range of 300\u2013550 \u00b0C, which is\nattributed to Se volatilization within the carbon matrix. The weight\nloss of the NPC/CGB-Se composite occurred at a higher temperature\nthan that of the CGB-Se composite owing to the well-defined porous\nstructure in the NPC/CGB-Se composite. The Se nanoparticles confined\nto the small NPC/CGB pores required more energy to melt and diffuse,\nresulting in higher-temperature evaporation. The Se contents of NPC/CGB-Se\nand CGB-Se were both calculated as 60 wt %.</p><p>To explore the electrochemical behaviors of NPC/CGB-Se and\nCGB-Se\nas cathode materials for Li\u2013Se batteries, cyclic voltammograms\n(CVs) of the two samples were scanned at 0.1 mV s<sup>\u20131</sup> in the range 1.0\u20133.0 V for the first and fifth cycles (a,b). The voltammogram\nin a shows\nweak peaks at 2.1 and 2.3 V in the initial discharge profile, corresponding\nto the transformation of r-Se to c-Se, which disappeared after further\ncycling. The distinct reduction peak at 1.7 V was\nrelated to the formation of Li<sub>2</sub>Se by the electrochemical\nreaction between Se and Li<sup>+</sup>. Notably, the\npeak shifted to higher voltages in the following cycles, which was\nattributed to NPC/CGB-Se cathode deformation at the initial lithiation. In the first anodic sweep, the main peak appearing\nat 2.2 V was attributed to the conversion of Li<sub>2</sub>Se into\nSe nanoparticles. The CV of the CGB-Se cathode also showed a similar\npattern except for the weak peak at 2.3 V in the initial discharge\nprofile, which may be due to the irreversible multistep reaction between\nSe and Li<sup>+</sup>. It is noteworthy\nthat the voltage gap between the main cathodic and anodic peaks of\nthe NPC/CGB-Se cathode was much smaller than that between those of\nthe CGB-Se cathode, indicating the lower resistance of the NPC/CGB-Se\ncathode. The initial charge/discharge curves of the NPC/CGB-Se and\nCGB-Se cathodes obtained at 0.5 C (1 C = 675 mA g<sup>\u20131</sup>) are shown in c. The initial discharge profile of the NPC/CGB-Se cathode clearly\nshows a long plateau at about 1.8 V, corresponding to the formation\nof Li<sub>2</sub>Se, and two small plateaus at 2.1 and 2.3 V, attributed\nto the conversion of r-Se to c-Se, which are in good agreement with\nthe CV data. In contrast, the initial discharge profile of the CGB-Se\ncathode did not show any clear plateaus owing to low Se utilization.\nThe initial discharge capacities of the NPC/CGB-Se and CGB-Se cathodes\nmeasured at a current density of 0.5 C were 998 and 343 mA h g<sup>\u20131</sup>, and their corresponding initial Coulombic efficiencies\nwere 66 and 19%, respectively. The high discharge capacity of NPC/CGB-Se\ncathode, which is beyond the theoretical value of 675 mA h g<sup>\u20131</sup>, can be ascribed to the high utilization of short-range ordered\nc-Se, which was formed from NPC/CGB composite with a well-developed\nporous structure. The degree of Se utilization is directly related\nto the capacity value of electrode, thus the formation of short-range\nordered Se results in high initial capacity of NPC/CGB-Se cathode.\nAlso, the irreversible formation of solid electrolyte interphases\n(SEIs) on the surface of electrode during the initial cycle is responsible\nfor the excess initial capacity. In contrast, the low initial discharge\ncapacity of the CGB-Se cathode was due to the barely utilizable bulk\nSe nanoparticles that had formed during melt diffusion. The low Coulombic\nefficiency of CGB-Se was mainly attributed to irreversible Li storage\nin carbon materials. The cycling performances and Coulombic efficiencies\nof the NPC/CGB-Se and CGB-Se cathodes measured at a current density\nof 0.5 C are presented in d. The initial capacity losses and low Coulombic efficiencies\nof electrodes can be ascribed to electrolyte decomposition and to\nthe irreversible formation of solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs),\nwhich have been commonly reported in previous studies. The Coulombic efficiency of the NPC/CGB-Se cathode quickly stabilized\nduring the early few cycles and increased above 99% after the fifth\ncycle. In contrast, that of the CGB-Se cathode reached over 98% after\n77 cycles owing to the low utilization and conductivity of bulk Se.\nThe discharge capacity of the NPC/CGB-Se cathode after the 1000th\ncycle was 462 mA h g<sup>\u20131</sup>, and the capacity retention\nfrom the 10th cycle was 81.4%. The discharge capacity of the CGB-Se\ncathode after the 1000th cycle, on the other hand, was only 51 mA\nh g<sup>\u20131</sup>. The CGB-Se capacity slightly but gradually\nincreased during cycling owing to the formation of ultrafine Se nanoparticles\nduring the activation of bulk Se. NPC/CGB-Se cathode also showed stable\ncycling performances even at high current densities of 1.0 and 2.0\nC. The electrode delivered discharge capacities of 544 and 515 mA\nh g<sup>\u20131</sup> after 100 cycles at current densities of 1.0\nand 2.0 C, respectively (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.8b03104/suppl_file/am8b03104_si_001.pdf\">Figure S7</ext-link>).</p><p>The rate capabilities of the NPC/CGB-Se and CGB-Se cathodes\nare\ndisplayed in e. The discharge capacities of NPC/CGB-Se at current densities of\n0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 7.0, 10.0, and 15.0 C were 564, 552, 527, 487,\n467, 442, and 409 mA h g<sup>\u20131</sup>, respectively. It is\nworth mentioning that a satisfactory capacity of 409 mA h g<sup>\u20131</sup> was achieved even at a high current density of 15.0 C. Furthermore,\nthe composites regained most of their discharge capacities when the\ncurrent density returned to 0.5 C. The CGB-Se cathode discharge capacity\nfell below 5 mA h g<sup>\u20131</sup> at a relatively low current\ndensity of 5.0 C. In consideration of the requirements for scale-up\nfabrication, NPC/CGB-Se cathode with higher areal Se loading was also\nprepared. Although the Se loading increased to 1.8 mg cm<sup>\u20132</sup>, the discharge capacity of NPC/CGB-Se cathode at 0.5 C still maintained\nat 380 mA h g<sup>\u20131</sup> after 90 cycles (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.8b03104/suppl_file/am8b03104_si_001.pdf\">Figure S8</ext-link>).

Hierarchically porous N-doped carbon polyhedrons anchored on crumpled graphene balls (NPC/CGBs) are synthesized by carbonizing a zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8)/CGB composite precursor, producing an unprecedented effective host matrix for high-performance Li-Se batteries. Mesoporous CGBs obtained by one-pot spray pyrolysis are used as a highly conductive matrix for uniform polyhedral ZIF-8 growth. During carbonization, ZIF-8 polyhedrons on mesoporous CGBs are converted into N-doped carbon polyhedrons showing abundant micropores, forming a high-surface-area, high-pore-volume hierarchically porous NPC/CGB composite whose small unique pores effectively confine Se during melt diffusion, thereby providing conductive electron pathways. Thus, the integrated NPC/CGB-Se composite ensures high Se utilization originating from complete electrochemical reactions between Se and Li ions. The NPC/CGB-Se composite cathode exhibits high discharge capacities (998 and 462 mA h g-1 at the 1st and 1000th cycles, respectively, at a 0.5 C current density), good capacity retention (68%, calculated from the 3rd cycle), and excellent rate capability. A discharge capacity of 409 mA h g-1 is achieved even at an extremely high (15.0 C) current density.\n\nThe surface areas and detailed pore structures of unloaded and Se-loaded NPC/CGB and CGB were investigated by N2 sorption. As shown in a, both unloaded samples show a typical IV isotherm with a hysteresis loop due to mesopores in the CGB matrix. Notably, the NPC/CGB composite isotherm displays large uptake in the low PP o -1 range, which is attributed to the composite micropores. As confirmed in the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distributions (b), the sharp peak at ~4 nm in the NPC/CGB composite isotherm showed higher intensity, indicating that the small mesopores were more developed when the CGBs were combined with the NPC polyhedrons. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of NPC/CGB and CGB were 541.6 and 235.8 m2 g-1, respectively. The surface area of the Se-loaded NPC/CGB composite had significantly decreased to 21.2 m2 g-1, and the corresponding BJH plots did not show any peaks, indicating that Se had fully infiltrated the available composite pores (c,d). Meanwhile, CGB-Se showed a larger surface area than NPC/CGB owing to the agglomeration of Se nanoparticles generating empty mesopores in the CGB matrix.\n\nTo investigate the C and Se structural characteristics of NPC/CGB-Se and CGB-Se composites, Raman spectra were obtained, as shown in a,b. The NPC/CGB-Se composite exhibited a broad band at 259 cm-1, which was attributed to the combination of chainlike Se (c-Se, 257 cm-1) and ringlike Se (r-Se, 267 cm-1) short-range ordered band modes. In addition, the Raman spectra did not show any peaks corresponding to trigonal Se (t-Se, 237 cm-1), indicating that the composites only contained short-range ordered Se. The Raman spectrum for the CGB-Se composite is similar to that for the NPC/CGB-Se composite except for the weak peak corresponding to t-Se, suggesting that the unique NPC/CGB composite pore structure had facilitated the formation of short-range ordered Se, thereby resulting in high Se utilization and excellent electrochemical performance for Li-Se batteries. In b, the Raman spectra show two major peaks at 1360 and 1590 cm-1, correlating with the D- and G-bands of defected graphitic carbon materials, respectively. The G-band is attributed to sp2-hybridized bonded C atoms, whereas the D-band is assigned to the defects in carbon materials. The relative intensity ratio (I D/I G) of the two bands correlates with the degree of sample graphitization. The I D/I G values of NPC/CGB-Se and CGB-Se were calculated as 0.99 and 1.08, respectively. The lower I D/I G value for NPC/CGB-Se was due to graphitic layers produced in NPC and CGB during high-temperature annealing at 900 \u00b0C. The thermal behaviors of NPC/CGB-Se and CGB-Se were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under an inert Ar atmosphere (c). The considerable weight losses of both samples occurred in the range of 300-550 \u00b0C, which is attributed to Se volatilization within the carbon matrix. The weight loss of the NPC/CGB-Se composite occurred at a higher temperature than that of the CGB-Se composite owing to the well-defined porous structure in the NPC/CGB-Se composite. The Se nanoparticles confined to the small NPC/CGB pores required more energy to melt and diffuse, resulting in higher-temperature evaporation. The Se contents of NPC/CGB-Se and CGB-Se were both calculated as 60 wt %.\n\nTo explore the electrochemical behaviors of NPC/CGB-Se and CGB-Se as cathode materials for Li-Se batteries, cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of the two samples were scanned at 0.1 mV s-1 in the range 1.0-3.0 V for the first and fifth cycles (a,b). The voltammogram in a shows weak peaks at 2.1 and 2.3 V in the initial discharge profile, corresponding to the transformation of r-Se to c-Se, which disappeared after further cycling. The distinct reduction peak at 1.7 V was related to the formation of Li2Se by the electrochemical reaction between Se and Li+. Notably, the peak shifted to higher voltages in the following cycles, which was attributed to NPC/CGB-Se cathode deformation at the initial lithiation. In the first anodic sweep, the main peak appearing at 2.2 V was attributed to the conversion of Li2Se into Se nanoparticles. The CV of the CGB-Se cathode also showed a similar pattern except for the weak peak at 2.3 V in the initial discharge profile, which may be due to the irreversible multistep reaction between Se and Li+. It is noteworthy that the voltage gap between the main cathodic and anodic peaks of the NPC/CGB-Se cathode was much smaller than that between those of the CGB-Se cathode, indicating the lower resistance of the NPC/CGB-Se cathode. The initial charge/discharge curves of the NPC/CGB-Se and CGB-Se cathodes obtained at 0.5 C (1 C = 675 mA g-1) are shown in c. The initial discharge profile of the NPC/CGB-Se cathode clearly shows a long plateau at about 1.8 V, corresponding to the formation of Li2Se, and two small plateaus at 2.1 and 2.3 V, attributed to the conversion of r-Se to c-Se, which are in good agreement with the CV data. In contrast, the initial discharge profile of the CGB-Se cathode did not show any clear plateaus owing to low Se utilization. The initial discharge capacities of the NPC/CGB-Se and CGB-Se cathodes measured at a current density of 0.5 C were 998 and 343 mA h g-1, and their corresponding initial Coulombic efficiencies were 66 and 19%, respectively. The high discharge capacity of NPC/CGB-Se cathode, which is beyond the theoretical value of 675 mA h g-1, can be ascribed to the high utilization of short-range ordered c-Se, which was formed from NPC/CGB composite with a well-developed porous structure. The degree of Se utilization is directly related to the capacity value of electrode, thus the formation of short-range ordered Se results in high initial capacity of NPC/CGB-Se cathode. Also, the irreversible formation of solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) on the surface of electrode during the initial cycle is responsible for the excess initial capacity. In contrast, the low initial discharge capacity of the CGB-Se cathode was due to the barely utilizable bulk Se nanoparticles that had formed during melt diffusion. The low Coulombic efficiency of CGB-Se was mainly attributed to irreversible Li storage in carbon materials. The cycling performances and Coulombic efficiencies of the NPC/CGB-Se and CGB-Se cathodes measured at a current density of 0.5 C are presented in d. The initial capacity losses and low Coulombic efficiencies of electrodes can be ascribed to electrolyte decomposition and to the irreversible formation of solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs), which have been commonly reported in previous studies. The Coulombic efficiency of the NPC/CGB-Se cathode quickly stabilized during the early few cycles and increased above 99% after the fifth cycle. In contrast, that of the CGB-Se cathode reached over 98% after 77 cycles owing to the low utilization and conductivity of bulk Se. The discharge capacity of the NPC/CGB-Se cathode after the 1000th cycle was 462 mA h g-1, and the capacity retention from the 10th cycle was 81.4%. The discharge capacity of the CGB-Se cathode after the 1000th cycle, on the other hand, was only 51 mA h g-1. The CGB-Se capacity slightly but gradually increased during cycling owing to the formation of ultrafine Se nanoparticles during the activation of bulk Se. NPC/CGB-Se cathode also showed stable cycling performances even at high current densities of 1.0 and 2.0 C. The electrode delivered discharge capacities of 544 and 515 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at current densities of 1.0 and 2.0 C, respectively (Figure S7).\n\nThe rate capabilities of the NPC/CGB-Se and CGB-Se cathodes are displayed in e. The discharge capacities of NPC/CGB-Se at current densities of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 7.0, 10.0, and 15.0 C were 564, 552, 527, 487, 467, 442, and 409 mA h g-1, respectively. It is worth mentioning that a satisfactory capacity of 409 mA h g-1 was achieved even at a high current density of 15.0 C. Furthermore, the composites regained most of their discharge capacities when the current density returned to 0.5 C. The CGB-Se cathode discharge capacity fell below 5 mA h g-1 at a relatively low current density of 5.0 C. In consideration of the requirements for scale-up fabrication, NPC/CGB-Se cathode with higher areal Se loading was also prepared. Although the Se loading increased to 1.8 mg cm-2, the discharge capacity of NPC/CGB-Se cathode at 0.5 C still maintained at 380 mA h g-1 after 90 cycles (Figure S8). Owing to effective confinement of Se within NPC/CGB matrix, the cathode with higher areal Se loading showed good cycling performance.\n\nTo explain the role of CGB in the composite, NPC-Se cathode was tested under same conditions with other cathodes (Figure S9). As shown in Figure S9a, NPC-Se cathode delivered specific capacity of 374 mA h g-1 after 80 cycles, which is lower than NPC/CGB-Se composites. Furthermore, the specific capacity rapidly decreased when tested at high current densities (Figure S9b). These results clearly showed that the combination of porous NPC and conductive CGB enhances the electrochemical performance.
