The synthetic approach for MAF-7-coated FCAT (FCAT@MAF-7) was analogous to that of FCAT@ZIF-8; however, Zn(NO3)2\u22c56H2O was used as the metal source and dilute ammonium hydroxide solution was employed as a base. To compare the activities of encapsulated and surface-adsorbed FCAT, we also synthesized biocomposites by mixing FCAT with pure ZIF-8, ZIF-90, or MAF-7 crystals in water at room temperature (RT) for 4 h. Rigorous washing procedures (e.g., 10% w/w aqueous sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)) could not effectively remove the surface-adsorbed FCAT-on-ZIF-90 and FCAT-on-MAF-7 (Figures S2-S4), and thus, to be consistent, all as-synthesized biocomposites were washed only with water to remove the loosely adsorbed FCAT from the ZIF surface. The prepared biocomposites are illustrated in a. In addition, to elucidate the formation mechanism of the CAT/MOF biocomposities, synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments (stop-flow setup) were conducted to examine the MOF formation in the presence or absence of CAT. Experimental results reveal that CAT@ZIF-8 is formed through the biomineralization process (Figure S5); however, CAT@MAF-7 and CAT@ZIF-90 are formed through a coprecipitation mechanism (Figure S5).", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 18, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Schematic representations of the different\nFCAT/ZIF biocomposites\nformed by encapsulation of enzyme molecules via biomimetic mineralization\nor surface adsorption within/on hydrophobic (orange) or hydrophilic\n(blue) frameworks.

The FTIR spectrum of pure catalase is shown in , Figures S13 and S14. The characteristic normal modes of vibration of the peptide backbone are the amide I (1700-1610 cm-1) and amide II (1595-1480 cm-1) bands. The amide I vibration is mainly comprised of the C\ue5fbO stretching vibration (~80%), with minor contributions from the out-of-phase CN stretching vibration, the CCN deformation, and the NH in-plane bend. The amide I band is the most intense feature in the FTIR spectrum and, therefore, is commonly used to assess the secondary structure of a given protein. The amide I band of dehydrated CAT shows three major spectral contributions (1683, 1654, and 1635 cm-1) ( and Figure S13) that are more clearly observed in the second derivative spectrum in b,d,f and S13. The spectral component centered at 1654 cm-1 is assigned to \u03b1-helix motifs while the feature at 1635 cm-1 can be attributed to intramolecular \u03b2-sheets. The least intense feature at 1683 cm-1 is engendered by protein turns and loops. The position of these peaks is dependent on the secondary structure of CAT, which is a tetramer composed of four subunits, which contains both \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet motifs in the proportions 30% and 18%, respectively (PDB ID 1A4E ). The amide II mode (1595-1480 cm-1) is the out-of-phase combination of the N-H in plane bending (~60%) and the CN stretching (~40%) vibrations with smaller contributions from the CO in-plane bend and the CC and NC stretching vibrations. Typically, the amide II band is less influenced by protein secondary structure with respect to the amide I band. In the case of CAT, the amide II band shows a major contribution at 1545 cm-1, which is due to an \u03b1-helix motif.

We believe that\nthe slightly slower reaction rates of FCAT-on-MAF-7 and FCAT-on-ZIF-90\ncompared to those of FCAT@MAF-7 and FCAT@ZIF-90 may be attributed\nto hindered substrate diffusion and/or changed enzyme orientation\nthat is engendered by close packing of FCAT on the MOF surface (surface-crowding\neffect). To provide a more comprehensive comparison of the FCAT/MOF biocomposite\nwith free FCAT, we evaluated the Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetic parameters\n(<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.8b10302/suppl_file/ja8b10302_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S28</ext-link> and <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.8b10302/suppl_file/ja8b10302_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Table S2</ext-link>).

The loss of activity for the FCAT/ZIF-8 biocomposites could be\ndue to a number of factors, such as (1) the presence of the acetate\nanion inhibiting the FCAT activity, (2) binding of HmIM to the iron-heme\nactive site of FCAT during the synthesis process, (3) denaturation\nof the enzyme during the encapsulation or surface immobilization process\nas a result of hydrophobic interactions between FCAT and ZIF-8, and/or\n(4) hindered diffusion of the substrate (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)/product (H<sub>2</sub>O) by the hydrophobic framework of ZIF-8\n(for FCAT@ZIF-8). Importantly, CAT (i.e., not fluorescein tagged)\nwas found to be inactive for the CAT@ZIF-8 composites (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.8b10302/suppl_file/ja8b10302_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S28</ext-link>), indicating the deactivation of FCAT\nin/on ZIF-8 is not ascribed to the enzyme surface functionalization.</p><p>Given that the catalytic activity of the encapsulated enzymes is\npreserved for FCAT@MAF-7 and FCAT@ZIF-90 (c), we sought to examine the capacity of\nthese ZIF coatings to protect the enzymes from inhospitable environments.\nThis \u201cshielding\u201d effect has been previously observed\nfor ZIF-90; thus, it serves as an excellent\nbenchmark material for FCAT@MAF-7. To assess the capacity of the ZIF\ncoating to protect the biological cargo from elevated temperatures,\nwe measured the enzymatic activity for FCAT, FCAT@MAF-7, and FCAT@ZIF-90\nafter incubating the catalysts at 50, 60, and 70 \u00b0C (a and <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.8b10302/suppl_file/ja8b10302_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S29</ext-link>), along with a room temperature (RT,\n25 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C) control experiment. As anticipated, without protection\nvia encapsulation, the activity of free FCAT decreased dramatically\nfrom 3.7 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20133</sup> mM s<sup>\u20131</sup> at\nRT to 0.9 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20133</sup> mM s<sup>\u20131</sup> after\ntreatment at 70 \u00b0C. Consistent with previous studies, ZIF-90\nprovides a degree of protection for embedded FCAT: ca. 80 and 65%\nof its original activity was retained after exposure to 50 and 60\n\u00b0C, respectively. Notably, FCAT@MAF-7 offered far superior protection\nto elevated temperatures than ZIF-90, retaining 79% of its original\nactivity after exposure to a temperature of 70 \u00b0C compared to\n24% and 25% for FCAT and FCAT@ZIF-90, respectively. We then exposed\nthe ZIF-based biocomposites to urea, a chaotropic agent that engenders\nloss of biological function by unfolding proteins.\na shows that free FCAT retained only 8% of its original activity\nafter contact with urea; however, FCAT@MAF-7 and FCAT@ZIF-90 maintained\n89% and 48% of their original activity, respectively. It is worth\nnoting that analogous experiments employing FCAT-on-MAF-7 and FCAT-on-ZIF-90\nled to essentially complete deactivation of the surface-adsorbed protein\n(<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.8b10302/suppl_file/ja8b10302_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S30</ext-link>). Thus, by exposing FCAT@MAF-7\nand FCAT@ZIF-90 to urea, we were observing only enzymatic activity\nfrom encapsulated enzyme. In the presence of protease (2 mg mL<sup>\u20131</sup> for 4 h at RT) FCAT@MAF-7 retained 85% of its original\nactivity compared to only 14% for free FCAT and 19% for FCAT@ZIF-90\n(a and <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.8b10302/suppl_file/ja8b10302_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S31</ext-link>). Both MAF-7 and ZIF-90 possess \u00c5-sized\npore apertures that would size-exclude the protease and prevent contact\nwith the embedded enzyme. These observations are commensurate with\nurea treatment and is again presumably due to the deactivation of\nthe surface-adsorbed enzyme, which is more significant in FCAT@ZIF-90\n(<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.8b10302/suppl_file/ja8b10302_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S31</ext-link>). Finally, both MAF-7 and ZIF-90\nprotect the embedded FCAT from organic solvents (a). Specifically, FCAT@MAF-7\nmaintained 96% and 64% of its original activity after exposure to\ndimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and tetrahydrofuran (THF), respectively.\nIn comparison, the activity of free FCAT is significantly diminished\nupon exposure to these solvents (a). These experiments suggest that MAF-7\noffers superior protection to enzymes than other reported ZIFs and\nmay provide the stability necessary for the enzymes to retain their\nperformance under commercially relevant conditions.\n</p><p>Encouraged by the excellent stability\nof FCAT@MAF-7, we sought\nto investigate recyclability, a critical performance metric for practical\napplications. We cycled FCAT@MAF-7 ten times without an appreciable\nreduction in enzymatic activity (b).

In contrast to the FCAT/ZIF-8 biocomposites, FCAT@MAF-7 showed comparable activity to that of free FCAT: 3.2 \u00d7 10-3 mM s-1 for FCAT@MAF-7 versus 4.4 \u00d7 10-3 mM s-1 for free FCAT (c, Figures S24 and S25). Additionally, FCAT@ZIF-90 showed a substantial reduction in activity compared to the free enzyme (1.4 \u00d7 10-3 mM s-1, c and Figure S26). We believe that the slightly slower reaction rates of FCAT-on-MAF-7 and FCAT-on-ZIF-90 compared to those of FCAT@MAF-7 and FCAT@ZIF-90 may be attributed to hindered substrate diffusion and/or changed enzyme orientation that is engendered by close packing of FCAT on the MOF surface (surface-crowding effect). To provide a more comprehensive comparison of the FCAT/MOF biocomposite with free FCAT, we evaluated the Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters (Figure S28 and Table S2). The K m and k cat values for FCAT@MAF-7 are 0.99 mM and 950 s-1, respectively (Table S2), which are comparable to those of free FCAT and superior to those of FCAT@ZIF-90 (Figure S28 and Table S2). The loss of activity for the FCAT/ZIF-8 biocomposites could be due to a number of factors, such as (1) the presence of the acetate anion inhibiting the FCAT activity, (2) binding of HmIM to the iron-heme active site of FCAT during the synthesis process, (3) denaturation of the enzyme during the encapsulation or surface immobilization process as a result of hydrophobic interactions between FCAT and ZIF-8, and/or (4) hindered diffusion of the substrate (H2O2)/product (H2O) by the hydrophobic framework of ZIF-8 (for FCAT@ZIF-8). Importantly, CAT (i.e., not fluorescein tagged) was found to be inactive for the CAT@ZIF-8 composites (Figure S28), indicating the deactivation of FCAT in/on ZIF-8 is not ascribed to the enzyme surface functionalization.\n\nGiven that the catalytic activity of the encapsulated enzymes is preserved for FCAT@MAF-7 and FCAT@ZIF-90 (c), we sought to examine the capacity of these ZIF coatings to protect the enzymes from inhospitable environments. This \"shielding\" effect has been previously observed for ZIF-90; thus, it serves as an excellent benchmark material for FCAT@MAF-7. To assess the capacity of the ZIF coating to protect the biological cargo from elevated temperatures, we measured the enzymatic activity for FCAT, FCAT@MAF-7, and FCAT@ZIF-90 after incubating the catalysts at 50, 60, and 70 \u00b0C (a and Figure S29), along with a room temperature (RT, 25 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C) control experiment. As anticipated, without protection via encapsulation, the activity of free FCAT decreased dramatically from 3.7 \u00d7 10-3 mM s-1 at RT to 0.9 \u00d7 10-3 mM s-1 after treatment at 70 \u00b0C. Consistent with previous studies, ZIF-90 provides a degree of protection for embedded FCAT: ca. 80 and 65% of its original activity was retained after exposure to 50 and 60 \u00b0C, respectively. Notably, FCAT@MAF-7 offered far superior protection to elevated temperatures than ZIF-90, retaining 79% of its original activity after exposure to a temperature of 70 \u00b0C compared to 24% and 25% for FCAT and FCAT@ZIF-90, respectively. We then exposed the ZIF-based biocomposites to urea, a chaotropic agent that engenders loss of biological function by unfolding proteins. a shows that free FCAT retained only 8% of its original activity after contact with urea; however, FCAT@MAF-7 and FCAT@ZIF-90 maintained 89% and 48% of their original activity, respectively. It is worth noting that analogous experiments employing FCAT-on-MAF-7 and FCAT-on-ZIF-90 led to essentially complete deactivation of the surface-adsorbed protein (Figure S30). Thus, by exposing FCAT@MAF-7 and FCAT@ZIF-90 to urea, we were observing only enzymatic activity from encapsulated enzyme. In the presence of protease (2 mg mL-1 for 4 h at RT) FCAT@MAF-7 retained 85% of its original activity compared to only 14% for free FCAT and 19% for FCAT@ZIF-90 (a and Figure S31). Both MAF-7 and ZIF-90 possess \u00c5-sized pore apertures that would size-exclude the protease and prevent contact with the embedded enzyme. These observations are commensurate with urea treatment and is again presumably due to the deactivation of the surface-adsorbed enzyme, which is more significant in FCAT@ZIF-90 (Figure S31). Finally, both MAF-7 and ZIF-90 protect the embedded FCAT from organic solvents (a). Specifically, FCAT@MAF-7 maintained 96% and 64% of its original activity after exposure to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and tetrahydrofuran (THF), respectively. In comparison, the activity of free FCAT is significantly diminished upon exposure to these solvents (a). These experiments suggest that MAF-7 offers superior protection to enzymes than other reported ZIFs and may provide the stability necessary for the enzymes to retain their performance under commercially relevant conditions. \n\nEncouraged by the excellent stability of FCAT@MAF-7, we sought to investigate recyclability, a critical performance metric for practical applications. We cycled FCAT@MAF-7 ten times without an appreciable reduction in enzymatic activity (b). Furthermore, fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed negligible leaching during repeated usage (Figure S33) and PXRD analysis showed that crystallinity was retained subsequent to the cycling process (Figure S34). Lastly, we explored the generality of MAF-7 as a host for biomacromolecules by performing an analogous set of experiments on fluorescein-tagged urease, FU. After immobilization, FU@MAF-7 retained 82% of the urease activity compared to FU@ZIF-90 (21%) and FU@ZIF-8 (13%) (Figure S43). In addition, compared to ZIF-90 and ZIF-8, MAF-7 provided better protection: FU@MAF-7 maintained 61% of its original activity after heating (70 \u00b0C for 1 h) and 74% after exposure to a proteolytic enzyme (Figure S44).", "data": ["This model's maximum context length is 4097 tokens.
