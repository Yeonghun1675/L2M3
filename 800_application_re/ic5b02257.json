These are in good agreement with previously reported BET surface areas for UiO-67 and with geometrical calculations (see Supporting Information). N2 isotherms acquired after activation from water confirm the decomposition of 1 and 2; following only one cycle of activation from water, sample 1 loses its porosity (s A (BET) < 5 m2 g-1), and the surface area of 2 was reduced to 1112 m2 g-1. For 3, however, only a slight increase was observed, to 1452 m2g-1. After repeated syntheses and measurements of 3 only slight deviations in s A (BET) between as-synthesized and water-activated samples have been observed.\n\nThe newly synthesized MOFs 2 and 3 were found to be slightly less thermally stable than 1, and started to decompose around 400 \u00b0C (see Supporting Information for TGA).\n\nSingle Crystal Structure Analysis\n\nThe structures of the two linkers, 1,1'-binaphthyl-4,4'-dicarboxylic acid (as a DMF solvate) and biphenyl-4,4'-dicarboxylic acid (crystal structure previously unreported of the pure compound), and MOFs 2 and 3 were characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. In the structure of 2 and 3, two positions of the carboxylate oxygen were observed and allocated to missing linkers, in accordance with previous literature reports. TGA measurements also indicate the presence of missing linker defects in the powder samples. The SC-XRD refinement statistics are summarized in .\n\nWater Adsorption Cycles\n\nAll four cycles of water adsorption measured on 3 at 30 \u00b0C exhibit remarkable type IV adsorption isotherms, featuring a well-defined hysteresis loop with two virtually vertical and nearly parallel branches (). This is generally associated with porous materials having a narrow pore-size distribution. At relative humidity of 53% (at 30 \u00b0C) it approaches full loading of water. Although a small decrease of adsorption capacity between each cycle is observed, this is remarkable for a UiO-67-type MOF. While the cause of this decrease in capacity is unknown, it is likely connected to missing linker defects, as this has been shown to have a significant impact on Zr MOF stability, and is present in the measured sample of UiO-67-BN. It may also be affected by the harsh regeneration between each cycle, heating the powder at 250 \u00b0C overnight in vacuum. Further investigations of the synthesis and measurement conditions will clarify whether this is indeed the case.\n\nThe adsorption isotherm has three distinct parts; before, during, and after the water condensation. Initially (p/p 0 = 0.0-0.4), it exhibits a non-negligible rise in adsorption (for p/p 0 = 0.0-0.02), followed by a linear segment (for p/p 0 = 0.02-0.4). If we consider the crystal density of 0.937 for this material, the initial amount of water adsorbed (n 0) corresponds to 0.645 mmol cm-3, or to about 7.5 water molecules per unit cell, which is in good agreement with the 8 water molecules (2 per Zr6-cluster) expected to undergo chemisorption upon rehydroxylation of the cluster. According to the Langmuir equation, more than 90% of the rehydroxylation is completed at a relative partial pressure as low as p/p 0 = 0.015.\n\nThe low k H value of 3 (average log(k H) of -6.4, see ) suggests a hydrophobic behavior and thus limited adsorption at moderate partial water pressure (p/p 0 < 0.4). The values reported by Canivet et al. for the parent UiO-66 and its amino-functionalized derivative have log(k H) values of -3.5 and -2.4, 3 and 4 orders of magnitude higher, respectively. Among the 15 MOFs investigated by these authors, very few exhibit similar hydrophobic features; 3 is actually only comparable to the very hydrophobic ZIF-8 and to In-MIL-68 with log(k H) values of -6.2 and -6.6, respectively.\n\nThe second part of the adsorption isotherm consists of a water condensation phenomenon which occurs at p/p 0 = 0.53 with a significant rise in water adsorption equivalent to 92% of the total water adsorption capacity. This large uptake is followed by the third part, a linear increase that could originate from further ordering of adsorbed water molecules into additional layer(s) with higher pressure, thus increasing the density in the larger pores and allowing some additional adsorption. The total water uptake finally reaches 27.4 mmol/g (0.495 cm3/g) at p/p 0 = 0.90 (see ).\n\nThe CH4 adsorption capacity (), derived from isotherms at 25 \u00b0C (), is moderate for all three MOFs, and below the best performing MOFs. Despite the steric shielding of the cluster corners (which are the preferred gas adsorption sites) and above all the reduction of porosity (by 26% in the case of 3), the volumetric capacity of 3 is 147 cm3(STP) cm-3 at 65 bar, whereas it is 127 for 1 and 135 for 2. This observation seems to encourage the adopted strategy of functionalizing the linker with pending methyl or aryl groups to enhance the interaction with the framework and thus the methane adsorption capacity.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "2583", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "2", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "1978", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "3", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "1416", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["surface_area"]}, {"idx": 17, "type": "table", "classification": ["Crystal"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Summary of Crystallographic Data for MOFs <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup align=\"left\" cols=\"3\">\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\"></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">UiO-67-Me (<bold>2</bold>)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">UiO-67-BN (<bold>3</bold>)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>space group</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic>Fm</italic>3\u0305<italic>m</italic>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic>Fm</italic>3\u0305<italic>m</italic>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic>a</italic>/\u00c5</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>26.8690(3)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>26.8167(2)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic>V</italic>/\u00c5<sup>3</sup>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>19397.9(6)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>19284.8(4)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>radiation</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>synchrotron (\u03bb\u00a0=\u00a00.750)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>2\u0398\u00a0range/deg</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>5.306\u201360.836</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>6.99\u201361.784</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>reflns</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>10\u202f712</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>10\u202f300</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>indep reflns</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1290 [<italic>R</italic>\n<sub>int</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.0161, <italic>R</italic>\n<sub>\u03c3</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.0099]</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1314 [<italic>R</italic>\n<sub>int</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.0400, <italic>R</italic>\n<sub>\u03c3</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.0275]</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>data/restraints/params</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1290/0/63</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1314/0/78</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>GOF\u00a0on\u00a0<italic>F</italic>\n<sup>2</sup>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.146</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.178</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>final <italic>R</italic> indexes [<italic>I</italic>\u00a0\u2265\u00a02\u03c3(<italic>I</italic>)]</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>R1\u00a0=\u00a00.0349, wR2\u00a0=\u00a00.1507</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>R1\u00a0=\u00a00.0323, wR2\u00a0=\u00a00.0953</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>final <italic>R</italic> indexes [all\u00a0data]</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>R1\u00a0=\u00a00.0354, wR2\u00a0=\u00a00.1515</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>R1\u00a0=\u00a00.0338, wR2\u00a0=\u00a00.0965</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>largest diff peak/hole/e\u00a0\u00c5<sup>\u20113</sup>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.74/\u20130.56</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.64/\u20130.50</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "Table 1.
