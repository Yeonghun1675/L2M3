Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Figure S2a) reveal that the Ni-BTC presents a spherical-shaped structure and Cu-BTC possesses a typical octahedral structure (Figure S2e). For the bimetallic NiCu-MOFs, with the increasing of Cu content, the structure turned to be a more obvious octahedral-like shape, indicating the successful incorporation of Cu in the bimetallic MOFs. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis (Figure S3) confirms the bond formation process. The peak positions of the three MOFs precursors are very similar. The strong and wide adsorption peak at 3400 cm-1 results from the stretching vibration of the O-H group from water molecules. The peaks around the range of 1370 cm-1 can be attributed to the symmetrical bending vibration of -CH2. All these bands were red-shifted compared with typical -CH2 bonds, illustrating that the -CH2 groups were replaced by electron-donating groups. The peaks around 730 cm-1 might be assigned to the Cu-O stretching vibration. The corresponding infrared absorption peaks also confirmed the successful synthesis of bimetallic MOFs. The thermal stability of materials was investigated by thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), and the results are revealed in Figure S4a-e. Apart from the weight loss (~8 to 9 wt % in general) of the physically adsorbed water around 100-120 \u00b0C, the broad exothermic peaks from 300 to 500 \u00b0C could be attributed to the decomposition of organic matter. At this stage, 37.6 wt % of weight loss in the Ni1Cu2-BTC precursor is observed. \n\nFurthermore, the porous information of Ni x Cu y /C500 catalysts was investigated with the N2 adsorption/desorption test. All of the five N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms confirmed the type IV curves according to the results of a. The values of the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and the pore diameter are listed in Table S3, suggesting that the surface area of bimetallic catalysts increased sharply compared to that of homometallic Ni/C500 and Cu/C500 catalysts. The maximum specific surface area of 225.3 m2 g-1 is obtained when the molar ratio of Ni/Cu is 1:1. The pore diameter distribution is shown in b, mainly distributed from 1 to 6 nm. Combined with the SEM characterization results of precursors, the collapse of the MOF structure may also cause the decrease of the pore volume after calcination.\n\nInductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis of Ni1Cu2/C500 confirmed 15.6 wt % Ni and 41.4 wt % Cu in the composition as summarized in Table S1. The deviation was likely due to the solubility of the metals during the hydrothermal synthesis with the possible metal leaching from the hydrothermal solution as detected by ICP-mass spectrometry (MS) and shown in Table S2. The amount of metal leaching in the reaction (0.5 ppm of Ni and 51.2 ppm of Cu) indicates the strong bonding force and ligand effect that existed in the bimetallic Ni-Cu.\n\nCatalytic Performance in the Hydrogenation of LA\n\nAs shown in a, the catalytic performance of the set of Ni x Cu y /C500 catalysts was first screened in a batch reactor in 1,4-dioxane as a solvent at 160 \u00b0C and 2 MPa of H2 pressure for 3 h. The homometallic Ni/C500 showed a very low GVL yield, less than 40%. In comparison, with the formation of the bimetallic NiCu nanoparticles, a higher yield was obtained. The Ni1Cu2/C500 catalyst showed the highest catalytic performance with a 66.8% yield of GVL at the LA conversion of 69.3%. The ligand effect between Ni and Cu could induce the synergetic activities in the Ni x Cu y /C500 catalysts. Besides this, the catalytic performance of Ni1Cu2/C500 was further used to evaluate other reaction parameters. The effect of reaction temperature was then discussed under the constant conditions of 2 MPa H2 and 3 h (b). A remarkable change in the catalytic performance was observed by varying the reaction temperature. LA conversion was found to increase from 7.0 to 99.9% as the temperature increased from 120 to 200 \u00b0C, with the corresponding improvement in the GVL yield from 1.5 to 97.1%. However, higher temperatures (>200 \u00b0C) decreased the yield of GVL and induced side reactions (e.g., formation of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran and pentanoic acid). A temperature of 180 \u00b0C was chosen to explore other factors. The effect of H2 pressure and reaction time was also evaluated and is presented in c,d. Optimum reaction parameters to achieve nearly a full conversion of LA and 93.9% yield of GVL are obtained in 1,4-dioxane at 180 \u00b0C, 2 MPa of H2 pressure, and 3 h of reaction time.\n\nStability of the Catalyst\n\nCatalytic stability is a crucial factor in deciding practical uses. The reusability of the non-noble bimetallic Ni1Cu2/C500 catalyst was investigated for four cycles (Figure S5). After each cycle, the catalyst was removed from the liquid phase through a simple separating and drying process without any regeneration step. Then, fresh substrate LA and 1,4-dioxane solvent were added to the reactor for the next cycle under the action of recovery catalyst. The results of the four-run tests are illustrated in Figure S5. It can be seen that the Ni1Cu2/C500 catalyst can still exhibit good stability after recycling at least four times with almost no obvious loss in the GVL yield. The XRD pattern of the reused Ni1Cu2/C500 after the fourth recycling test is illustrated in Figure S6. The diffraction peaks of homo-Ni gradually emerged, which were likely due to the structural reconstruction. In addition, TEM and XPS analysis of the Ni1Cu2/C500 catalyst after four runs, as shown in Figures S7 and S8, confirms that active sites of metals remain highly dispersed and with nearly no agglomeration, and the chemical state of the Cu metal component of the alloy was maintained, which is the evidence of an unchanged structure, crystal phase, and chemical forms.
