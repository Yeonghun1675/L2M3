The experimental Q st values for H2 at zero loading for NU-111 and PCN-61 are 5.6 and 6.4 kJ mol-1, respectively. The variation in the Q st could be due to the different magnitudes of the more positively charged Cu2+ ion between the two MOFs. The more electropositive Cu2+ ion in NU-111 and PCN-61 carries partial charges of 1.4979 and 1.7155 e -, respectively (). Since the Cu 1 ions in PCN-61 are more positively charged than the Cu 2 ions in NU-111, the former could interact with the negatively charged center-of-mass of the H2 molecule more strongly, which leads to a greater adsorption enthalpy. Indeed, this could explain why both the experimental and simulated H2 Q st values at zero loading in PCN-61 are greater than those for NU-111.
