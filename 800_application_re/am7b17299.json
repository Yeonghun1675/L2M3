The mechanical property, methanol resistance,\nelectrochemistry, and other properties of MNS@SNF-PAEK-XX hybrid membranes\nwere characterized in detail.

This result indicated that bifunctionalized MNS\nrearranged the microstructure of hybrid membranes, which could accelerate\nthe transfer of protons. The hybrid membrane (MNS@SNF-PAEK-3%) showed\na better direct methanol fuel cell performance with a higher peak\npower density of 125.7 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> at 80 \u00b0C and a higher\nopen-circuit voltage (0.839 V) than the pristine membrane.</p><p>FT-IR was used to further confirm the successful synthesis\nof MNS, and the spectra were displayed in b.

Besides, the SEM image in a shows the octahedral structure\nof MNS, as same as MIL-101, which has been reported by previous work.

As shown in , all membranes displayed two decomposition stages. The first\nstage starting from 220 to 330 \u00b0C belonged to the decomposition\nof the grafted flexible sulfoalkyl groups on the side chain, and the\nsecond stage in the range from 400 to 650 \u00b0C was assigned to\nthe degradation of the polymer backbone.

After the addition of MNS,\nthe <italic>T</italic>\n<sub>d5%</sub> increased from 244.93 to 266.51\n\u00b0C. It is because of the cross-linked structure formed by MNS,\nrestraining the decomposition of the polymer matrix. Therefore, the\ncomposite membranes have good thermal stabilities to be used for DMFCs.</p><p>As summarized\nin , all these\nMNS@SNF-PAEK-XX and SNF-PAEK membranes showed higher strength properties\nof tensile strength (33.38\u201336.97 MPa) and Young\u2019s modulus\n(0.90\u20131.06 GPa) than those of tensile strength and Young\u2019s\nmodulus of recast Nafion of 13.7 MPa and 0.24 GPa, respectively. With\nincreasing the amount of MNS addition, Young\u2019s modulus increased\nfrom 0.90 to 1.06 GPa, whereas the tensile strength increased from\n33.38 to 36.97 MPa. However, the elongation at break decreased sharply\nfrom 118 to 10% as the content of MNS varied from 1\u20135%. Besides,\nthe stress\u2013strain curves of MNS@SNF-PAEK-XX membranes are shown\nin Figure S4 (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.7b17299/suppl_file/am7b17299_si_001.pdf\">Supporting Information</ext-link>).\nIt is because MNS at an increasing content exists as an ionic cross-linker\nin the composite membranes. Because the amino groups of ethylenediamine\nwere immobilized onto the metal\u2013oxygen clusters of MIL-101,\nthey could be cross-linked with the polymer matrix of SNF-PAEK by\nthe formation of electrostatic forces between sulfonic groups and\namino groups.

However, the water uptake of MNS@SNF-PAEK-4%\nand MNS@SNF-PAEK-5% (45.03 and 43.08%, respectively) was lower than\nthat of SNF-PAEK because of higher density of the cross-linking structure\nformed between MNS and the polymer matrix, which restricted the water\nabsorption. Meanwhile, all hybrid membranes exhibited lower water\nuptake (75.55\u201362.46%) than pristine membrane (75.66%) at 80\n\u00b0C.

Then, MNS was incorporated into a SNF-PAEK matrix as an inorganic nanofiller to prepare a series of organic-inorganic hybrid membranes (MNS@SNF-PAEK-XX). The mechanical property, methanol resistance, electrochemistry, and other properties of MNS@SNF-PAEK-XX hybrid membranes were characterized in detail. We found that the mechanical strength and methanol resistances of these hybrid membranes were improved by the formation of an ionic cross-linking structure between -NH2 of MNS and -SO3H on the side chain of SNF-PAEK. Particularly, the proton conductivity of these hybrid membranes increased obviously after the addition of MNS. MNS@SNF-PAEK-3% exhibited the proton conductivity of 0.192 S\u22c5cm-1, which was much higher than those of the pristine membrane (0.145 S\u22c5cm-1) and recast Nafion (0.134 S\u22c5cm-1) at 80 \u00b0C. This result indicated that bifunctionalized MNS rearranged the microstructure of hybrid membranes, which could accelerate the transfer of protons. The hybrid membrane (MNS@SNF-PAEK-3%) showed a better direct methanol fuel cell performance with a higher peak power density of 125.7 mW/cm2 at 80 \u00b0C and a higher open-circuit voltage (0.839 V) than the pristine membrane.\n\nFT-IR was used to further confirm the successful synthesis of MNS, and the spectra were displayed in b. Compared to pristine MIL-101, all intermediates and target MNS showed the characteristic peaks at 2934 and 3263 cm-1, ascribing to the absorption peaks for \u03bd(CH) and \u03bd(NH), respectively, which indicated the successful grafting of N-boc-ethylenediamine and the remain of ethylenediamine after sulfonation. In addition, the IR adsorption band at 1207 cm-1 for MIL-101-SO3H-NHBOC and MNS was assigned to the asymmetric vibration mode of -SO3H. Besides, the postsynthetic modification was also proved via XPS analysis (Supporting Information), where the sulfur XPS signal appeared at a binding energy of 168.97 eV corresponding to S6+ of the sulfonic acid group, whereas the nitrogen XPS signal appeared at a binding energy of 402.06 eV corresponding to N 1s of ethylenediamine that was attached to metal-oxygen clusters. Then, we drew a conclusion that MIL-101 was converted into MNS successfully by the postsynthetic modification. Besides, the SEM image in a shows the octahedral structure of MNS, as same as MIL-101, which has been reported by previous work. The result confirmed that MNS still retained its framework structure after modification. The thermodynamic stability of MOFs was measured by TGA (Supporting Information). The result showed that the decomposition temperature at 5% weight loss (T d5%) of MIL-101 and MNS was 200 and 280 \u00b0C, respectively. This indicated that they had good thermal stability to be used in DMFCs.\n\nThermal and Oxidative Stabilities and Mechanical Properties of Membranes\n\nTGA measurements of pristine and hybrid membranes were performed to evaluate whether the membranes were thermally stable within the temperature range for applications in DMFCs. As shown in , all membranes displayed two decomposition stages. The first stage starting from 220 to 330 \u00b0C belonged to the decomposition of the grafted flexible sulfoalkyl groups on the side chain, and the second stage in the range from 400 to 650 \u00b0C was assigned to the degradation of the polymer backbone. According to the data in , all the decomposition temperatures at 5% weight loss (T d5%) of samples were higher than 230 \u00b0C. After the addition of MNS, the T d5% increased from 244.93 to 266.51 \u00b0C. It is because of the cross-linked structure formed by MNS, restraining the decomposition of the polymer matrix. Therefore, the composite membranes have good thermal stabilities to be used for DMFCs.\n\nAs summarized in , all these MNS@SNF-PAEK-XX and SNF-PAEK membranes showed higher strength properties of tensile strength (33.38-36.97 MPa) and Young's modulus (0.90-1.06 GPa) than those of tensile strength and Young's modulus of recast Nafion of 13.7 MPa and 0.24 GPa, respectively. With increasing the amount of MNS addition, Young's modulus increased from 0.90 to 1.06 GPa, whereas the tensile strength increased from 33.38 to 36.97 MPa. However, the elongation at break decreased sharply from 118 to 10% as the content of MNS varied from 1-5%. Besides, the stress-strain curves of MNS@SNF-PAEK-XX membranes are shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information). It is because MNS at an increasing content exists as an ionic cross-linker in the composite membranes. Because the amino groups of ethylenediamine were immobilized onto the metal-oxygen clusters of MIL-101, they could be cross-linked with the polymer matrix of SNF-PAEK by the formation of electrostatic forces between sulfonic groups and amino groups. Furthermore, all inorganic fillers act as a physical cross-linker which blocks the movement of the molecular chain. Hence, the tensile strength of hybrid membranes increases due to the formation of the cross-linked structure, whereas the toughness decreases at a higher density of cross-linking.\n\nIEC, Water Uptake, and Swelling Ratio of Membranes\n\nAs shown in , IEC increased with increasing the content of MNS. There were large amount of sulfonic acid groups on the framework of MNS, so the addition of MNS led to extra more ionic exchange groups into the matrix, thus resulting in a higher IEC.  shows the water uptake and swelling ratio of membranes as a function of temperature. MNS@SNF-PAEK-1%, MNS@SNF-PAEK-2%, and MNS@SNF-PAEK-3% displayed higher water uptake (45.71-47.32%) than the pristine membrane (45.44%) at 30 \u00b0C. This was because extra more hydrophilic groups, such as sulfonic acid groups and amino groups, in the inorganic fillers could absorb more water. However, the water uptake of MNS@SNF-PAEK-4% and MNS@SNF-PAEK-5% (45.03 and 43.08%, respectively) was lower than that of SNF-PAEK because of higher density of the cross-linking structure formed between MNS and the polymer matrix, which restricted the water absorption. Meanwhile, all hybrid membranes exhibited lower water uptake (75.55-62.46%) than pristine membrane (75.66%) at 80 \u00b0C. This could be attributed to the interaction between the polymer matrix and MNS, which suppressed the absorption of water in the membranes. As for dimensional stability, MNS reduced the swelling ratio of the membranes, especially at high temperature (49.65 and 32.10% for SNF-PAEK and MNS@SNF-PAEK-3%, respectively).\n\nProton Conductivity, Methanol Permeability, and Selectivity of Membranes\n\nThe performance of a fuel cell is usually based on the proton conductivity of the PEM materials. The proton conductivities of all membranes were measured at 100% RH and plotted as a function of temperature (). As expected, the proton conductivities increased with increasing the temperature. All the membranes showed a proton conductivity comparable to the recast Nafion. It was interesting to observe that the proton conductivities increased first and then decreased with increasing the amount of MNS addition. The proton conductivities increased from 0.055 to 0.080 S\u22c5cm-1 at 25 \u00b0C and from 0.145 to 0.192 S\u22c5cm-1 at 80 \u00b0C as the content of MNS increased from 0 to 3%. Then, the conductivities decreased from 0.080 to 0.070 S\u22c5cm-1 at 25 \u00b0C and 0.192 to 0.174 S\u22c5cm-1 at 80 \u00b0C when the content of MNS up to 5%. This indicated that too much MNS led the polymer matrix to a high density of cross-linking, which might hinder the motion of the molecular chain. As listed in , MNS@SNF-PAEK-3% exhibited the highest proton conductivity (0.080 S\u22c5cm-1 at 25 \u00b0C and 0.198 S\u22c5cm-1 at 80 \u00b0C) among these hybrid membranes, even higher than that of recast Nafion (0.073 S\u22c5cm-1 at 25 \u00b0C and 0.134 S\u22c5cm-1 at 80 \u00b0C). The results indicated that the hybrid membranes have the potential to be used as the practical PEM for applications in fuel cells.\n\nMethanol permeability of membranes was obtained according to the method mentioned in our previous work, and the data are showed in . It could be found that hybrid membranes displayed a lower methanol permeability of 4.92 \u00d7 10-7 cm2\u22c5s-1 (MNS@SNF-PAEK-4%) compared with the pristine membrane of 6.44 \u00d7 10-7 cm2\u22c5s-1 and recast Nafion (2.18 \u00d7 10-6 cm2\u22c5s-1). In general, proton and methanol utilize the same pathway for transport, thus high conductivity leading to high methanol crossover. Selectivity (\u03c6, S\u22c5s\u22c5cm-3) is another factor to evaluate the methanol resistance property of PEMs, which shows the relationship between proton conductivity and methanol permeability. MNS makes the polymer chain be cross-linked as the hybrid membranes become more compact, and the compact structure improves the methanol resistance of hybrid membranes. For instance, MNS@SNF-PAEK-4% exhibited the highest selectivity of 15.24 \u00d7 104 S\u22c5s\u22c5cm-3, which implied that the hybrid membrane maintained its low methanol permeability even at a high conductivity. However, the extra free MNS destroys the compact structure of the polymer matrix; then, the methanol permeability increases, whereas the selectivity declined when the content of MNS increases up to 5%. However, both the pristine membrane and hybrid membranes performed much better than recast Nafion in methanol resistance (21.87 \u00d7 10-7 cm2\u22c5s-1) and selectivity (3.34 \u00d7 104 S\u22c5s\u22c5cm-3).\n\nSingle Cell Performance\n\nTo further investigate the practical application of the hybrid membranes in DMFC, a single cell measurement was carried out at 25, 40, 60, and 80 \u00b0C. As shown in a-c, the power density of membranes increased obviously with increasing the operating temperature, which is similar to the tendency of proton conductivity. d shows the peak power density of SNF-PAEK, MNS@SNF-PAEK-3%, and recast Nafion at different temperatures. The hybrid membrane (MNS@SNF-PAEK-3%) demonstrated a higher power density than the pristine SNF-PAEK membrane, especially at a low operating temperature. For instance, MNS@SNF-PAEK-3% gave peak power densities of 23.5 mW/cm2 at 25 \u00b0C and 40.2 mW/cm2 at 40 \u00b0C, much higher than those of SNF-PAEK (14.9 mW/cm2 at 25 \u00b0C and 28.6 mW/cm2 at 40 \u00b0C) and recast Nafion (9.1 mW/cm2 at 25 \u00b0C and 10.9 mW/cm2 at 40 \u00b0C). Furthermore, MNS@SNF-PAEK-3% reached high levels of peak power density at high temperatures, 79.5 mW/cm2 at 60 \u00b0C and 125.7 mW/cm2 at 80 \u00b0C. In short, higher power density is attributed to higher proton conductivity of the hybrid membrane. In addition, owing to a superior methanol resistance, MNS@SNF-PAEK-3% showed better open-circuit voltages, 0.839 V in average, compared with those of SNF-PAEK of 0.816 V and recast Nafion of 0.634 V. The maximum peak power densities of different membranes at different temperatures can be found in Table S2 (Supporting Information).
