Information concerning crystallographic data collection and structure refinement details is summarized in Table S5. Tables S1 and S2 gather the most significant geometrical parameters of the crystallographically independent Tb3+ coordination sphere and possible supramolecular contacts.\n\nPhotoluminescence and Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Calculations\n\nThe UV-vis absorption spectra of H8btp in ethanol solutions (1.0 \u00d7 10-4 and 6.2 \u00d7 10-4 mol\u22c5L-1) exhibit a broad band at 255 nm with high molar absorption coefficients, characteristic of singlet intraligand (1IL) \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* transitions, and a residual component peaking at ca. 325 nm for the concentrated solution (Figure S3). To rationalize the UV-vis absorption results, the theoretical singlet electronic transitions, oscillator strengths, and molecular orbitals involved in the selected transitions (containing the ethanol solvent effects) were assessed by TD-DFT calculations, for a ground-state H8btp singlet S 0 monomeric structure (Figure S4a). Very good agreement is observed between the calculated lowest singlet, with the largest oscillator strength at 254 nm, and the experimental lowest-energy absorption maximum at 255 nm. A monomeric model cannot explain the small band at 325 nm given by the concentrated solution. This band is ascribed to the equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric structures; that is, to an excimer. To validate this hypothesis, the excitation spectra of H8btp ethanol solutions of concentration 4.0 \u00d7 10-5, 2.0 \u00d7 10-4, and 1.0 \u00d7 10-3 mol\u22c5L-1, monitoring the emission at 405 nm, were recorded (Figure S5). As the H8btp concentration decreases, the intensity of the 310-390 nm bands also decreases, in contrast with the increasing intensity of the 260-290 nm bands, confirming the above hypothesis.\n\nEmission spectra of 2 also witness the S 2,1 \u2192 S 0 ligand transitions and excimer emission (b). At 12 K, the spectrum excited at 300 nm is dominated by a broad band from ca. 440 to 580 nm, attributed to the ligand's phosphorescence, with a T 1 triplet-state energy of 22676 cm-1 (441 nm). However, this phosphorescence disappears upon excitation of the excimer at 370 nm (b). As shown in Figure S6, all the main luminescence characteristics of 2, namely, the fluorescence emission from both S 2,1 and excimer, are observed in the isolated H8btp ligand and, therefore, are intrinsic to it. The low intensity of excimer emission relatively to S 2,1 \u2192 S 0 emission (284 nm excitation) is expected, because in the MOF structure \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between the aromatic rings of the ligands () favor excimer formation. The small shift to higher energy of the emission bands of H8btp in ethanolic solution relative to 2, and the distinct vibronic structure observed for the phosphorescence emission (Figure S6), may be due to the different protonation level and coordination modes of H5btp3-.\n\nThe ambient temperature time-resolved emission spectra of 1 (Figure S8) and the decay curves (Figure S9) further confirm the assignment of S 2,1 \u2192 S 0 transition and excimer emission. Indeed, these emissions display similar time dependence, much faster than the intra-4f Tb3+ lines. Moreover, the measured lifetimes (emission at 425 nm) are \u03c41 = 2.33 \u00b1 0.10 ns, \u03b11 = 94.4%, \u03c42 = 4.67 \u00b1 0.11 ns, \u03b12 = 5.6%, and \u03c72 = 2.2 for 1 and \u03c41 = 2.98 \u00b1 0.05 ns, \u03b11 = 91.0%, \u03c42 = 5.59 \u00b1 0.14 ns, \u03b12 = 9.0%, and \u03c72 = 2.4 for 2. The detection of two lifetimes is ascribed to the two distinct H5btp3- coordinating groups revealed by crystallography. Our excitation source does not allow excitation of the S 2,1 emission, and thus the decay curves were not measured. The 5D4 decay curves of 1 were recorded at 295 and 12 K. The data are well-described by single-exponential decay functions (Figure S10), yielding lifetimes of 1.23 \u00b1 0.01 ms at 295 K and 2.92 \u00b1 0.01 ms at 13 K, in agreement with the presence of a single Tb3+ crystallographic site. The increase of emission lifetime with decreasing temperature is the result of nonradiative deactivation pathways, also responsible for the increase in ligand-to-Tb3+ energy transfer.\n\nNext, the lowest-excited triplet state of the H8btp monomer was studied by geometry optimization by the unrestricted method (Figure S4d). The \u0394SCF approach was applied and, upon geometry relaxation in the T 1 state, an excitation energy of 420 nm was calculates, in good agreement with the 436 nm experimental value of the 0-0 onset energy of the triplet phosphorescence emission at 12 K (Figure S6).\n\nLuminescence Temperature Dependence\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, an excimer emission has not yet been used for implementing ratiometric luminescence thermometry. Thus, the excimer emission (together with Tb3+ emission) observed in the present system offers a unique opportunity to assess this possibility and to compare it with the more \"conventional\" optical thermometry based on ligand fluorescence. For this purpose, the ratios of the integrated areas of the 5D4 \u2192 7F5 (I Tb, 534-560 nm) and of the (i) excimer emission (I  E , 390-476 nm) and (ii) ligand S 2,1 \u2192 S 0 emission (I S, 316-386 nm) were used to define the thermometric parameters (\u0394E = I Tb/I E and \u0394S = I Tb/I S), allowing the conversion of emission intensities into absolute temperatures. The emission spectra of 1 at 299-319 K are presented in a. Four consecutive emission spectra were recorded at each temperature and used to determine the average thermometric parameters, with the errors calculated from the corresponding standard deviations (95% confidence). From 299 to 319 K, I Tb, I E, and I S decrease 34%, 18%, and 13%, respectively, (b).\n\n a depicts the temperature dependence of \u0394E and \u0394S in the 299-319 K range: solid lines depict the calibration curves obtained by fitting the experimental data with linear equations [\u0394(T) = \u03940 + mT], with \u03940 = 34.94 \u00b1 0.71 and m = 0.0922 \u00b1 0.0023 (r 2 = 0.99) for \u0394S and \u03940 = 20.18 \u00b1 0.70 and m = 0.0507 \u00b1 0.0023 (r 2 = 0.98) for \u0394E. The corresponding relative sensitivity, defined as S r = |\u2202\u0394/\u2202T|/\u0394, a figure of merit used to compare the performance of thermometers independently of their nature, is shown in b. These ratiometric thermometers exhibit good relative sensitivities in the physiological range, with similar maximal relative sensitivities (S m) of 1.66 and 1.26%\u22c5K-1 at 319 K, respectively, for \u0394S and \u0394E. Thus, even if the singlet-based thermometer outperforms the excimer-based thermometer, the latter is a possible alternative. Concerning S m, the singlet-based thermometer is the third highest reported to date for MOF-based visible luminescent ratiometric thermometers operating in the physiological range. S m of 4.47%\u22c5K-1 at 333 K was reported for Tb0.995Eu0.005@In(OH)(bpydc), where bpydc = 2,2'-bipyridine-5,5'-dicarboxylic acid, and 2.19%\u22c5K-1 at 293 K for Eu@UiO(bpydc). In addition, at the reference human body temperature (309 K), S r for our \u0394S (1.43%\u22c5K-1) is similar to the best S r values (1.57 and 1.63%\u22c5K-1) reported for prior visible luminescent ratiometric Ln-based MOFs ().", "data": ["This model's maximum context length is 4097 tokens.
