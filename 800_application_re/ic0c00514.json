The kinetic behaviors of as-prepared samples for RhB degradation were further investigated. As illustrated in c, all of them fit well with the pseudo-first-order correlation. On the basis of the plots, the calculated degradation apparent rate constants of the catalysts are 0.122, 0.0426, and 0.0029 min-1 for Co9S8@ZnAgInS-5, ZnAgInS, and Co9S8 (d), respectively. The Co9S8@ZnAgInS-5 is 3 and 42 times higher than that of ZnAgInS and Co9S8, respectively. Figure S6 shows the results of recycling tests of Co9S8@ZnAgInS-5 for photocatalytic degradation of RhB. The photocatalytic activity does not show a significant decrease in five successive cycles, indicating the high stability of the as-prepared composite.\n\nPhotocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution\n\nThe photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activities of the as-prepared samples were evaluated under simulated solar light irradiation using ascorbic acid (AA) as a scavenger. As shown in , bare Co9S8 is almost inactive to photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, probably due to its high recombination rate of photoinduced charges. Pristine ZnAgInS exhibits low photocatalytic activity with a H2 evolution rate of 2171.3 \u03bcmol g-1 h-1. However, after coupling with Co9S8 to form the composite Co9S8@ZnAgInS, the catalytic activity is substantially promoted, with the highest hydrogen evolution rate being 9395.3 \u03bcmol g-1 h-1, which is about 4.3 and many times higher than that of pure ZnAgInS and Co9S8, respectively. Interestingly, the obtained result is also higher than for other similar materials reported in the previous literatures (Table S2). As shown in a and b, the H2 evolution rates over the Co9S8@ZnAgInS composite increase with increasing Co9S8 content, achieving a maximum value of 9395.3 \u03bcmol g-1 h-1 with a Co9S8 content of 5%. However, further increasing the Co9S8 content leads to a decrease of photocatalytic H2 evolution rates. It is obvious that the Co9S8 content in the composite greatly affects the photocatalytic activity of the composite. When the Co9S8 content is relatively low (<5%), the enhanced photocatalytic activity of Co9S8@ZnAgInS can be ascribed to the formation of a heterojunction, which accelerates the transfer and separation of photoinduced charges, enhances solar light harvesting, and offers large surface area and active sites for photocatalytic reaction. Nevertheless, excessive Co9S8 causes a reduction in the photocatalytic efficiency. The decrease is probably due to the following reasons: (i) Accompanying the increase of Co9S8 content, the content of ZnAgInS, which is the main activity substance, will decrease relatively. (ii) Excessive Co9S8 may turn into a recombination center for photoinduced charges.
