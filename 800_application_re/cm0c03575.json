The differences in the distribution of the total and network-accessible surface areas obtained from PB v4.0 are remarkable. The most striking feature is the large number of MOFs that have a surface area close to zero (they are not strictly zero as materials with strictly zero surface areas have been already eliminated in the preliminary screening of the 57000 MOFs). This implies that the CSD MOF subset, i.e., the database compiling all the reported MOFs from the literature, is dominated by materials with low surface areas and porosities. Even within this smaller subset of 12052 porous MOFs, more than 3000 have total surface areas below 50 m2/g, and only 2455 MOFs have total surface areas above 1000 m2/g\ue5f8i.e., only about 20% of ca. 12000 MOFs. However, we also need to be aware that some materials will appear in this analysis as nonporous, whereas, in reality, they are porous, with windows close to the size of the nitrogen molecules. A certain degree of structural flexibility, not considered in the methods based on the assumption of the rigid framework, allows nitrogen to adsorb in the actual experiments. ZIF-8 is one of the most prominent examples of the materials belonging to this category.

A different picture, however, emerges for the network-accessible\nsurface area (d). This property depends on how the accessibility of the pore network\nis calculated, and given the differences in the algorithms between\nZeo++ and PB v4.0, it is not surprising that this property is more\nsensitive to the code used. Interestingly, there is a set of MOFs\n(\u223c2000) showing a zero network-accessible surface area in Zeo++\nand nonzero values in PB v4.0; it manifests itself as a horizontal\nline of points in the figure. We will return to a more comprehensive\nanalysis for the reasons for these deviations in  once we present the results\non the remaining properties (pore volumes and their distributions).\nThe differences in the distribution of the total and network-accessible\nsurface areas obtained from PB v4.0 are remarkable. The most striking\nfeature is the large number of MOFs that have a surface area close\nto zero (they are not strictly zero as materials with strictly zero\nsurface areas have been already eliminated in the preliminary screening\nof the 57\u202f000 MOFs). This implies that the CSD MOF subset,\ni.e., the database compiling all the reported MOFs from the literature,\nis dominated by materials with low surface areas and porosities. Even\nwithin this smaller subset of 12\u202f052 porous MOFs, more than\n3000 have total surface areas below 50 m<sup>2</sup>/g, and only 2455\nMOFs have total surface areas above 1000 m<sup>2</sup>/g\ue5f8i.e.,\nonly about 20% of ca. 12\u202f000 MOFs. However, we also need to\nbe aware that some materials will appear in this analysis as nonporous,\nwhereas, in reality, they are porous, with windows close to the size\nof the nitrogen molecules. A certain degree of structural flexibility,\nnot considered in the methods based on the assumption of the rigid\nframework, allows nitrogen to adsorb in the actual experiments.

A different picture, however, emerges for the network-accessible surface area (d). This property depends on how the accessibility of the pore network is calculated, and given the differences in the algorithms between Zeo++ and PB v4.0, it is not surprising that this property is more sensitive to the code used. Interestingly, there is a set of MOFs (~2000) showing a zero network-accessible surface area in Zeo++ and nonzero values in PB v4.0; it manifests itself as a horizontal line of points in the figure. We will return to a more comprehensive analysis for the reasons for these deviations in  once we present the results on the remaining properties (pore volumes and their distributions). The differences in the distribution of the total and network-accessible surface areas obtained from PB v4.0 are remarkable. The most striking feature is the large number of MOFs that have a surface area close to zero (they are not strictly zero as materials with strictly zero surface areas have been already eliminated in the preliminary screening of the 57000 MOFs). This implies that the CSD MOF subset, i.e., the database compiling all the reported MOFs from the literature, is dominated by materials with low surface areas and porosities. Even within this smaller subset of 12052 porous MOFs, more than 3000 have total surface areas below 50 m2/g, and only 2455 MOFs have total surface areas above 1000 m2/g\ue5f8i.e., only about 20% of ca. 12000 MOFs. However, we also need to be aware that some materials will appear in this analysis as nonporous, whereas, in reality, they are porous, with windows close to the size of the nitrogen molecules. A certain degree of structural flexibility, not considered in the methods based on the assumption of the rigid framework, allows nitrogen to adsorb in the actual experiments. ZIF-8 is one of the most prominent examples of the materials belonging to this category. \n\nIn the case of the total surface area, S  AC  ,T , we have a total number of 2261 (18.76%) MOFs with errors exceeding 10% (, third row); importantly, the maximum values found for MOFs having these discrepancies are below 500 m2/g. Out of the 2261 MOFs, 1488 show Zeo++ S  AC  ,T  values larger than PB v4.0. Similar to the previous properties, MOFs with significant errors are concentrated in the low surface area regime: errors exceeding 100% correspond to the materials with surface areas below 5 m2/g. When looking at the network-accessible surface area, S  AC  ,A , we found 2396 MOFs (19.88%) with errors exceeding 10% (, fourth row).
