When an external pressure of 100 MPa is applied, the water fluxes through graphene/MoS2 with a single pore (with same size) are 40.23 #/ns and 48.03 #/ns, respectively. Under the same hydraulic pressure, the water fluxes through single-layer Ni/Cu-HAB are 347.47 #/ns and 360.48 #/ns, respectively, which is more than 9 times higher than those of graphene and MoS2. The fluxes are calculated by fitting the slope of the curve of filtered water molecules with respect to time (an example of single-layer Ni-HAB curves is shown in b) and then taking average of the slopes among four simulation runs. The flux difference between materials indicates that graphene/MoS2 must have more than 9 pores, each with area of 43 \u00c52, to achieve the same water flux of MOF. Creating 9 pores with 43 \u00c52 area in a 4 nm \u00d7 4 nm graphene membrane thoroughly compromises its structure integrity  (Supporting Information Figure S1c). Recent studies with ab initio simulations have shown that despite porous atomic structure of conductive MOF, its elastic modulus is found to be comparable or even higher than densely packed 2D materials. Therefore, intrinsic porosity gives MOF the natural superiority of maximizing its flux while maintaining mechanical strength during water desalination.\n\nPermeation Coefficient\n\nPermeability coefficient, p, is employed here for a standardized comparison between the performances of different membranes. In the following equation for dilute solution:  1    p =     J   w     -   V   w   \u0394   C   s   +     V   w       N   A     k   B   T   \u0394 P      J w is the flux of water (#/ns), V w is the molar volume of water (18.91 mL/mol), \u0394C s is the concentration gradient of the solute (2.28 M), N A is the Avogadro number, k B is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature (300 K), and \u0394P is the applied hydrodynamic pressure (MPa). Under 100 MPa external pressure, the permeability coefficients of the Ni/Cu-HAB with single, double, or triple layers membrane were calculated to be 474.84 #/ns, 436.16 #/ns, 376.89 #/ns (nickel) and 501.05 #/ns, 433.92 #/ns, 363.15 #/ns (copper), respectively. For graphene and MoS2 membranes with a 43 \u00c52 pore, the water permeation coefficients are calculated to be 56.26 #/ns and 67.17 #/ns, respectively. The permeation coefficients of single-layer MOF membranes are ~9 times higher in magnitude than those of graphene and MoS2.\n\nWater Density and Velocity in Pores\n\nThe radial density of water (with respect to the distance to the pore center) is computed for a single pore of MOF and graphene/MoS2 (a). The single-layer MOF membrane has a higher water density compared to graphene and MoS2 at radii between 2 and 4 \u00c5 from the center of the pore (a). Moreover, the average water density in pore can be obtained by integrating the area below the density curves. The average densities are calculated to be 0.812 g/cm3 and 0.819 g/cm3 for water in single-layer Ni/Cu-HAB membrane pores and 0.658 g/cm3 and 0.728 g/cm3 for water in graphene/MoS2 pores, respectively. At each pore of MOF, more water molecules are packed compared to that of graphene/MoS2. The average radial densities of water in pores are lower than 1 g/cm3 because the water density in the depletion region around the edge of pore is very low. The results indicate that Ni/Cu-HAB generally has a higher water density in the pore.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "dielectric constant", "value": "4.5", "unit": "", "condition": "at 1 kHz"}, {"property name": "dielectric properties", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "value", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "suitable for applications", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "in electronics and capacitive devices"}, {"property name": "valuable", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "in energy storage and electronic components"}]}]], "include_properties": ["etc"]}, {"idx": 5, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Schematic of a typical simulation box consists of a graphene\npiston, saline water with potassium and chloride ions, membrane (MOF,\ngraphene/MoS<sub>2</sub>), and fresh water section.
