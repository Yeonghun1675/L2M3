As illustrated in d,e, AZO shows very low N2 adsorption capacity. However, both ZIF-8@AZO and Co-NC@AZO exhibit high uptakes in the low P/P 0 range, which corresponds to the micro-/mesoporous structure of MOFs and Co-NC. The BET surface area of Co-NC@AZO is calculated to be 209.80 m2 g-1, and its total pore volume is 0.47 cm3 g-1, which is significantly higher than those of AZO (88.96 m2 g-1, 0.18 cm3 g-1) but lower than those of ZIF-8@AZO (935.01 m2 g-1, 0.65 cm3 g-1). This result suggests that a portion of the ZIF-8 was decomposed during the carbonization process to produce catalytic Co nanoparticles for improved LiPS conversion. The rich micro-/mesopores are expected to benefit for the inhibition of LiPS shuttle effect. The Raman spectra of Co-NC@AZO, ZIF-8@AZO, and AZO are displayed in f. The sharp peak at 1341 cm-1 is ascribed to the D-band of sp3 defects for amorphous carbon, and the distinct peak at 1582 cm-1 can be ascribed to the G-band from the in-plane vibration of graphitic layers. Raman spectra are used to evaluate the microcrystalline graphite domain lengths along the lateral ab direction (L a) of samples according to the following         L   a     ( nm )  =  ( 2.4 \u00d7   10   - 10   )    \u03bb   n m   4     (   I   G   /   I   D   )     1 where \u03bb (nm) is the wavelength of the laser (532 nm), I G and I D are the intensity of the G band and D band, respectively. The I D/I G (area) values of Co-NC@AZO, ZIF-8@AZO, and AZO are 2.09, 2.69, and 2.29, respectively, and the corresponding L a values are calculated as 9.19, 7.14, and 8.39 nm, respectively. ZIF-8@AZO exhibits a higher I D/I G (area) value and shorter length of L a than AZO, implying a lower proportion of graphitic layers introduced by ZIF-8, which can be confirmed by the slightly decreased conductivity of ZIF-8@AZO than AZO (b), while Co-NC@AZO displays the lowest I D/I G (area) value and the highest L a value, demonstrating that the carbonization process increases the degree of graphitization, compensating for the loss of electrical conductivity due to the introduction of nongraphite carbon (from 5.4 to 9.8 S cm-1, b). The surface chemistry of the obtained Co-NC@AZO was studied by XPS. The two peaks at 1022.2 and 1045.2 eV in g can be ascribed to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively, and the peak at 74.5 eV in h is assigned to Al 2p, demonstrating the existence of Zn and Al. Meanwhile, i shows a sharp peak at 778.6 eV, verifying the existence of the metallic Co state. The emergence of C-N and C\ue5fbN species in fitted C 1s confirms the successful doping of N in the carbon lattice (Figure S7c). Additionally, as shown in Figure S7b, four peaks can be obtained in the N 1s spectrum, which are assigned to pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N, and oxidized-N groups. Note that in N-containing metal/carbon systems, for example, MOF-derived carbonous materials, the formation of N-metal sites is a regular phenomenon under elevated-temperature pyrolysis treatment. Therefore, the appearance of pyrrolic-N and pyridinic-N peaks may likely represent the N-Co bond here. The sulfur contents in Co-NC@AZO, ZIF-8@AZO, and AZO calculated from TGA are 74.5, 65.3, and 58.2 wt %, respectively, which can be found in Figure S8.

Note that the AZO retains the lattice of ZnO with peaks slightly\nshifting to higher degrees, which can be explained by the slight lattice\nshrinkage of partly replaced Zn<sup>2+</sup> by Al<sup>3+</sup> (2\nmol %). Moreover, the characteristic\npeak of ZIF-8 between 5 and 20\u00b0 can be found in the ZIF-8@AZO\nand the pure ZIF-8, proving the successful formation of ZIF-8 crystals\nin the 3DOM framework.

The conductivity\nof AZO (7.8 S cm<sup>\u20131</sup>) is 4 orders of magnitude higher\nthan that of ZnO (8.6 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20134</sup> S cm<sup>\u20131</sup>), implying that a proper doping of Al can significantly enhance\nthe electrical conductivity of ZnO.

The DOS pattern\nof ZnO shows distinct energy gaps with a typical semiconducting character.\nWhen Al is introduced into the lattice of ZnO to replace Zn atoms,\na new DOS appears around the Fermi energy to narrow the band gap,\nwhich significantly improves its electrical conductivity. Moreover, a higher Zn d band center can be observed\nfor AZO (\u22121.55 eV) compared with that of ZnO (\u22122.80\neV); see <ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.1c12808/suppl_file/am1c12808_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S6</ext-link>.

To address these issues, a unique hierarchical porous architecture, combining highly conductive ordered macroporous skeleton and embedded microporous particles is rationally designed as a dual-effective polysulfide immobilizer and conversion promoter. In this nanoporous architecture, Al-doped ZnO (AZO) acts as a conductive macroporous framework, profiting chemical anchoring of LiPS as well as facilitating electrolyte infiltration and ion diffusion; Co nanoparticle-anchored N-doped carbon (Co-NC) derived from CoZn-metal-organic framework is embedded in the macropores to further strengthen the LiPS adsorption, catalytically accelerating conversion kinetics of LiPS simultaneously. Consequently, the Co-NC@AZO/S cathode delivers a notable rate capability of 635.5 mA h g-1 at 5 C. A high area capacity of about 5.8 mA h cm-2 with a mass loading of 6.8 mg cm-2 is also achieved under a lean electrolyte (E/S = 5.7). Additionally, the Li-S pouch cells equipped with Co-NC@AZO can be extended to sulfur loading as high as 4.0 mg cm-2, delivering a superb capability of 897.5 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles. This work puts forward a design for stably cycled and practically viable Li-S batteries.\n\nHerein, a highly conductive and polar three-dimensional ordered macroporous (3DOM) framework was developed by Al-doped ZnO (AZO), a commonly used conductive oxide in photovoltaics. The inherent polarity of 3DOM AZO can provide strengthened LiPS adsorption. In addition, the high conductivity and ordered macropores can efficiently accelerate charge transportation and transfer, electrolyte infiltration, and ion diffusion. To further boost the surface area and corresponding reaction sites, microporous Co-decorated N-doped carbon (Co-NC), derived from the carbonization of the CoZn-MOF, was introduced within the macropores of 3DOM AZO, forming a novel hierarchical porous structure. The microporous Co-NC provides plentiful and accessible active sites of Co nanoparticles as well as N-doped carbon for strong LiPS adsorption and its effective catalytic conversion during charge/discharge cycling, ensuring a high utilization rate of sulfur in lean electrolyte conditions. Combined with these merits, the CoZn-NC@AZO/S cathode exhibits superb cycling stability over 500 cycles at 1 C with a low capacity fading rate of 0.020% per cycle and a high capacity of 635.5 mA h g-1 at 5 C. Furthermore, a high area capacity of 5.8 mA h cm-2 with a sulfur loading of 6.8 mg cm-2 is also achieved at a low electrolyte-to-sulfur ratio (E/S = 5.7). More importantly, the multifunctional CoZn-NC@AZO cathode also shows excellent electrochemical performance in a pouch cell. A high capacity of 897.5 mA h g-1 can be obtained even after 100 cycles at 0.1 C under a sulfur loading of 4.0 mg cm-2 and E/S ratio of 5.2 \u03bcL mg-1. Also, the excellent flexibility of the pouch cell is displayed under flat and bending states. This study proposes a novel design strategy for advanced and practicable Li-S batteries.\n\nThe collected XRD patterns of Co-NC@AZO, ZIF-8@AZO, AZO, and 3DOM ZnO (ZnO) are presented in a and S5. The three characteristic peaks shown in Figure S5 at 31, 34, and 36\u00b0 attribute to the (1 0 0), (0 0 2), and (1 0 1) planes of ZnO. Note that the AZO retains the lattice of ZnO with peaks slightly shifting to higher degrees, which can be explained by the slight lattice shrinkage of partly replaced Zn2+ by Al3+ (2 mol %). Moreover, the characteristic peak of ZIF-8 between 5 and 20\u00b0 can be found in the ZIF-8@AZO and the pure ZIF-8, proving the successful formation of ZIF-8 crystals in the 3DOM framework. The electrical conductivities of these samples were measured by the four-point probe method (b). The conductivity of AZO (7.8 S cm-1) is 4 orders of magnitude higher than that of ZnO (8.6 \u00d7 10-4 S cm-1), implying that a proper doping of Al can significantly enhance the electrical conductivity of ZnO. When ZIF-8 forms on AZO, the electrical conductivity slightly decreases to 5.4 S cm-1, which can be improved back to an even higher 9.8 S cm-1 after carbonization. c depicts the density of states (DOS) patterns of ZnO and AZO to further prove the good conductivity of AZO. The DOS pattern of ZnO shows distinct energy gaps with a typical semiconducting character. When Al is introduced into the lattice of ZnO to replace Zn atoms, a new DOS appears around the Fermi energy to narrow the band gap, which significantly improves its electrical conductivity. Moreover, a higher Zn d band center can be observed for AZO (-1.55 eV) compared with that of ZnO (-2.80 eV); see Figure S6. That is, the introduction of Al significantly upshifts the d band center of Zn, thereby enhancing its adsorption ability toward polysulfide. \n\nTo verify the porosity of the samples, nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements were performed. As illustrated in d,e, AZO shows very low N2 adsorption capacity. However, both ZIF-8@AZO and Co-NC@AZO exhibit high uptakes in the low P/P 0 range, which corresponds to the micro-/mesoporous structure of MOFs and Co-NC. The BET surface area of Co-NC@AZO is calculated to be 209.80 m2 g-1, and its total pore volume is 0.47 cm3 g-1, which is significantly higher than those of AZO (88.96 m2 g-1, 0.18 cm3 g-1) but lower than those of ZIF-8@AZO (935.01 m2 g-1, 0.65 cm3 g-1). This result suggests that a portion of the ZIF-8 was decomposed during the carbonization process to produce catalytic Co nanoparticles for improved LiPS conversion. The rich micro-/mesopores are expected to benefit for the inhibition of LiPS shuttle effect. The Raman spectra of Co-NC@AZO, ZIF-8@AZO, and AZO are displayed in f. The sharp peak at 1341 cm-1 is ascribed to the D-band of sp3 defects for amorphous carbon, and the distinct peak at 1582 cm-1 can be ascribed to the G-band from the in-plane vibration of graphitic layers. Raman spectra are used to evaluate the microcrystalline graphite domain lengths along the lateral ab direction (L a) of samples according to the following         L   a     ( nm )  =  ( 2.4 \u00d7   10   - 10   )    \u03bb   n m   4     (   I   G   /   I   D   )     1 where \u03bb (nm) is the wavelength of the laser (532 nm), I G and I D are the intensity of the G band and D band, respectively. The I D/I G (area) values of Co-NC@AZO, ZIF-8@AZO, and AZO are 2.09, 2.69, and 2.29, respectively, and the corresponding L a values are calculated as 9.19, 7.14, and 8.39 nm, respectively. ZIF-8@AZO exhibits a higher I D/I G (area) value and shorter length of L a than AZO, implying a lower proportion of graphitic layers introduced by ZIF-8, which can be confirmed by the slightly decreased conductivity of ZIF-8@AZO than AZO (b), while Co-NC@AZO displays the lowest I D/I G (area) value and the highest L a value, demonstrating that the carbonization process increases the degree of graphitization, compensating for the loss of electrical conductivity due to the introduction of nongraphite carbon (from 5.4 to 9.8 S cm-1, b). The surface chemistry of the obtained Co-NC@AZO was studied by XPS. The two peaks at 1022.2 and 1045.2 eV in g can be ascribed to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively, and the peak at 74.5 eV in h is assigned to Al 2p, demonstrating the existence of Zn and Al. Meanwhile, i shows a sharp peak at 778.6 eV, verifying the existence of the metallic Co state. The emergence of C-N and C\ue5fbN species in fitted C 1s confirms the successful doping of N in the carbon lattice (Figure S7c). Additionally, as shown in Figure S7b, four peaks can be obtained in the N 1s spectrum, which are assigned to pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N, and oxidized-N groups. Note that in N-containing metal/carbon systems, for example, MOF-derived carbonous materials, the formation of N-metal sites is a regular phenomenon under elevated-temperature pyrolysis treatment. Therefore, the appearance of pyrrolic-N and pyridinic-N peaks may likely represent the N-Co bond here. The sulfur contents in Co-NC@AZO, ZIF-8@AZO, and AZO calculated from TGA are 74.5, 65.3, and 58.2 wt %, respectively, which can be found in Figure S8. It is worth noting that ZIF-8@AZO and AZO exhibit lower sulfur loading than Co-NC@AZO.

When tested at 1 C, a high capacity retention of 950.03 mA h g-1 was achieved after 500 cycles for the Co-NC@AZO/S cathode, with a low capacity decay rate of only 0.020% per cycle (g), demonstrating the outstanding polysulfide retention capability.\n\nRepeated volume fluctuations of sulfur particles during charging and discharging can damage the cathode structure. Therefore, the SEM images of the Co-NC@AZO cathode before and after 100 cycles at 1 C with sulfur washed off were investigated to reveal the structural stability of Co-NC@AZO. As illustrated in Figure S14c,d, the intact and well-defined 3DOM structure of AZO still remains without structural collapse after cycling. Meanwhile, the Co-NC particles attach well to the AZO framework with almost no Co loss, confirmed by EDS analysis (Figure S14e,f). The good structural stability of Co-NC@AZO is conducive to tolerating the volume expansion of sulfur and thus improving the cycle life of Li-S batteries. Furthermore, the feasibility of the Co-NC@AZO/S cathode with higher sulfur loadings of 2.4, 5.2, and 6.8 mg cm-2 was also explored. h and S15 present the cycling performance of Co-NC@AZO/S electrodes at different sulfur loadings and electrolyte-to-sulfur ratios (E/S). Satisfactorily, a decent areal capacity of 5.8 mA h cm-2 after 100 cycles is accessible even at a high sulfur loading of 6.8 mg cm-2. This highlights the advanced electrochemical performance of Co-NC@AZO to achieve high utilization of sulfur. More impressively, the volumetric capacity of Co-NC@AZO/S-based Li-S cells is as high as 1240 mA h cm-3, which is much higher than those of the commercialized lithium-ion batteries (<200 mA h cm-3) and is comparable or even superior to the reported Li-S batteries with efficient composite cathodes (Figure S16 and Table S1).
