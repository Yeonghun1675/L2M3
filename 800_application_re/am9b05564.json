However, the layered double hydroxide structure is unstable\nand changes almost instantly in alkaline solution due to the instability\nof a manganese\u00ad(III) ion. Thus, it is important to investigate the\ntrue active phase for designing efficient electrode materials. In\nthis work, the metal\u2013organic framework is used as a templating\nprecursor to derive CoMn-LDH from three different manganese solutions,\nnamely, MnSO<sub>4</sub>, Mn\u00ad(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, and MnCl<sub>2</sub>. Anions in the solutions participate in the derivation process\nand strongly affect the layer structure, phase transformation process,\nand charge storage properties of the resulting materials. CoMn-LDH\nsynthesized from manganese sulfate solution exhibits the largest interlayer\nspacing of 1.08 nm, and more interestingly, the layered structure\ncan well be retained in KOH solution, while the other two synthesized\nfrom manganese chloride and nitrate solutions transform into the spinel\nstructure. As a cathode material, it delivers a high areal capacity\nof 582.07 mC/cm<sup>2</sup> at 2 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>\n<sub>,</sub> which\nis about 100% higher than those of the other two samples. The present\nwork explores the active phase of CoMn-LDH in the alkaline electrolyte\nand proposes a potential mechanism of the phase transformation, which\nprovides insights into understanding and designing of the active electrode\nmaterials for stable and high-performing supercapacitors in an alkaline\nenvironment.</p><p>TEM studies (see d\u2013f) show that the CoMn-LDH-SO<sub>4</sub> sheets\nwere\nsmall and interconnected with each other, while CoMn-LDH-NO<sub>3</sub>/Cl sheets prefer to be in one plane and the sizes are larger. The\nSAED images show a typical pattern for LDH. The extra circles in SAED\nobserved are due to the decomposition of hydroxides to oxides under\nstrong electron beams. The enlarged TEM\nimages (g\u2013i)\npresent the lattice fringes of the (006) plane in each sample, showing\na larger interlayer spacing of around 0.5 nm for CoMn-LDH-SO<sub>4</sub>, which also can be confirmed by the FFT image. The clear lattice\nfringes and bright SAED circles also indicate a good crystallinity\nof the sample. The BET surface areas of CoMn-LDH-SO<sub>4</sub>, CoMn-LDH-NO<sub>3</sub>, and CoMn-LDH-Cl are 89.4, 65.6, 72.6 m<sup>2</sup>/g, respectively,\nlarger than that of the common CoMn-LDH materials that have been reported\n(\u223c53 m<sup>2</sup>/g). The interconnected\n3D network morphology has effectively prevented the restacking of\nthe LDH sheets, giving rise to the higher surface area of CoMn-LDH-SO<sub>4</sub>.</p><p>Electrochemical tests were conducted in a three-electrode\nsetup\nin 1 M KOH solution for the three CoMn-LDH@carbon cloth samples, which\nwere immersed in KOH for 30 min in advance. CoMn-LDH-SO<sub>4</sub> shows an outstanding performance, compared to the other two samples.\nTwo pairs of redox peaks are observed in CV curves for the three samples\nat \u223c0 and \u223c0.4 V (see a), which correspond to the redox reactions\nof M<sup>2+</sup>/M<sup>3+</sup> and M<sup>3+</sup>/M<sup>4+</sup> (M = Co, Mn). By comparison, the CV curve area of CoMn-LDH-SO<sub>4</sub> is the\nlargest, indicating the highest capacity among the three. The charge\u2013discharge\nplateau in the GCD curve (see <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.9b05564/suppl_file/am9b05564_si_001.pdf\">Figure S9a</ext-link>) is also consistent with the CV curve. The areal capacity is calculated\nfrom the discharge curve as 582.07 mC/cm<sup>2</sup> for CoMn-LDH-SO<sub>4</sub> at 2 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, which is around 2 times that of the\nother two samples (b). The electrochemical performance also compares favorably\nwith other literature values (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.9b05564/suppl_file/am9b05564_si_001.pdf\">Table S1</ext-link>).\nThey can well be accounted for the more accessible active sites in\nassociation with the stable layered structure of CoMn-LDH-SO<sub>4</sub>. Its rate capability (66.2%) is also higher than the other two samples\n(56.6% and 54.9%). In addition, CoMn-LDH-SO<sub>4</sub> has the smallest\nelectron transfer resistance and mass transfer resistance, as shown\nin the Nyquist plot (see c). These experimental results suggest CoMn-LDH-SO<sub>4</sub> has a better electron transfer path and electrolyte ion penetration\ntunnel. Upon 5000 charge\u2013discharge cycles at 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, the capacity of CoMn-LDH-SO<sub>4</sub> can well be maintained\nat 77% of its initial value (see d). Although around 90% of the initial value\ncan be maintained for the other two samples, their capacity stays\nat around 200 mC/cm<sup>2</sup>, which is still 2 times lower than\nthe capacity of CoMn-LDH-SO<sub>4</sub> after 5000 charge\u2013discharge\ncycles.

The morphology of\nCoMn-LDH-SO4 does not show a significant change after the cycling\ntest. In addition, when compared to the other two samples, CoMn-LDH-SO<sub>4</sub> appears to have more nanosheets retained on the nanowall\nsurface, which can contribute to a higher capacity.</p><p>A hybrid supercapacitor was then\nassembled using CoMn-LDH-SO<sub>4</sub> and porous carbon as the respective\nelectrodes. Porous carbon\nis derived from ZIF-8, and it shows a semirectangular CV curve and\nsymmetrical linear GCD curve, representing a good supercapacitor behavior\nand reversibility (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.9b05564/suppl_file/am9b05564_si_001.pdf\">Figure S9b,c</ext-link>).

However, the layered double hydroxide structure is unstable and changes almost instantly in alkaline solution due to the instability of a manganese(III) ion. Thus, it is important to investigate the true active phase for designing efficient electrode materials. In this work, the metal-organic framework is used as a templating precursor to derive CoMn-LDH from three different manganese solutions, namely, MnSO4, Mn(NO3)2, and MnCl2. Anions in the solutions participate in the derivation process and strongly affect the layer structure, phase transformation process, and charge storage properties of the resulting materials. CoMn-LDH synthesized from manganese sulfate solution exhibits the largest interlayer spacing of 1.08 nm, and more interestingly, the layered structure can well be retained in KOH solution, while the other two synthesized from manganese chloride and nitrate solutions transform into the spinel structure. As a cathode material, it delivers a high areal capacity of 582.07 mC/cm2 at 2 mA/cm2 , which is about 100% higher than those of the other two samples. The present work explores the active phase of CoMn-LDH in the alkaline electrolyte and proposes a potential mechanism of the phase transformation, which provides insights into understanding and designing of the active electrode materials for stable and high-performing supercapacitors in an alkaline environment.\n\nTEM studies (see d-f) show that the CoMn-LDH-SO4 sheets were small and interconnected with each other, while CoMn-LDH-NO3/Cl sheets prefer to be in one plane and the sizes are larger. The SAED images show a typical pattern for LDH. The extra circles in SAED observed are due to the decomposition of hydroxides to oxides under strong electron beams. The enlarged TEM images (g-i) present the lattice fringes of the (006) plane in each sample, showing a larger interlayer spacing of around 0.5 nm for CoMn-LDH-SO4, which also can be confirmed by the FFT image. The clear lattice fringes and bright SAED circles also indicate a good crystallinity of the sample. The BET surface areas of CoMn-LDH-SO4, CoMn-LDH-NO3, and CoMn-LDH-Cl are 89.4, 65.6, 72.6 m2/g, respectively, larger than that of the common CoMn-LDH materials that have been reported (~53 m2/g). The interconnected 3D network morphology has effectively prevented the restacking of the LDH sheets, giving rise to the higher surface area of CoMn-LDH-SO4.\n\nElectrochemical tests were conducted in a three-electrode setup in 1 M KOH solution for the three CoMn-LDH@carbon cloth samples, which were immersed in KOH for 30 min in advance. CoMn-LDH-SO4 shows an outstanding performance, compared to the other two samples. Two pairs of redox peaks are observed in CV curves for the three samples at ~0 and ~0.4 V (see a), which correspond to the redox reactions of M2+/M3+ and M3+/M4+ (M = Co, Mn). By comparison, the CV curve area of CoMn-LDH-SO4 is the largest, indicating the highest capacity among the three. The charge-discharge plateau in the GCD curve (see Figure S9a) is also consistent with the CV curve. The areal capacity is calculated from the discharge curve as 582.07 mC/cm2 for CoMn-LDH-SO4 at 2 mA/cm2, which is around 2 times that of the other two samples (b). The electrochemical performance also compares favorably with other literature values (Table S1). They can well be accounted for the more accessible active sites in association with the stable layered structure of CoMn-LDH-SO4. Its rate capability (66.2%) is also higher than the other two samples (56.6% and 54.9%). In addition, CoMn-LDH-SO4 has the smallest electron transfer resistance and mass transfer resistance, as shown in the Nyquist plot (see c). These experimental results suggest CoMn-LDH-SO4 has a better electron transfer path and electrolyte ion penetration tunnel. Upon 5000 charge-discharge cycles at 10 mA/cm2, the capacity of CoMn-LDH-SO4 can well be maintained at 77% of its initial value (see d). Although around 90% of the initial value can be maintained for the other two samples, their capacity stays at around 200 mC/cm2, which is still 2 times lower than the capacity of CoMn-LDH-SO4 after 5000 charge-discharge cycles. SEM images of the three samples after the stability test are shown in Figure S10. The morphology of CoMn-LDH-SO4 does not show a significant change after the cycling test. In addition, when compared to the other two samples, CoMn-LDH-SO4 appears to have more nanosheets retained on the nanowall surface, which can contribute to a higher capacity.\n\nA hybrid supercapacitor was then assembled using CoMn-LDH-SO4 and porous carbon as the respective electrodes. Porous carbon is derived from ZIF-8, and it shows a semirectangular CV curve and symmetrical linear GCD curve, representing a good supercapacitor behavior and reversibility (Figure S9b,c). The specific capacitance of porous carbon is around 137 F/g. To match the charge stock in CoMn-LDH-SO4, 3.7 mg of anode material was used. e presents the comparison of the CV between the used cathode and anode materials, showing a similar area and therefore a good match between the two electrodes. By assembling the two different materials, the voltage window can then be extended to 1.5 V. Indeed, the CV curve of the full cell is rather rectangular with two pairs of wide redox peaks, and the GCD curve is also linear showing a capacitor behavior (f,g). The capacitance was calculated to be 308.48 mF/cm2 at 2 mA/cm2, and the energy density is 0.096 mWh/cm2 with a power density of 1.5 mW/cm2. These performance values compare favorably with most of the literature values as shown in the Ragone plot (h and Table S2). During the repeating charge-discharge test at 10 mA/cm2, the capacitance can well maintain at 89% of the initial value after 18,000 charge-discharge cycles, showing a superior stability (i).\n\nConclusions\n\nThere is a strong anion effect in the transformation process of Co-MOF to CoMn-LDH.
