Y-apt is formed by annealing of Ya (an aptamer responsive to ATP), Yb, and Yc-PC (which is obtained by incorporating a PC linker at positions spaced by 10 nucleotides at the 5'-end). In the SYBR Green-stained PAGE image (B), one band with the highest molecular weight can be observed on the gel, while the mobility is lower than other bands, indicating the successful assembly of Y-apt (lane 7). To achieve high-efficiency synthesis of Y-apt, the molar ratio of Ya, Yb, and Yc-PC was optimized to be 1:1.25:1.25 (Figure S1). Additionally, we designed two control probes, Y-apt-off (lane 4 in Figure S2 and Scheme S3A) formed by annealing Ya, Yb, and Yc-non (its sequence is identical to Yc-PC but without the PC linker) and Y-apt-on (lane 6 in Figure S2 and Scheme S3B) formed by Ya, Yb, Yc-1, and Yc-2 (Yc-1 and Yc-2 are DNA sequences that mimic disconnection due to the photocleavage of the PC linker in Yc-PC, respectively). It is remarkable that the PC linker on Yc-PC can be quickly cleaved upon irradiation, which further ensures the sensitivity of Y-apt to target ATP (A). Upon light exposure, it can be observed that Y-apt appears a distinct faster migrating band upon light exposure (C, lane 7), which was in a similar position to Y-apt-on (lane 4), indicating that light can remotely control the cleavage of the PC linker. Furthermore, the bands become brighter when the illumination time was prolonged (Figure S3). Then, the effective response of Y-apt to ATP upon illumination was verified. The illuminated Y-apt showed two distinct short bands (C, lane 8) upon ATP addition. With the increase of ATP concentration (from 0 to 10 mM), the short bands in response to ATP in the gel image became brighter (Figure S4). The control probes (Y-apt-off and Y-apt-on) also validated the effective response of our constructed nanodevice to ATP. As shown in Figure S5, Y-apt-on showed obvious short bands compared with Y-apt-off upon ATP addition, suggesting that only light-gated Y-shaped probes could response to ATP.
