Figure S5c shows the most likely synthetic mechanism. PCN-226 was generated at a higher temperature (140 \u00b0C) than PCN-222 (120 \u00b0C), which is advantageous for the creation of ZrO7 chains by overcoming a higher energetic barrier. In the meantime, a large amount of benzoic acid, one of the modulators, was introduced to the PCN-226 synthesis process, limiting the formation of the Zr6-oxo cluster containing the structure. Supposedly, PCN-226 with an increased thermodynamic stability of ZrO7 chains without hydroxyl groups might be more difficult to combine with carboxyl compounds. Furthermore, the eight hydroxyl groups of the Zr6(\u03bc-OH)8 clusters seem to be more likely to be attacked and replaced by carboxyl groups. DFT calculations were further carried out to simulate and optimize the adsorption models of HOOC-TEMPO on the Zr6(\u03bc-OH)8 cluster and ZrO7 zigzag chain. Through the investigation of optimization processes, HOOC-TEMPO can be adsorbed on the Zr6(\u03bc-OH)8 cluster by the bidentate model (Supplementary Video 1). However, HOOC-TEMPO would gradually move away from the ZrO7 chain, indicating that HOOC-TEMPO cannot be adsorbed on the ZrO7 chain (Supplementary Video 2). The DFT calculations show that the adsorption energy of TEMPO on the Zr6(\u03bc-OH)8 cluster was calculated to be -48.1 kcal mol-1, higher than that of HOOC-TEMPO due to the lack of binding sites of Zr6(\u03bc-OH)8 (a). The bidentate adsorption is the highly favorable adsorption model of HOOC-TEMPO on the Zr6(\u03bc-OH)8 cluster (E ad = -52.7 kcal mol-1 for unidentate adsorption and E ad = -66.6 kcal mol-1 for bidentate adsorption, respectively) (b,c). This also means that the adsorption of HOOC-TEMPO on Zr6(\u03bc-OH)8 clusters can be triggered spontaneously. Consequently, it could be assumed that HOOC-TEMPO would display a superior cooperative effect to that of TEMPO over PCN-222 for the selective oxidation of sulfides.

Because of the existence of Soret\nand Q bands, they are sensitive to wavelengths extending from 350\nto 800 nm.

These results confirm that crystalline structures were explicitly formed for PCN-222 and PCN-226, respectively. Next, the adsorption-desorption isotherms of PCN-222 and PCN-226 were measured at 77 K in an N2 environment to reveal their intrinsic porous properties (c,d). The presence of micropores is demonstrated by the high amount of the adsorbed volume in the low p/p 0 region (<0.05) in the two adsorption isotherms. Furthermore, when p/p 0 = 0.3, the typical type IV isotherm of PCN-222 shows a rapid rise, indicating mesoporosity. The porous structures of the two MOFs can also be confirmed by the investigation of pore size distribution curves following the nonlocal density functional theory model (e,f). Notably, PCN-222 has mesopores with a size of 2.7 nm and micropores of around 1.3 nm. On the other hand, PCN-226 is primarily made up of micropores (less than 2 nm). A higher Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area of 1466 m2 g-1 and a larger pore volume of 1.03 cm3 g-1 have been observed in PCN-222 than those of PCN-226 (573 m2 g-1 and 0.05 cm3 g-1, respectively). The molecular size of methyl phenyl sulfide is about 0.57 nm \u00d7 0.43 nm \u00d7 0.18 nm according to density functional theory (DFT) calculation. As such, a large portion of micropores of PCN-222 and PCN-226 cannot be accessed by organic sulfide. Typically, the BET specific surface area does not correlate linearly to photocatalytic activity for transformation of large organic molecules.\n\nNext, the light absorption of PCN-222 and PCN-226 was compared using UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) (Figure S2a). Because of the existence of Soret and Q bands, they are sensitive to wavelengths extending from 350 to 800 nm. Furthermore, considering the reaction includes exposure to 660 nm red light, the band gaps could be calculated using the Tauc plot method around 660 nm and are determined to be 1.80 eV for PCN-222 and 1.82 eV for PCN-226, respectively (Figure S2b). In a solution of 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH = 7), the Mott-Schottky plots were also plotted at frequencies of 1000, 1500, and 2000 Hz (Figure S2c,d). The flat band potentials of PCN-222 and PCN-226 were calculated to be -0.94 and -0.91 V, respectively, versus Ag/AgCl. This manifests that both photocatalysts are capable of producing the reactive oxygen species (ROS) superoxide anion O2 \u22c5- [E (O2/O2 \u22c5-) = -0.48 V versus Ag/AgCl]. Both simulated curves have a positive slope, indicating that they are n-type semiconductors. Highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of +0.86 and +0.91 V versus Ag/AgCl can also be achieved. Figure S3 displays the similar electronic structure of PCN-222 and PCN-226. Figure S4a shows the transient photocurrent response curves for PCN-222 and PCN-226.
