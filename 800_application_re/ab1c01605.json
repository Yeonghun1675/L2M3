For L929 cells, cell viability was maintained at 100% with drug concentrations ranging from 0 to 400 \u03bcg mL-1, indicating that CMMFTP is not toxic to normal cells and is safe even at doses up to 400 \u03bcg mL-1. Under the same conditions, HeLa cells showed a significant decrease in cell viability after 4 and 24 h of dosing, with only 5% viability at 24 h (dose 400 \u03bcg mL-1), which suggested that the Fenton-like reaction and the Russell reaction occurred under the tumor microenvironment stimulation, generating a high concentration of ROS to kill cancer cells. The above analysis demonstrated that CMMFTP is biocompatible and has significant therapeutic selectivity.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "TCPP", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "UV\u2013vis absorption spectrum": {"type": "porphyrin ring", "value": "400\u2013700", "unit": "nm", "condition": ""}}, {"meta": {"name": "TCPP", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "UV\u2013vis absorption spectrum": {"type": "K-band", "value": "400", "unit": "nm", "condition": ""}}, {"meta": {"name": "TCPP", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "UV\u2013vis absorption spectrum": {"type": "Q-bands", "value": "500\u2013700", "unit": "nm", "condition": ""}}, {"meta": {"name": "TCPP", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "UV\u2013vis absorption spectrum": {"type": "new peak", "value": "309", "unit": "nm", "condition": "Cu<sup>2+</sup> coordination"}}, {"meta": {"name": "FA", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "UV\u2013vis absorption spectrum": {"type": "benzene ring", "value": "250\u2013325", "unit": "nm", "condition": ""}}, {"meta": {"name": "CMMFTP", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "fluorescence emission spectrum": {"type": "excitation wavelength", "value": "430", "unit": "nm", "condition": ""}}, {"meta": {"name": "CMMFTP", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "\u03b6 potential": {"type": "", "value": "-18.55", "unit": "mV", "condition": ""}}, {"meta": {"name": "Cu-MOF@MnO<sub>2</sub>", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "\u03b6 potential": {"type": "", "value": "-25.18", "unit": "mV", "condition": ""}}, {"meta": {"name": "CMMFTP", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "\u03b6 potential": {"type": "", "value": "8.94", "unit": "mV", "condition": "positive phosphine charge and amino group"}}]], "include_properties": ["etc"]}, {"idx": 6, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Preparation and the\nSynergistic Antitumor Chemodynamic Effect of\nCMMFTP</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr6\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ab1c01605_0006.tif\" xlink:type=\"simple\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Preparation and the Synergistic Antitumor Chemodynamic Effect of CMMFTP   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 27, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) TEM of Cu-MOF.
