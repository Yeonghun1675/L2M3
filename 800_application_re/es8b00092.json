In the case of the secondary building unit of MIL-100(Fe), each iron octahedron possesses one terminal group (i.e., H2O, OH-, or F-) that is removable from the framework by vacuum thermal activation. The coordinated H2O molecules could be easily removed when heating above 100 \u00b0C under vacuum, resulting in the exposure of FeIII CUS. Additionally, the FeII CUS could be created above 150 \u00b0C owing to the departure of anionic ligands (OH- or F-). Thus, under our experimental condition, FeIII CUS together with FeII CUS embedded in the framework of MIL-100(Fe) could be triumphantly achieved with the removal of H2O and anionic ligands. To further justify the formation of CUSs, the in situ IR spectroscopy of adsorbed NO probe molecules was performed at room temperature.  shows the IR spectra of the NO adsorption stretching region on MIL-100(Fe) and CUS-MIL-100(Fe). NO adsorption gives rise to three \u03bd\u0303(NO) bands at \u03bd\u0303 = 1901, 1842, and 1828 cm-1. The band appearing at 1901 cm-1 belongs to nitrosyls on associated FeIII CUS, while the doublet at 1842 and 1828 cm-1 corresponds to the species coordinated on FeII CUS. It could be found that only a weak \u03bd\u0303(NO) band for FeIII CUS was detected in the IR spectra of MIL-100(Fe). The detectable FeIII CUS in MIL-100(Fe) can be attributed to the pretreatment at 120 \u00b0C under inert gas flow, which provokes the departure of water molecules and the formation of FeIII CUS. Compared with the IR spectra of MIL-100(Fe), the band intensity for FeIII CUS of CUS-MIL-100(Fe) was significantly increased, and two additional \u03bd\u0303(NO) bands for FeII CUS were also observed, testifying the successful formation of FeIII CUS and FeII CUS via the 200 \u00b0C vacuum thermal treatment. Because a decrease in the atomic ratio of O/Fe and F/Fe occurred in the activation of MIL-100(Fe) (see  element semiquantitative analysis below), these important features also prove that the creation of FeII CUS has direct correlation with the loss of anionic ligands (OH- or F-).", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 11, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>IR spectra of MIL-100\u00ad(Fe)\nand CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) under NO (1% NO in\nN<sub>2</sub>, 25 ccmin) flow at room temperature after pretreatment\nof the sample under N<sub>2</sub> flow at 120 \u00b0C for 3 h.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"es-2018-00092u_0001.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  IR spectra of MIL-100(Fe) and CUS-MIL-100(Fe) under NO (1% NO in N2, 25 ccmin) flow at room temperature after pretreatment of the sample under N2 flow at 120 \u00b0C for 3 h.

As mentioned\nabove, CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) with high porosity and open pore network (\u223c6.57\nnm pore diameter) could be valuable for the fast molecule diffusion\nof reactants toward the interior materials. Benefiting from the high\naccessibility of coordinatively unsaturated metal sites, the SMT molecules\nwere initially adsorbed on the framework of catalyst through the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0\ninteraction between the aromatic rings of SMT and CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe),\nleading to the enrichment of SMT in the vicinity of iron CUSs. Once\nH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was added, complexes (\ue5fcFe<sup>II</sup> CUS\ue5f8H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and \ue5fcFe<sup>III</sup> CUS\ue5f8H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) were immediately formed due\nto the strong affinity between the iron CUSs and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> molecules ( and ). The \ue5fcFe<sup>II</sup> CUS\ue5f8H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> subsequently underwent intramolecular electron\ntransfer to form surface-bound \u00b7OH radical (\u00b7OH<sub>ads</sub>) and \ue5fcFe<sup>III</sup> CUS (). Meanwhile, the \ue5fcFe<sup>III</sup> CUS\ue5f8H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> could be reduced to \ue5fcFe<sup>II</sup> CUSs\nvia reactions ( and ). The \ue5fcFe<sup>II</sup> CUSs and \ue5fcFe<sup>III</sup> CUSs were continuously added to each other under this circumstance,\ngenerating plenty of \u00b7OH<sub>ads</sub>. The generated \u00b7OH<sub>ads</sub> can directly attack the SMT in the vicinity of iron CUSs\n(). Furthermore,\nthe highly instantaneous concentration of SMT and \u00b7OH<sub>ads</sub> in such a local microenvironment could provide a driving force to\nfacilitate the degradation of SMT. Eventually, in the bulk solution,\nthe dissolved iron that resulted from the leaching of CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe)\nalso initiates the decomposition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> through\na chain

SMT degradation by CUS-MIL-100(Fe) is proposed and illustrated in . As mentioned above, CUS-MIL-100(Fe) with high porosity and open pore network (~6.57 nm pore diameter) could be valuable for the fast molecule diffusion of reactants toward the interior materials. Benefiting from the high accessibility of coordinatively unsaturated metal sites, the SMT molecules were initially adsorbed on the framework of catalyst through the \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction between the aromatic rings of SMT and CUS-MIL-100(Fe), leading to the enrichment of SMT in the vicinity of iron CUSs. Once H2O2 was added, complexes (\ue5fcFeII CUS\ue5f8H2O2 and \ue5fcFeIII CUS\ue5f8H2O2) were immediately formed due to the strong affinity between the iron CUSs and H2O2 molecules ( and ). The \ue5fcFeII CUS\ue5f8H2O2 subsequently underwent intramolecular electron transfer to form surface-bound \u22c5OH radical (\u22c5OHads) and \ue5fcFeIII CUS (). Meanwhile, the \ue5fcFeIII CUS\ue5f8H2O2 could be reduced to \ue5fcFeII CUSs via reactions ( and ). The \ue5fcFeII CUSs and \ue5fcFeIII CUSs were continuously added to each other under this circumstance, generating plenty of \u22c5OHads. The generated \u22c5OHads can directly attack the SMT in the vicinity of iron CUSs (). Furthermore, the highly instantaneous concentration of SMT and \u22c5OHads in such a local microenvironment could provide a driving force to facilitate the degradation of SMT. Eventually, in the bulk solution, the dissolved iron that resulted from the leaching of CUS-MIL-100(Fe) also initiates the decomposition of H2O2 through a chain reaction, producing free \u22c5OH radicals (\u22c5OHfree) to degrade SMT (-). 3      \ue5fcFe   II   CUS +   H   2     O   2   \u2192   \ue5fcFe   II   CUS\ue5f8   H   2     O   2       4      \ue5fcFe   III   CUS +   H   2     O   2   \u2192   \ue5fcFe   III   CUS\ue5f8   H   2     O   2       5      \ue5fcFe   II   CUS\ue5f8   H   2     O   2   \u2192   \ue5fcFe   III   CUS + \u22c5   OH   ads   +   OH   -       6      \ue5fcFe   III   CUS\ue5f8   H   2     O   2   \u2192   \ue5fcFe   II   CUS +   HO   2   \u22c5 +   H   +       7      \ue5fcFe   III   CUS +   HO   2   \u22c5 \u2192   \ue5fcFe   II   CUS +   O   2   +   H   +       8    \u22c5   OH   ads   + SMT \u2192 degraded products     9      Fe   2 +   +   H   2     O   2   \u2192   Fe   3 +   + \u22c5   OH   free   +   OH   -       10      Fe   3 +   +   H   2     O   2   \u2192   Fe   2 +   +   HO   2   \u22c5 +   H   +       11      Fe   3 +   +   HO   2   \u22c5 \u2192   Fe   2 +   +   O   2   +   H   +       12    \u22c5   OH   free   + SMT \u2192 degraded products    ", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 37, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig11\" position=\"float\">\n<label>11</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Schematic diagram of the reaction mechanism of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> activation by CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe).</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr11\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"es-2018-00092u_0011.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 11  Schematic diagram of the reaction mechanism of the H2O2 activation by CUS-MIL-100(Fe).

The catalytic\nperformance of CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) was investigated on the basis of various\nparameters, including initial pH, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration,\ncatalyst dosage, and initial SMT concentration. The results showed\nthat CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) could effectively degrade SMT, with almost 100%\nremoval efficiency within 180 min (52.4% mineralization efficiency),\nunder the reaction conditions of pH 4.0, 20 mg L<sup>\u20131</sup> SMT, 6 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and 0.5 g L<sup>\u20131</sup> catalyst. Moreover, CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) displayed a higher catalytic\nactivity than that of MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) for SMT degradation. Combined with\nthe physical\u2013chemical characterization, the enhanced catalytic\nactivity can be ascribed to the incorporation of Fe<sup>II</sup> and\nFe<sup>III</sup> CUSs (coordinatively unsaturated metal sites), the\nlarge specific surface area, as well as the formation of mesopores.\nFurthermore, CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) exhibited a good stability and reusability.\nThe possible catalytic mechanism of CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) was tentatively\nproposed.</p><p>The specific surface area and the porous nature\nof the resulting\nsamples were determined by N<sub>2</sub> adsorption\u2013desorption\nmeasurements and are depicted in . From a, the MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) presents a perfect type I isotherm\nof IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) classification\nwithout a discernible hysteresis loop, indicating the existence of\nuniform micropores in the structure. Different from the curve of MIL-100\u00ad(Fe),\nthe isotherm of CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) is of type IV with a distinct H3 hysteresis\nloop reflecting the presence of mesoporous structure in the catalyst. b points out the\nBJH pore size distribution of MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) and CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe), from\nwhich we can see that both of the samples possess the sharp peak below\n2 nm, characteristic of micropores. Discarding that sharp peak, two\nmajor peaks of around 3.82 and 6.57 nm can be observed in the pore-size\ndistribution curve of CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe), which further manifests that\nthe introduction of iron CUS could result in the creation of mesopores\nin CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) in addition to intrinsic micropores. The specific\nBET surface areas and pore structure parameters of each catalyst are\nsummarized in . The specific BET surface area and total pore volume of MIL-100\u00ad(Fe)\nwere calculated to be 1271.31 and 0.656 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup>, while those of CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) were 568.91 and 0.711 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup>, respectively. Despite the surface area of\nCUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) being diminished, its surface area value remains high.\nThus it is expected that the high porosity and surface area of CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe)\nwould facilitate the adsorption and diffusion of catalytic substrates\nto the exposed active sites in catalysis.</p><title>Catalytic\nProperties of CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe)</title><p>The catalytic performance of\nCUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) was assessed for SMT\ndegradation under the assistance of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.  shows the removal\nprofiles of SMT under various reaction systems. It can be seen that\nnegligible SMT removal (2.5%) was obtained when H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> alone was present, which indicates that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> itself can scarcely induce the degradation of SMT in the\nabsence of solid catalyst. Meanwhile, without H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) alone exhibited a limited performance of SMT removal\n(17.6%) due to the adsorption of CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe). Notably, the SMT\nwas almost completely removed within 180 min in the coexistence of\nCUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, indicating that the\nSMT was mainly degraded by the Fenton-like reaction rather than the\nadsorption process. To clarify the role of the iron CUS in the CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe)\non the catalytic reaction, control experiment using MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) +\nH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> system was also evaluated. The MIL-100\u00ad(Fe)\nshowed a much lower removal efficiency (only 11.1% of SMT degradation\nwithin 180 min) than the CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe). The result demonstrates\nthat the incorporation of iron CUS is important for the catalyst to\nget a satisfactory catalytic activity in Fenton-like degradation of\nSMT. Together with the physical\u2013chemical characterization,\nthe incorporation of iron CUS could induce the formation of mesopores\nwith enlarged pore channels that allow reactants to diffuse easily\ninto the interior structure and enable the interior and external active\nsites for the full contact with the reactive media. In addition, the\niron CUS in the pore channels, owing to its Lewis acidic character,\ncould induce region-selectivity toward H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,\nthereby improving the opportunities for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to contact with the active sites. Meanwhile, the iron CUS with variable chemical valences\n(Fe<sup>II</sup> CUS and Fe<sup>III</sup> CUS) would accelerate the\ndecomposition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to generate \u00b7OH radicals\nthrough the one-electron transfer process and thus enhance the catalytic\nactivity for the SMT degradation.</p><p>\nc and <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.est.8b00092/suppl_file/es8b00092_si_001.pdf\">Figure S2c</ext-link> disclose the SMT degradation at different\ncatalyst dosage. It was apparent that the increase in catalyst dosage\nsurely accelerated the degradation of SMT. As the catalyst dosage\nincreased from 0.2 to 1.5 g L<sup>\u20131</sup>, the <italic>k</italic> value increased gradually from 0.0054 to 0.0160 min<sup>\u20131</sup>, and the final SMT removal efficiency was increased from 70.3 to\n98.8%. This originates from the fact that higher dosage of catalyst\nwould provide more active sites available for the generation of \u00b7OH\nradicals, leading to the enhancement of catalytic efficiency.</p><p>The effect of initial SMT concentration on the degradation of SMT\nwas evaluated as depicted in d and <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.est.8b00092/suppl_file/es8b00092_si_001.pdf\">Figure S2d</ext-link>. Clearly,\nthe SMT degradation rates tended to decline quickly when increasing\nthe initial SMT concentration from 10 (0.0166 min<sup>\u20131</sup>) to 40 mg L<sup>\u20131</sup> (0.0083 min<sup>\u20131</sup>).\nThe likely reason for this phenomenon was that the rise of initial\nSMT concentration would result in the coverage of active sites on\nthe catalyst, hampering the generation of \u00b7OH radicals and subsequent\ndegradation of SMT. In addition, more\nintermediates were produced at higher initial SMT concentration, which\nmay cause an undesirable competitive consumption of hydroxyl radicals\nand therefore decrease the degradation rate.\n</p><p>During the oxidation process, the change of TOC value of\nthe reaction\nsolution was examined to reflect the mineralization degree of SMT.\nAs observed in , the reduction of TOC proceeded more slowly than did the removal\nof SMT. After 180 min of reaction, &gt;98% of SMT in the solution\nwas\neliminated, while the efficiency of TOC removal reached only 52.4%.\nThus it was speculated that some organic residues derived from SMT\ndecomposition remained in the solution. The efficiency of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> utilization in terms of mineralization, defined as\nthe amount of TOC converted per gram of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> decomposed, was also calculated to establish the efficiency of the\nFenton-like catalyst. Under these reaction\nconditions, the degradation of 180 min consumed 30.8% of the initial\nH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration, which corresponded, in turn,\nto 86.3 mg TOC g<sup>\u20131</sup> H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The\nobtained value is in the range of the reported literature values,\nsuggesting a high efficiency of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> utilization\nand a good degradation of SMT.\n</p><title>Stability and Reusability of CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe)</title><p>The stability of the catalyst is of great significance for heterogeneous\ncatalysis. To assess it, the concentrations of iron ions leaching\nfrom CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) were also detected during the heterogeneous Fenton\nprocess over five cycles. As shown in a, the dissolved iron concentration gradually\nincreased with the reaction time. The highest concentration of dissolved\niron (0.41 mg L<sup>\u20131</sup>) was lower than the environmental\nstandard (2 mg L<sup>\u20131</sup>) imposed by the European Union,\navoiding the further treatment for iron ions. Additionally, the concentration\nof dissolved iron after each cycle ranged from 0.36 to 0.41 mg L<sup>\u20131</sup>, which suggested the good structural stability of\nthe catalyst. To estimate the possible contribution of the dissolved\nFe ions to the reaction, the filtrate that was collected by removing\n0.5 g L<sup>\u20131</sup> CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) after vigorous agitation\nfor 180 min was applied to catalyze the degradation of SMT. It can\nbe seen from b that the degradation of SMT catalyzed by the dissolved Fe ions\nwas only 13.2% after 180 min, which manifested that the degradation\nof SMT was mainly dominated by the heterogeneous Fenton reaction catalyzed\nby CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe). Moreover, five consecutive cycling tests of SMT\ndegradation were performed to evaluate the reusability of CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe)\nusing the recovered catalyst under the same reaction conditions (c).

The catalytic performance of CUS-MIL-100(Fe) was investigated on the basis of various parameters, including initial pH, H2O2 concentration, catalyst dosage, and initial SMT concentration. The results showed that CUS-MIL-100(Fe) could effectively degrade SMT, with almost 100% removal efficiency within 180 min (52.4% mineralization efficiency), under the reaction conditions of pH 4.0, 20 mg L-1 SMT, 6 mM H2O2, and 0.5 g L-1 catalyst. Moreover, CUS-MIL-100(Fe) displayed a higher catalytic activity than that of MIL-100(Fe) for SMT degradation. Combined with the physical-chemical characterization, the enhanced catalytic activity can be ascribed to the incorporation of FeII and FeIII CUSs (coordinatively unsaturated metal sites), the large specific surface area, as well as the formation of mesopores. Furthermore, CUS-MIL-100(Fe) exhibited a good stability and reusability. The possible catalytic mechanism of CUS-MIL-100(Fe) was tentatively proposed.\n\nThe specific surface area and the porous nature of the resulting samples were determined by N2 adsorption-desorption measurements and are depicted in . From a, the MIL-100(Fe) presents a perfect type I isotherm of IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) classification without a discernible hysteresis loop, indicating the existence of uniform micropores in the structure. Different from the curve of MIL-100(Fe), the isotherm of CUS-MIL-100(Fe) is of type IV with a distinct H3 hysteresis loop reflecting the presence of mesoporous structure in the catalyst. b points out the BJH pore size distribution of MIL-100(Fe) and CUS-MIL-100(Fe), from which we can see that both of the samples possess the sharp peak below 2 nm, characteristic of micropores. Discarding that sharp peak, two major peaks of around 3.82 and 6.57 nm can be observed in the pore-size distribution curve of CUS-MIL-100(Fe), which further manifests that the introduction of iron CUS could result in the creation of mesopores in CUS-MIL-100(Fe) in addition to intrinsic micropores. The specific BET surface areas and pore structure parameters of each catalyst are summarized in . The specific BET surface area and total pore volume of MIL-100(Fe) were calculated to be 1271.31 and 0.656 cm3 g-1, while those of CUS-MIL-100(Fe) were 568.91 and 0.711 cm3 g-1, respectively. Despite the surface area of CUS-MIL-100(Fe) being diminished, its surface area value remains high. Thus it is expected that the high porosity and surface area of CUS-MIL-100(Fe) would facilitate the adsorption and diffusion of catalytic substrates to the exposed active sites in catalysis.\n\nCatalytic Properties of CUS-MIL-100(Fe)\n\nThe catalytic performance of CUS-MIL-100(Fe) was assessed for SMT degradation under the assistance of H2O2.  shows the removal profiles of SMT under various reaction systems. It can be seen that negligible SMT removal (2.5%) was obtained when H2O2 alone was present, which indicates that H2O2 itself can scarcely induce the degradation of SMT in the absence of solid catalyst. Meanwhile, without H2O2, CUS-MIL-100(Fe) alone exhibited a limited performance of SMT removal (17.6%) due to the adsorption of CUS-MIL-100(Fe). Notably, the SMT was almost completely removed within 180 min in the coexistence of CUS-MIL-100(Fe) and H2O2, indicating that the SMT was mainly degraded by the Fenton-like reaction rather than the adsorption process. To clarify the role of the iron CUS in the CUS-MIL-100(Fe) on the catalytic reaction, control experiment using MIL-100(Fe) + H2O2 system was also evaluated. The MIL-100(Fe) showed a much lower removal efficiency (only 11.1% of SMT degradation within 180 min) than the CUS-MIL-100(Fe). The result demonstrates that the incorporation of iron CUS is important for the catalyst to get a satisfactory catalytic activity in Fenton-like degradation of SMT. Together with the physical-chemical characterization, the incorporation of iron CUS could induce the formation of mesopores with enlarged pore channels that allow reactants to diffuse easily into the interior structure and enable the interior and external active sites for the full contact with the reactive media. In addition, the iron CUS in the pore channels, owing to its Lewis acidic character, could induce region-selectivity toward H2O2, thereby improving the opportunities for H2O2 to contact with the active sites. Meanwhile, the iron CUS with variable chemical valences (FeII CUS and FeIII CUS) would accelerate the decomposition of H2O2 to generate \u22c5OH radicals through the one-electron transfer process and thus enhance the catalytic activity for the SMT degradation.\n\n c and Figure S2c disclose the SMT degradation at different catalyst dosage. It was apparent that the increase in catalyst dosage surely accelerated the degradation of SMT. As the catalyst dosage increased from 0.2 to 1.5 g L-1, the k value increased gradually from 0.0054 to 0.0160 min-1, and the final SMT removal efficiency was increased from 70.3 to 98.8%. This originates from the fact that higher dosage of catalyst would provide more active sites available for the generation of \u22c5OH radicals, leading to the enhancement of catalytic efficiency.\n\nThe effect of initial SMT concentration on the degradation of SMT was evaluated as depicted in d and Figure S2d. Clearly, the SMT degradation rates tended to decline quickly when increasing the initial SMT concentration from 10 (0.0166 min-1) to 40 mg L-1 (0.0083 min-1). The likely reason for this phenomenon was that the rise of initial SMT concentration would result in the coverage of active sites on the catalyst, hampering the generation of \u22c5OH radicals and subsequent degradation of SMT. In addition, more intermediates were produced at higher initial SMT concentration, which may cause an undesirable competitive consumption of hydroxyl radicals and therefore decrease the degradation rate. \n\nDuring the oxidation process, the change of TOC value of the reaction solution was examined to reflect the mineralization degree of SMT. As observed in , the reduction of TOC proceeded more slowly than did the removal of SMT. After 180 min of reaction, >98% of SMT in the solution was eliminated, while the efficiency of TOC removal reached only 52.4%. Thus it was speculated that some organic residues derived from SMT decomposition remained in the solution. The efficiency of H2O2 utilization in terms of mineralization, defined as the amount of TOC converted per gram of H2O2 decomposed, was also calculated to establish the efficiency of the Fenton-like catalyst. Under these reaction conditions, the degradation of 180 min consumed 30.8% of the initial H2O2 concentration, which corresponded, in turn, to 86.3 mg TOC g-1 H2O2. The obtained value is in the range of the reported literature values, suggesting a high efficiency of H2O2 utilization and a good degradation of SMT. \n\nStability and Reusability of CUS-MIL-100(Fe)\n\nThe stability of the catalyst is of great significance for heterogeneous catalysis. To assess it, the concentrations of iron ions leaching from CUS-MIL-100(Fe) were also detected during the heterogeneous Fenton process over five cycles. As shown in a, the dissolved iron concentration gradually increased with the reaction time. The highest concentration of dissolved iron (0.41 mg L-1) was lower than the environmental standard (2 mg L-1) imposed by the European Union, avoiding the further treatment for iron ions. Additionally, the concentration of dissolved iron after each cycle ranged from 0.36 to 0.41 mg L-1, which suggested the good structural stability of the catalyst. To estimate the possible contribution of the dissolved Fe ions to the reaction, the filtrate that was collected by removing 0.5 g L-1 CUS-MIL-100(Fe) after vigorous agitation for 180 min was applied to catalyze the degradation of SMT. It can be seen from b that the degradation of SMT catalyzed by the dissolved Fe ions was only 13.2% after 180 min, which manifested that the degradation of SMT was mainly dominated by the heterogeneous Fenton reaction catalyzed by CUS-MIL-100(Fe). Moreover, five consecutive cycling tests of SMT degradation were performed to evaluate the reusability of CUS-MIL-100(Fe) using the recovered catalyst under the same reaction conditions (c). Specifically, a significantly drop in the catalytic activity of CUS-MIL-100(Fe) was found after the first application. To check the possible change in the surface chemistry of the CUS-MIL-100(Fe) before and after use, XPS measurement was performed. The XPS results () revealed that two new elements of N and S originating from the SMT were detected on the surface of the used CUS-MIL-100(Fe), and the amount of FeII CUSs in the CUS-MIL-100(Fe) was decreased after reaction. Therefore, the decreased activity of the used CUS-MIL-100(Fe) may be attributable to the loss of exposed FeII CUSs as well as the inhibition effect of the adsorbed organic species on catalyst surface. It should be remarked, however, that the catalytic activity of used CUS-MIL-100(Fe) was recovered to the original level as the fresh catalyst after reactivating under the same conditions described above. These results indicate that reactivation treatment under vacuum condition can recover the performance of the catalyst and enhance its reusability. Moreover, the physicochemical properties of the reactivated CUS-MIL-100(Fe) were also characterized by FESEM, XRD, FTIR, and XPS measurements ( and Figure S3). The results showed no significant change in the morphology, crystal structures, functional group, as well as the amount of FeII CUSs in comparison with the fresh catalyst, which provided further evidence of the good structural stability of the catalyst.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "porosity": [{"value": "0.87", "unit": "", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "porosity": [{"value": "38.2", "unit": "%", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "porosity": [{"value": "852.8", "unit": "\u00c53", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "porosity": [{"probe": "", "value": "1.2", "unit": "cm3/g", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "1500", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "B", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "porosity": [{"probe": "", "value": "0.9", "unit": "cm3/g", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "B", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": [{"type": "Langmuir", "probe": "", "value": "1200", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe)", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "porosity": [{"value": "568.91", "unit": "", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe)", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "568.91", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["porosity", "surface_area"]}, {"idx": 12, "type": "table", "classification": ["Property"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Textural Properties\nand Surface Elemental\nContents of MIL-100\u00ad(Fe) and CUS-MIL-100\u00ad(Fe)</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"10\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col5\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col6\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col7\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col8\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col9\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col10\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\"></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\"></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\"></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\"></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\" nameend=\"col8\" namest=\"col5\" rowsep=\"1\">surface atomic content</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\" nameend=\"col10\" namest=\"col9\" rowsep=\"1\">atomic ratio</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">sample</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<italic>S</italic>\n<sub>BET</sub> (m<sup>2</sup>\u00a0g<sup>\u20131</sup>)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">total pore\nvolume (cm<sup>3</sup>\u00a0g<sup>\u20131</sup>)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">average pore\ndiameter (nm)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">C\u00a0(%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">O\u00a0(%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">F\u00a0(%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">Fe\u00a0(%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">O/Fe</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">F/Fe</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>MIL-100(Fe)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1271.31</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.656</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.702</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>55.21</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>36.59</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.71</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>6.49</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>5.36</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.26</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>CUS-MIL-100(Fe)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>568.91</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.711</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>6.572</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>57.26</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>32.80</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.64</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>9.30</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>3.53</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.07</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "Table 1.
