More precisely, we measured the storage (G') and loss (G\") moduli as a function of time for solutions with 10 wt % PTA-OH and different ZIF-8 contents (c). Initially, for all solutions G\" > G', similar to solutions without ZIF-8 (Figure S2), the G'/G\" ratio is <1. When no ZIF-8 is added, practically no significant change of viscosity or G'/G\" with time was observed. This indicates the viscous fluidic behavior of the solutions. For samples with 5-15 wt % ZIF-8, above 12 min (c), G' becomes larger than G\", demonstrating that a gel-like behavior is developed. The time corresponding to the crossing of the G' and G\" curves (G'/G\" = 1) increases as 5 > 10 > 15 wt %.

The addition of only 3 wt % ZIF-8 (relative to the polymer content) to the PTA-OH solution causes gelation with a 4 orders of magnitude increase in viscosity, as seen in Figure S3b.

The shear rate at which the maximum occurs depends on temperature. For 30 \u00b0C or below, the maximum is probably out of the measurement range of the rheometer, with a slight increase of viscosity starting just below 10000 s-1.

Figure S4 presents Arrhenius-like plots of viscosity as a function of the inverse of temperature, at different shear rates.

Figure S11a shows stress-strain curves of films prepared with increasing ZIF-8 contents, and additional characterization is reported in Table S2.
