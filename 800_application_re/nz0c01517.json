Consequently, the fabricated quasi-solid metal batteries exhibit higher and more stable cycling performance compared to the performance of those without interface optimization. This strategy for optimizing the interfacial compatibility of MOFs thus exploits a new avenue for developing high-performance SEs for various metal batteries.\n\nIn this work, the physicochemically stable Zr-based MOF, UiO-66-2OH, was chosen for the fabrication of bioinspired SE, as the electronegative -OH groups are expected to bind Li+ and serve as hopping sites. Moreover, further chemical design is feasible with -OH groups. 3-Glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (\u03b3-GPS) was used to provide cross-linking nodes on MOF surfaces because of its suitable size and chemical property. The \u03b3-GPS molecule is ~11.7 \u00c5 in length and ~5.6 \u00c5 in width (Figure S1) and slightly larger than the window size of UiO-66-2OH (<6 \u00c5). Thus, the hydrolysis-condensation of \u03b3-GPS is supposed to occur on the surface of MOF particles, ensuring that the inner aperture of MOF-CN remains unoccupied. XRD and SEM results demonstrate that MOF-CN preserves the crystal structure of UiO-66-2OH (Figure S2), and its particle size is ~500 nm, without an obvious change from UiO-66-2OH (Figure S3). Compared with UiO-66-2OH, MOF-CN possesses a smaller BET surface area (785 m2 g-1 vs 520 m2 g-1) (Figure S4), suggesting the presence of \u03b3-GPS. To further certify the existence of \u03b3-GPS in MOF-CN, TGA and FT-IR were conducted. TGA data indicate that the organic content of MOF-CN is 2.2 wt % higher than that of UiO-66-2OH, which can be ascribed to grafted \u03b3-GPS (Figure S5). The additional adsorption peak at 1095 cm-1 observed in FT-IR spectra of MOF-CN is assigned to the stretching vibration of the Si-O-C group, confirming that \u03b3-GPS has been successfully grafted onto UiO-66-2OH (Figure S6a).\n\nThe calculated density of the SE-PMOF membrane is 0.32 g cm-3, while the densities of UiO-66-2OH pellets pressed under 1 and 2 MPa are 0.24 and 0.35 g cm-3, respectively (Figure S9). Thus, the density of SE-PMOF is close to that of the MOF pellet pressed under a pressure of 2 MPa, demonstrating that the in situ ring-opening reaction increased the stacking density of MOF particles and implying a close interface contact between MOF particles. One can seen in a that the MOF-CN particles are densely packed, and a very thin polymer overlayer can be observed between crystals. The side view of the SE-PMOF (b) shows that the membrane has a good uniform thickness, ~60 \u03bcm. The morphologies of SE-PMOF and the typical SE fabricated with the MOF and polymer binder (UiO-66-2OH/PVDF-HFP) are compared in Figure S10. Under a higher magnification, the MOF particles in SE-PMOF are fully covered by the thin polymer overlayer and are closely connected to each other (Figure S10a). While voids between MOF particles can be clearly observed in the case of UiO-66-2OH/PVDF-HFP, the diameters of some voids are >100 nm (Figure S10b). Therefore, compared with the physical contact in UiO-66-2OH/PVDF-HFP, the covalent bonds formed between MOF particles and the polymer in SE-PMOF can significantly improve the interfacial compatibility.\n\nBoth the mechanical property and the electronic conductivity were investigated to study the usability of the SE-PMOF. The SE-PMOF exhibits good flexibility and toughness (c). Tensile tests show that the dry SE-PMOF has a higher tensile strength, but its ductility is poor. The PC-wetted SE-PMOF possesses better ductility but a lower tensile strength (Figure S11). The tensile strength of the SE-PMOF is however lower than those of traditional polymers such as PEO and PVDF-HFP, which could be expected as the SE-PMOF is mainly composed of MOF particles and lacks long chain polymers. The electronic conductivity of the SE-PMOF was estimated with a multimeter, and the calculated electronic conductivity is 9.1 \u00d7 10-12 S cm-1, indicating that the SE-PMOF is an insulator.\n\nTo study the electrochemical stability of the SE-PMOF, a linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) test was conducted at a scan rate of 1 mV s-1 with asymmetric Li|SE-PMOF|SS (SS is short for stainless steel) cells. The SE-PMOF demonstrates a wide electrochemical window as large as ~4.6 V versus Li+/Li (d). To certify the superiority of SE-PMOF, the DPPG/PEGDE/PVDF-HFP and PVDF-HFP membrane were fabricated and tested under identical conditions. Both of them became unstable at ~4 V versus Li+/Li (d), suggesting that the SE-PMOF has better electrochemical stability compared with that of the traditional polymeric SE. \n\nThe ion transport ability of SE-PMOF was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at a range of temperatures from -20 to 60 \u00b0C (Figure S12). Migrations of Li+ and Zn2+ in the SE-PMOF were investigated as examples with LiTFSI, Zn(TFSI)2, and Zn(ClO4)2 as ion sources. The ionic conductivity of the SE-PMOF membrane increases with temperature and is calculated to be 1.70 \u00d7 10-3, 1.43 \u00d7 10-3, and 2.87 \u00d7 10-3 S cm-1 (at 30 \u00b0C) for LiTFSI, Zn(TFSI)2, and Zn(ClO4)2, respectively (e and Table S1). Moreover, the conductivity shows Arrhenius-type activated behavior, and the calculated ion migration energies are 0.27, 0.37, and 0.31 eV, respectively (f). The difference in ion conductivity between the use of Zn(TFSI)2 and Zn(ClO4)2 reveals that the anion can affect the transport of metal ions, as well, implying that more electronegative chemical groups promote ion transport better.

The Li+ conductivity of SE-PMOF is even higher than those of other previously reported MOFs applied in SSBs (Table S2 and Figure S15), which we attribute to the optimized interfacial compatibility in polymerized MOFs. \n\nBecause both positive and negative ions migrate during ion conductivity tests, the real conductivity of positive ions needs to be confirmed by ion transport number. Herein, the Li+ transference number (t Li+ ) in the SE-PMOF was evaluated with the potentiostatic polarization method using a Li|SE-PMOF|Li symmetric cell.
