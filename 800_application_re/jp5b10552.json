Pore size distributions (PSD) and accumulated pore volume of RFC and PFC spheres were calculated from adsorption branches of nitrogen sorption isotherms using the NLDFT (Nonlocal density functional theory) method for slit-like pores available in the BEL Master software from BEL Inc. Micropore volumes were calculated from the corresponding isotherms using the t plot method. The volume of pores below 2, 1, and 0.7 nm were calculated on the basis of accumulated pore volume. The isosteric heat of adsorption (Q st) was calculated using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Surface functional groups of the as-prepared carbon spheres were determined by recording FTIR spectra on a Varian Corporation (USA) Varian Scimitar 1000 FT-IR. Raman scattering spectra were recorded with a Renishaw RM1000 (514 nm). Samples for Raman scattering were prepared on a clean glass substrate, and the samples were excited using a green laser (514.5 nm and 0.05 mW power). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were recorded on a Rigaku, D/MAX-2500/PC equipped with Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 1.5406 \u00c5). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained with a HITACHI S-4800 microscope with an accelerating voltage of 15.0 kV and an applied current of 10 mA and a HITACHI SU8010 microscope with an accelerating voltage of 5.0 kV and an applied current of 10 mA. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were measured using a PHI Versa Probe system with a 100-W ALK Alpha X-ray source. Elemental analyses (EA) were obtained using FLASH EA1112. TEM images were recorded on a transmission electron microscope (JEM-3010) with an operating voltage at 300 kV. 13C solid state NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance II 500 MHz solid/microimaging high resolution NMR spectrometer.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 15, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Results\nand Discussion</title><title>Synthesis of Phenolic Resin Spheres</title><p>Since the first\nreport by Liu et al., who used the concept of the Sto\u0308ber method\nfor preparation of phenolic resin spheres with controllable size and\nnarrow particle size distribution, various modified approaches that\nutilize diverse additives and precursors have been carried out to\nprepare spherical morphologies as well as more complex structures\nsuch as core@shell materials.

The RFC and RFC_C45,\n120 samples showed characteristic type I isotherms; in contrast, RFC_C240\nand RFC_C380 samples showed type IV isotherms due to the presence\nof mesopores arising from prolonged activation times (a).

Thus, we first\ntried to utilize hot CO<sub>2</sub> treatment for activation of RFC\nand PFC spheres. CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption isotherms for the RFC and\nPFC series were measured at 298 and 273 K at atmospheric pressure\n(1 bar) (a,b\nand <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b10552/suppl_file/jp5b10552_si_001.pdf\">S8a,b</ext-link>). According to CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption isotherms for the RFC series measured at 273 K and 1\nbar, the CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption capacities of RFC and RFC_C45,\n120, and 240 samples were 3.82, 6.86, 5.59, and 4.86 mmol g<sup>\u20131</sup>, respectively (a and ); meanwhile\ntheir nitrogen contents were similar ().

When the accumulated pore volumes\nwith different pore sizes (e.g., 0.7, 1, and 2 nm) were plotted with\nrespect to CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption capacities for the PFC and RFC_C45,\nand 120 samples (d), a similar trend was observed that creation of ultramicropores\nis the dominant feature affecting CO<sub>2</sub> capacities.</p><p>Another important factor that\ncan enhance CO<sub>2</sub> uptake\nis the incorporation of nitrogen into the carbon framework to facilitate\ngreater adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub> onto the N-doped carbons. It has been reported that N-doped carbon has an increased <italic toggle=\"yes\">Q</italic>\n<sub>st</sub> value compared to its nondoped counterpart,\nwhich identifies the chemisorption ability of N-doped carbon. Therefore,\nit was of interest to observe the nitrogen effect using two different\ncarbon samples with almost the same textural feature (e.g., accumulated\npore volume of ultramicropores) but different nitrogen contents. As\nmentioned above, textural features of the RFC_C45 and RFC_N10 samples\nwere similar to each other ( and ), except that RFC_N10 had almost twice the nitrogen content\n(2.83 wt %) of RFC_C45 (1.55 wt %). Thus, the CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption\nisotherm for RFC_N10 was measured at 298 and 273 K at 1 bar (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b10552/suppl_file/jp5b10552_si_001.pdf\">Figures S10</ext-link> and b). According\nto the isotherm, the CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption capacity of RFC_N10\nat 273 K and atmospheric pressure was 7.14 mmol g<sup>\u20131</sup>, which is superior to the CO<sub>2</sub> uptake of 6.86 mmol g<sup>\u20131</sup> for RFC_C45 () and is located on the upper region of the plotted\nline, showing almost perfect correlation for CO<sub>2</sub> uptake\ncapacities of the RFC and PFC series (a).

Monodisperse and size-tunable (100-600 nm) RFC and PFC spheres had intrinsic nitrogen contents (ca. 1.5 wt %), which are attributed to the synthesis conditions that utilized NH3 as a basic catalyst as well as nitrogen precursor. A series of CO2-activated and N-doped RFC and PFC spheres showed almost perfect correlation (R 2 = 0.99) between CO2 adsorption capacities and accumulated pore volumes of fine micropores (ultramicropore <1 nm) obtained using the nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) model. Interestingly, NH3 activation served not only as an effective method for heteroatom doping (i.e., nitrogen) into the carbon framework but also as an excellent activation process to fine-tune the surface area and pore size distribution (PSD). Increased nitrogen doping levels up to ca. 2.8 wt % for NH3-activated RFC spheres showed superior CO2 adsorption capacities of 4.54 (1 bar) and 7.14 mmol g-1 (1 bar) at 298 and 273 K, respectively. Compared to CO2-activated RFC spheres with similar ultramicropore volume presenting CO2 uptakes of 4.41 (1 bar) and 6.86 mmol g-1 (1 bar) at 298 and 273 K, respectively, NH3-activated nitrogen-enriched RFC was found to have elevated chemisorption ability. Moreover, prolonged activation of RFC and PFC spheres provided ultrahigh surface areas, one of which reached 4079 m2g-1 with an unprecedented superb H2 uptake capacity of 3.26 wt % at 77 K (1 bar), representing one of the best H2 storage media among carbonaceous materials and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs).\n\nStructure-property relationships of a series of activated RFC and PFC spheres for CO2 uptake revealed that regardless of the different polymer spheres used (RFP and PFP), a perfect linear relationship (R 2 = 0.99) between CO2 uptake and ultramicropore volume, determined by the NLDFT (nonlocal density functional theory), was found. The capacity of CO2 uptake with CO2-activated RFC spheres reached as high as 4.41 and 6.86 mmolg-1 at 298 and 273 K at atmospheric pressure (1 bar), respectively. In addition, hot NH3 activation of carbon spheres gave a similar ultramicropore volume with almost twice the nitrogen content (2.83%) compared to that of the CO2-activated RFC counterpart (1.55%). As a result, ultrahigh CO2 uptakes for NH3-activated RFC were recorded as 4.54 and 7.14 mmolg-1 at 298 and 273 K at atmospheric pressure (1 bar), respectively, which are higher than those of CO2-activated RFC, strongly suggesting that the elevated chemisorption by heteroatom doping via hot NH3 treatment affects the CO2 uptake capacity.\n\nFurthermore, a prolonged activation process resulted in ultrahigh surface area of RFC spheres up to 4079 m2g-1 with an unprecedented H2 uptake capacity of 3.26 wt % at 77 K (1 bar), which is comparable to the best H2 storage media among carbonaceous materials and MOFs.\n\nNitrogen Adsorption Studies\n\nTextural features of RFC, CO2-activated RFCs, PFC, CO2-activated PFCs, and RFC_N10 samples were analyzed using nitrogen sorption measurements, adsorption parameters such as specific surface area were determined by the BET model, micropore volumes with different pore sizes were derived from the t method and the NLDFT model, pore size distribution (PSD) was obtained from the NLDFT model, and total pore volume was measured at P/P 0 = 0.99, and the results are listed in . First, as-made RFC and CO2-activated RFC_C45, 120, 240, and 380 samples show significantly increased uptakes at low relative pressure representing microporous features along with CO2-activation times (a). As mentioned above, hot CO2 treatment activates RFC spheres via the chemical reaction C(s) + CO2 (g) \u2192 2CO (g), which generates small pores that become larger pores with increased reaction times. The RFC and RFC_C45, 120 samples showed characteristic type I isotherms; in contrast, RFC_C240 and RFC_C380 samples showed type IV isotherms due to the presence of mesopores arising from prolonged activation times (a). As anticipated, surface areas of the samples determined by the BET model were significantly increased from 724 to 1611, 2842, 3540, and 4079 m2 g-1 for the RFC and RFC_C45, 120, 240, and 380 samples, respectively (). It is notable that a surface area as high as 4000 m2 g-1 for RFC_C380 has rarely been reported for carbon materials. Additionally, the micropore volumes determined from the t method were also significantly increased from 0.31 to 0.83, 1.26, 1.27, and 1.28 cm3 g-1 for the RFC and RFC_C45, 120, 240, and 380 samples, respectively (). Interestingly, the micropore volume seems to be saturated at around 1.26 for the RFC_C120, 240, and 380 samples, resulting from the creation of pores larger than 2 nm. Along with the trend of surface area, total pore volumes of the RFC and RFC_C45, 120, 240, and 380 samples were substantially developed from 0.28 to 0.73, 1.33, 2.0, and 2.56 cm3 g-1, which is consistent with CO2-activation times ().\n\nPSD was derived using the NLDFT model in order to closely characterize the micropores of the carbon materials. According to PSD, ultramicropores centered around 0.7 nm quickly developed with a 45 min CO2-activation time and gradually decreased with prolonged activation times because of continuous weight loss during the activation process (b,c). The accumulated ultramicropore volume of the RFC_C45 sample had the highest value of 0.61 cm3 g-1 compared to the other CO2-activated samples that had a broader distribution of up to 4 nm for RFC_C380 (d,e and ). Therefore, a controlled activation process could generate selective development of ultramicropores under the specific conditions.\n\nIn contrast, when hot NH3 activation was applied to RFC spheres, increased uptake at low relative pressure compared to the parent RFC spheres strongly suggested the development of micropores (a). A specific surface area of 1458 m2 g-1, micropore volume of 0.76 cm3 g-1 derived from the t method, accumulated ultramicropore volume of 0.59 cm3 g-1, and the PSD were identified (b, d and ). The obtained values and distribution of the RFC_N10 sample are very similar to those of the RFC_C45 sample, which suggests that they have similar textural features except for different nitrogen doping levels.\n\nCO2 Adsorption Studies\n\nIt has been widely accepted that enhanced CO2 uptake for carbonaceous materials arises from development of ultramicropores and incorporation of nitrogen atoms into the carbon framework. Thus, we first tried to utilize hot CO2 treatment for activation of RFC and PFC spheres. CO2 adsorption isotherms for the RFC and PFC series were measured at 298 and 273 K at atmospheric pressure (1 bar) (a,b and S8a,b). According to CO2 adsorption isotherms for the RFC series measured at 273 K and 1 bar, the CO2 adsorption capacities of RFC and RFC_C45, 120, and 240 samples were 3.82, 6.86, 5.59, and 4.86 mmol g-1, respectively (a and ); meanwhile their nitrogen contents were similar (). The ultramicropore volumes for RFC and RFC_C45, 120, and 240 samples of 0.24, 0.61, 0.46, and 0.36 cm3 g-1, respectively, strongly suggesting that development of ultramicroporosity by the CO2-activation process mainly governs the CO2 uptake capacities in this series in good agreement with previously reported results (). \n\nThe CO2 adsorption capacities of PFC and PFC_C45 and 120 samples measured at 273 K and atmospheric pressure were 4.55, 6.77, and 5.77 mmol g-1, respectively (b and ), and the same trend for CO2 uptake capacities was also obtained at 298 K and 1 bar (Figure S8b and ), again strongly suggesting the importance of development of ultramicroporosity. When the accumulated pore volumes with different pore sizes (e.g., 0.7, 1, and 2 nm) were plotted with respect to CO2 adsorption capacities for the PFC and RFC_C45, and 120 samples (d), a similar trend was observed that creation of ultramicropores is the dominant feature affecting CO2 capacities.\n\nAnother important factor that can enhance CO2 uptake is the incorporation of nitrogen into the carbon framework to facilitate greater adsorption of CO2 onto the N-doped carbons. It has been reported that N-doped carbon has an increased Q st value compared to its nondoped counterpart, which identifies the chemisorption ability of N-doped carbon. Therefore, it was of interest to observe the nitrogen effect using two different carbon samples with almost the same textural feature (e.g., accumulated pore volume of ultramicropores) but different nitrogen contents. As mentioned above, textural features of the RFC_C45 and RFC_N10 samples were similar to each other ( and ), except that RFC_N10 had almost twice the nitrogen content (2.83 wt %) of RFC_C45 (1.55 wt %). Thus, the CO2 adsorption isotherm for RFC_N10 was measured at 298 and 273 K at 1 bar (Figures S10 and b). According to the isotherm, the CO2 adsorption capacity of RFC_N10 at 273 K and atmospheric pressure was 7.14 mmol g-1, which is superior to the CO2 uptake of 6.86 mmol g-1 for RFC_C45 () and is located on the upper region of the plotted line, showing almost perfect correlation for CO2 uptake capacities of the RFC and PFC series (a). The reason for the ultrahigh CO2 uptake capacity for RFC_N10 is attributed to the higher nitrogen content that is accompanied by a greater Lewis acid-base interaction between the acidic CO2 and N-doped carbon framework. To assess the strength of the interactions between CO2 and the carbon samples, Q st values for RFC_C45 and RFC_N10 were calculated using CO2 sorption isotherms measured at 273 and 293 K by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. As seen in c, through all the coverage regions, RFC_N10 has a higher Q st value than that of RFC_C45, arising from higher incorporation of electron-rich nitrogen sites in the RFC_N10 sample, which could facilitate more interactions between acidic CO2 and basic N-doped carbon.\n\nH2 Adsorption Studies\n\nLight weight, high specific surface area, and development of microporosity of carbonaceous materials are particularly important features for enhanced storage of H2. In this article, as a means to augment the specific surface area and microporosity, activation processes using hot CO2 and NH3 treatments provided significantly increased textural features regardless of carbons produced with different precursors. According to the H2 isotherms for carbon samples measured at 77 and 87 K and 1 bar (Figure S11), H2 uptake sharply increased along with activation times for the carbon samples with PFC_120 and RFC_240 and 380, exhibiting more than twice the H2 capacity compared to the parent carbon spheres (RFC and PFC) ( and Figure S11). In addition, the Q st for H2 of the samples was calculated by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation (). Similarly, the trend of the Q st of H2 adsorption resembled that of CO2 adsorption, probably resulting from the generation of larger pores for prolonged CO2-activated carbon samples (). In particular, the RFC_380 sample had an ultrahigh H2 uptake capacity, as high as 3.26 wt %, which makes it one of the most efficient H2 storage adsorbents among carbonaceous materials and MOFs (Table S3).
