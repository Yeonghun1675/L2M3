Accordingly, the PET process upon selective 532 nm laser excitation of the Rudcbpy-UiO-67(Zr) MOF should take place from the excited Ru2+|3 of the Rudcbpy complex grafted to the MOF lattice to the inorganic cluster (see ). To further confirm this proposal, an additional experiment was performed using UiO-67(Zr) as reference.
