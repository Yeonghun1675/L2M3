Bi2O(H2O)2(C14H2O8)\u22c5nH2O (SU-101) was inspired by bismuth phenolate metallodrugs, and could be synthesized entirely from nonhazardous or edible reagents under ambient aqueous conditions, enabling simple scale-up. Reagent-grade and affordable dietary supplement-grade ellagic acid was sourced from tree bark and pomegranate hulls, respectively. Biocompatibility and colloidal stability were confirmed by in vitro assays. The material exhibits remarkable chemical stability for a bioinspired MOF (pH = 2-14, hydrothermal conditions, heated organic solvents, biological media, SO2 and H2S), attributed to the strongly chelating phenolates. A total H2S uptake of 15.95 mmol g-1 was recorded, representing one of the highest H2S capacities for a MOF, where polysulfides are formed inside the pores of the material. Phenolic phytochemicals remain largely unexplored as linkers for MOF synthesis, opening new avenues to design stable, eco-friendly, scalable, and low-cost MOFs for diverse applications, including drug delivery.\n\nThe thermal stability of SU-101 was assessed by variable temperature powder X-ray diffraction (VT-PXRD), revealing that the framework remains crystalline under vacuum or in a nitrogen atmosphere at temperatures of up to 500 \u00b0C (Figures S8 and S9). While VT-PXRD tests are not always employed to study the thermal stability of MOFs, hindering an overall comparison, an intact and open framework at 500 \u00b0C (independent of atmosphere) has only been shown for a small handful of MOFs, such as CFA-2 and ZIF-8. The framework remains intact up to 250 \u00b0C in air, after which the ellagate anion likely oxidizes, leading to a loss of crystallinity (Figure S10). This has also been observed with other MOFs composed of phenolate linkers and has been attributed to the relative ease with which phenolates are oxidized. \n\nThe permanent microporosity of SU-101 was confirmed by N2 sorption experiments at 77 K after activating the material at 150 \u00b0C under vacuum for 10 h. Type I N2 isotherms, typical for microporous materials, were observed (Figures S11 and S12), with a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area (S BET) of 412 m2g-1 when using reagent-grade ellagic acid for synthesis and 350 m2 g-1 for a washed large-scale batch produced from supplement-grade ellagic acid. These values are within the range of surface areas previously reported for Bi(iii)-MOFs (70-1100 m2 g-1). \n\nThe average pore size of SU-101 was estimated to be approximately 6.8 \u00c5 (Figure S13), in good agreement with the crystallographic model (6-7 \u00c5). The pore size distribution was calculated using the density functional theory (DFT) method with a N2 slit pore model. The trend toward lower surface areas obtained by Bi(iii)-MOFs in units of m2 g-1 is in part due to the heavy nature of Bi3+ compared to the significantly lighter metal cations found in the large majority of other MOFs. The adsorption of other environmentally and industrially relevant gases, CO2 and CH4, was also investigated (Figure S14), where SU-101 displays a higher affinity toward CO2 over N2 and CH4, due to the lower saturation pressure of CO2. The CO2/N2 selectivity for a hypothetical flue gas mixture, containing 15 kPa CO2 and 85 kPa N2 was estimated using the equation s = (q1/q2)/(p1/p2), giving a CO2/N2 selectivity of ~35, yet other MOFs and porous materials have shown higher selectivity and CO2 uptakes under similar conditions. Even so, bismuth-based MOFs are of interest as precursors to electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction, as demonstrated using CAU-7. \n\nColloidal Stability and Biocompatibility\n\nIn addition to the structural and chemical stability of a material in biorelevant conditions, insight into the physicochemical properties such as charge, surface chemistry, and colloidal stability will affect the affinity to different biological structures, which in turn governs the efficacy and biodistribution of the material. Aqueous suspensions of SU-101 exhibit a small and monodisperse particle size of 129 \u00b1 2 nm (PdI ~ 0.3), a size which is a priori compatible with intravenous drug administration. This hydrodynamic diameter, obtained by dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements, assumes a spherical particle shape in solution, yet is in fair agreement with the microscopic observations acquired by TEM (Figures S1 and S2), showing polydispersed elongated crystals at its dry state (176 \u00b1 88 nm length and 51 \u00b1 18 nm wide; measured from 200 particles). This slight particle size difference between methods has been previously observed. In addition, previous intravenous toxicological studies using elongated MOF nanoparticles did not show any signs of in vivo toxicity associated with the MOF morphology. As such, a biocompatible character of SU-101 is expected (see below). When monitoring the particle size over time (24 h), SU-101 exhibited suitable colloidal stability in water (average size ~137 \u00b1 4 nm; Figure S19) with a strongly negative \u03b6-potential (-35 mV), possibly due to the presence of partially coordinated ellagate anions or hydroxyl groups completing the coordination sphere of superficial Bi3+. In turn, the resulting electrostatic repulsions might be responsible for the observed colloidal stability. In RPMI, the observed particle size is slightly larger than that in water (180 \u00b1 26 nm), while also showing a less negative \u03b6-potential (-10 mV). This is expected as proteins in the RPMI media (supplemented with FBS) can adhere to the particle surfaces, hampering direct interparticle contact through the formation of a protein corona, leading to lower surface charge values (from -35 \u00b1 1 to -10 \u00b1 0 mV), in agreement with previous colloidal MOF behaviors. Colloidal stability is maintained over time, with a particle size of 200 \u00b1 11 nm over 24 h, further indicating properties suitable for biological applications.\n\nTo explore the intrinsic qualities and potential applications of this green material, in vitro cytotoxicity tests were performed to assess the biocompatibility of SU-101. For these purposes, a promyelocytic cell line (HL-60) was selected as a model for differentiated phagocytic cells and granulocytes involved in the body's defense. Remarkably, after 24 h of cell contact, a very low cytotoxicity profile was observed (80% maximum inhibitory concentration, IC80 = 1000 \u03bcgmL-1), even when exposed to very high concentrations of SU-101 (up to 1200 \u03bcgmL-1; Figure S20). This is in agreement with the absence of severe toxicity observed for the individual reagents\ue5f8ellagic acid and bismuth acetate. Therefore, SU-101 seems to be a promising candidate for environmental and biological applications, such as depollution and drug delivery, both being chemically stable and biocompatible.\n\nTo investigate the adsorptive properties of SU-101, SO2 sorption isotherms were acquired at pressures between 0 to 1 bar at 298 K on an activated sample using a Dynamic Gravimetric Gas/Vapor Sorption Analyzer, DVS vacuum (see SI). The resulting SO2 isotherm shows a total uptake of 2.2 mmol g-1 (Figure S21). Although this value is considerably lower than the uptake of other MOFs, the stability of SU-101 upon adsorption-desorption cycling was investigated and structural integrity after both dry and humid SO2 sorption was confirmed by PXRD (Figures S25 and S27). Furthermore, the host-guest interaction between SU-101 and SO2 was quantified, evaluating the isosteric heat of adsorption (\u0394H) for SO2 at low coverage for SU-101 (estimated by fitting two adsorption isotherms at 303 and 308 K to a Clausius-Clapeyron equation, Figures S22 and S23). The low isosteric heat of adsorption for SO2 (\u0394H = -29.6 kJ mol-1) indicates that no M-SO2 interactions occur (>90 kJ mol-1). Since the heat of adsorption was low, cycling experiments were carried out, where activation of SU-101 between cycles was achieved by applying vacuum (1.7 \u00d7 10-6 Torr) for only 15 min at 298 K. Using this procedure, it was demonstrated that the SO2 capture capacity (1 bar, 298 K) remains constant during 50 adsorption-desorption cycles (2.200 \u00b1 0.004 mmol g-1, Figure S24) with the structure remaining intact (Figure S25).", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "SU-101", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "Bi2O(H2O)2(C14H2O8)nH2O"}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "500", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "thermal stability", "condition": "vacuum or nitrogen atmosphere"}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "", "unit": "wt%", "temperature": "25\u00b0C", "pressure": "1 atm", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "", "unit": "wt%", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "1 atm", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["decomposition_temperature", "gas_adsorption"]}, {"idx": 31, "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<p>H<sub>2</sub>S capture by SU-101 was investigated with a\nseries\nof breakthrough experiments (4.3 vol % H<sub>2</sub>S with 95.7 vol\n% of N<sub>2</sub>).
