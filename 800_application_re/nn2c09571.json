Unlike the carbon\nK-edge that is similar for the three systems, distinct LL features\nare found for each nanoMOF. d shows the low-loss response of nanoMOFs obtained\nat low (10 e<sup>\u2013</sup>/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>) and higher (above\n130 e<sup>\u2013</sup>/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>) electron doses with a\ncloser look between 2 eV and 10 eV. At low dose, MIL-100\u00ad(Al) displays\nan intense peak centered around 5.8 eV with shoulders at 5.2 eV and\n6.6 eV. For MIL-100\u00ad(Fe), a similar feature is exhibited with a slight\nblue-shift of the intense peak to 5.9 eV and less pronounced shoulders\nat 5.3 eV and 6.6 eV. Both MIL-100 exhibit two weak features at 2.5\neV and 3.5 eV and an additional very weak peak near 4.5 eV. Conversely,\nonly two intense and asymmetric peaks are found for UiO-66 near 5.1\neV and 6.5 eV. The aforementioned signals of the three nanoMOFs agree\nreasonably well with UV\u2013vis experiments between 2 eV and 6\neV. They have been usually related to \u03c0\u2013\u03c0*\ntransitions but barely assigned to specific chemical functions. To\nget more insights, we compared the signature of nanoMOFs with their\nfreestanding organic linkers, focusing on the shaded area LL<sub>2</sub> in a\u2013d.\nThe two organic linkers (BTC and BDC) show two peaks at 5.3 eV and\n6.8 eV (see <ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.2c09571/suppl_file/nn2c09571_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S5</ext-link> for the comparison\nof nanoMOFs, BTC, and BDC spectra). They were attributed to the designated\nbenzoic and local-excitation bands of functionalized phenyl groups,\nrespectively. These bands seem to be\nslightly red-shifted for nanoMOFs, where the linkers are coordinated\nwith metals (<italic toggle=\"yes\">e.g.</italic>, shifted to 5.1 eV and 6.5 eV for\nUiO-66). Hence, we assume that the metal bonding affects the LL<sub>2</sub> features of the coordinated organic molecules. This is in\nagreement with previous UV\u2013vis studies that related the 5.1\neV peak of UiO-66 to linker-to-metal charge transfer. In addition, the peak observed for MIL-100 around 5.8 eV/5.9 eV\nis not detected for the organic linkers. Thus, this intense peak may\nalso be related to metal bonding. In a nutshell, our results suggest\nthe LL<sub>2</sub> feature may be considered as a spectral fingerprint\nof the coordination bonding between the organic and metal parts of\nthe nanoMOFs. In the absence of UV data from the literature, the weak\nfeatures observed for MIL-100 below 4 eV are not straightforward to\ninterpret and theoretical studies are required to elucidate their\norigin.</p>", "clean_text": "Thereafter, we studied the metal part of nanoMOFs and first kept focused on MIL-100(Fe) (c,d). c (right side, red lines) depicts the typical dose evolution observed for the iron L2,3-edge on MIL-100(Fe). The L-edges of transition metals provide information on their electronic environment such as oxidation state and crystal-field splitting. Unfortunately, the signal was too low in low-dose conditions for any fine analysis. Iron's low cross-section and low concentration in the nanoMOFs make the signal tens of times weaker than the carbon K-edge one. A quantifiable signal was only detected for higher electron doses starting from 90 e-/\u00c52. As aforementioned, these conditions imply that the organic part is already degraded. At this dose, MIL-100(Fe) exhibits a main peak at 707.6 eV, followed by a small shoulder at 708.9 eV (observable for higher electron doses i.e., 780 e-/\u00c52). These data agree with previous XANES measurements on MIL-100(Fe), where authors attributed the signature to surface Fe2+ species produced by reduction under vacuum. These authors also detected a peak at 534.2 eV similar to CL6, which we assign here to degraded organic linkers. Herein, the combined systematic study of the iron, oxygen, and carbon edges as a function of the electron dose provides additional information on this phenomenon. This dose-effect study suggests that the linkers' reduction induced by radiolysis can also affect the coordination structure of iron and, hence, its valency. Nonetheless, the iron behavior under high electron irradiation remains unclear. d shows the evolution of the iron L2,3-edge of MIL-100(Fe) compared to an iron(III) oxide reference (gray line) for higher doses between 500 e-/\u00c52 and 104 e-/\u00c52. Starting from 2 \u00d7 103 e-/\u00c52, the peak of MIL-100(Fe) located at 708.9 eV drastically increases, revealing changes in electronic configuration. For this high-dose range, the organic fraction is degraded and may involve a complex chemical evolution which is not straightforward to disentangle.\n\nLow-Loss Excitations\n\nThereafter, we focus on analyzing the LL region, where the excitations of valence electrons are visible. First, we used a large energy window of 400 eV to simultaneously monitor the LL and CL evolutions with the electron dose (a-c, \u03b4E = 800 meV). Then, we used a smaller energy window, spanning 16 eV, to achieve a better energy resolution (d, \u03b4E = 40 meV). The more significant LL contribution shared for the three nanoMOFs is a huge bulk plasmon peak standing out near 22 eV, due to the electrons' collective oscillations (observed in b). As shown in a-c, other molecular features are also observable in the UV energy range below 10 eV. Unlike the carbon K-edge that is similar for the three systems, distinct LL features are found for each nanoMOF. d shows the low-loss response of nanoMOFs obtained at low (10 e-/\u00c52) and higher (above 130 e-/\u00c52) electron doses with a closer look between 2 eV and 10 eV. At low dose, MIL-100(Al) displays an intense peak centered around 5.8 eV with shoulders at 5.2 eV and 6.6 eV. For MIL-100(Fe), a similar feature is exhibited with a slight blue-shift of the intense peak to 5.9 eV and less pronounced shoulders at 5.3 eV and 6.6 eV. Both MIL-100 exhibit two weak features at 2.5 eV and 3.5 eV and an additional very weak peak near 4.5 eV. Conversely, only two intense and asymmetric peaks are found for UiO-66 near 5.1 eV and 6.5 eV. The aforementioned signals of the three nanoMOFs agree reasonably well with UV-vis experiments between 2 eV and 6 eV. They have been usually related to \u03c0-\u03c0* transitions but barely assigned to specific chemical functions. To get more insights, we compared the signature of nanoMOFs with their freestanding organic linkers, focusing on the shaded area LL2 in a-d. The two organic linkers (BTC and BDC) show two peaks at 5.3 eV and 6.8 eV (see Figure S5 for the comparison of nanoMOFs, BTC, and BDC spectra). They were attributed to the designated benzoic and local-excitation bands of functionalized phenyl groups, respectively. These bands seem to be slightly red-shifted for nanoMOFs, where the linkers are coordinated with metals (e.g., shifted to 5.1 eV and 6.5 eV for UiO-66). Hence, we assume that the metal bonding affects the LL2 features of the coordinated organic molecules. This is in agreement with previous UV-vis studies that related the 5.1 eV peak of UiO-66 to linker-to-metal charge transfer. In addition, the peak observed for MIL-100 around 5.8 eV/5.9 eV is not detected for the organic linkers. Thus, this intense peak may also be related to metal bonding. In a nutshell, our results suggest the LL2 feature may be considered as a spectral fingerprint of the coordination bonding between the organic and metal parts of the nanoMOFs.

(a) Comparison of the ultralow-loss EELS (solid line) with conventional FTIR (dotted line) for MIL-100(Al) in blue, MIL-100(Fe) in red, BTC in yellow, UiO-66 in green, and BDC in pink. All EEL spectra are averages obtained by extracting and summing the signal over the whole hyperspectral image. They have been collected in an energy window of 2 eV and deconvolved using the Richardson-Lucy Algorithm (details in the SI). The EEL energy resolution is about \u03b4E = 7 meV (55 cm-1), and the FTIR one is about 4 cm-1 (0.5 meV). (b) HAADF image of MIL-100(Al) nanoparticles and (c) corresponding chemical map of the CO vibration modes (shaded ULL4 area in panel a). (d) Intensity profiles acquired along the indicated line of the HAADF image (black line profile) and the chemical map (blue line profile) from panels b and c. To increase the SNR, several line profiles were added, as illustrated by the white dotted rectangle in panels b and c. It shows a localized signal on the nanoparticles. Gray stars indicate the amorphous carbon film signal. (e) Chemical map obtained on an area where no excitation was detected (450-495 meV). It attests that thickness does not contribute to the signal map of MIL-100(Al) in panel b. The pixel size is 2 nm in panels b, c, and e. Chemical maps were obtained as described in the SI. They have been normalized to the ZLP to exclude the thickness variations. For comparison, their intensity scale is also normalized (see the SI).
