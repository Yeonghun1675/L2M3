We attribute (speculatively) a broad band at 3598 cm-1 to an H-bonded species formed by the piperidinium moiety with the Zr-bound phosphonate, hydroxyl, and residual solvents; note a corresponding band in the SALI-PPA sample, prior to piperidine treatment, appearing at 3614 cm-1. Regardless of the assignments, it is clear that piperidine binds via an acid/base interaction that is unavailable in SALI-BA.
