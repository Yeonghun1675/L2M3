Therefore, in order to gain fundamental insight into these trends, five representative structures were chosen for further investigation via molecular simulation. For this study, the five circled structures in Figure  (DMOF, DMOF-DM, DMOF-TM, DMOF-Cl2 and DMOF-TF) were chosen based on their diversity in terms of degree (full vs partial) and type (polar vs nonpolar) of ligand functionalization. The relatively low experimental Henry's coefficients of the polar DMOF-TF and DMOF-Cl2 structures are particularly interesting to explore as a recent screening of over 130000 hypothetical MOFs identified fluorine and chlorine as the two functional groups most strongly correlated with increased selectivity for CO2 over N2 and CH4 at 298 K in a range of gas mixture compositions. In fact, nearly 50% of all structures exhibiting the highest CO2 selectivity in this study contained fluorine atoms.
