Had we been able to interview each student, perhaps they\nwould have provided us with more nuanced responses that might have\nfallen in more than one category.</p>", "clean_text": "Discussion and Conclusion\n\nAs can be seen from the data presented in , students in general reported learning something as a result of the various presentations that they received. Notably, the only students who reported learning something about authentic laboratory work were those who viewed the video, with or without the presence of the researcher. That being said, the percentages of students who reported learning something about authentic work was still quite low. Perhaps we can do a better job in the future supplementing the video with hands-on laboratory work and other related activities before and after viewing the video. Previous research in the use of educational videos in chemistry teaching contexts demonstrates the value of planned video pauses with explicitly designed discussion questions. This is definitely a strategy that could be implemented with this video in the future. Another interesting finding was that the only students who reported learning nothing were those in classes where the chemist was not present during the experience. This finding indicates that a knowledgeable chemist present during the video playback was a key variable related to learning outcomes. We wonder, if a trained high school teacher, e.g., one who has personal experience conducting professional chemistry research, might be able to substitute for the presence of the chemist. Perhaps what is important is the presence of expertise itself and an expertise that could potentially be had by the high school teacher. This is something that needs future research. It is worth mentioning here that the majority of all of the students in the video only groups (i.e., those that lacked the presence of the expert chemist) did report learning something valuable about the work that chemists do, the applications of MOF chemistry, material chemistry in general, or authentic laboratory work. One limitation to our analysis was that we coded each student to only one category of learning (). We do believe that given the data we had, this was the best that we could do. Had we been able to interview each student, perhaps they would have provided us with more nuanced responses that might have fallen in more than one category.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 20, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>We believe that this information demonstrates the value of a chemist-generated\nresearch-related video for the purposes of introducing high school\nchemistry students to authentic chemistry research and related concepts.\nThis is particularly important because visiting individual classrooms\nin high school settings is quite time-consuming and requires a good\ndeal of planning.
