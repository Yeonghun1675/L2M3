These results indicated that the chirality of UCNP@ZIF-NiSx-L was from the chiral NiSx-L NPs. To confirm this assumption, dispersed chiral NiSx-L NPs were prepared. The TEM image in Figure S10 shows that the diameter of the chiral NiSx-L NPs was about 3.5 nm. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was conducted to analyze the changes in mercapto groups (-SH). As shown in Figure S11, FTIR of the chiral L-pen showed a peak at 2586 cm-1, which was assigned to the stretching and vibration of the S-H bond. After formation of the chiral NiSx-L NPs, the peak completely disappeared, indicating cleavage of the S-H bond by the strong covalent binding of thiol groups to Ni atoms on the surface of the NiSx-L NPs. The CD spectrum of the chiral NiSx-L NPs (Figure S12) showed a similar CD response to UCNP@ZIF-NiSx-L, further confirming the existence of chiral NiSx-L NPs in the nanoassemblies. Notably, the NiSx-L and NiSx-D NPs which were induced by the chiral L-pen and D-pen displayed mirror image CD lines (Figure S12). Absorption spectra were carried out to characterize the optical activity of the prepared nanomaterials. As displayed in Figure S13, chiral NiSx NPs showed absorption peaks at 415 and 535 nm, and the absorption of UCNP@ZIF-NiSx-L was in accordance with chiral NiSx-L, demonstrating that NiSx-L NPs were assembled into UCNP@ZIF successfully. Concurrently, the UCL of UCNP@ZIF-NiSx-L at 540 nm was dramatically quenched by NiSx-L NPs (Figure S14).\n\nMore importantly, the change of CD signal exhibited a perfect linear relationship with the H2O2 concentration ranging from 0.05 to 20 \u03bcM, and the LOD was 0.032 \u03bcM. (A and S20). We next tested the feasibility of this probe for its ability to detect H2O2 using a luminescent signal. As shown in Figure S21, the absorption of the probe spectrally overlaps with the green emission (540 nm) of the UCNPs. Reaction of H2O2 with the probe caused a decrease in probe absorption at 660 nm, which will then increase the I 660/I 540 ratio of the probe (B). A plot of I 660/I 540 ratio versus H2O2 concentration in the range of 0.05 to 20 \u03bcM shows a linear response, and LOD was calculated to be 0.037 \u03bcM (Figure S22). Next, the selectivity of this probe was tested. In the presence of ROS, the CD signal disappeared, and the luminescent signal was restored, whereas no obvious changes in the CD or luminescent signals were observed with possible interfering components. This suggested that this detection probe had a perfect specificity (C,D and S23, S24). Therefore, the UCNP@ZIF-NiSx probe had adequate sensitivity and excellent selectivity for the detection of ROS under physiological conditions.\n\nTo determine the various levels of H2O2 in living cells, normal primary uterine fibroblast cells (PCS-460-010) were treated with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to eliminate intracellular ROS. They were then incubated with varying concentrations of H2O2 to increase intracellular H2O2 levels. After treatment, intracellular H2O2 was quantified with a hydrogen peroxide assay kit. For UCL signal detection, the PCS-460-010 cells were incubated with the nanoassemblies and then confocal images were taken under an optical microscope equipped with a 980 nm laser. As shown in A, the green UCL signal as expected increased, whereas the red UCL signal remained unchanged, with an increase in intracellular H2O2 concentration. The UCL signal allowed a linear relationship ranging from 0.18 to 10.2 \u03bc\u039c, and the LOD was 0.13 \u03bc\u039c, which is much lower than the H2O2 level (~35 \u03bcM) in human blood plasma. \n\nThe intracellular CD signal was obtained after the PCS-460-010 cells were incubated with the probe for 4 h (C). As can be seen in the CD spectra, the CD intensity decreased as the concentration of ROS increased in the cells, exhibiting a good linear relationship with the concentration of H2O2 (D). The detection range of the CD signal was 0.18-10.2 \u03bcM, and the LOD was calculated to be 0.09 \u03bcM.\n\nTo confirm general applicability of this probe, the detection of intracellular ROS levels was also carried out in human epithelial cancer cells (HeLa cells) and human melanoma SK-MEL-2 cells (A and S28). For HeLa cells, the intracellular H2O2 level was calculated to be 2.29 \u00b1 0.21 \u03bcM and 2.43 \u00b1 0.17 \u03bcM from the CD mode and UCL mode, respectively. For SK-MEL-2 cells, the CD and UCL detection results were 1.33 \u00b1 0.23 \u03bcM and 1.37 \u00b1 0.18 \u03bcM, respectively. All the results were consistent and comparable to those found using the H2O2 Kit, demonstrating that the nanoassemblies displayed excellent versatility among various cell lines. For the HeLa cells treated with NAC, the intensity of the CD response was much higher than that of the original untreated cells, whereas after treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, an upregulator of ROS), the CD signal intensity was much weaker than that of untreated cells (Figure S29), suggesting that this probe could be applied to detect changes of intracellular H2O2 levels.
