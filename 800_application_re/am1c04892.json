To address this, we here create an effective uranium ion trap by using a novel and facile strategy that introduces bioinspired moiety phytic acid (PA) into highly robust PCN-222. The resultant metal-organic framework (MOF)-based uranium ion trap (PCN-222-PA) with a high density of accessible phosphate groups exhibits a remarkable U(VI) uptake capacity (401.6 mg\u22c5g-1), surpassing most of the reported phosphorus-modified MOFs and various other MOF adsorbents. Kinetics study reveals that PCN-222-PA can reduce the uranium concentration from 10 mg L-1 to 21 \u03bcg L-1, below the acceptable limit defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency. In addition, PCN-222-PA also shows good selectivity and high stability as well as excellent recyclability toward uranium capture. Our work demonstrates a new strategy to design functional MOFs with abundant phosphate groups and provides a new perspective for extracting uranium from aqueous solution.\n\nHerein, as a proof of concept, we demonstrate that such an effective uranium ion trap can be constructed by grafting bioinspired PA to a highly stable MOF (PCN-222) through a postsynthetic method (PSM), which is always regarded as a common method in MOF modification. To the best of our knowledge, our work presents the first study to use PA-functionalized MOF for uranium capture. As a result, the resultant MOF-based uranium ion trap (PCN-222-PA) bearing high-density accessible phosphate groups exhibits a remarkable U(VI) uptake capacity (401.6 mg\u22c5g-1), surpassing most of the phosphorus-modified MOFs and various other MOF-based adsorbents. Kinetics study reveals that PCN-222-PA can reduce the U(VI) concentration from 10 mg L-1 to 21 \u03bcg L-1, below the acceptable limit defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). Furthermore, PCN-222-PA also possesses good selectivity and high stability as well as excellent recyclability toward U(VI) capture, suggesting its great potential in practical application.\n\n a shows the PXRD patterns of PCN-222-PA and original PCN-222. It is visible that the related peaks of these two MOFs are closely matched, indicating that the crystal structure of PCN-222 remains intact after PA module insertion. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of PCN-222 and PCN-222-PA measured at 77 K display a typical type IV isotherm and exhibit a steep increase at the point of P/P 0 = 0.3 (b), suggesting the reservation of a mesoporous feature after introducing PA molecules into PCN-222, despite a decrease of their Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas from 2330 m2\u22c5g-1 for PCN-222 to 2197 m2\u22c5g-1 for PCN-222-PA. The mesopore size has decreased from 32 to 26 \u00c5 for PCN-222-PA (Figure S1), suggesting the successful introduction of PA into the MOF structure. The SEM images show that PCN-222-PA particles possess a rod-shaped morphology, with no obvious morphology change being observed after PA insertion (c,d). The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of PCN-222-PA demonstrates the emergence of phosphorus elements after modification, suggesting the successful grafting of PA molecules in PCN-222. Besides, phosphorus disperses uniformly in PCN-222-PA, indicating well-dispersion of PA molecules within the crystal structure of our uranium ion trap.\n\nThe successful grafting of PA molecules onto PCN-222 was also examined by FTIR, XPS, and ICP analyses. As shown in e, the FTIR spectra of PCN-222-PA reveal two new peaks at 574 and 1106 cm-1 compared with those of the original one, which can be attributed to the in-side-plane vibration of the phosphate group and the vibration of P\ue5fbO, respectively. Wide-scan XPS spectra of PCN-222-PA show the emergence of phosphorus signals around 133.9 eV, which can be ascribed to P 2p of PA molecules (f). In addition, the Zr 3d XPS spectra reveal a visible shift after PA modification (g), indicating that such molecules have been successfully anchored to the Zr6 clusters of PCN-222, instead of being adsorbed in MOF channels. To confirm the certain amount of the PA in PCN-222-PA, the PCN-222-PA sample was digested by KOH/D2O and characterized by the 1H NMR spectrum. As shown in Figure S2, \"*\" represents the peaks of TCPP, and the peaks around 3.5-4.5 ppm are attributed to the hydrogen in PA. A strong peak at 8.3 ppm for the hydrogen signal of HCOOH is present (Figure S2b) in PCN-222, and the peak area ratio (TCPP/HCOOH) is calculated as about 1:2, indicating that four formic acid molecules were capped in the Zr6 cluster of PCN-222. Such distinctive HCOOH peak almost disappears after PA modification (Figure S2a), indicating that PA molecules have been anchored to the Zr6 cluster of PCN-222 through a substitution way. Based on the 1H NMR spectrum of PCN-222-PA, the peak area ratio (TCPP/PA) is calculated as about 1:1, indicating that each Zr6 cluster in PCN-222 binds with about two PA molecules. To further confirm this, the contents of Zr and P were also measured by ICP after MOF digestion. The results show that the Zr/P molar ratio is calculated to be 1:1.96, which is consistent with the result of the 1H NMR spectrum. To investigate the thermal stability of PCN-222-PA, TGA was used. As shown in Figure S3, PCN-222-PA started to decompose from 100 \u00b0C due to the low boiling point of PA. About 32% of weight loss was observed as the temperature increases to 450 \u00b0C, which can be attributed to the degradation of both PA (mostly) and TCPP. Moreover, 31P NMR of PCN-222-PA was also characterized. As shown in Figure S4, the appearance of the phosphorus signal of PA indicates the successful modification of PCN-222. All these results demonstrate that each Zr6 cluster in PCN-222 binds with about two PA molecules. It should be noted that the BET surface area and N2 uptake capacity of PCN-222 have not decreased sharply after PA modification, which might be explained by the fact that two PA molecules bind with the Zr6 cluster by replacing four capped formic acid molecules instead of directly loading in the mesopore of PCN-222. \n\nU(VI) Adsorption Studies\n\nGiven that the pH of the solution has a significant influence on metal ion capture, a series of adsorption experiments were conducted to investigate the optimal pH test condition. As shown in Figure S7, the solution pH was optimized at 4.5 to achieve higher U(VI) uptake capacity. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our uranium trap, we then investigated the adsorption kinetics of PCN-222-PA toward U(VI) extraction. As shown in , PCN-222-PA can adsorb U(VI) efficiently. Over 90% of U(VI) was recovered within 30 min, and the removal efficiency could reach 99.79% after equilibrium. As a result, the residual U(VI) concentration was reduced from initial 10 mg L-1 to 21 \u03bcg L-1, below the acceptable limit of 30 \u03bcg L-1 defined by the US EPA. To get more information of adsorption kinetics, the pseudo-first-order kinetic model (see Supporting Information, S1) and pseudo-second-order kinetic model (see Supporting Information, S2) were applied to simulate the U(VI) adsorption process over PCN-222-PA. The linearized plots and the related parameters of these two models are shown in Figure S8 and Table S1. The results show that the pseudo-second-order model is the better one to describe the adsorption kinetics with a higher correlation coefficient (R 2 = 0.999), suggesting that chemisorption may play a key role during the U(VI) capture process.\n\nTo assess the U(VI) adsorption ability of PCN-222-PA, we subsequently measured adsorption isotherms. As illustrated in , PCN-222-PA shows high U(VI) uptake, far exceeding the pristine PCN-222, which demonstrates that the grafting of PA molecules onto the pore walls of MOF can improve U(VI) capture performance significantly. To evaluate the U(VI) uptake capacity of PCN-222-PA exactly, the Langmuir model (see Supporting Information, S3) was adopted in this case and a high correlation coefficient (R 2 = 0.99) was obtained, indicating that the adsorption process is dominated by the monolayer adsorption (Figure S9). The maximum U(VI) adsorption capacity of PCN-222-PA is calculated to be 401.6 mg g-1. In contrast, original PCN-222 exhibits a small adsorption capacity (87 mg g-1) for U(VI) removal; the big difference in uptake capacity can be explained by the strong interaction between UO2 and P\ue5fbO of PA in PCN-222. To highlight the excellent performance of PCN-222-PA, we first compare the adsorption performance of PCN-222-PA toward U(VI) with reported phosphorus-modified MOFs. As shown in Table S2, the U(VI) uptake capacity of PCN-222-PA surpasses most of the reported phosphorus-modified MOFs except for GO/Fe3O4/OPO3H2/PCN-222, which shows a slightly higher uptake capacity (416.7 mg g-1). However, considering the great potential of PCN-222-PA for trace metal removal (Figures S10 and S11), our PCN-222-PA still has promising application prospects. Besides, we also compare the U(VI) capture performance of PCN-222-PA with that of other MOFs (Table S3). As a result, the excellent adsorption capacity of PCN-222-PA surpasses various MOF-based adsorbents toward U(VI).\n\nBesides, to further confirm the optimal synthetic conditions of PCN-222-PA, the effects of PA concentration on U(VI) adsorption capacity were also investigated. As shown in Figure S14, when the PA concentration increases from 2.5 to 5 mM, the U(VI) maximum adsorption capacity has not increased obviously. When the PA concentration increases to 50 mM, the U(VI) adsorption capacity decreases sharply, which can be ascribed to the fact that the MOF structures start to be destroyed at this concentration.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "PCN-222-PA", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "U\u00ad(VI)", "adsorbed amount": "401.6", "unit": "mg\u00b7g^\u20131", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["gas_adsorption"]}, {"idx": "23, 27, 30", "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<p>As selectivity is an important performance metric for adsorbents,\nwe investigated the effect of different metal ions coexisting in water\non the removal efficiency of PCN-222-PA toward U\u00ad(VI).
