Most MOFs are constrained by the trade-off between adsorption capacity and separation selectivity. Due to the special U-shaped channel structure, Compound-1 can achieve high adsorption of C2H2 (141.8 cm3 g-1, 298 K), which is similar to UTSA-74a (145 cm3 g-1), but higher than FJU-22a (114.8 cm3 g-1), UTSA-300a (68.9 cm3 g-1), and NKMOF-1-Ni (61 cm3 g-1, Figure S6). In addition, Compound-1 has a moderate dynamic capture productivity of C2H2 (1.56 mol kg-1), which was higher than those of NbU-3-MnFe (0.74 mol kg-1), UTSA-300a (1.14 mol kg-1), and JXNU-5 (1.25 mol kg-1, f, Table S2).", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "Compound-1", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "topology": [{"value": "3,9-c xmz", "condition": ""}], "porosity": [{"proboe": "", "value": "57.1", "unit": "%", "condition": ""}], "pore volume": [{"probe": "", "value": "0.76", "unit": "cm3/g", "condition": "Platon calculations"}], "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "1519.15", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["topology", "porosity", "pore_volume", "surface_area"]}, {"idx": 7, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Schematic\ndiagram of the framework and cage (yellow ball) of\nCompound-1 after topology simplification.
