Compared with traditional porous materials such as activated carbon,\nmolecular sieve, etc., the frame structure, pore shape and size, and\nfunctionalities of the MOFs could be regulated at the molecular level. These excellent properties have stimulated considerable research\nwork on exploring their functions in gas selective adsorption and\nseparation. In the recent 2 decades, MOFs have exhibited potential\napplications in CO<sub>2</sub> capture, light hydrocarbon separation, and so on. Because of the special relationship between the structure\nand functionalization of MOF materials, MOFs can be designed and tuned\nby the suitable adjustment and selection of bridging linkers and metal\nunits to meet the functional requirements. However, it is still a\nchallenge to develop the MOF materials, which not only are able to\ncapture CO<sub>2</sub> from the fuel gases and but also can adsorb\na trace amount of acetylene in ethylene. Because in practical application,\nthe adsorption materials are required to have excellent adsorption\nperformance and selectivity and at the same time can tolerate water\nand acid gas, which are always mixed in fuel and natural gases. Chemists found that high-valence conjugated carboxylic acid ligands\ncan be used to synthesize water-stable MOFs. In addition, metal clusters, such as M<sub>2</sub>(COO)<sub>2</sub> (M = Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup>, and Ni<sup>2+</sup>), as secondary building units (SBUs) can always be formed\nwhen organic ligands containing carboxyl groups are used. MOFs containing metal clusters as SBUs are always\naccompanied by permanent porosity and excellent sorption performance. What is more, on the basis of the theory of hard\u2013soft acid\u2013base,\nthe MOFs formed by a combination of the soft base containing an azolate\nring (such as pyrazolates, imidazolates, triazolates, and tetrazolates)\nand the bivalent transition soft acid metal ions (such as Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, and Ni<sup>2+</sup>) are more\nstable.

As presented in a, <bold>Cu-1</bold> has a very excellent\nCO<sub>2</sub> uptake capacity of 128.77 cm<sup>3</sup>\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup> at 298 K and 1 bar, which is higher than the reported\nrecorded value of bio-MOF-11 (92 cm<sup>3</sup>\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup>). In addition, the CO<sub>2</sub> loading\nat 273 K and 1 bar of <bold>Cu-1</bold> is 180.05 cm<sup>3</sup>\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup>; it also set a very excellernt value for CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption compared with the reported highest uptake of NOTT-101\n(164 cm<sup>3</sup>\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup>). The excellent adsorption properties of <bold>Cu-1</bold> for CO<sub>2</sub> can be ascribed to its higher surface area, multiple pores,\nthe matching effect of micropoles, the size of the CO<sub>2</sub> molecule,\nand the introduction of 1<italic toggle=\"yes\">H</italic>-triazole rings in H<sub>2</sub>TIA, which can strengthen the affinity between the framework\nand CO<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, <bold>Cu-1</bold> exhibits a low\nadsorption capacity for CH<sub>4</sub> (41.37 cm<sup>3</sup>\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup> at 273 K and 26.07 cm<sup>3</sup>\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup> at 298 K) and N<sub>2</sub> (11.46 cm<sup>3</sup>\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup> at 273 K and 9.81 cm<sup>3</sup>\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup> at 298\nK) under the condition of 1 bar.

The framework of Cu-1 has excellent acid-alkali resistance and thermal stability, which is stable in a pH = 2-13 aqueous solution and an 260 \u00b0C air environment. In addition, the microporous copper MOF shows very high uptakes of CO2 (180 cm3\u22c5g-1) and C2H2 (113 cm3\u22c5g-1) at 273 K and displays excellent adsorption selectivity for small molecular gases. The ideal adsorbed solution theory selectivity values for C2H2/C2H4, CO2/CH4, and CO2/N2 are 2, 9, and 22 at 298 K, respectively. At the same time, breakthrough experiments for CO2/CH4, CO2/N2, and C2H2/C2H4 were further conducted to verify the efficient separation performances.\n\nMOFs, also known as porous coordination polymers, have been paid much attention because of their outstanding capabilities in the areas of gas deposition and segregation, luminescence, interfacial catalysis, and biomedicine. Compared with traditional porous materials such as activated carbon, molecular sieve, etc., the frame structure, pore shape and size, and functionalities of the MOFs could be regulated at the molecular level. These excellent properties have stimulated considerable research work on exploring their functions in gas selective adsorption and separation. In the recent 2 decades, MOFs have exhibited potential applications in CO2 capture, light hydrocarbon separation, and so on. Because of the special relationship between the structure and functionalization of MOF materials, MOFs can be designed and tuned by the suitable adjustment and selection of bridging linkers and metal units to meet the functional requirements. However, it is still a challenge to develop the MOF materials, which not only are able to capture CO2 from the fuel gases and but also can adsorb a trace amount of acetylene in ethylene. Because in practical application, the adsorption materials are required to have excellent adsorption performance and selectivity and at the same time can tolerate water and acid gas, which are always mixed in fuel and natural gases. Chemists found that high-valence conjugated carboxylic acid ligands can be used to synthesize water-stable MOFs. In addition, metal clusters, such as M2(COO)2 (M = Cu2+, Zn2+, Co2+, and Ni2+), as secondary building units (SBUs) can always be formed when organic ligands containing carboxyl groups are used. MOFs containing metal clusters as SBUs are always accompanied by permanent porosity and excellent sorption performance. What is more, on the basis of the theory of hard-soft acid-base, the MOFs formed by a combination of the soft base containing an azolate ring (such as pyrazolates, imidazolates, triazolates, and tetrazolates) and the bivalent transition soft acid metal ions (such as Cu2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, and Ni2+) are more stable. Bearing this in mind, a multifunctional ligand, 3-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)isophthalic acid (H2TIA), was selected in our study. As expected, a porous MOF, namely, {[Cu(TIA)]\u22c51.5CH3OH} n  (Cu-1), which contains the SBU of Cu2(COO)2, was successfully obtained. Cu-1 not only has exceptional thermal and chemical stability but also has two different sizes of micropores. Further study found that Cu-1 showed extraordinary adsorption capacities for CO2 (180 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 273 K) and C2H2 (113 cm3\u22c5g-1) as well as good CO2/CH4, CO2/N2, and C2H2/C2H4 gas selectivity.\n\nStabilities of Cu-1 \n\nPowder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments were conducted to confirm the stability of the MOF Cu-1. As can be seen from a, the framework of Cu-1 has outstanding acid-base stability, which can remain invariant in a wide range of pH = 2-13. In addition, the temperature-dependent PXRD pattern (b) and TGA curve (Figure S2) confirm that the framework also has excellent thermal stability, which can withstand high temperature up to 260 \u00b0C, and the structure of Cu-1 starts to collapse when the temperature is above 300 \u00b0C. Therefore, Cu-1 has excellent thermal and chemical stability, which is the basis for the following adsorption and separation experiments.\n\nGas Sorption Properties\n\nN2 sorption-desorption isotherms of the activated Cu-1 were obtained to verify the permanent porosity. The results are exhibited in , a typical reversible type I isotherm behavior with a breakthrough uptake at P/P 0 < 0.01, explaining the characteristics of the micropores. At 77 K, the maximum uptake of N2 reached 270 cm3\u22c5g-1, and the corresponding Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Langmuir surface areas were calculated as 766 and 1117 m2\u22c5g-1, respectively. In addition, it can be seen in b that there exist two kinds of pore systems. The large BET surface areas and various pore sizes inspire us to study the Cu-1 adsorption performance for small-molecule gases, such as CO2, N2, CH4, and C2 hydrocarbons (C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6).\n\nThe single-component sorption isotherms of CO2, CH4, and N2 for Cu-1 at 273 and 298 K up to 1 bar () were collected to explore the abilities for adsorption and separation for these gases. As presented in a, Cu-1 has a very excellent CO2 uptake capacity of 128.77 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 298 K and 1 bar, which is higher than the reported recorded value of bio-MOF-11 (92 cm3\u22c5g-1). In addition, the CO2 loading at 273 K and 1 bar of Cu-1 is 180.05 cm3\u22c5g-1; it also set a very excellernt value for CO2 adsorption compared with the reported highest uptake of NOTT-101 (164 cm3\u22c5g-1). The excellent adsorption properties of Cu-1 for CO2 can be ascribed to its higher surface area, multiple pores, the matching effect of micropoles, the size of the CO2 molecule, and the introduction of 1H-triazole rings in H2TIA, which can strengthen the affinity between the framework and CO2. Furthermore, Cu-1 exhibits a low adsorption capacity for CH4 (41.37 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 273 K and 26.07 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 298 K) and N2 (11.46 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 273 K and 9.81 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 298 K) under the condition of 1 bar. For the sake of detecting the interaction between gases and the framework of the MOF Cu-1, the isoteric heat of adsorption (Q st) of CO2, N2, and CH4 was obtained based on the adsorption isotherms at 273 and 298 K with the help of a virial equation. As exhibited in , the Q st value of CO2 near zero loading is 27.6 kJ\u22c5mol-1; it slowly rises to 32 kJ\u22c5mol-1 following and increase of the adsorption capacity. For CH4 and N2, the zero-loading Q st values are 16.4 and 16.3 kJ\u22c5mol-1, respectively ().\n\nIt is well-known that the selective adsorption and separation of light hydrocarbons play a vital role in the development of petrochemical enterprises. Considering the microporous characteristics of the MOF Cu-1, single components of C2 hydrocarbons (C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6) were also carried out at 273 and 298 K with pressures from 0 to 1 bar. As shown in b, Cu-1 also displays high adsorption capacities for C2 hydrocarbons, and the corresponding uptakes are 112.88 cm3\u22c5g-1 and 5.04 mmol\u22c5g-1 for C2H2, 84.95 cm3\u22c5g-1 and 3.79 mmol\u22c5g-1 for C2H4, and 79.11 cm3\u22c5g-1 and 3.53 mmol\u22c5g-1 for C2H6 at 273 K. The adsorption capacity of Cu-1 at 298 K is basically similar to that of 273 K, which are 95.68 cm3\u22c5g-1 and 4.27 mmol\u22c5g-1 for C2H2, 68.06 cm3\u22c5g-1 and 3.04 mmol\u22c5g-1 for C2H4, and 57.99 cm3\u22c5g-1 and 2.59 mmol\u22c5g-1 for C2H6 at 298 K, respectively. The uptake for C2H2 at 298 K is higher than those of the famous MOFs UTSA-300 (76.4 cm3\u22c5g-1, 3.41 mmol\u22c5g-1), SIFSIX-3-Zn10 (86.5 cm3\u22c5g-1, 3.86 mmol\u22c5g-1), and NTU-65 (75.4 cm3\u22c5g-1, 3.36 mmol\u22c5g-1). Similarly, the interactions between the gases and MOF materials are also measured by calculation of the isosteric heat of adsorption (Q st) at 273 and 298 K; the values of Q st at low coverage are 30 kJ\u22c5mol-1 (C2H2), 27.3 kJ\u22c5mol-1 (C2H4), and 26.3 kJ\u22c5mol-1 (C2H6) ().", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "Cu-1", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "180.05", "unit": "cm3/g", "temperature": "273 K", "pressure": "1 bar", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "128.77", "unit": "cm3/g", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "1 bar", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "CH4", "adsorbed amount": "41.37", "unit": "cm3/g", "temperature": "273 K", "pressure": "1 bar", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "CH4", "adsorbed amount": "26.07", "unit": "cm3/g", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "1 bar", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "11.46", "unit": "cm3/g", "temperature": "273 K", "pressure": "1 bar", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "9.81", "unit": "cm3/g", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "1 bar", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "C2H2", "adsorbed amount": "112.88", "unit": "cm3/g", "temperature": "273 K", "pressure": "1 bar", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "C2H2", "adsorbed amount": "5.04", "unit": "mmol/g", "temperature": "273 K", "pressure": "1 bar", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "C2H2", "adsorbed amount": "95.68", "unit": "cm3/g", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "1 bar", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "C2H2", "adsorbed amount": "4.27", "unit": "mmol/g", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "1 bar", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "C2H4", "adsorbed amount": "84.95", "unit": "cm3/g", "temperature": "273 K", "pressure": "1 bar", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "C2H4", "adsorbed amount": "3.79", "unit": "mmol/g", "temperature": "273 K", "pressure": "1 bar", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "C2H4", "adsorbed amount": "68.06", "unit": "cm3/g", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "1 bar", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "C2H4", "adsorbed amount": "3.04", "unit": "mmol/g", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "1 bar", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "C2H6", "adsorbed amount": "79.11", "unit": "cm3/g", "temperature": "273 K", "pressure": "1 bar", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "C2H6", "adsorbed amount": "3.53", "unit": "mmol/g", "temperature": "273 K", "pressure": "1 bar", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "C2H6", "adsorbed amount": "57.99", "unit": "cm3/g", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "1 bar", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "C2H6", "adsorbed amount": "2.59", "unit": "mmol/g", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "1 bar", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["gas_adsorption"]}, {"idx": "20, 22, 24", "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<p>In order to theoretically explore the excellent\nadsorption properties\nof the complexes for CO<sub>2</sub> and acetylene, the distribution\nof CO<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> molecules in <bold>Cu-1</bold> at 300 K were confirmed by ab initio molecular dynamics\n(AIMD) simulations.
