Remarkably, IFP-8 presents much lower overpotentials (319 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and 490 mV at 500 mA/cm2) than IFP-5 toward OER, as confirmed by online gas chromatography measurements (Faradaic yield of O2 > 99%).

As a consequence, the remarkable activity of IFP-8 can be ascribed to the formation of Co(O)OH phase with a particle size of a few nanometers (3-10 nm) during the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution.\n\nPutting together the pieces of information obtained, the chemical environment of the Co2+ ion in the IFP series is constituted by five donor atoms of three ligands to form a distorted trigonal-bipyramidal geometry (, down).

The functional groups at the imidazolic C2 position protrude into the channel opening, tuning the pore aperture (4.2-1.7 \u00c5), polarity, and functionality of the channel walls (). As a consequence, the specific surface area of IFP is much higher for IFP-5 (666.2 m2g-1) than for IFP-8 (45.8 m2g-1) based on the narrowing the pore aperture window of the IFP structure (Figure S3). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of IFP samples (Figure S4) revealed that IFP-5 displays hexagonal nanostructures, whereas IFP-8 forms spherical morphologies.\n\nRemarkably, IFPs exhibit better performances than the well-known ZIF-67 benchmark. IFP-8 is the most active electrocatalyst (a-d), with a low overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 (\u03b710) of 319 and 257 mV at the onset, respectively (Figure S13). Also, the Tafel slope of 64 mV/dec is particularly low (Figure S14). The \u03b710 for the other tested catalysts are 340 and 360 mV, whereas the onsets are 273 and 269 mV for IFP-5 and ZIF-67, respectively (Figure S13). The values of the Tafel slope (Figure S14) are slightly higher (ca. 70 mV/dec for both). Such values are considerably lower than previously reported cobalt-based MOF benchmarks, as those reported by and Pang and Qu. \n\nIn order to rationalize this remarkable activity, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in the potential range of 0.9-1.8 V vs RHE has been performed. The resistance associated with OER increases from IFP-8 (1.9 \u03a9 at 1.6 V vs RHE) to IFP-5 (2.6 \u03a9 at 1.6 V vs RHE), whereas the values of the pseudocapacitance for the different catalysts inversely fit this trend, since IFP-8 has the highest capacitance in the entire potential window investigated (Figure S15 and Table S1). This is an indication that IFP-8 exhibits a higher electrochemical surface area (ECSA) with respect to IFP-5 and, consequently, a higher number of active sites exposed. Indeed, the ECSA measured from the double layer capacitance is 11.2 and 2.7 cm2 for IFP-8 and IFP-5, respectively (see SI for calculation details).\n\nRemarkably, chronopotentiometry (CP) at 10 mA/cm2 (b) shows a slight decrease in the overpotential for both IPFs at the beginning of the CP, but then it remains stable during the successive 13 h, clearly indicating that an activation process occurs. Indeed, \u03b710 of IFP-8 is 319 mV after the activation phase, and the \u03b750 became as low as 390 mV (c). Furthermore, a remarkable and sustained current of 480 mA/cm2 was observed at an overpotential as low as 490 mV. Such stability is uncommon for simply deposited MOF on the electrode material so this prompts us to push the stability tests toward a very long CP run during 180 h at 10 mA/cm2 (Figure S16). For comparison, the bioinspired cobalt-citrate MOF, UTSA-16, needs 408 mV of overpotential to deliver a stable current of 10 mA/cm2 during 7 h before deactivation, whereas the Co2(OH)2BDC nanosheets recently reported by Pang et al., exhibit much lower \u03b710 (273 mV) and \u03b750 of ca. 360 mV, but such outstanding activity at pH 14 is maintained for only 3 h, before that current drops up to 60% of its initial value and \u03b750 increases up to 410 mV (as estimated by LSV showed therein). In general, the performances of IFPs are much better than the majority of Co-based MOFs and even with respect to many pure inorganic materials (d and Table S4). \n\nAccording to the measures of the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), IFP-8 also has the highest nominal TOF value (0.53 s-1 at \u03b7 = 0.4 V) over IFP-5 and ZIF-67 (e). However, it should be noted that these TOF values are an underestimation of the real performances because they are calculated under the assumption that all the catalytic centers equally participate in catalysis. However, even the nominal TOF value reported for IFP-8 largely exceeds the most common benchmarks reported so far; for example, that of Co-MOF nanosheet array directly grown on NF (0.18 s-1 at \u03b7 = 0.4 V) recently reported by Qu et al. \n\nSince the chemical stability tests revealed that IFPs at pH 13 do not suffer of partial hydrolysis, the same measurements were performed at this lower pH (f). Remarkably, the activity of IFPs is competitive even under these conditions, and indeed, \u03b710 are 360 and 410 mV for IFP-8 and IFP-5, respectively, which are comparable with similar single Co-based MOF MCF-12 nanosheets recently reported by Zhang et al.

Interestingly, at this pH, the \u03b710 drifts after 12 h of long-term chronopotentiometry experiments (15 h at 10 mA/cm2), approaching 500 and 680 mV (Figure S17).\n\nThe remarkably low overpotentials at 10 mA/cm2 prompt us to study IFP-8 as a bifunctional catalyst for both OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and therefore as a water splitting catalyst. HER tests (Figure S18) were performed in a three-electrode cell with the same configuration as for OER, but this time, the electrolyte solution was continuously degassed by N2 flow, in order to remove O2. Furthermore, the potential at the working electrode was varied between 0.9 V to -0.5 V vs RHE at a scan rate of 1 mV/s. The \u03b710 of 227 mV is quite lower if compared to other Co-based catalysts and competitive with the most recent Co-based hybrid systems. As indicated in , the overall water splitting reaction can be performed at 10 mA/cm2 by applying ca. 1.89 V. A long CP experiment highlights the extreme durability of IFP-8 under total water splitting conditions (for 120 h at 10 mA/cm2), as the activity remains rather constant for the entire duration of the experiment without suffering apparent fatigue (b). The overall water splitting is confirmed by the online measured H2/O2 ratio of ca. 1.9, with quantitative faraday efficiency during the first 3 h of reaction (Figure S19). In total, after 120 h of electrolysis, minimum TONs of 26000 and 13000 are calculated for H2 and O2, respectively, considering all the deposited material over the electrode.\n\nEncouraged by these results, PXRD, ATR, and EXAFS experiments were performed ex situ before and after the catalysis, by plating the materials onto FTO as the electrode material (IFP@FTO).\n\nThe electrochemical studies of IFPs@FTO were carried out analogously to the characterization in NF. Initial LSVs confirm the reactivity order found in NF (Figure S21a,b). At the same time, during the 5 h CP experiments performed at 5 mA/cm2, the reduction of the potential and the increased number of exposed active sites (as indicated by the integrated charge of Co redox features and by ECSA, Table S5) indicate that the catalysts undergo an activation process, although with different rate with respect to that observed in NF. Nevertheless, the main kinetic descriptors for the intrinsic activity, that is, TOF and ECSA-normalized current density, decrease. In particular, TOF values (at \u03b7 = 300 mV) were observed to almost half from 0.29 s-1 to 0.16 s-1 for IFP-8 and reduce from 0.35 s-1 to 0.25 s-1 for IFP-5. The decrease of the TOF value might be symptomatic for the loss of molecular behavior in favor of an aggregation process, which would likely be stronger in the case of IFP-8 than for IFP-5 because of the higher drop of the TOF.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "dielectric constant", "value": "4.5", "unit": "", "condition": "at 1 kHz"}, {"property name": "dielectric properties", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "value", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "suitable for applications", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "in electronics and capacitive devices"}, {"property name": "valuable", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "in energy storage and electronic components"}]}]], "include_properties": ["etc"]}, {"idx": 6, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Top: general synthetic strategy of IFP frameworks, highlighting\nthe in situ ligand hydrolysis.
