As depicted in a,b, the framework is composed of a mononuclear indium inorganic SBU and an organic SBU functionalized with imide groups. Each indium ion is chelated to four bidentate carboxylic acid groups derived from four ligands, which can be defined as a 4-connected node with tetrahedral geometry. Each ligand binds to four independent metal centers, resulting in the formation of a rectangle geometry. The alternant assembly of these SBUs results in a (4, 4)-connected pts network with the point symbol of (42 \u22c5 84) (c, d and Figure S4). As shown in e and Figure S3, there exists two types of channels with approximate diameters of 17.3 \u00d7 5.5 and 15.1 \u00d7 8.2 \u00c5 along the (100) and (010) directions (excluding the van der Waals radius), respectively.

Compound 1 with a (4, 4)-connected pts network is constructed by negative [In(OOC)4]- secondary building units (SBUs) and expanded tetracarboxylate ligands with functional imide groups. Meanwhile, the overall framework possesses large open channels of 17.3 \u00d7 5.5 \u00c5 with a high solvent-accessible volume that occupied about 69.2% of the total cell volume.

With regard to series of mixtures with oppositely charged dyes, compound 1 can selectively trap carcinogenic dyes. Therefore, compound 1 should be a promising metal-organic framework (MOF)-based material for the efficient and selective adsorption of carcinogenic dyes.\n\nInspired by the positive charge and abundant existence of amino groups of carcinogenic BR9 and BV14, we expected to develop a new MOF to facilitate the adsorption of BR9 and BV14 by creating more host-guest interactions. In an attempt to accomplish the above-mentioned desires, negative inorganic nodes and elongated and functional organic backbones are introduced simultaneously. From a metal perspective, indium, as a high cycle p-block metal, has attracted widespread concern for its tendency to form charged building units, such as negatively charged [In(OOC)4]- monomers, positively charged [In3O(OOC)6]+ trimers, and [In2(OH)] dimers. Even the coexistence of these building units can create more skeletons with different electrical properties. These charged secondary building units (SBUs) are generally formed by the coordination of carboxylic acids with indium. Besides that, open channels with appropriate window sizes are also crucial for large-sized dyes adsorption. An expanded tetracarboxylate ligand N,N'-bis(3,5-dicarboxyphenyl)pyromellitic diimide (H4BDCPPI) functionalized with imide groups has been selected to synthesize a prospective In-MOF with pts topology, named [(CH3)2NH2][In(BDCPPI)]\u22c50.5DMF\u22c5H2O (compound 1).

Additionally, compound 1 can also rapidly capture other cationic dyes with various sizes and shapes. In summary, compound 1 can be used as a prominent adsorbent for the highly selective and efficient adsorption of carcinogenic dyes.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nStructure Description\n\nSingle-crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that compound 1 crystallizes in a tetragonal crystal system with the space group of P42/mmc. As depicted in a,b, the framework is composed of a mononuclear indium inorganic SBU and an organic SBU functionalized with imide groups. Each indium ion is chelated to four bidentate carboxylic acid groups derived from four ligands, which can be defined as a 4-connected node with tetrahedral geometry. Each ligand binds to four independent metal centers, resulting in the formation of a rectangle geometry. The alternant assembly of these SBUs results in a (4, 4)-connected pts network with the point symbol of (42 \u22c5 84) (c, d and Figure S4). As shown in e and Figure S3, there exists two types of channels with approximate diameters of 17.3 \u00d7 5.5 and 15.1 \u00d7 8.2 \u00c5 along the (100) and (010) directions (excluding the van der Waals radius), respectively. Calculated by the PLATON software, the total solvent accessible volume of compound 1 is 3401.2 \u00c53 per unit cell, which makes up approximately 69.2% of the cell volume. As rendered in a, the square channels with a window size of 8.2 \u00d7 8.2 \u00c5 are sufficiently modified by imide groups along the (001) direction (Figure S3). From the perspective of the (010) direction (b), the imide groups anchor on window edges of the large channel with 17.3 \u00d7 5.5 \u00c5, which can form the hydrogen bonds with carcinogenic dyes and serve as active sites during the adsorption process. Noteworthily, the charged behavior of the skeleton and the countercation (CH3)2NH2 + located within the channels are vital for the capture of cationic dyes. The counterions resulted from the decomposition of DMF solvent are applied to balance the charge of the anionic skeleton. The large open channels, decorated imide groups, and charged characteristic of compound 1 make the highly efficient and rapid adsorption of carcinogenic dyes possible.\n\nAs shown in Figure S1a, the experimental PXRD pattern of compound 1 keeps consistent with the simulated one acquired from single crystal data, which manifests the pure phase of the as-synthesized sample. Under air atmosphere, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed to assess the thermal stability of compound 1. As represented in Figure S2, the skeleton is stable up to about 400 \u00b0C and has approximately 11.6% weight loss before 150 \u00b0C, corresponding to the loss of guest molecules.\n\nSimilar variation trends also occurred in the adsorption processes of RhB, MLB, and NR (Figure S6). The first-order derivative of adsorption amounts with time, a critical indicatrix to evaluate adsorption efficiency, discloses the initial adsorption rates of compound 1. Delightedly, the adsorption rates of BR9, BV14, RhB, MLB, and NR have been valued as high as 7.3, 6.7, 3.0, 14.6, and 13.2 mg g-1 min-1, respectively (). With the sizes of the cationic dyes increasing, the adsorption rates decline. These results show that compound 1 is able to rapidly adsorb BR9 and BV14. For further comparison, the intensity of the characteristic adsorption peaks remained almost unchanged for MO and Orange II, which shows that the anionic dyes do not get access to the framework, even if their sizes match the window size of the framework, due to the charge repulsion (Figure S7). PXRD patterns of samples after adsorption agreed well with that of the as-synthesized crystals, ruling out the possibility of the adsorption caused by the collapse of the skeleton during adsorption progress (Figure S1b).\n\nThe adsorption capability, as an important index of any adsorbent from the perspective of industrial wastewater purification, is affected by the initial concentration of dye solutions. Thus, the adsorption isotherm was measured to evaluate the maximum adsorption capacity by varying the original concentration. Langmuir and Freundlich models are applied to fit the maximum adsorption curves, and it was found that the Langmuir model is more suitable for the calculation of adsorption data (Figure S9). Impressively, the adsorbent displays the maximum adsorption capacities for BR9 and BV14, as high as up to 245 and 227 mg g-1, respectively (). As far as we know, very few MOFs are applied to capture BR9 and BV14, and the trapping capacity of the compound 1 outperforms many reported materials, such as Al-MCM-41 and Ca-bentonite (see Tables S4 and S5). The surprising adsorption amounts for these carcinogenic dyes may be ascribed to the following aspects: (a) The suitable pore size and high porosity provide opportunities for the adsorption of large-sized dye molecules. (b) On account of the host-guest interactions of Coulombic interaction and ion-exchange, anionic compound 1 can rapidly trap cationic dyes. (c) The imide groups decorated on the surface of the pore can form hydrogen bonds with the amino groups of carcinogenic dyes to strengthen the host-guest interaction and facilitate the adsorption of the carcinogenic dyes. FT-IR studies were employed to test carcinogenic dyes, compound 1, and dye-adsorbed samples. The analogous structure and functional groups of BR9 and BV14 caused their FT-IR spectra to be similar. Therefore, BR9 was selected as a representative to discuss the mechanism in detail. As shown in Figure S8a, the amino peaks at 3173 and 3312 cm-1 were discovered for BR9, which blue-shifted toward higher wavenumbers of 3218 and 3348 cm-1 for compound 1 after adsorption. Meanwhile, the red shift is observed from 1668 to 1655 cm-1 for C\ue5fbO stretching vibration of compound 1 before and after adsorption. These shifts clearly explained the formation of hydrogen bonds between amino functional groups of BR9 and BV14 and the imide groups of compound 1.
