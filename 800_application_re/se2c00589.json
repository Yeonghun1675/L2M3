However,\ngas sensors based on pure SnO<sub>2</sub> usually show a low response\nor high working temperature. In this work, laminar SnO<sub>2</sub> was obtained by using a Sn-based metal organic framework\u00ad(Sn-MOF)@SnO<sub>2</sub> as a precursor. Sn-MOF@SnO<sub>2</sub> is prepared at low\ntemperatures using water and dimethylformamide as a solvent, which\nis simple, low cost, and easily reproducible. After sintering, Sn-MOF@SnO<sub>2</sub> is derived to SnO<sub>2</sub> with rich adsorbed oxygen,\nlarge specific surface area, and unique nanoparticle piled pores,\nthus showing excellent gas-sensing properties. The prepared SnO<sub>2</sub> has an ultrahigh response value of 10,000 to 10 ppm formaldehyde\nat an optimal working temperature of 120 \u00b0C, a fast response/recovery\ntime of 33 s/142 s, and an actual detection limit of lower than 10\nppb as well as high selectivity and high stability. Density functional\ntheory calculations show that the exposed (110) plane of oxygen-rich\nvacancies in laminar SnO<sub>2</sub> can effectively increase the\ncoadsorption capacity of O<sub>2</sub> and formaldehyde molecules,\nthereby improving the formaldehyde gas-sensing performance of the\nmaterial. The present original approach paves the way to design advanced\nmaterials with excellent gas-sensing properties as well as broad application\nprospects in formaldehyde monitoring.</p><p>Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have a wide range\nof application\nprospects in the field of gas sensors due to their unique structural\nadvantages. MOF materials are widely used in the field of gas sensors,\nbut many types of research have focused on developing hybrid nanostructures\ncomposed of MOFs and noble metal or transition metal oxides, and less research has been done on MOF-derived\npure oxide gas-sensing materials. For Sn-based MOFs, most reported\nstudies concentrated on electrode materials and lithium storage materials, but there have been only a few reports on gas-sensing\nmaterials. For example, Wang et al. synthesized\na Sn-MOF with a hexagonal prism shape by a hydrothermal method at\na temperature of 180 \u00b0C and obtained SnO<sub>2</sub> by calcining\nthe Sn-MOF, the response value of which is 882 to 2 ppm formaldehyde\nat an optimal working temperature of 120 \u00b0C, and the response\ntime is 19 s, which shows a long recovery time due to the resistance\nbaseline being difficult to recover. Bai et al. synthesized a Sn/Ni-MOF by hydrothermal methods at a temperature\nof 180 \u00b0C and obtained SnO<sub>2</sub>@NiO triethylamine gas-sensing\nmaterials by calcining the Sn/Ni-MOF. The response value of SnO<sub>2</sub>@NiO to 10 ppm triethylamine is 14.03 at an optimal working\ntemperature of 70 \u00b0C, and the response/recovery time is 86 s/95\ns. Yang et al. synthesized a Sn-MOF through\nlow-temperature stirring and likewise obtained SnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles\nby calcining the Sn-MOF. By combining SnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles\nand MoSe<sub>2</sub>, a composite material with CO gas sensitivity\nat room temperature was obtained, the response value for 100 ppm CO\nis 9.2, and the response/recovery time is 20 s/16 s. In all, most\nof the currently reported SnO<sub>2</sub> gas-sensing materials based\non Sn-MOFs are synthesized based on the hydrothermal method, these\ntypes of SnO<sub>2</sub> have a smaller specific surface area and\nless oxygen adsorption, and as far as we know, there is no report\nof low-temperature preparation of Sn-MOF-based pure SnO<sub>2</sub> ultrasensitive gas-sensitive materials.</p><p>In this work, we explored\nthe use of the water bath method to prepare\nSn-MOF@SnO<sub>2</sub> and used Sn-MOF@SnO<sub>2</sub> as a precursor\nto prepare laminar SnO<sub>2</sub>, due to the unique Sn-MOF@SnO<sub>2</sub> mixed phase structure; when the Sn-MOF phase disappears by\npyrolysis, the laminar SnO<sub>2</sub> possesses rich adsorbed oxygen,\nlarge specific surface area, and unique nanoparticle piled pores,\nso the laminar SnO<sub>2</sub> shows very excellent formaldehyde gas\nsensitivity. The laminar SnO<sub>2</sub> gas sensor has a response\nvalue of 10,000 to 10 ppm formaldehyde at an optimal working temperature\nof 120 \u00b0C, a response/recovery time of 33 s/142 s, and an actual\ndetection limit of lower than 10 ppb and shows great selectivity and\nlong-term stability; this SnO<sub>2</sub> has the advantages of high\nsensitivity and low detection limit of traditional two-dimensional\nnanomaterials, low operating temperature,\nand high sensitivity to formaldehyde at low temperatures (&lt;100\n\u00b0C), as well as simple preparation and low cost. We further carried\nout relevant characterization and further analyzed the mechanism of\nthe enhancement of the gas sensitivity of the SnO<sub>2</sub> nanomaterial.\nAt the same time, the coadsorption energies of laminar SnO<sub>2</sub> and four representative sensitive gases (formaldehyde, NO<sub>2</sub>, ethanol, and toluene) on the exposed (110) crystal plane and O<sub>2</sub> were explored by density functional theory (DFT) calculation.</p><p>To explore the pyrolysis temperature,\nwe performed thermogravimetric\nanalysis on Sn-MOF@SnO<sub>2</sub> (as shown in d). The pyrolysis of Sn-MOF@SnO<sub>2</sub> can be divided into three stages. The first stage loses 3.81% of\nweight, which can be attributed to the disappearance of lattice water\nmolecules, and the second stage loses 10.69%, which can be attributed\nto the disappearance of solvent molecules and coordinated water molecules.\nAlso, 16.24% weight loss in the third stage can be attributed to the\npyrolysis of the organic framework. The weight of the sample is barely\nlost after 450 \u00b0C; thus, 450 \u00b0C is determined as the pyrolysis\ntemperature.</p><p>The morphologies of Sn-MOF@SnO<sub>2</sub> and\nSnO<sub>2</sub> were\nanalyzed by SEM and TEM, and the results are shown in . a,f shows the SEM images of Sn-MOF@SnO<sub>2</sub> and SnO<sub>2</sub> at the microscale, respectively, in which\nthe samples show a bulk morphology. b,g shows the TEM images of Sn-MOF@SnO<sub>2</sub> and SnO<sub>2</sub>, respectively. An irregular laminar structure\nof the two samples can be seen. Compared to Sn-MOF@SnO<sub>2</sub>, laminar SnO<sub>2</sub> exhibits a porous structure composed of\nsmall particles. To further understand the difference between Sn-MOF@SnO<sub>2</sub> and laminar SnO<sub>2</sub>, we analyzed their HRTEM images.\nFrom c, it\ncan be seen that Sn-MOF@SnO<sub>2</sub> is composed of two-phase substances.\nOn the one hand, we can see the fuzzy lattice fringes produced by\nmany SnO<sub>2</sub> crystallites; on the other hand, blurred shadows\nappear between this crystallite, which represents the Sn-MOF, and\nthe Sn-MOF is distributed among SnO<sub>2</sub> crystallites like\na binder. By calcining Sn-MOF@SnO<sub>2</sub>, a large number of pores\nare finally generated due to the disappearance of water molecules,\nsolvent molecules, the Sn-MOF phase, and the growth of the SnO<sub>2</sub> crystallite; finally, a large number of pores are generated,\nand these pores play an important role in the improvement of gas-sensing\nperformance. d shows the SAED image of Sn-MOF@SnO<sub>2</sub>; the weak polycrystalline\ndiffraction rings of SnO<sub>2</sub> can be observed, which indicates\nthe weak crystallinity of Sn-MOF@SnO<sub>2</sub>. e shows the EDX image of Sn-MOF@SnO<sub>2</sub>, which confirmed the existence of Sn, C, and O elements in\nthe Sn-MOF@SnO<sub>2</sub> sample.

By calcining Sn-MOF@SnO<sub>2</sub>, due\nto the disappearance of MOF substances, water molecules, and solvent\nmolecules, the space occupied by these substances is emptied, leaving\na large number of holes, even if the growth of the SnO<sub>2</sub> crystallite will occupy part of the space; however, it still leads\nto a rapid increase in the specific surface area in the end.</p><p>Combined with the analysis of \u2013, a conclusion\ncan be drawn that the sample is composed of a mixed phase of the SnO<sub>2</sub> crystallite and MOF substance, and the calcination\nmechanism diagram is shown in c.</p><p>To further understand the composition of Sn-MOF@SnO<sub>2</sub> and laminar SnO<sub>2</sub>, we performed XPS analysis on\nSn-MOF@SnO<sub>2</sub> and laminar SnO<sub>2</sub>. a shows the XPS full-spectrum\nscan images\nof Sn-MOF@SnO<sub>2</sub> and laminar SnO<sub>2</sub>, both of which\nshow the signals of Sn, O, and C, without obvious impurity peaks,\nindicating the high purity of the samples.

However, gas sensors based on pure SnO2 usually show a low response or high working temperature. In this work, laminar SnO2 was obtained by using a Sn-based metal organic framework(Sn-MOF)@SnO2 as a precursor. Sn-MOF@SnO2 is prepared at low temperatures using water and dimethylformamide as a solvent, which is simple, low cost, and easily reproducible. After sintering, Sn-MOF@SnO2 is derived to SnO2 with rich adsorbed oxygen, large specific surface area, and unique nanoparticle piled pores, thus showing excellent gas-sensing properties. The prepared SnO2 has an ultrahigh response value of 10,000 to 10 ppm formaldehyde at an optimal working temperature of 120 \u00b0C, a fast response/recovery time of 33 s/142 s, and an actual detection limit of lower than 10 ppb as well as high selectivity and high stability. Density functional theory calculations show that the exposed (110) plane of oxygen-rich vacancies in laminar SnO2 can effectively increase the coadsorption capacity of O2 and formaldehyde molecules, thereby improving the formaldehyde gas-sensing performance of the material. The present original approach paves the way to design advanced materials with excellent gas-sensing properties as well as broad application prospects in formaldehyde monitoring.\n\nMetal organic frameworks (MOFs) have a wide range of application prospects in the field of gas sensors due to their unique structural advantages. MOF materials are widely used in the field of gas sensors, but many types of research have focused on developing hybrid nanostructures composed of MOFs and noble metal or transition metal oxides, and less research has been done on MOF-derived pure oxide gas-sensing materials. For Sn-based MOFs, most reported studies concentrated on electrode materials and lithium storage materials, but there have been only a few reports on gas-sensing materials. For example, Wang et al. synthesized a Sn-MOF with a hexagonal prism shape by a hydrothermal method at a temperature of 180 \u00b0C and obtained SnO2 by calcining the Sn-MOF, the response value of which is 882 to 2 ppm formaldehyde at an optimal working temperature of 120 \u00b0C, and the response time is 19 s, which shows a long recovery time due to the resistance baseline being difficult to recover. Bai et al. synthesized a Sn/Ni-MOF by hydrothermal methods at a temperature of 180 \u00b0C and obtained SnO2@NiO triethylamine gas-sensing materials by calcining the Sn/Ni-MOF. The response value of SnO2@NiO to 10 ppm triethylamine is 14.03 at an optimal working temperature of 70 \u00b0C, and the response/recovery time is 86 s/95 s. Yang et al. synthesized a Sn-MOF through low-temperature stirring and likewise obtained SnO2 nanoparticles by calcining the Sn-MOF. By combining SnO2 nanoparticles and MoSe2, a composite material with CO gas sensitivity at room temperature was obtained, the response value for 100 ppm CO is 9.2, and the response/recovery time is 20 s/16 s. In all, most of the currently reported SnO2 gas-sensing materials based on Sn-MOFs are synthesized based on the hydrothermal method, these types of SnO2 have a smaller specific surface area and less oxygen adsorption, and as far as we know, there is no report of low-temperature preparation of Sn-MOF-based pure SnO2 ultrasensitive gas-sensitive materials.\n\nIn this work, we explored the use of the water bath method to prepare Sn-MOF@SnO2 and used Sn-MOF@SnO2 as a precursor to prepare laminar SnO2, due to the unique Sn-MOF@SnO2 mixed phase structure; when the Sn-MOF phase disappears by pyrolysis, the laminar SnO2 possesses rich adsorbed oxygen, large specific surface area, and unique nanoparticle piled pores, so the laminar SnO2 shows very excellent formaldehyde gas sensitivity. The laminar SnO2 gas sensor has a response value of 10,000 to 10 ppm formaldehyde at an optimal working temperature of 120 \u00b0C, a response/recovery time of 33 s/142 s, and an actual detection limit of lower than 10 ppb and shows great selectivity and long-term stability; this SnO2 has the advantages of high sensitivity and low detection limit of traditional two-dimensional nanomaterials, low operating temperature, and high sensitivity to formaldehyde at low temperatures (<100 \u00b0C), as well as simple preparation and low cost. We further carried out relevant characterization and further analyzed the mechanism of the enhancement of the gas sensitivity of the SnO2 nanomaterial. At the same time, the coadsorption energies of laminar SnO2 and four representative sensitive gases (formaldehyde, NO2, ethanol, and toluene) on the exposed (110) crystal plane and O2 were explored by density functional theory (DFT) calculation.\n\nTo explore the pyrolysis temperature, we performed thermogravimetric analysis on Sn-MOF@SnO2 (as shown in d). The pyrolysis of Sn-MOF@SnO2 can be divided into three stages. The first stage loses 3.81% of weight, which can be attributed to the disappearance of lattice water molecules, and the second stage loses 10.69%, which can be attributed to the disappearance of solvent molecules and coordinated water molecules. Also, 16.24% weight loss in the third stage can be attributed to the pyrolysis of the organic framework. The weight of the sample is barely lost after 450 \u00b0C; thus, 450 \u00b0C is determined as the pyrolysis temperature.\n\nThe morphologies of Sn-MOF@SnO2 and SnO2 were analyzed by SEM and TEM, and the results are shown in . a,f shows the SEM images of Sn-MOF@SnO2 and SnO2 at the microscale, respectively, in which the samples show a bulk morphology. b,g shows the TEM images of Sn-MOF@SnO2 and SnO2, respectively. An irregular laminar structure of the two samples can be seen. Compared to Sn-MOF@SnO2, laminar SnO2 exhibits a porous structure composed of small particles. To further understand the difference between Sn-MOF@SnO2 and laminar SnO2, we analyzed their HRTEM images. From c, it can be seen that Sn-MOF@SnO2 is composed of two-phase substances. On the one hand, we can see the fuzzy lattice fringes produced by many SnO2 crystallites; on the other hand, blurred shadows appear between this crystallite, which represents the Sn-MOF, and the Sn-MOF is distributed among SnO2 crystallites like a binder. By calcining Sn-MOF@SnO2, a large number of pores are finally generated due to the disappearance of water molecules, solvent molecules, the Sn-MOF phase, and the growth of the SnO2 crystallite; finally, a large number of pores are generated, and these pores play an important role in the improvement of gas-sensing performance. d shows the SAED image of Sn-MOF@SnO2; the weak polycrystalline diffraction rings of SnO2 can be observed, which indicates the weak crystallinity of Sn-MOF@SnO2. e shows the EDX image of Sn-MOF@SnO2, which confirmed the existence of Sn, C, and O elements in the Sn-MOF@SnO2 sample. As shown in Figure S2a,b, the size of laminar SnO2 ultrafine nanoparticles is between 4 and 7 nm with an average grain size of 5.48 nm. As shown in h, the interplanar spacing is 0.35 nm, which corresponds to the (110) plane of SnO2, and it can be seen that laminar SnO2 mainly exposes the (110) crystal plane; compared with the reports in the literature, the interplanar spacing has a certain increase. \n\nThe N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm and BJH pore size distribution of Sn-MOF@SnO2 and SnO2 are analyzed. a shows the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm of Sn-MOF@SnO2. The specific surface area of Sn-MOF@SnO2 is 10.0611 m2/g, the specific surface area is equivalent to the Sn-MOF synthesized with water as a solvent reported in the literature, the average pore size is 19.8785 nm, and it has the characteristics of a mesoporous solid; however, the influence of the choice of solvent on the coordination environment in MOF synthesis is still unclear. b shows the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm of SnO2, which belongs to the IV curve in the IUPAC classification, it has an obvious hysteresis loop and belongs to the H2(a) type hysteresis loop, the specific surface area of SnO2 is 138.8247 m2/g, the average of pore size is 3.92 nm, and a large specific surface area can provide more active sites for gas attachment, thereby improving gas sensitivity. By calcining Sn-MOF@SnO2, due to the disappearance of MOF substances, water molecules, and solvent molecules, the space occupied by these substances is emptied, leaving a large number of holes, even if the growth of the SnO2 crystallite will occupy part of the space; however, it still leads to a rapid increase in the specific surface area in the end.\n\nCombined with the analysis of -, a conclusion can be drawn that the sample is composed of a mixed phase of the SnO2 crystallite and MOF substance, and the calcination mechanism diagram is shown in c.\n\nTo further understand the composition of Sn-MOF@SnO2 and laminar SnO2, we performed XPS analysis on Sn-MOF@SnO2 and laminar SnO2. a shows the XPS full-spectrum scan images of Sn-MOF@SnO2 and laminar SnO2, both of which show the signals of Sn, O, and C, without obvious impurity peaks, indicating the high purity of the samples. We further analyzed the C 1s of Sn-MOF@SnO2 and laminar SnO2, as shown in b; it can be seen that Sn-MOF@SnO2 has obvious C-C, C\ue5fbO, and C-O peaks, which are mainly derived from the organic ligand of the Sn-MOF, while the C peak signal of SnO2 is relatively weak, and there is no obvious C\ue5fbO peak, which means that the MOF phase of Sn-MOF@SnO2 is almost completely decomposed during the pyrolysis process. c shows the O 1s peaks of SnO2 and Sn-MOF@SnO2, and the peaks at 530.82, 531.22, and 532.02 eV belong to the lattice oxygen, surface oxygen vacancies, and chemisorption oxygen in SnO2, respectively. By calculating the ratio of the peak area of V o, the percentages of V o on the surface of SnO2 were obtained as 38.02%, the sensing process is the reaction between the target gas molecule adsorbed on the material surface and the reactive oxygen species, and a higher V o concentration will cause more oxygen molecules to be adsorbed on the surface of SnO2, thereby increasing the concentration of active oxygen participating in the sensing reaction and ultimately leading to an improvement in gas sensitivity. As a comparison, the O distribution of Sn-MOF@SnO2 was analyzed; for Sn-MOF@SnO2, the peaks at 531.32, 532.37, and 533.53 eV belong to the Sn-O, C\ue5fbO or C-O, and O-H, and C\ue5fbO/C-O mainly comes from carboxyl groups of organic ligands; O-H mainly comes from water molecules (). As shown in d, for Sn-MOF@SnO2, binding energies of 495.66 and 487.23 eV correspond to the characteristic peaks of Sn 3d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2, respectively, the Sn 3d spin-orbit coupling of Sn-MOF@SnO2 is 8.43 eV, which indicates that Sn exists in the state of Sn4+, for laminar SnO2, binding energies of 495.52 and 487.09 eV correspond to the characteristic peaks of Sn 3d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2, respectively, the Sn 3d spin-orbit couplings of Sn-MOF@SnO2 and SnO2 both are 8.43 eV, and the Sn 3d peaks of Sn-MOF@SnO2 and SnO2 are slightly shifted, which may be related to the change of the binding state of Sn4+ in Sn-MOF@SnO2. EPR is often used to study crystal defects in semiconductor materials. e shows the EPR spectra of Sn-MOF@SnO2 and laminar SnO2, it can be seen that Sn-MOF@SnO2 has no obvious EPR signal, and as a comparison, SnO2 shows intensive EPR signals at g = 2.003, which is identified as the presence of single-electron oxygen vacancies.

In all, the gas sensor has good reversibility and repeatability.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "etc": [{"property name": "temperature", "value": "120", "unit": "\u00b0C", "condition": "optimal working temperature"}, {"property name": "response value", "value": "33.6", "unit": "", "condition": "at room temperature"}, {"property name": "response/recovery time", "value": "33/142", "unit": "s", "condition": "at 10 ppm formaldehyde concentration"}, {"property name": "detection limit", "value": "0.01", "unit": "ppm", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "selectivity", "value": "formaldehyde", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "response value", "value": "142", "unit": "", "condition": "to 10 ppm triethylamine"}, {"property name": "response value", "value": "18.7", "unit": "", "condition": "to 10 ppm ethanol"}, {"property name": "response value", "value": "10,000", "unit": "", "condition": "to 10 ppm formaldehyde"}, {"property name": "response value", "value": "2000, 5400, 10,000, 12,500, 15,700, 17,500, 20,300, 23,700, 33,500", "unit": "", "condition": "to 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 100 ppm formaldehyde"}, {"property name": "repeatability", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "response value", "value": "9000 to 11,000", "unit": "", "condition": "to 10 ppm formaldehyde for eight consecutive cycles"}, {"property name": "response/recovery time", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": "maintains good repeatability after eight repeated measurements"}]}]], "include_properties": ["etc"]}, {"idx": 21, "type": "table", "classification": ["Property"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Comparison of O 1s of Sn-MOF@SnO<sub>2</sub> and SnO<sub>2</sub>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"5\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry morerows=\"2\">SnO<sub>2</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>oxygen type</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>O<sub>lattice</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>O<sub>vacancy</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>O<sub>chemisorbed</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>position</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>530.82 eV</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>531.22\neV</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>532.02 eV</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>ratio</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>28.9%</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>38%</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>33.1%</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry morerows=\"2\">Sn-MOF@SnO<sub>2</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>oxygen type</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>Sn\u2013O</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>C\ue5fbO or C\u2013O</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>O\u2013H</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>position</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>531.32\neV</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>532.37 eV</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>533.53 eV</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>ratio</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>67.6%</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>25.6%</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>6.8%</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "Table 1.
