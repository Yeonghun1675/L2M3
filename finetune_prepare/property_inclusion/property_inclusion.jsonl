The asymmetric unit contains 0.5 Zn2+ cations, 0.25 TZI3\\u2212 ligand, 0.25 \\u03bc\\n3-OH and 0.5 coordinated water molecular (). And the 0.25 (CH3)2NH of guest comes from the hydrolysis of DMF under high pressure and temperature . TZI3\\u2212 ligand coordinates with six mental sites by the coordination mode which can be described as \\u03bc\\n6-\\u03b71: \\u03b70: \\u03b70: \\u03b71: \\u03b71: \\u03b71: \\u03b71: \\u03b71 (\\na). Its conformation is mode-b by the dihedral is 90.0\\u00b0 between the m-benzenedicarboxylate and tetrazolyl ring (). Two kinds of zinc centers (Zn1 and Zn2) are found in the framework. The Zn1 atom is five-coordinated by three oxygen atoms which consist of two carboxylate oxygen atoms from two TZI3\\u2212 and one bridging oxygen atom from a \\u03bc\\n3-OH ligand in the equatorial plane, and two nitrogen atoms from two TZI3\\u2212 ligands distribution in the axial position, which forms triangle biconical ZnN2O3 coordination geometry. While the Zn2 atom is six coordinate by four oxygen atoms from two \\u03bc\\n3-OH ligands, two coordinated water molecules and two nitrogen atoms from two different TZI3\\u2212 ligands, forming an octahedral geometry. The Zn\\u2013O bond distances are from 1.962(4) to 2.128(6)\\u00c5, and the Zn\\u2013N bond distances are 2.110(5) and 2.362(5)\\u00c5 (). For the interactions between metal sites and ligands described above, triangle [Zn3(\\u03bc\\n3-OH)] SBU are formed by \\u03bc\\n3-OH connecting three metal centers (b), these isosceles triangles connected by TZI3\\u2212 spacers to form 1D strip-shaped chains further. Adjacent chains linked by m-benzenedicarboxylate groups to form 3D frameworks with 1D rectangular channels (6.5\\u00d73.0\\u00c52) with taking van der Waals radii into consideration run along the c axis (c). A better insight into the nature of JUC-165 can be achieved by the application of a topological approach, that is, reducing multidimensional structures to simple node-and-linker nets (the Topos4.0 program is a powerful tool for the analysis, comparison, and design of network structures) . As shown in , the trimetallic [Zn3(\\u03bc\\n3-OH)] SBU can simply be regarded as a 5-connected node since the terminal H2O molecules do not contribute to the network topology. Likewise, each TZI3\\u2212 ligand coordinated to five [Zn3(\\u03bc\\n3-OH)] clusters can act as a 5-connected node. On the basis of the simplification principle, the resulting structure of JUC-165 is a rare binodal five-connected net, and its Schl\\u00e4fli symbol is 4664 (d)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['crystal_system', 'space_group', 'topology']"}]}

In this structure, there are five kinds of Cd2+ sites. Among them, Cd1, Cd2, Cd3, Cd5 are all six-coordinated octahedral geometry. For Cd1, it is coordinated by three oxygen atoms from two terminal coordinated waters and one bridging oxygen \\u03bc\\n3-OH ligand, and three nitrogen atoms from three TZI3\\u2212 ligands.

The as-synthesized samples were exchanged with MeOH about three days, and activated at room temperature to obtain the activated samples.

Compound 1 crystallizes in the F-43c space group. In 1, tpt ligands and metal ions assembled into eight interpenetrating (10,3)-a networks which has been observed in Zn(tpt)2/3(SiF6)(H2O)2(MeOH) as reported by B.F. Abrahams et al. . However, the coordinated SiF6\\n2- anion in the reported architecture was replaced with one dehydrogenized carboxyl from H4bpta, and the coordination sphere of the six coordinated Ni(II) center was accomplished with two water molecules and one hydroxyl group. The Ni\\u2013O bond lengths vary from 2.049(3) to 2.088(3)\\u00c5, and the Ni\\u2013N bond lengths range from 2.093(2) to 2.108(3)\\u00c5. Benefiting from its structure characteristic, each bpa4\\u2212 joint two left- and two right-handed individual chiral (10,3)-a subnets together by coordinating to Ni(II) ions from the corresponding subnets. As the individual (10,3)-a subnets interconnected by bpa4- ligands, a complicated three dimensional porous framework was achieved. In the structural view, the discrete networks were banded together and the eight interpenetrating (10,3)-a topology was modified by the connectivity increased from the presenting of bpa4\\u2212 ligands. To simplify and realize the structure of 1, bpa4\\u2212 ligand could be viewed as four connected vertex and the stacking tpt ligands could be viewed as triangle building blocks (a), then the overall structure could be simplified into a network bearing bor topology (b). According to the topology of the framework, the free volume found in the framework of 1 could be divided into chambers and channels, separately. In the octahedron double-wall chambers raised from the connection of four triangle building blocks and six vertexes, the dimension between the opposite vertexes is about 21.3\\u00c5 and the triangle window formed has 10.2\\u00c5 length edge, slightly bigger than the similar reported coordination cage .

The asymmetric coordination unit comprises one Zn(II), one and a half independent 2-eiba ligands, and a half-occupied hydroxide ions. As shown in a, each Zn(II) is coordinated by four O atoms from two 2-eiba ligands and one hydroxide ion, and one N atom from another 2-eiba ligand. The coordination geometry of the Zn center (\\u03c4=0.48) can be portrayed as a distorted polyhedron between trigonal bipyramid and square pyramid, where the \\u03c4 values of the ideal trigonal bipyramid and square pyramid are defined as 1 and 0, respectively . A pair of ZnII centers are interconnected by the \\u03bc2-hydroxyl and \\u03bc2-COO\\u2013 bridges to form a [Zn2(COO)(OH)] secondary building unit (SBU), with the Zn\\u22efZn separation of 3.292(2) \\u00c5. As for the 2-eiba ligands, they show the bridging and terminal linking role to connect the binuclear Zn(II) SBU, respectively. In this way, a grid-like layered coordination net (14.25\\u00d714.25\\u00c52), being extended through 2-eiba ligands, is formed (b). This 2D pattern is considerably undulated and of further importance, decorated with the unidentate 2-eiba pendants as side arms at single side. Interestingly, these long prominent arms, with a length of ca.7.824\\u00c5 between the pyridyl N atom and carboxylate C atom, penetrate into the grids of two adjacent layers to build a 3D polythreading supramolecular architecture with finite components . In fact, each lateral 2-eiba arm goes through two parallel grids and forms a OH\\u22efN hydrogen bond with the third one (O\\u22efN=2.759\\u00c5, H\\u22efN=1.91\\u00c5, \\u2220OH\\u22efN=172\\u00b0) (c). Thus, if these H-bonding interactions are also taken into account, [Zn2(COO)(OH)] SBUs behave as 6-connected nodes and 2-eiba ligands act as bridges. Then three uniform 3D networks are generated, which are 3-fold interpenetrating (d and e).

Before gas adsorption tests, activation to remove the guest molecules from the pores by heating under vacuum is a required pretreatment and the as-synthesized crystal samples were heated at an optimized temperature of 140\\u00b0C for 20h. To verify whether the framework of 1 can be sustained after the removal of the solvent molecules, PXRD patterns were measured (). The framework of 1 still has crystallinity after removing the solvent molecules, but the PXRD pattern of the activated sample is different from the as-synthesized one which may be attributed to the framework dynamics of 1. The crystalline solid of 1 can be re-generated by immersing the activated sample in 10mL DMF for 12h as indicated by the PXRD measurements () . The results show that the host framework of complex 1 is flexible enough to change its structure depending on the nature of the guest molecules, and the framework transformations are reversible. While complex 2 shows good crystallinity after removing the guest water molecules and the PXRD pattern of the activated sample shifts and becomes broad compared with the as-synthesized one (), therefore, the gas sorption isotherms of 1 and 2 are investigated. The N2 adsorption isotherms for 1 and 2 are shown in \\na and b, it can be seen that no N2 uptake was observed at 77K for 1 and 2, hysteresis was observed between the adsorption and desorption curves down to the lowest attainable pressure, which are characteristic for type-H3 sorption . However, significant amounts of CO2 (195K) were adsorbed (c) and both isotherms present typical type-I curves , which is the characteristic of microporous material. The amounts of adsorbed CO2 increase abruptly at the beginning and reach to 60.90cm3 (STP)/g (1.40mmol/g) at 1.0 atom for 1, 43.19cm3 (STP)/g (0.82mmol/g) for 2, approximately 0.48 CO2 and 0.23 CO2 molecules per formula unit were adsorbed for 1 and 2. Fitting the BET equations to the CO2 adsorption isotherm gave estimated surface areas of 119 and 68m2/g for complexes 1 and 2, respectively. The gas sorption isotherms show distinct hysteresis between the adsorption\\u2013desorption curves, which must be attributed to the intercrystalline voids . It is noteworthy that no N2 were adsorbed in spite of the channel size larger than the kinetic diameter of N2 (3.64\\u00c5), thus, the selective sorption behaviors of CO2 over N2 are attributed to the significant quadrupole moment of CO2 (\\u22121.4\\u00d710\\u221239\\nCm2), which induces specific interactions with the host framework . Considering the great current interest of CO2 adsorption/separation, the present work provides nice example of selective sorption behaviors of CO2 over N2 that is not size-controlled, but quadrupole moment induced ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['decomposition_temperature', 'gas_adsorption', 'surface_area']"}]}

A sharp photocurrent was generated when the cluster/ITO electrode was subjected to excitation with UV and visible light. The irradiation process was repeated 20 times over 400\\u00a0s, and the UV light was cut at 380\\u00a0nm or 400\\u00a0nm. The reproducible photocurrent responses without noticeable decrease in their relative intensities, despite of the dissimilar base curves, demonstrate the repeatabilities of the photoelectrode responses and hence the mechanical and photophysical stabilities of the electrodes. It should be noted that the current intensity is related to the wavelength of the light and the type of the clusters. The results are summarized as following. (1) The current intensity using a 380\\u00a0nm UV filter (, the left) is larger than that using a 400\\u00a0nm UV filter (, the right), about 1.7 times. (2) The current intensities of the 3-D C2 clusters are larger than those of the discrete C1 clusters, comparing (a) and (b) with (e) and (f), (c) and (d) with (g) and (h) in , about 2 times. (3) The current intensities of the selenide clusters are larger than those of the sulfide clusters, comparing (a) and (b) with (c) and (d), (e) and (f) with (g) and (h) in , about 8\\u201310 times. (4) Dark current was clearly found for both the C1 and C2 selenide clusters ((a), (b), (e) and (f), shown in red lines), and for this reason the base lines of their photocurrent drop down in whole or in first part of the experiment range.

The average distance between neighboring rare earth ions in the fumarate chain (4.28\\u00c5) (see ) is smaller than 5\\u00c5. Thus, Sm3+ ions in these compounds can interact between each other through the \\u201ccarboxylate bridges\\u201d of the fumarate anions, which is reflected in their spectra as the splitting of the crystal field components of f\\u2013f transitions.
