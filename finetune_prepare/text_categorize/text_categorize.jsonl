Due to the complete coordination of nitrogen donors and alkyl-lined pore surface, the imidazolate frameworks MAF-4 and MAF-5 are rare hydrophobic adsorbents with high pore volumes, which can easily adsorb large amount of organic solvent but do not adsorb water even at very high humidity. As the pore size is similar to small aromatic derivatives such as benzene and toluene, MAF-5 is suitable for removal of trace aromatic molecules from water.

Synthetic challenges in this field include controlling the size and size distribution of the nanoparticles and modifying structure . Large nanosized cadmium chalcogenido clusters have not only the definite structures, but also the extremely low limit of the size distribution and high stability. Therefore, a \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach to the synthesis of well defined large cadmium chalcogenido clusters has been recognized as a key to developing the semiconductor quantum dots technologically . These clusters generally fall into three series: supertetrahedral clusters (T<ce:italic>n</ce:italic>), pentasupertetrahedral clusters (P<ce:italic>n</ce:italic>), and capped tetrahedral clusters (C<ce:italic>n</ce:italic>) .

Besides the potential applications as quantum dots, they could serve as model systems and provide synthetic and structural insights into the formation and properties of nanomaterials.

The Flack parameter of crystal <ce:bold>1</ce:bold> having a acentric space group was refined to be \u22120.01(2), indicating <ce:bold>1</ce:bold> crystallizes as an enantiopure form, although achiral ligand was used. It was noticed that as seen in a the ligand molecules in <ce:bold>1</ce:bold> adopt the conformation I and type-A binding mode with two silver(I) centers related by a <ce:italic>C</ce:italic>\n<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf> symmetric axis (). Relevant bond parameters around metal centers are summarized in \n<ce:float-anchor refid=\"t0010\"></ce:float-anchor>. The silver(I) center is tetracoordinate with two sulfur atoms from symmetry-related ligands and two oxygen atoms of the bridging nitrate ions, being in a slightly distorted tetrahedral environment. The Ag-S bond distances are almost identical (2.5185(6) and 2.5186(6)<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>\u00c5, respectively), falling in the range of Ag\u2013S bond lengths reported in the literature , yet the Ag\u2013O bonds are slightly different in length (2.357(3) and 2.533(3)<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>\u00c5). Propagation of the repeat structure unit along the silver(II) centers results in the formation of an infinite 2-D coordination network which is composed of 20-membered macrocycles containing two ligand units, two silver(I) centers and two bridging nitrato-O atoms (b\u00a0and\u00a0c). In each macrocycle, the Ag\u22efAg nonbonding distance between two silver(I) centers bonded to the same ligand is approximately 10.7<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>\u00c5, while the O-bridged Ag\u22efAg nonbonding distance is approximately 4.6<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>\u00c5. The two phenyl rings of ligands in the macrocycle are arranged in an edge-to-face fashion and thus effective C\u2013H\u22ef\u03c0 interaction is observed between the rings. The C\u2013H\u22ef \u03c0 (centroid) distance as illustrated in c is as short as ca. 2.85<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>\u00c5 (c). It is worth mentioning that previously a silver(I) perchlorate complex based on a similar thioether ligand, 1,3-bis(phenylthiomethyl)benzene has been reported, where a structurally related grid-like network was observed . However, the structure of the repeating macrocyclic motif in this network is essentially distinct with that of <ce:bold>1</ce:bold>. In the structure reported previously , the silver centers are bridged by two oxygen atoms of the perchlorate anion, and the Ag\u2013O bond distances are relatively longer (2.556(10) and 2.719(4)<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>\u00c5, respectively), indicating weaker bonding interactions. In addition, the phenyl rings in the macrocycle are arranged in a face-to-face mode by \u03c0\u22ef\u03c0 stacking interaction (the distance between two aromatic planes is ca. 3.5<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>\u00c5), in sharp contrast to the C\u2013H\u22ef\u03c0 interactions found in <ce:bold>1</ce:bold> (c)</ce:para>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['property']"}]}

Currently, several extreme interests on MOFs were focused on designing new topological architectures, and pioneers have disclosed many kinds of topological structure, such as NbO, PtS, CdSO<ce:inf loc=\"post\">4</ce:inf> net, diamond net, rutile net, boracite net, sodalite net, etc.  Carefully checking the structure characters of MOFs, most of them were constructed from the single type of node, and the MOFs assembled from the double type of nodes are relatively less developed, such as the (3, 4) and (3, 6)-connected MOFs . To achieve this goal, the key factor is the choice of suitable organic ligands and metal centers; that is, to achieve the (3, 4)-connected net, one of the best ways is to choose metal centers with a low coordination number such as Zn, Cu, Co as 4-connected nodes and trigonal organic ligands as 3-connected nodes .

There is currently a renewed interest in that field because of the nanotechnologies emergence. Actually, the design of nanoporous open frameworks is a factor of this revival  because these compounds are anticipated to exhibit good efficiency as far as size selective separation, catalysis and gas storage are concerned . These potential applications require materials that do not decompose or collapse upon the removal of the guest molecules. Such materials can be obtained by using aromatic poly-carboxylate ligands. Several lanthanide-based coordination polymers involving benzene-poly-carboxylate ligand have already been described , but potentially porous materials are still rather uncommon . In order to increase the intermetallic distances in these materials, we have undertaken the study of naphthalene-poly-carboxylate-based coordination polymers . The two new lanthanide-containing coordination polymers reported below are part of this study. Both have been obtained by reacting in aqueous gel media a lanthanide chloride with the sodium salt of naphthalene-tetra-carboxylic acid (1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetra-carboxylic acid) (see \n<ce:float-anchor refid=\"fig9\"></ce:float-anchor>), hereafter symbolized by H<ce:inf loc=\"post\">4</ce:inf>ntc.</ce:para>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['else']"}]}

For example, thiocyanate anion has extraordinary varieties in the binding of complexes and shows great potential in building coordination frameworks. It can adopt end-on and end-to-end fashions via the nitrogen and sulfur atoms to bind metal ions. In particular, the end-to-end bridging fashion increases the dimensionality of the coordination network by the interlinking of the 1D chains or 2D networks, and meantime it enhances the interactions between paramagnetic metal-ions. It is worthy to note that cadmium thiocyanate adducts of organic ligands are an important class of complexes for the design and preparation of functional coordination frameworks since Cd(II) ion can form stable double SCN bridged chains .</ce:para>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['else']"}]}

The successful preparation of porous materials is mainly dependent on the self assembly of metal ions and multi-dentate linkers with specific coordination geometry. The self-assembly process has been affected by many factors, involving coordination modes, the nature of linkers and reaction conditions . In fact, the key to synthesize these porous materials is the careful design of organic linkers. The nature of organic linkers can directly affect the structure diversity and properties of these materials due to the difference in the size, the flexibility, positions of functional groups and coordination modes to various metal ions . To date, extensive research efforts have been focused on the preparation of new organic linkers and their use in the assembly of new coordination polymers. However, the combination study on positional isomeric effect of organic linkers and the diversity of structure in these solids is of great importance in understanding the relationship between their structure and intrinsic properties.</ce:para>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['else']"}]}

One of the most effective ways is the appropriate choice of well-designed molecular building blocks (MBB) and metal ions or clusters to achieve the targeting assemblies of such extended crystalline systems with desired structural features and/or physicochemical properties\u00a0. Although MBBs with 2-fold linear , 3-fold  and 4-fold  symmetries are popular choices for obtaining the well-defined MOFs, 2-fold non-linear MBB is rarely studied. This lies in two aspects: bigger steric hindrance and necessity of the auxiliary ligand known as pillar to sustain the architecture . Compared with BDC , non-linear FDA possesses two advantages as the MBB: the high openness net with the flexible bond angle of two carboxyl (~<ce:hsp sp=\"0.10\"></ce:hsp>126\u00b0) and the polarity owing to the oxygen atom of ring, which is potentially applied for gas-storage and gas-separation. Due to the non-linear FDA as the MBB, the choice of the pillar would effect the structural formations \u2014 porosity and interpenetration. With respect to the steric hindrance and electronic effect, the flexible and rigid pillars are employed to the construction of structure, respectively. In this work, two novel MOFs have been synthesized, in which the flexible bpp results in the robust porous [Zn<ce:inf loc=\"post\">3</ce:inf>\u00b7(FDA)<ce:inf loc=\"post\">3</ce:inf>\u00b7bpp\u00b7H<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>O]\u00b72H<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>O (<ce:bold>1</ce:bold>), and the rigid bipy in 3-/3-D interpenetrated [Zn\u00b7(FDA)\u00b7bipy]\u00b72H<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>O (<ce:bold>2</ce:bold>).</ce:para>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['else']"}]}

We identified 2-(4-pyridyl)thiazole-4-carboxate (pytac) (<ce:float-anchor refid=\"sch2\"></ce:float-anchor>\n) as one ligand of suitable length and have begun to use it in the preparation of new coordination frameworks . This ligand is similar to pca and ppca in that there exists a terminal and a chelating nitrogen coordination site that can be used for coordinating to metal centers. However, while in the case of pca and ppca the coordination sites are in a linear arrangement with respect to each other, in the case of pytac, the chelating nitrogen is no longer exactly opposite the terminal nitrogen, but rather is oriented approximately perpendicular to it. This spatial arrangement of the nitrogens enables the ligand to function as a \u2018bent\u2019 spacer . The \u2018bent\u2019 orientation of the ligand's N-donor atoms, as well as the presence of an additional Lewis base site in the form of a ring-sulfur atom, lead us to believe that the use of this ligand could yield equally, if not more, diverse structures compared to those containing the pca or ppca ligands.

As far as the construction of cluster polymers is concerned, on the one hand, the inorganic salts being prone to form the clusters, such as oxides, halides or sulfides are usually used as the inorganic precursors to form inorganic subunits (SUs) . On the other hand, the literature show that three types of bridges can extend the inorganic SUs into poly-nuclear or high-dimensional (D) cluster polymers: (i) inorganic bridge. With various organic ammines as guest species or organic templating agents, the SUs interact with each other through covalent M\u2013O (X or S) bonds (or through sharing the corner, edge or/and face) between the SUs, producing new polymeric clusters. This is the basic constructing conception of zeolite and zeolite-like materials . (ii) Organic bridge, the most common method. Up to now, lots of bridging organic ligands with N/O/S donors have been chosen to extend the SUs into the 1-D, 2-D, 3-D cluster polymers via covalent interactions or a combination of covalent and non-covalent interactions . (iii) Metal complex bridge. This strategy has been extensively adopted when preparing high-D poly-acids . Some recent reports show that it is being extended to the construction of metal\u2013halo cluster polymers .</ce:para>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['else']"}]}

With bridging N-donor ligands, CuX can form various neutral oligomeric and polymeric clusters, namely so-called SUs. The most reports are rhombic dimer, cubane tetramer, zigzag-type and staircase chains . Further, these SUs are extended by organic bridges into the 1-D, 2-D or 3-D networks. It was reported that the size of organic ligands determines the mode of the SUs.
