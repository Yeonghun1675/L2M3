## Summary
This project focuses on efficiently collecting experimental Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) data from scientific literature to overcome the challenges of accessing elusive data and to improve the quality of information available for machine learning applications in materials science. By leveraging a chain of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), we developed a systematic approach to extract and organize MOF data into a structured and usable format. Our methodology successfully compiled information from over 40,000 research articles, resulting in a comprehensive, ready-to-use dataset. This dataset includes MOF synthesis conditions and properties, extracted from both tables and textual descriptions, which were subsequently analyzed. We employed a machine learning model to predict experimentally measured properties, demonstrating that using experimental data instead of simulated data for training significantly enhances prediction accuracy. Our findings underscore the richness of experimental data compared to in silico data and highlight the importance of utilizing experimental datasets to improve machine learning predictions in MOF research.
