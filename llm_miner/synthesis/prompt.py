Paragraph: A mixture of tris-(4-bromophenyl)amine (2.00 g, 4.15 mmol) and CuCN (1.70 g, 18.98 mmol) was heated at reflux in 25 mL of anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) for 6 h under a nitrogen atmosphere at 150 °C. Upon cooling to room temperature (RT), the FeCl3/H2O/ethanol (8.00 g/10 mL/8 mL) mixture solvent was added to the reaction mixture and then heated to 125 °C. Then, dilute hydrochloric acid (100 mL, 2 M) was added into the solution. The resulting mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2 (5 × 50 mL), washed with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-2Na aqueous solution (5 × 100 mL), evaporated under a rotary evaporator, and dried over anhydrous MgSO4. The crude product was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel using CH2Cl2 as an eluent to afford 0.90 g (67.8%) of tris-(4-cyanophenyl)amine as a primrose yellow powder.

PROMPT_STRUCT = """Extract the relevant information about the synthesis of MOFs mentioned in the paragraph.

There are guildlines for output format:
- You must write like {{"meta":{{"name":"", "symbol":"", "chemical formula":""}}, "processes": list, "yield": str,and "other properties": [str, str, ...]}}.
- The "process" list consists of several dictionaries. Each dictionary consists of {{"synthesis method": str, information(different according to synthesis method)}}.

For each process, you must follow these formats:
{format}


You must follow rules belows:
- According to the synthesis type, information you must write is different. You must write one dictionary per one material.
- If there are several "meta"s in the text, you must write several dictionaries.
- If the synthesis procedure is same as certain compound except for certain material, write same synthesis method with that compound except for certain material.
- For each dictionary, you must include yield, chemical formula and other properties if information exists. Chemical formula consists of combination of several elements and numbers like C2H5OH.
- According to the synthesis method, you must include other information about {synthesis_type}.
- In case of precursor, additive, surfactant, solution, solvent and reducing agent, if these exist more than 2, you must write all the things in one dictionary. 
- Do not confuse precursor with solution. Precursor has a unit of mass and solution has a unit of volume.
- You never forge information that is not in the paragraph. Do not write the information in the example.
- If symbol is written altogether like "4-6", write three different results.
- When "Ln" or "M" exists in the paragraph, you must write other metals instead of "Ln" or "M". ex) ChemLn (Ln=Pr(1), Gd(2), Dy(3), Er(4)), There are four chemicals; ChemPr, ChemGd, ChemDy, ChemEr

Paragraph: [Ag3(Z[6])2(TDA)3(Cl)2(H2O)10][Ag(TDA)(H2O)5]·6Cl·nH2O (2)

Z[6] (20 mg, 2.0 mmol) was dissolved in 4.0 mL of deionized (DI) water. Silver chloride (536.1 mg; 3.0 mmol) and tetradecanoic acid (576.3 mg, 2.0 mmol) were dissolved in 4.0 mL of DI water and added to the above Z[6] solution. Diluted sodium hydroxide was used to adjust the solution to pH 7 (±0.1). After a period of one week, octahedral crystals of compound 2 were formed. The resulting product was achieved in a yield of 68% based on Z[6], which was collected and dried under vacuum.
