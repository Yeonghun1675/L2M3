If "%" and "conversion" words exist in the sentence, it must be about catalytic activity. If information about reaction time exist, you must write it. If the sentence includes more than one information, you must extract the information for each separately. For example, when the sentence is "the reaction afforded 20%, 40%, and 60% conversions after 1, 2, and 3 h, respectively, and 99% conversion could be obtained if the reaction was continued for 8 h.", 20% corresponds to 1 h, 40% corresponds to 2 h, 60% corresponds to 3h, and 99% corresponds to 8 h. TOF is a catalytic activity.
