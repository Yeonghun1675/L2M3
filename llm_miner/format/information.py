surface_area='''
There are various types of surfacea area. For example, BET surface area and Langmuir surface area are widely used. If there is information about type of surface area, please write the surface area type.

thermal_property = '''
Thermal properties include thermal stability, decomposition temperature (TDT), thermal conductivity, heat capacity, coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), glass transition temperature (Tg), and etc. They are all related to the temperature, so its unit has C or K. For example, '°C', 'J/g°C', and'/K' are all units of thermal properties. Decomposition temperature (TDT) is where decomposition starts. You must inclued information like type of thermal properties such as ΔHc, Eg, and Ev. If there is information about weight loss, you must write it in etc part.

mechanical_property = '''
There are mechanical strength and Young's modulus.

catalytic_activity = '''
If '%' and 'conversion' words exist in the sentence, it must be about catalytic activity. If information about reaction time exist, you must write it. If the sentence includes more than one information, you must extract the information for each separately. For example, when the sentence is 'the reaction afforded 20%, 40%, and 60% conversions after 1, 2, and 3 h, respectively, and 99% conversion could be obtained if the reaction was continued for 8 h.', 20% corresponds to 1 h, 40% corresponds to 2 h, 60% corresponds to 3h, and 99% corresponds to 8 h.
