PROMPT_TYPE = """First, determine whether properties exist or not. Except for topology, crystal system, and space group, properties must have a float value. If a property does not have float value, do not extract it. If there is no property in the paragraph, please return an empty list.
If properties exist, you must find all the properties in paragraphs. Names of properties must be one of following:
{explanation}

You must follow below rules:
- Avoid including the same property multiple times. If there are surface_area and BET surface_area in the paragraph at the same time, you must include "surface_area" once.
- You must include only the properties, excluding the names of materials.
- If a property you find lacks a value, please exclude it.
- Do not be confused between gas adsorption and selectivity. Gas adsorption is a property that has a unit and selectivity is unitless. Even though there is a word "selectivity", it is not always selectivity. If there is a value with unit, it is gas adsorption.
- In crystal system, there are triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, trigonal, hexagonal, and cubic. If one of them exists in the paragraph, it means there is "crystal system" information.
- If "TGA" or "TG" exists in the paragraph, it includes "decomposition_temperature".

If you are uncertain, please reply with "I do not know".
