Although this topology is rare in MOF chemistry, it is not unprecedented. Despite its interpenetrating nature, the structure is porous in all three dimensions, with crystallographic studies suggesting 5.5 DMA and 0.5 H2O noncoordinated solvent molecules per asymmetric unit. Theoretical removal of these noncoordinated molecules gives a PLATON (probe radius 1.2 \u00c5) calculated solvent accessible void volume of 8973.7 \u00c53 per unit cell or 47.6%. All of the channels in 1 are relatively narrow, with the largest channels running along the crystallographic 010 direction (see Figure b) having a rectangular cross section of ca. 7.5 \u00d7 5.5 \u00c5.\n\nPowder diffraction measurements show signals which closely match those of a simulated diffractogram based on the single-crystal X-ray data (see ), thus confirming the bulk purity of the product. TGA measurements on 1 show a 25.6% weight loss occuring in the temperature range 100-200 \u00b0C (see ). This is close to a predicted value of 26.2% for the loss of all noncoordinated solvents from 1 based on the X-ray crystallographic data. A further 40.3% weight loss occurs from 400-480 \u00b0C and can be attributed to decomposition of the MOF.\n\nThe zinc-hydroxo chains in 3 are interconnected through the dicarboxylate ligands to give 2D corrugated layers in which the SiMe2 groups protrude both above and below the plane of the zinc atoms (Figure a). This gives rise to the formation of intralayer channels in the crystallographic 100 direction (Figure b) of approximate rectangular cross section 8.5 \u00d7 7.0 \u00c5. DMF molecules are sited within these channels (one per lattice point) and form weak hydrogen bonds to the zinc hydroxyl group (O1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O, 2.8137(18) \u00c5; H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O, 1.92 \u00c5; O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O, 170\u00b0). The PLATON (probe radius 1.2 \u00c5) calculated solvent-accessible void volume for 3 after theoretical removal of these DMF molecules is 999.7 \u00c53 per unit cell (23.9%). In contrast to the layers in 2, the corrugated layers in 3 stack with alternate layers directly above one another, and no overlapping or intercalation of the layers is present.\n\nThe bulk purity of 3 was confirmed using powder diffraction measurements (). TGA measurements show a 15.3% weight loss in the range 120-280 \u00b0C, which occurs in two distinct steps (). This is consistent with the loss of the noncoordinated DMF from 3 (calcd, 15.0%).
