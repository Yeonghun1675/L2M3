Our models described the stability of static UiO-66-Ds in the presence of binary mixtures, whereas the long-term stability of the material may suffer from defect evolution caused by multicomponent effects under process conditions. Despite detection of defects in MOFs remaining experimentally challenging, this study represents a significant step toward a data-driven analysis of defects and provide a useful reference for the development of defect engineering in MOFs and related materials with respect to practical adsorption and separation processes.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 47, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information\nis\navailable free of charge at <ext-link xlink:href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemmater.9b05322?goto=supporting-info\">https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemmater.9b05322</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Details of defect\ncreation, property calculations, and\nclassifications of UiO-66-Ds; statistical summary of features and\npairwise correlations between the features in UiO-66-Ds; prediction\naccuracy of the target properties by machine learning; predicted missing-linker\nratio versus experimental data; response surface in predicting missing-linker\nratio; top 10 privileged candidates of UiO-66-Ds; best performing\ndecision trees to access different categories of UiO-66-Ds; categories\nof real UiO-66 materials; and reproducibility of measured the BET\nsurface area in an experiment (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.chemmater.9b05322/suppl_file/cm9b05322_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>CIF files of the library of UiO-66-Ds (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.chemmater.9b05322/suppl_file/cm9b05322_si_002.zip\">ZIP</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Feature data\nset of UiO-66-Ds (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.chemmater.9b05322/suppl_file/cm9b05322_si_003.xlsx\">XLSX</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemmater.9b05322.
