All samples exhibit Type I isotherms profiles due\nto the presence of micropores. Compared with the adsorption isotherms\nof other crystals, NC crystals exhibit a continuous rising plateau\ndue to the significant external area from small agglomerated particles. As shown in <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b01073/suppl_file/cm8b01073_si_001.pdf\">Table S1</ext-link>, the Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) surface areas of\nNR and IT crystals (1283 and 969 m<sup>2</sup>/g) are much lower than\nthat of RD crystals (1539 m<sup>2</sup>/g).

As shown in a, all the spectra are in good agreement with the previous reports on ZIF-8 crystals, with the exception of the appearance of peaks in the region of 2800-3200 cm-1 assigned to the special vibrations of CTAB molecules. The absorptions at 2918 and 2846 cm-1 are assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of C-CH2 in the methylene chains, respectively. Furthermore, compared to the as-synthesized ZIF-8 crystals with other shapes, IT crystals exhibit the highest absorptive intensity of characteristic peaks from CTAB molecules. This phenomenon is attributed to the existence of abundant CTAB molecules in IT crystals, which was verified through the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in air atmosphere. As shown in b, the decomposition temperature windows for Hmim and CTAB are 150-200 and 230-300 \u00b0C, respectively, and the temperature for structural degradation of ZIF-8 structure ranges from 330 to 430 \u00b0C. Prior to the decomposition of the ZIF-8 framework, crystals with various shapes exhibit different weight-loss and can be categorized into two groups. For the first-group crystals (RD, NC, and OP), the weight-loss is mainly due to the release of embedded Hmim molecules. On the contrary, the weight-loss on the second-group crystals (IT and NR) is the release of both Hmim and CTAB, suggesting the existence of non-negligible amounts of CTAB inside the IT and NR crystals. In addition, N2 sorption measurements at 77 K also indicate that NR and IT crystals exhibit relative lower adsorption uptake than other shapes (c). All samples exhibit Type I isotherms profiles due to the presence of micropores. Compared with the adsorption isotherms of other crystals, NC crystals exhibit a continuous rising plateau due to the significant external area from small agglomerated particles. As shown in Table S1, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of NR and IT crystals (1283 and 969 m2/g) are much lower than that of RD crystals (1539 m2/g). Especially for the IT crystals, the BET surface area and micropore volume are only ~60% those of RD crystals. We speculate that the reduction of porosity is attributed to the inclusion of CTAB molecules inside the ZIF-8 framework rather than adsorption of CTAB on the crystal surfaces. Therefore, the role of CTAB in the morphological-controllable synthesis of ZIF-8 crystals is not limited to the capping mechanism, which is the general observation for surfactant-assistant synthesis of both MOF and inorganic nanocrystals.
