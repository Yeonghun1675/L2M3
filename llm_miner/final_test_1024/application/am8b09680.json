The relaxation rate of NMOF-SNO had linear change with their increasing concentration. The longitudinal relaxivity value (r 1) was 24.6 mM-1 s-1, whereas the r 2 value of NMOF-SNO was 12.1 mM-1 s-1 (Figure S14). Thus, NMOF-SNO is very suitable for T 1-weighted MRI. The T 1-weighted MR efficiency of NMOF-SNO was confirmed by the apparent Mn concentration-reliant brightening property (inset of A).", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "NMOFs", "symbol": "A,B", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "N2", "value": "1900", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": "77 K"}], "pore volume": [{"probe": "N2", "value": "0.67", "unit": "cm3/g", "condition": "77 K"}], "pore diameter": [{"value": "1.26", "unit": "nm", "condition": ""}], "peak spectrum": [{"value": "466, 573, 603", "unit": "nm", "type": "UV-vis", "condition": ""}], "etc": [{"property name": "r 1 value", "value": "26.9", "unit": "mM-1 s-1", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "longitudinal relaxivity value (r 1)", "value": "24.6", "unit": "mM-1 s-1", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "r 2 value", "value": "12.1", "unit": "mM-1 s-1", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["surface_area", "pore_volume", "pore_diameter", "peak_spectrum", "etc"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['surface_area', 'pore_volume', 'pore_diameter', 'peak_spectrum', 'etc']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"NMOFs\",\n            \"symbol\": \"A,B\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"surface area\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"BET\",\n                \"probe\": \"N2\",\n                \"value\": \"1900\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"77 K\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"pore volume\": [\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"N2\",\n                \"value\": \"0.67\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"77 K\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"pore diameter\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"1.26\",\n                \"unit\": \"nm\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"peak spectrum\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"466, 573, 603\",\n                \"unit\": \"nm\",\n                \"type\": \"UV-vis\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"etc\": [\n            {\n                \"property name\": \"r 1 value\",\n                \"value\": \"26.9\",\n                \"unit\": \"mM-1 s-1\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"property name\": \"longitudinal relaxivity value (r 1)\",\n                \"value\": \"24.6\",\n                \"unit\": \"mM-1 s-1\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"property name\": \"r 2 value\",\n                \"value\": \"12.1\",\n                \"unit\": \"mM-1 s-1\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 22, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(A) Scheme for the synthesis of the NMOF\u2013SNO nanocomposite\nand the NIR light-triggered NO release and PTT.
