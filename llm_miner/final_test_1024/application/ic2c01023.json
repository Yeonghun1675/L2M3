Measurements were performed by alternating current impedance spectroscopy, using pelletized powder samples over a large range of temperatures (25-90 \u00b0C) and RH levels (68-98%), as shown in  and S10-S12. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results were represented in a Nyquist form, where Z'' (imaginary component of the impedance) is plotted as the function of Z' (real component of impedance). All the Nyquist plots showed a semicircle in the high-frequency region followed by an elongated tail in the low-frequency region. The Nyquist plots were fitted to a suitable equivalent circuit ((R1/Q1) + (R2/Q2) + Q3), where R1 and R2 represent resistance and Q1, Q2, and Q3 represent constant-phase elements, as shown in the inset of a. On fitting, the Nyquist plots each resolved into a well-fitted high-frequency semicircle with a lower radius and a low-frequency semicircle with a high radius, representing the resistance of the material analogous to the proton conductivity and the contact resistance, respectively. The conductivities were calculated from the fitted high-frequency semicircle of the Nyquist plots and were found to be highly dependent on the RH (Figures S10-S12). The strongly hydrogen-bonded guest water molecules are poorly labile at low humidity. However, their mobility increases with RH, resulting in an enhanced proton conductivity performance. For instance, all the frameworks reported here showed a very poor proton conductivity at 25 \u00b0C and low RH. When the RH was increased, keeping the temperature constant, the conductivity of BAM-1, BAM-2, and BAM-3 increased 2-fold, reaching 2.1 \u00d7 10-6, 3.4 \u00d7 10-6, and 5.1 \u00d7 10-6 S cm-1, respectively, at 98% RH (Figures S10-S12). Moreover, when the temperature was gradually increased (at a constant RH of 98%), the conductivities of BAM-1 and BAM-2 also increased. This is a typical proton conductivity behavior. At 90 \u00b0C and 98% RH, the conductivity of BAM-1 and BAM-2 reached maximum values of 4.9 \u00d7 10-5 (a) and 4.4 \u00d7 10-5 S cm-1 (b), respectively. For BAM-3, increasing the temperature also led to an increase in the conductivity, reaching a maximum value of 1.4 \u00d7 10-5 S cm-1 at 50 \u00b0C and 98% RH (c). The proton conductivity remains almost constant with a further increase in temperature but suddenly drops at 90 \u00b0C to 7.6 \u00d7 10-6 S cm-1. This is consistent with the phase transition observed by VT-PXRD in which lattice water, and hence the hydrogen bonding network is lost (Figure S8). Following conductivity measurements, PXRD patterns indicate no irreversible structural transition in any of the reported compounds (Figure S13). The proton conductivities of BAM-1, BAM-2, and BAM-3 are comparable to the recently reported mixed-ligand phosphonate MOFs.
