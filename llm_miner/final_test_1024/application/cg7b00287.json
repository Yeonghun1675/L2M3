Mean square displacement \u27e8r 2(\u0394)\u27e9 of gases during interval \u0394 can be calculated and self-diffusion coefficients defined by D s = \u27e8r 2(\u0394)\u27e9/(6\u0394) can be determined. Self-diffusivities can also be obtained by another microscopic method called quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) if gas molecules contain hydrogen whose scattering is essentially incoherent. Besides, transport diffusivities Dt  relating a concentration gradient to the flux originated from this gradient (J = -D  t \u2207c) can be determined by QENS as well when molecules are deuterated with coherent scattering. Recently, the development of microimaging using interference microscopy (IFM) and infrared microscopy (IRM) enables the direct monitoring of guests in individual single crystals and records the concentration profiles of guests in the observation direction. These techniques can be used not only for the calculation of self-diffusivities and transport diffusivities from the concentration profiles, but also for the determination of the governing mass transfer mechanism of gas molecules diffusion into the crystals.

Currently, industrial separation of O2 from air is mainly implemented by cryogenic distillation. This process can provide O2 in very high purity (>99%) but consumes considerable energy and capital cost. Zeolites or CMS based adsorptive separations used in industrial scale and portable medical devices are more energy efficient alternatives, though the purity of O2 obtained by this process is slightly lower (~94%). Though kinetic N2/O2 separation using CMS and 4A zeolite has already been developed, few studies on kinetic separation of N2/O2 using MOFs have been reported. Mohideen and coauthors reported a Cu-based MOF in which N2 diffuses much slower than O2. Starting from benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (BTC) and Cu(NO3)2\u22c53(H2O), BTC undergoes selective monoesterification during reaction to obtain STAM-1 (St Andrews MOF-1) rather than the expected 3D CuBTC (aka HKUST-1), which was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and solid-state NMR. Composed of a copper \"paddle-wheel\" connected by monoesterified ligands, STAM-1 contains hydrophilic channels lined by metal ions which are filled with H2O molecules as well as hydrophobic cavities lined only by organic functional groups (a,b). The hydrophilic channels lie along the crystallographic c-axis with pore apertures of ~4 \u00c5, while the hydrophobic chambers with pore apertures of similar size (~4 \u00c5) sit among hydrophilic channels (c). Interestingly, water in the pores can be removed upon heating at 393 K, after which only hydrophilic channels remain open for the adsorption of N2, N2O, and CO2. On the contrary, the interactions between polar molecules such as H2O and CH3OH and the hydrophilic pores are so strong that they can reverse the crystal structure change upon activation, which enables the access of H2O and CH3OH to the hydrophilic channels along with hydrophobic chambers. Moreover, the adsorption kinetics of O2 is significantly higher than that of N2, leading to an O2/N2 selectivity of 4. Though this value is lower than that of the best CMS used in industry (20), this proof-of-concept work opens a new door for developing porous adsorbents for kinetic N2/O2 separation.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 20, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig3\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) A cup unit in STAM-1 with a green ball representing\nthe hydrophilic\ncavity.
