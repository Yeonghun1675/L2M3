In order to remove the solvents in the MOFs with integrity of the frameworks, the as-synthesized 1 and 1-NH2 were immersed in MeOH for 2 days to exchange the high-boiling point solvent, DMA, followed by heating at 70 \u00b0C under vacuum conditions to afford the activated samples of 1 and 1-NH2. The TGA and XRD results showed that the DMA molecules were completely removed in the activated 1 and 1-NH2 while the integrity of the frameworks was still kept (Figures S6-S8). The N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K indicated that both the activated 1 and 1-NH2 displayed the fully reversible type-I isotherm with the Langmuir area of 1154.3 m2 g-1 and 1032.1 m2 g-1, respectively (Figure S9).", "data": [{"meta": {"name": "[Cd4(hbhdpy)2(bdc)3(DMA)2]\u00b7(H2O)4", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "C74H72N10O26Cd4"}, "processes": [{"synthesis method": "solvothermal synthesis", "precursor": [{"name": "Hhbhpy", "amount": "0.0780", "unit": "g"}, {"name": "Cd\u00ad(OAc)2", "amount": "0.4", "unit": "mmol"}, {"name": "H2bdc", "amount": "0.0498", "unit": "g"}, {"name": "DMA", "amount": "5", "unit": "mL"}, {"name": "water", "amount": "0.5", "unit": "mL"}], "pressure": "", "temperature": "100 \u00b0C", "time": "3 days", "heating rate": "", "cooling rate": "10 \u00b0C/h"}], "yield": "75%"}, {"meta": {"name": "[Cd4(hbhdpy)2(bdc-NH2)3(DMA)2]\u00b7(H2O)4", "symbol": "1-NH2", "chemical formula": "C74H73N13O26Cd4"}, "processes": [{"synthesis method": "solvothermal synthesis", "precursor": [{"name": "Hhbhpy", "amount": "0.0780", "unit": "g"}, {"name": "Cd\u00ad(OAc)2", "amount": "0.4", "unit": "mmol"}, {"name": "H2bdc-NH2", "amount": "", "unit": ""}, {"name": "DMA", "amount": "5", "unit": "mL"}, {"name": "water", "amount": "0.5", "unit": "mL"}], "pressure": "", "temperature": "", "time": "", "heating rate": "", "cooling rate": "10 \u00b0C/h"}], "yield": "72%"}], "include_properties": ["solvothermal_synthesis"]}]
