The structure was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies (Scheme b). Geometrical analysis using Platon software confirmed the highly porous nature of the as-synthesized material (61% of the unit cell volume); however, attempts to desolvate the framework using commonly applied procedures (vacuum and thermal treatment) were unsuccessful. Therefore, we resorted to supercritical CO2 drying. With this method, NU-505-Zn exhibited high initial porosity, as evidenced by a pore volume of 0.63 cm3/g and a BET area of 1600 m2/g. Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations of N2 sorption performed for this MOF resulted in a predicted pore volume of 1.02 cm3/g and a predicted BET area of 2660 m2/g. The fact that the experimental values are smaller indicates that complete activation was not achieved. Furthermore, we discovered that the evacuated MOF did not display persistent porosity. When N2 isotherms were collected 24 and 48 h after activation, the BET  area decreased to 1370 m2/g and then 1280 m2/g, implying gradual structural collapse; after a week, almost all N2 porosity was lost (see the ).", "data": [{"meta": {"name": "NU-505-Zn", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "processes": [{"synthesis method": "sonication", "composition": [{"name": "H4TBAPy", "amount": "50", "unit": "mg"}, {"name": "Zn(NO3)2\u00b76H2O", "amount": "44", "unit": "mg"}, {"name": "dabco", "amount": "16.8", "unit": "mg"}, {"name": "fuming HNO3 (90%)", "amount": "8 drops"}, {"name": "DMF", "amount": "8", "unit": "mL"}], "power": "", "solvent": "DMF", "temperature": "60\u00b0C for 30 min, then 75\u00b0C for 3 days", "time": "", "type": ""}, {"synthesis method": "washing", "washing solution": "DMF", "amount": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "NU-505-Zn", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "processes": [{"synthesis method": "transmetalation", "precursor": [{"name": "NU-505-Zn", "amount": "30", "unit": "mg"}], "solution": [{"name": "NiCl2\u00b76H2O", "amount": "62", "unit": "mg"}, {"name": "DMSO", "amount": "5", "unit": "mL"}], "pressure": "", "temperature": "100\u00b0C", "time": "2 days"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "water-treated NU-505-Ni", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "processes": [{"synthesis method": "reinsertion", "precursor": [{"name": "water-treated NU-505-Ni", "amount": "30", "unit": "mg"}], "solution": [{"name": "dabco", "amount": "20", "unit": "mg"}, {"name": "DMF", "amount": "5", "unit": "mL"}], "pressure": "", "temperature": "100\u00b0C", "time": "overnight"}]}], "include_properties": ["solvothermal_synthesis", "sonication", "washing"]}]
