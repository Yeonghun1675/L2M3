The molecular formula of compound 1 was determined by elemental analysis and single-crystal X-ray analysis. In IR spectrum of 1 (Figure S1), the strong and broad absorption bands in the range 3250-3510cm-1 are characteristic of the O-H vibration of water molecules. The spectrum also shows characteristic bands of carboxylate groups around 1550cm-1 assignable to the asymmetric stretch and around 1384cm-1 associated with the symmetric stretch . The difference of 253cm-1 between \u03bd as(COO-) and \u03bd s(COO-) in 1 indicates that bridging carboxylates are in the exo-bidentate mode, as proven by the X-ray crystal structure analysis.
