Orange crystals of DyHPMo11VO40\u22c5nH2O were formed after cooling the saturated solution and slow evaporation at room temperature. A solvent mixture (10mL) of acetonitrile and water (v:v=3:2) was used as a buffer layer and very carefully layered over an aqueous solution (4mL) of L ligand (35mg, 0.1mmol) in a long and thin tube. Then, the fresh DyHPMo11VO40\u22c5nH2O (90mg, ~0.04mmol) in 4mL mixture of acetonitrile and water (v:v=3:1) was slowly layered over the buffer layer.
