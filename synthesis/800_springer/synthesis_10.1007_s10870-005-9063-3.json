The initial cloudy lavender suspension was heated and allowed to react for about 15\u00a0min. The resulting clear maroon solution was then gravity-filtered into an evaporation dish and left out at room temperature. Following complete evaporation of the solvent, many large (&gt;2\u00a0mm) pale mauve diamond-shaped plates of the product were recovered from the bottom of the dish (this and subsequent reactions were repeated three times: average yield 1.06\u00a0g, 48%). The remainder not collected was a polycrystalline crust on the sides of the dish. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the crystals performed from 50 to 800\u00b0C at a 20\u00b0C/min gradient shows two distinct mass losses centered at roughly 333 and 408\u00a0K each corresponding to loss of six molecules of water per formula unit. Presumably, the first six are the waters of crystallization while the second six are those coordinated to the Mg cation.
