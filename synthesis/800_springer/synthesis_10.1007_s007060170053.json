[30]) in 10 cm3 CH3CN was added to a solution of 132 mg (0.84 mmol) of 4,4 0-bipyridine (ACROS) in 10 cm3 acetonitrile under stirring. First, a yellow microcrystalline precipitate of Cu2I2-4,4 0-bipyridine is formed which transforms to red CuI-4,40-bipyridine by stirring overnight. The product was \u00aeltered off and washed with EtOH and diethyl ether. Yield: 87% based on CuI; calcd.: C 34.65, N 8.08, H 2.33; found: C 35.05, N 8.00, H 2.24; AAS (Cu): calcd.: 18.33, found: 18.54; X-ray powder diffraction: phase-pure. 2 1 [Cu2I2(-C10H8N2)] A solution of 386.9 mg (2 mmol) of copper(I) iodide (freshly prepared according to Ref. [30]) in 15 cm3 CH3CN was added to a solution of 156.2 mg (1 mmol) of 4,4 0-bipyridine (ACROS) in 10 cm3 CH3CN under stirring. The reaction mixture was stirred over night, and the product was \u00aeltered off and washed with EtOH and diethyl ether. Yield: 94.4% based on CuI; calcd.: C 22.36, N 5.22, H 1.50; found: C 22.24, N 5.32, H 1.55; AAS (Cu): calcd.: 23.67, found: 23.72; X-ray powder diffraction: phase-pure. Single crystals of this compound were prepared by reaction of 96.7 mg (0.5 mmol) CuI (freshly prepared according to Ref. [30]) and 39.1 mg (0.25 mmol) 4,40-bipyridine (ACROS) in 10 cm3 of deionized H2O in a te\u00afon-lined steel autoclave at 130 C under hydrothermal conditions. After 5 days the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. The product was \u00aeltered off and washed with deionized water. It consists of a mixture of a few very small needles and a yellow microcrystalline material.
