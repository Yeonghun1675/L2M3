Briefly, PbBr2@MOF precursor was first prepared by a one-pot solvothermal reaction. The obtained PbBr2@MOF was dispersed in MABr ethanol solution at room temperature. After 10 min, MAPbBr3 PQDs@MOF crystals with a size of tens of micrometers were obtained (see the Supporting Information for synthesis details). After the growth of MAPbBr3 PQDs, the MOF crystals turned a light-yellow color because of the light absorption of MAPbBr3 PQDs (Figure S1a). However, the in situ growth of PQDs did not change the crystal structure and morphology of the MOF, as supported by the optical image in Figure S1a and the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figure S1b). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of PQDs@MOF shows homogeneous distribution of PQDs embedded in MOF (b). The average diameter of the PQDs is ~2.34 nm (Figure S2), and the average dot-to-dot distance (from center to center) is ~3.34 nm. c shows the UV-vis absorption and PL emission spectra of MAPbBr3 PQDs@MOF crystals. Because the diameter of the PQDs is smaller than the Bohr radius (~5 nm) of the exciton in bulk MAPbBr3, the PQDs in MOF show a blue-shifted absorption spectrum compared with their bulk counterpart (Figure S3) because of the quantum confinement effect. For comparison, MAPbBr3 PQDs colloid with oleic acid (OA) and n-octylamine (OLAM) ligands were also synthesized, and the corresponding solid thin films were fabricated via a drop-casting method (see the Supporting Information for details). The thickness of the solid films is ~200 nm (Figure S4). The diameter of PQDs in solid films was controlled to be 3.92 nm (Figure S5) to achieve a similar absorption spectrum (thus similar band gap energy) as that of PQDs@MOF (Figure S3). Compared with the PQDs in solid films, the diameter of PQDs in MOF is smaller, which may be due to their type-II heterostructure and the weaker dielectric screening effect of the MOF matrix.
