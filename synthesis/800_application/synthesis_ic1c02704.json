Ball milling a 1:12 mixture of [Hf6O4(OH)4(OOCCH3)12]2 and H2bdc in the presence of added DMF (\u03b7 = 0.67 \u03bcL/mg) afforded white crystalline solids, which did not dissolve in DMF or methanol.

The completeness of the mechanochemical reaction is monitored through infrared (IR) spectroscopy by examining the disappearance of carbonyl stretching from free carboxylic acid groups at 1674 cm-1 (Figure S3).
