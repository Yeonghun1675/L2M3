The low value of I 2\u03c9 is due in part to the short ligand length (and thus inefficient conjugation) in 1.

Compound 5 exhibited a large SHG response, but the sample was damaged by the laser before an accurate measurement could be attained (attempts to attenuate the input beam were unsuccessful).
