However, the pore size distributions of 2-7 calculated on the basis of the N2 sorption isotherms at 77 K reveal almost the same peaks at ~11 \u00c5, which are quite consistent with the observations of their crystal structures. As unsaturated coordinative metal sites have been proven to be highly responsible for the interaction with CO2, the CO2 adsorption isotherms of 2-7 at 273 and 298 K were recorded to evaluate the properties of different metal ions with respect to the CO2 uptake performance. It can be seen from  that the rates of uptake of CO2 by 2-7 obviously outperformed that of the parent framework, which implied an affinity of Cu2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, and Co2+ ions for CO2 that is higher than that of the Cd2+ ion. To gain more insights into the CO2 adsorption capacity, we calculated the Q st values for 2-7 from the CO2 isotherms by using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. The Q st values at low coverages are calculated to be 25.7, 20.4, 38.9, 48.1, 37.1, and 41.5 kJ/mol for 2-7, respectively, all of which overwhelmed that of the parent framework (16.7 kJ/mol) (). More specifically, 2, 3, 6, and 7 with the fully metalated porphyrin cores showed distinctly varied Q st values that decreased in the following order: Co2+ > Ni2+ > Cu2+ > Zn2+. These results illustrate the stronger interaction between the Co2+ ion and CO2 in ps-CMOF analogues, which has been previously observed in other MOFs. Furthermore, both 4 and 5, whose porphyrin cores are partially metalated, showed approximate Q st values compared to those of their fully metalated counterparts 6 and 7, indicating the free porphyrin might also contribute to the interaction with CO2, because the introduction of amine groups into the framework has been identified as an effective method for improving CO2 adsorption behavior.

To date, the substrate size-dependent enantioselectivity in the asymmetric carbonatation reactions has been witnessed in other catalytic systems, but there is no evidence illustrating the intrinsic reason for this phenomenon. Here in the ps-CMOF catalytic platform, the crystal structures provide detailed structural evidence that improves our understanding of the interaction between the substrate and chirally induced groups.

As shown in , Cu2+ and Zn2+ ions in 2 and 3 are successfully trapped in the free porphyrin with Cu-N bond lengths ranging from 1.982 to 2.010 \u00c5 and Zn-N bond lengths ranging from 2.059 to 2.106 \u00c5. Similarly, the Cu2+ ion is coordinated in porphyrin with a square-planar geometry, and the Zn2+ ion is also axially coordinated by a water molecule. In 4 and 5, the porphyrin remains uncoordinated during the soaking process. These structural differences between 2 (or 3) and  4 (or 5) offer two insights for illustrating the exchange course. (i) The reaction kinetic rates of Cu2+ and Zn2+ ions in the complexation of porphyrin are faster than those of Ni2+ and Co2+ ions, and (ii) the metal ion exchange in porphyrin proceeds faster than the complexation of metal ions into free porphyrin. The first result is ascribed to the affinity of Cu2+ and Zn2+ ions for nitrogenous linkers being higher than that of Ni2+ and Co2+ ions.

This finding provides good structural evidence for the study of the coordination kinetics substitution reaction demonstrated by Berezin. Next, when the reaction time is extended to 30 days, complexation of Ni2+ and Co2+ ions to the free porphyrin was observed in 6 and 7, respectively. Although the structural determination of 6 and 7 by single-crystal XRD was unsuccessful because of the relatively poor quality of the single crystals, the PXRD patterns evidence the stability of the framework (a). In addition, AAS results revealed Cd:Ni and Cd:Co ratios of 1:2.96 and 1:1.98 for 6 and 7, respectively, which are in accordance with the stoichoimetric ratios of 1:3 and 1:2 predicted for 6 and 7, respectively.\n\nPXRD, CD, TG, and Gas Adsorption\n\nThe ps-CMOF analogues after PSMet processes retain the crystalline nature of the parent framework, as also evidenced by comparing their simulated PXRD patterns from crystal data. To confirm that no new phase is formed during the PSMet process, the bulky samples of 2-7 were filtered and then characterized by PXRD measurement. As revealed in a, all ps-CMOF analogues showed almost the same PXRD pattern, unambiguously suggesting their phase purity. The solid-state CD spectra (Figure S1) of 2-7 made from R and S enantiomers of the salen linker showed curves similar to those of 1, which are all mirror image of each other, confirming the chiral nature of the bulk materials. Then TGA were performed to evaluate the thermal stability of 2-7 (Figure S2). The TG curves showed first weight losses of approximately 17.6, 19.4, 20.4, 22.4, 18.2, and 20.6% for 2-7, respectively, corresponding to the loss of disordered guest molecules from the channels. The sharp weight losses after 390, 377, 388, 387, 383, and 381 \u00b0C for 2-7, respectively, indicate the collapse of the framework. All TG curves showed trends similar to that of the parent framework, further suggesting the maintenance of the thermal stability of the framework after PSMet processes. The N2 adsorption measurements at 77 K were then performed to confirm the permanent porosity of 2-7. The samples were outgassed at 150 \u00b0C under vacuum for 12 h before tests. As shown in panels c and d of , the N2 adsorption isotherms of 2-7 are similar to that of the parent framework and present type I behavior, an indication of microporous materials. It is noteworthy that the rates of uptake of N2 by these ps-CMOF analogues are slightly higher than that of the parent framework. We proposed this might result from the removal of some unknown species that were trapped inside the parent framework during the soaking of metal salt solutions, thus causing a slight increase in the surface area of 2-7. However, the pore size distributions of 2-7 calculated on the basis of the N2 sorption isotherms at 77 K reveal almost the same peaks at ~11 \u00c5, which are quite consistent with the observations of their crystal structures. As unsaturated coordinative metal sites have been proven to be highly responsible for the interaction with CO2, the CO2 adsorption isotherms of 2-7 at 273 and 298 K were recorded to evaluate the properties of different metal ions with respect to the CO2 uptake performance. It can be seen from  that the rates of uptake of CO2 by 2-7 obviously outperformed that of the parent framework, which implied an affinity of Cu2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, and Co2+ ions for CO2 that is higher than that of the Cd2+ ion. To gain more insights into the CO2 adsorption capacity, we calculated the Q st values for 2-7 from the CO2 isotherms by using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. The Q st values at low coverages are calculated to be 25.7, 20.4, 38.9, 48.1, 37.1, and 41.5 kJ/mol for 2-7, respectively, all of which overwhelmed that of the parent framework (16.7 kJ/mol) (). More specifically, 2, 3, 6, and 7 with the fully metalated porphyrin cores showed distinctly varied Q st values that decreased in the following order: Co2+ > Ni2+ > Cu2+ > Zn2+. These results illustrate the stronger interaction between the Co2+ ion and CO2 in ps-CMOF analogues, which has been previously observed in other MOFs. Furthermore, both 4 and 5, whose porphyrin cores are partially metalated, showed approximate Q st values compared to those of their fully metalated counterparts 6 and 7, indicating the free porphyrin might also contribute to the interaction with CO2, because the introduction of amine groups into the framework has been identified as an effective method for improving CO2 adsorption behavior.
