It is soluble in solvents such as toluene, THF, and diethyl ether. 3 was characterized by NMR spectroscopy, EI-MS spectrometry, elemental analysis, and single-crystal X-ray studies. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 3 display two sets of resonances from the benzamidinate ligand. In the 1H NMR spectrum a downfield shift of the tBu protons (\u03b4 1.39 ppm) is observed in comparison with those of 2 (\u03b4 1.18 ppm). In addition, 3 displays two more resonances at \u03b4 1.72 and 3.56 ppm, which indicates the existence of coordinated THF in the complex. This was further confirmed by the 13C NMR spectrum, which exhibits resonances at \u03b4 26.8 and 67.8 ppm. The molecular ion was not observed in the EI-MS spectrum, although it exhibited a fragment at m/z 479 as the ion with the highest mass, which indicates the half-fragment of 3.\n\nPreparation of 2 \n\nA solution of 1 (0.40 g, 1.02 mmol) in THF (20 mL) was added to a stirred suspension of sulfur (0.038 g, 1.02 mmol) in THF (10 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 days until the solution became transparent. Storage of the reaction mixture at -32 \u00b0C in a freezer for 7 days afforded the crystals of 2\u22c52THF, suitable for a X-ray structure determination (yield 0.18 g, 43.42%). Mp: 165-170 \u00b0C.
