On the basis of the principle of SPS, Wang et al. have developed an electric-field-induced surface photovoltage spectroscopy (EFISPS) technique, which they have used to investigate in depth the photoelectric properties of semiconductors under the effect of an external electric field. When an external direct current electric field is applied to the two sides of a semiconductor under illumination, it drives the photoinduced holes to transfer in the same direction as the added electric field because of the work of external force, whereas the photoinduced electrons are driven to migrate in the opposite direction, indicating that the mobile direction and diffusive distance of the photoinduced charge carriers can be varied. In other words, the external electric field can promote the separation of the photoinduced charge carriers and hence influence the semiconductor surface photovoltaic effect by influencing the distribution of charge carriers. If we apply a positive electric field (the illuminated surface is positive) vertically to the p-type semiconductor surface, whose direction is the same as the direction of the built-in field, the separation efficiency of the photoinduced carriers is increased and the intensity of SPV response increases in the original direction. If a negative electric field, whose direction is opposite to that of the built-in field, is applied, the separation efficiency of the photoinduced carriers reduces and the intensity of the SPV response is weakened, even in the reverse direction. In contrast to p-type semiconductors, the SPV response intensity of n-type semiconductors increases as a negative field is applied and reduces as a positive electric field is applied. The EFISPS results of compound 1 and compounds 2 and 3 are shown in b and Figure S9, respectively. The intensities of the responses are all obviously increased with a positive electric field (+0.2 V) and reduced with a negative electric field (-0.2 V). Hence, it means that compounds 1-3 behave as p-type semiconductors.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 46, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig13\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>13</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) SPS and (b) EFISPS\nof compound <bold>1</bold>.

The utilization\nof [UO<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> ions in compounds arranges the metal\ncenters into an extended topology as well as allows for the introduction\nof chromophoric organic linkers, which could sensitize the [UO<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> luminescence. The luminescence of uranyl compounds\ncentered near 520 nm has been known for centuries. The charge-transfer-based\nemission is vibronically coupled to both bending and stretching modes\nof the uranyl cation and typically consists of a five-peak spectrum,\nalthough far more lines can be observed at low temperature. Denning and his group members have examined\nin detail these transitions for the solid samples containing the [UO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2\u2013</sup> anion owing to its crystallization\nin a cubic space group. However, not\nall uranyl compounds possess luminescent properties, and the mechanisms\nof the emission from uranyl compounds are most often difficult to\nexplain. As we reported here, unusual luminescent properties have\nbeen documented recently for a family of uranyl flexible hexapodal\ncarboxylates.

These compounds exhibit a slight blue-shift\nof 40 nm along with lesser intensity for the emission bands compared\nto the benchmark compound. Such behaviors were previously observed\nfor other uranyl complexes. Moreover, comparison of the observed spectrum for compound <bold>1</bold> to compounds <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold> shows an\nobvious difference in the shape of the five-peak, which may be attributed\nto the coordination environment around the uranium centers UO<sub>7</sub> and UO<sub>8</sub> for <bold>1</bold> and UO<sub>7</sub> for <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold>, further resulting in differences in\nthe stereospecific blockade and the symmetry of the uranyl equatorial\ncoordination layer. To our surprise, two additional peaks at 379 and\n400 nm were found, corresponding to the \u03c0* \u2192 \u03c0\ntransition of the ligand and the MLCT transition (from metal to ligand\ncharge transfer transition), respectively, in accordance with the\nfluorescent spectrum for the ligand (375 and 392 nm).

The results\nof the SPS indicate that not only semiconductors possess photovoltage\ncharacteristic but also that some other materials, such as coordination\npolymers, also can exhibit the photovoltage properties.</p>", "clean_text": "Thermal Properties\n\nThe thermogravimetric curve (Figure S4) of compound 1 shows different weight loss steps. The first event occurring from 216 up to 246 \u00b0C is assigned to the departure of two free water molecules and one aqua ligand (obsd: 4.52%; calcd: 4.42%) and indicates that the interactions of these water molecules with the framework are slightly strong, which ends at a somewhat high temperature. From then on, almost no loss is observed until 260 \u00b0C, at which temperature the compound begins to decompose. The second weight loss step up to 375 \u00b0C is attributed to the removal of three N-diacetate groups of the H2TTHA4- ligand (obsd: 31.96%; calcd: 32.14%). The last event, up to 633 \u00b0C, corresponds to the decomposition of the 4,4'-bipy and the triazine ring (obsd: 18.20%; calcd: 19.19%). For compound 2, an immediate weight loss upon heating is completed from 46 \u00b0C up to 122 \u00b0C, which can be attributed to the loss of three aqua ligands (obsd: 4.13%; calcd: 4.05%). The rapid weight loss starts at ~200 \u00b0C, up to 540 \u00b0C, corresponding to the decomposition of three N-diacetate groups of the TTHA4- ligand (obsd: 29.21%; calcd: 29.29%). The remaining weight loss to 735 \u00b0C is in good agreement with further the decomposition of the triazine ring (obsd: 5.68%; calcd: 5.86%). The TGA curve of compound 3 illustrates that there is a significant weight loss stage between 42 and 110 \u00b0C due to the loss of the hydronium, three aqua ligands, and the uncoordinated carboxylate group (obsd: 4.95%; calcd: 5.00%) because of the instability of the group as described in the X-ray crystallographic determination section. A rather complicated continuous weight loss profile starts at 200 \u00b0C, suggesting decomposition of the organic linkers.\n\nPhotoluminescent (PL) Properties and Detection for Nitrobenzene\n\nThe luminescent properties of UVI are of interest due to potential applications, including photocatalysis. The utilization of [UO2]2+ ions in compounds arranges the metal centers into an extended topology as well as allows for the introduction of chromophoric organic linkers, which could sensitize the [UO2]2+ luminescence. The luminescence of uranyl compounds centered near 520 nm has been known for centuries. The charge-transfer-based emission is vibronically coupled to both bending and stretching modes of the uranyl cation and typically consists of a five-peak spectrum, although far more lines can be observed at low temperature. Denning and his group members have examined in detail these transitions for the solid samples containing the [UO2Cl4]2- anion owing to its crystallization in a cubic space group. However, not all uranyl compounds possess luminescent properties, and the mechanisms of the emission from uranyl compounds are most often difficult to explain. As we reported here, unusual luminescent properties have been documented recently for a family of uranyl flexible hexapodal carboxylates. The luminescent spectra for these three novel carboxylate compounds (\u03bbex = 290 nm), the benchmark compound UO2(CH3COO)2\u22c52H2O (\u03bbex = 332 nm), and the ligand (\u03bbex = 262 nm) were collected under the same experimental conditions and procedures and are shown in . Five peaks (452, 470, 491, 515, and 538 nm) for 1 and four peaks (452, 470, 491, and 515 nm) for 2 and 3 are observed in the spectra, which all exhibit characterized emission from uranyl cations. These emission peaks correspond to the electronic and vibronic transitions of S11 \u2192 S00, S10 \u2192 S0v  (v = 0-3) for 1 and S11 \u2192 S00, S10 \u2192 S0v  (v = 0-2) for 2 and 3, and the most intense peak is positioned at 470 nm for these three compounds. As for the benchmark compound, the luminescent spectrum shows well-resolved sharp vibronic peaks at 488, 510, 533, 559, and 587 nm [corresponding to S11 \u2192 S00 and S10 \u2192 S0v  (v = 0-3)], and the most intense peak (S10 \u2192 S00) is positioned at 510 nm. These compounds exhibit a slight blue-shift of 40 nm along with lesser intensity for the emission bands compared to the benchmark compound. Such behaviors were previously observed for other uranyl complexes. Moreover, comparison of the observed spectrum for compound 1 to compounds 2 and 3 shows an obvious difference in the shape of the five-peak, which may be attributed to the coordination environment around the uranium centers UO7 and UO8 for 1 and UO7 for 2 and 3, further resulting in differences in the stereospecific blockade and the symmetry of the uranyl equatorial coordination layer. To our surprise, two additional peaks at 379 and 400 nm were found, corresponding to the \u03c0* \u2192 \u03c0 transition of the ligand and the MLCT transition (from metal to ligand charge transfer transition), respectively, in accordance with the fluorescent spectrum for the ligand (375 and 392 nm). It is indicated that the energy of the ligand does not overall transfer to the [UO2]2+ ions.\n\nThe sensing properties of 1 for nitrobenzene were further investigated by monitoring a series of emulsions in DMSO upon gradually increasing the nitrobenzene concentration. As shown in b, the luminescence intensity gradually decreases with increasing nitrobenzene concentration. When the concentration of nitrobenzene increased to 1000 ppm, the luminescence intensity was quenched with a high quenching efficiency of 90%. Seemingly, Zn3(L1)2(L2) (2) {L1 = 4-[3-(4-carboxyphenoxy)-2-[(4-carboxyphenoxy)methyl]-2-methyl-propoxy]benzoate, L2 = 1,4-bis(1-imidazolyl)benzene]}, which has a quenching efficiency of 98.91%, is the most sensitive for nitrobenzene detection. Although there is a certain gap between compound 1 and Zn3(L1)2(L2) (2) {L1 = 4-[3-(4-carboxyphenoxy)-2-[(4-carboxyphenoxy)methyl]-2-methyl-propoxy]benzoate, L2 = 1,4-bis(1-imidazolyl)benzene]}, the result suggests that compound 1 has a good sensitivity in detecting small amounts of nitrobenzene in solution. To further verify the effect of the nitro group on the sensing of nitrobenzene, we measured the emission spectrum of 1 in toluene (c). Obviously, the luminescence intensity of the nitrobenzene emulsion was far below those of others in the benzene series. The result reveals that the nitro group is the main cause of the quenching effect. In addition, compounds 2 and 3 also show sensing properties for nitrobenzene (Figures S7). The different quenching efficiencies of compounds 1-3 are compared in d.\n\nSurface Photoelectric Properties\n\nWe all know that the transfer and separation processes of the photoinduced charge carriers (electron-hole pairs) result in the redistribution of surface charges under illumination, which makes the net surface charges (QSS) and the surface band bending decrease; thus, the SPV response (SPS) is generated. Figure S8 shows the effects of band-to-band transitions on the SPV responses of semiconductors. The detected signal is equivalent to the change in the surface potential barrier under illumination (\u03b4V s). The value is calculated by the equation \u03b4V s = V s' - V s o, in which V s o and V s' are the surface potential barriers before and after illumination, respectively. The magnitude of the surface potential barrier depends on the number of the net surface charges. By analogy with other metal oxide semiconductors (e.g., ZnO), the uranyl coordination polymer may be regarded as an extended semiconductor with its valence band consisting of the occupied O orbitals, whereas its conduction band consists of the empty metal (UVI) orbitals. The SPS of compound 1 is shown in a. Some overlap of signals was fixed after treatment using the Origin7.0 program. By careful differentiation, compound 1 shows three positive SPV responses in the range 300-550 nm. The response band at \u03bbmax = 322 nm can be attributed to the \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* transition of ligand, whereas the response at \u03bbmax = 358 nm is assigned to the LMCT transition (from ligand to metal charge transfer transition). Furthermore, the encouraging response band at ~418 nm should be the characteristic of uranyl charge transfer in accordance with the UV-vis spectrum. Compounds 2 and 3 also exhibit similar photovoltage properties (Figure S9). Comparing the SPV responses of compounds 1-3, it can be seen that the position of the highest peak about these three compounds is roughly the same, although their intensities are obviously different. This intensity difference is mainly due to the differences in coordination modes of the H6TTHA ligand, resulting in the different separation efficiencies of the photoinduced carriers. The results of the SPS indicate that not only semiconductors possess photovoltage characteristic but also that some other materials, such as coordination polymers, also can exhibit the photovoltage properties.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "400", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "lattice collapse", "condition":
