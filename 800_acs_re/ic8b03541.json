The specific\ncapacitance of 196 F g<sup>\u20131</sup> of <bold>APC-25</bold> is\nhigher than that of carbon reported quite recently.

Then Cu@C composites have been etched with HCl and subsequently activated with KOH to obtain activated porous carbon (APC-0, -25, and -60). Interestingly, APC-25 presents a loose multilevel morphology of cabbage and possesses the largest specific surface area (1880.4 m2 g-1) and pore volume (0.81 cm3 g-1) among these APC materials. Consequently, APC-25 also exhibits the highest specific capacitance of 196 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1, and the corresponding symmetric supercapacitor cell (SSC) achieves a remarkable energy density of 11.8 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 350 W kg-1. Furthermore, APC-25 shows excellent cycling stability, and the loss of capacitance is only 7.7% even after 10000 cycles at 1 A g-1. Significantly, five light-emitting diodes can be lit by six SSCs, which proves that APC-25 can be used in energy storage devices.\n\nTwo-dimensional Cu-MOF-25 with a squama morphology is synthesized as the precursor to prepare cabbagelike APC-25, which has a large BET specific surface area of 1800.4 m2 g-1. APC-25 displays excellent specific capacitance of 196 F g-1, and the corresponding symmetric supercapacitor cell achieves a remarkable energy density of 11.8 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 350 W K g-1, which can be used in energy storage devices.\n\nThe surface area and pore size distribution of APCs were explored by BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) and BJH (Barrette-Joynere-Halenda) methods. All N2 adsorption-desorption behaviors present sigmoidal isothermal curves (a). When the presure increases to P 0, the adsorption amount increases sharply because of capillary condensation. All characteristics clearly point to a typical IV isothermal curve, which infers the existence of hierarchical pores in APCs. Interestingly, APC-25 has the largest adsorption quantity at any pressure, which indicates the best porous structure. After the calculation, the BET specific surface areas are 1385.9, 1880.4, and 1243.9 m2 g-1 for APC-0, APC-25, and APC-60, respectively. Meanwhile, the corresponding volumes are 0.86, 1.08, and 0.81 cm3 g-1, respectively. Obviously, APC-25 possesses the largest BET specific surface area and pore volume (). The results show that the morphology of the Cu-MOF precursor, which is related to the reaction temperature, could control the porous feature of MOF-derived materials. As shown in b, all BJH pore size distribution curves reveal a sharp peak centered at 4.1 nm, which proves that APCs are mainly concentrated on micropores and mesopores. Furthermore, pore sizes ranging from 20 to 160 nm could be weakly detected in APC-25. The micropore could accommodate massive electrostatic charge, and the concomitance of the meso/macropore is attributed to the intercalation and deintercalation of the electrolyte ion, easily reaching the maximum accessible surface area. Considering the largest specific surface areas and pore volume, APC-25 with a hierarchically porous structure could serve as a suitable electrode candidate for the supercapacitor.\n\nSupercapacitive Properties\n\nTo research the energy storage of APCs, cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), and cycle-life tests have been employed. For a comparison, APCs as electrodes were evaluated by CV and GCD curves with a scan rate of 10 mV s-1 and a density current of 0.5 A g-1, respectively. As shown in , the APC-25 electrode obviously possesses the largest CV area and longest discharging time among all APC electrodes, which demonstrates that APC-25 has the highest specific capacitance.\n\nBecause of the best supercapacitive performance, the electrochemical behaviors of APC-25 were thoroughly studied. Supercapacitance was first investigated via CV measurements at different scan rates and GCD curves at different current densities in a three-electrode system. As shown in , the rectangular CV and triangle GCD curves both present slight distortion, which indicates the pseudocapacitive behavior of oxygen functionality doped in the APC-25 electrode. Furthermore, the distortion becomes more serious with an increase in the scan rate or current density, which may arise from the diffusion limitation of the electrolyte ion. The specific capacitance (C, farads per gram) calculated via CV is determined with :  1    C = \u222b  I  d V / 2 \u03c5 \u0394 V m    where I (amperes), \u0394V (volts), \u03c5 (millivolts per second), and m (grams) represent the instant current, potential change, scan rate, and mass of active material, respectively. Meanwhile, specific capacitance C counted from GCD is based on :  2    C = I \u0394 t / \u0394 V m   where \u0394t (seconds) is the discharge time and other variations are kept with . According to CV curves, specific capacitances of the APC-25 electrode decrease from 175 to 122 F g-1 as scan rates increase from 5 to 100 mV s-1, because the electrolyte ion does not have sufficient time to permeate into the microporous surface at a higher scan rate and there is less charge accommodation. On the basis of GCD tests, specific capacitance values of the APC-25 electrode are 196, 181, 166, 155, and 140 F g-1 at current densities of 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 A g-1, respectively. Obviously, with the increase in current density, the specific capacitance will decrease, which is mainly due to a decrease in the ion accessible surface area at large current densities. The specific capacitance of 196 F g-1 of APC-25 is higher than that of carbon reported quite recently. Furthermore, with respect to the APC-0 and APC-60 electrodes, the CV and GCD curves are shown in Figure S4. All specific capacitance values of APC electrodes are summarized in . Evidently, the specific capacitance of the APC-25 electrode is better than those of the APC-0 and APC-60 electrodes (Figure S5).\n\nTo better demonstrate the application as electrode materials, we construct a two-electrode APC-25//APC-25 SSC in a 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. a exhibits CV curves of the SSC from 1.0 to 1.4 V at a scan rate of 20 mV s-1, which can be reversibly cycled. However, the CV curve shows distortion and a slight hump above 1.4 V. Therefore, we test the performance of the SSC in the operating voltage window of 1.4 V, and stable CV curves could be obtained from 5 to 100 mV s-1 (b). The quasi-rectangular shapes manifest good supercapacitive performance and a high level of retention in the APC-25 electrode. GCD tests were performed at multiple current densities in the voltage window of 0-1.4 V to further evaluate the rate performances and accurately determine the specific capacitance of the SSC (c). All GCD curves are nearly symmetric triangle shapes, and the potential drop is not visible even at high current densities, which show the good Coulombic efficiency, fast charge propagation, and very small resistance of the APC-25 electrode. According to , the specific capacitance values of the SSC are 43.4 and 32.2 F g-1 at 0.5 and 10 A g-1, respectively (Figure S6). The level of retention of 74% indicates the good rate capability and superior ion transport properties of the APC-25 electrode.\n\nAs shown in , the energy density and power density were studied and plotted in a Ragone plot, which is a valuable indicator for the actual application of energy storage devices. The specific energy (SE, watthours per kilogram) and specific power (SP, watts per kilogram) can be computed from  and , respectively:  3    S E = 0.5 C   \u03c5   2   / 3.6     4    S P = 3600 \u00d7 S E / t   where C is the gravimetric capacitance, \u03c5 the voltage window, and t the discharge time. At a current density of 0.5 A g-1, the SE value of the SSC reaches 11.8 Wh kg-1 at a SP of 349 W kg-1. When the current density increase to 10 A g-1, the SE value of the SSC is 8.7 Wh kg-1 with a SP of 6960 W kg-1. A direct comparison of our symmetric capacitor performance with previous reports in the literature is summarized in Table S2. Our APC-25 sample owns an obvious advantage in energy density compared to other morphological carbon materials, such as NPC-L, the carbon nanotube sponge, a 3D carbon network, 3D-graphene foam, PGBC, etc. Notably, the SSC still retains 92.3% of its original specific capacitance at 1 A g-1 after 10000 cycles, indicating good cycle stability and high ion mobility (Figure S7).
