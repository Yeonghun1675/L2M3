Dry dmso (15 mL) was then added using a syringe, and the mixture was stirred vigorously for 2 days at 90 \u00b0C. The dmso solution was subsequently concentrated to 8-10 mL, and tert-butanol was slowly added to form a double layer. Slow crystallization from the double layer (1 day) afforded yellowish crystals, which were separated by filtration and dissolved again in dry dmso. The solution was filtered through diatomaceous earth to remove any traces of metallic palladium. Complex 1 precipitated from this solution as a yellow solid by addition of tert-butanol and was dried under vacuum overnight at 160 \u00b0C (0.390 g, 54% based on Pd). A reasonable agreement between the number of solvent molecules detected by 1H NMR spectroscopy and the elemental analysis results was obtained as follows.

Dry dmso (15 mL) was then added using a syringe, and the mixture was stirred vigorously for 2 days at 90 \u00b0C. The dmso solution was subsequently concentrated to 8-10 mL, and tert-butanol was slowly added to form a double layer. Slow crystallization from the double layer (1 day) afforded yellowish crystals, which were separated by filtration and dissolved again in dry dmso. The solution was filtered through diatomaceous earth to remove any traces of metallic palladium. Complex 1 precipitated from this solution as a yellow solid by addition of tert-butanol and was dried under vacuum overnight at 160 \u00b0C (0.390 g, 54% based on Pd). A reasonable agreement between the number of solvent molecules detected by 1H NMR spectroscopy and the elemental analysis results was obtained as follows. The solid was dissolved in dmso and crystallized by slow diffusion of tert-butanol. The crystals were crushed and dried for 12 h at 160 \u00b0C under high vacuum. Anal.
