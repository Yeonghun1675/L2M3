It is well-known that standard DFT methods based on generalized gradient approximation do not fully account for the long-range dispersion interactions between the framework and the weakly bound gaseous adsorbates. To accurately estimate static binding energies for weakly bound guest molecules with IPM-301 and IPM-302 framework, we implemented dispersion corrections using the DFT-D3 method. Electron exchange and correlation were described using the generalized gradient approximation Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof form, and the projector-augmented wave potentials were used to treat core and valence electrons. In all cases, we used a plane-wave kinetic energy cutoff of 600 eV and a \u0393-point mesh for sampling the Brillouin zone. The ionic coordinates were relaxed until the Hellman-Feynman ionic forces were less than 0.01 eV/\u00c5. The initial location of the guest molecule in the primitive cell of IPM-301 and IPM-302 was obtained from the classical simulated annealing technique using classical force field as implemented in sorption module in Materials Studio. In the simulated annealing method, the temperature was lowered stepwise, allowing the gas molecule to reach a desirable configuration based on different moves such as rotation, translation, and repositioning with preset probabilities of occurrence. This process of heating and cooling the system was repeated in several heating cycles to find the local minima. Forty heating cycles were performed, where the maximum temperature and the final temperature were 105 and 100 K, respectively.

To further examine the selectivity\nof IPM-301, the mixture selectivity of CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> (15:85, composition of flue gas) at 1 bar was calculated using ideal\nadsorbed solution theory (IAST) (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.8b14420/suppl_file/am8b14420_si_003.pdf\">Figures S44</ext-link> and d).

Remarkably, such stability is very rarely observed\nfor a MOF built from metal nodes having higher coordination spheres\nsuch as Cd\u00ad(II), which further endorses the choice of the building\nunits. The unusual stability can be ascribed to the combination of\nmultiple factors viz. higher denticity of linker for affording kinetic stability, higher binding strength of the imidazole groups to enhance coordination\nbond strength, bridging of adjacent Cd\u00ad(II)\nby strongly coordinating sulfate anion, and extended\ncoordination of the sulfonate ligand, which is further interacting with the framework backbone through\nstrong noncovalent interactions. Enthused from the robust hydrolytic\nstability, we further checked the stability of IPM-301 over different\npH conditions.

Amine groups\nhave been well known to provide strong binding sites in MOFs for CO<sub>2</sub> and other polar adsorptive. To understand\nthis behavior further in the current case, we performed dispersion-corrected\nDFT (DFT-D3) calculations to investigate the binding modes.

TGA profiles suggested initial loss of guest solvent molecules occluded in the pores during the synthesis, and decomposition of the framework was initiated ~400 \u00b0C. Field-emission SEM (FESEM) images displayed the formation of neat crystals (Figures S10 and S27). FT-IR spectra confirmed the presence of the sulfate groups with peaks corresponding to the S-O stretching frequency (Figure S11). The guest-free phases were obtained upon exchange with methanol followed by heating under vacuum, and the activation was validated using TGA profiles (Figure S8b). The crystallinity was found to be retained after this protocol making it a rare example of sulfonate-based MOF retaining permanent porosity. MOFs have commanded remarkable attention as sorbents for the pressing demands to capture and sequester greenhouse gas CO2. The polar pore surface of IPM-301 propelled us to investigate its ability to adsorb CO2. Low-temperature CO2 adsorption (195 K) performed on IPM-301 yielded an uptake of ~106 mL g-1 (Figure S12). The compound did not show any significant uptake for N2 (77 K) (Figure S15). Temperature-dependent CO2 isotherms were recorded at 273, 298, and 310 K which displayed uptake amounts of 46.8, ~37, and ~33 mL g-1, respectively (a, S12, and S13). Notably, these values are among the highest reported for an organosulfonate-based MOF (Table S5). \n\nThe zero-coverage isosteric heat of adsorption as estimated from variable-temperature adsorption was found to be 31.1 kJ mol-1, suggesting the high affinity of CO2 toward the MOF (Figure S14). IPM-301 exhibited negligible uptake for related small gases at 298 K [kinetic diameters: N2\ue5f83.64 \u00c5 and O2\ue5f83.46 \u00c5] (Figure S16). Importantly, the compound was found to retain its integrity after the adsorption measurements (Figure S17). To further examine the selectivity of IPM-301, the mixture selectivity of CO2/N2 (15:85, composition of flue gas) at 1 bar was calculated using ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) (Figures S44 and d).

The hydrolytic stability of the compound was established by dipping the compound in deionized water. PXRD pattern and CO2 adsorption isotherm of the phase recovered after 7 days confirmed the retention of integrity of the framework (Figures S18 and S19).

Like the previous case, we observed selective uptake for CO2, with adsorption amounts of ~95, 45.9, 36.6, and 32.1 mL g-1 at 195, 273, 298, and 310 K, respectively (Figures S28, S29, S31, and S32).\n\nThe isosteric heat of adsorption at zero-loading was found to be 28.7 kJ mol-1 (Figure S30). The IAST selectivity for CO2/N2 for IPM-302 was calculated to be 40 at 298 K and 1 bar (Figures S44 and d). IPM-302 was found to be hydrolytically stable and retained its structure at pH = 4 and 10.01 (b, S33-S37). Intriguingly, the two MOFs exhibited similar adsorption performances despite IPM-302 bearing the additional polar site of pendant amine group (Figures S38 and S39). Amine groups have been well known to provide strong binding sites in MOFs for CO2 and other polar adsorptive. To understand this behavior further in the current case, we performed dispersion-corrected DFT (DFT-D3) calculations to investigate the binding modes. The static binding energies for CO2 at 0 K using DFT calculations were found to be ~44 and ~36 kJ mol-1 for IPM-301 and IPM-302, respectively. The calculations suggested that CO2 interacts strongly with the oxygen atom directed toward the pore from the bridging SO4 2- anions, even in the case of IPM-302 which bears -NH2 pendant sites (). Some important reports in this domain have demonstrated the role of polar functional sites in MOFs, such as -F, -NH2, and -SO3 toward CO2 adsorption.
