Compounds 1 and 1-NH2 are isomorphous and crystallize in the monoclinic crystal system, space group P21/c. Compound 1 is employed as a representative to be described in detail. There are two Cd2+ ions, one deprotonated hbhdpy- anion, one and a half bdc2- anions, one coordinated DMA molecule, and two lattice water molecules in the asymmetric unit of 1 (a). Cd1 is seven-coordinated to two oxygen atoms (O2, O3) and one nitrogen atom (N1) from one deprotonated ligand hbhdpy-, two carboxyl oxygen atoms (O5, O6) from one deprotonated ligand bdc2-, one pyridyl nitrogen atom (N4i) from the other deprotonated ligand hbhdpy-, and one oxygen atom (O11) from one coordinated solvent of DMA, showing a distorted pentagonal bipyramidal coordination geometry. Cd2 is bonded with two oxygen atoms (O1, O2) from the deprotonated ligand hbhdpy- and five carboxyl oxygen atoms (O6, O7ii, O8ii, O9, O10) from three deproto-nated ligand bdc2- with the distorted pentagonal bipyramidal coordination geometry. The Cd-O bond distances are in the range of 2.237(3)-2.587(2) \u00c5, and the Cd-N bond distances fall in the range of 2.380(2)-2.399(3) \u00c5.

When it comes to the\nmixture of CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> (50/50, v/v), the breakthrough\noccurs at a shorter dimensionless time due to the relatively small\nseparation ratio of CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> compared to the\nCO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> (15/85, v/v) binary mixture.</p><p>To better understand these results, the adsorption enthalpies\n(<italic>Q</italic>\n<sub>st</sub>) of CO<sub>2</sub> are counted from\nthe adsorption\ndata at 273 and 298 K by using the Clausius\u2013Clapeyron equation\nto quantitatively assess the binding strengths between CO<sub>2</sub> and the frameworks (see the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.6b14051/suppl_file/am6b14051_si_001.pdf\">Supporting Information</ext-link>).

What\u2019s more, the DFT calculations were\nalso provided to further confirm the probable position of CO<sub>2</sub> in the pores. A specific spatial possibility distribution can be\nexhibited in <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.6b14051/suppl_file/am6b14051_si_001.pdf\">Figure S9</ext-link> and , which illustrate the tendency\nof particles after equilibrium. On the direction of <italic>b</italic> and <italic>c</italic>, there was an obvious difference between\ntwo MOFs. For <bold>1</bold>, the position of CO<sub>2</sub> was mainly\ninfluenced by the acylamino and metal-cluster jointly. After amination,\nthe molecules of CO<sub>2</sub> begin to adsorb parallel with the\nplane of acylaminos for the existence of these two groups on both\nsides. Besides, the specific spatial possibility distribution increased\nnear the amino.

The PXRD patterns of 1 and 1-NH2 match quite well with the simulated ones of 1 and 1-NH2 from the single-crystal-structure analyses, showing not only the similarity in structures of 1 and 1-NH2 but also the phase purity of as synthesized samples (). The thermal stabilities of 1 and 1-NH2 were also investigated under N2 atmosphere from room temperature to 800 \u00b0C with a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min (Figure S6). As showed in Figure S6, the 1 and 1-NH2 have the similar thermal stability. A weight loss from 147 to 211 \u00b0C was observed, which can be attributed to the loss of the DMA solvent and lattice water molecules. The TGA results further indicate that, after removal of guest molecules, 1 and 1-NH2 exhibit relatively high thermal stability up to 300 \u00b0C with certain structural robustness.\n\nThe CO2, CH4 and N2 adsorption isotherms were measured at 273 and 298 K, showing the completely reversible without hysteresis (a,b). It was shown that at 273 K (1 bar), 1 possesses good CO2 capture with an uptake of 33.6 cm3 g-1(1.5 mmol g-1) while the CH4 and N2 uptakes at 273 K (1 bar) were only 3.9 cm3/g and 1.9 cm3/g, respectively. At 298 K (1 bar), 1 still held the amount of 17.7 cm3 g-1 of CO2 capture while that of CH4 and N2 is quite minimal (2.1 cm3 g-1 and 1.6 cm3 g-1). It is obvious that 1 displayed the better sorption selectivity for CO2 over N2 and CH4, which could be attributed to the open metal sites and the acylamide groups in the channels forming strong quadrupole-quadrupole interaction between 1 and CO2.\n\nMoreover, in order to further improve the sorption selectivity for CO2, the pores in 1 were modified with amine group to give 1-NH2. The result showed that 1-NH2 displayed a much higher uptake of CO2 at 273 K, 1 bar (49.3 cm3 g-1, 2.2 mmol g-1) with a less uptake of CH4 and N2 (4.0 cm3 g-1 and 2.0 cm3 g-1, respectively). Also at 298 K, 1 bar, the 1-NH2 showed better adsorption of CO2 than 1 (b). To further investigate the CO2 selectivity, the separation selectivities of CO2 versus CH4 (50/50 mol ratios) and N2 (15/85 mol ratios) at room temperature were calculated up to 100 kPa using the ideal adsorption solution theory (IAST) based method (c and Figure S12 in the Supporting Information). For 1, the selectivity of CO2/N2(CO2/CH4) displayed slight decreasing trend from 84.3 to 60.8 (9.7 to 8.0) in the range of 0-100 kPa. However, the corresponding value was almost improved two times from 157.6 to 104 (17.7 to 12.8) for 1-NH2. These results suggest that the 3-D interpenetrating 1/1-NH2 networks have a strong affinity toward CO2 over N2 and CH4, in which the performance of 1-NH2 from further amino functionalization of 1 is more effective. As we have learned, this performance is much better than some porous organic frameworks and zeolite imidazolate frameworks (Table S4). \n\nMoreover, the dynamic column breakthrough experiments were also performed to test the performance of the materials in the actual adsorption-based separation and purification processes. The mixture of CO2/N2 (15/85, v/v) was flowed over a packed bed of 1 and 1-NH2 solid at 298 K. As shown in a,b, 1 can successfully separate the CO2 from the CO2/N2 (15/85, v/v) mixture while the NH2 functional material, 1-NH2, performs more efficiently. The dynamic CO2 adsorption capacity (0.83 mmol g-1) in 1-NH2 at room temperature is higher than that of 1 (0.41 mmol g-1). The result is similar to the known IRMOF-74-III-CH2NH2 (0.8 mmol g-1) and better than the HKUST-1 (0.45 mmol g-1). When it comes to the mixture of CO2/CH4 (50/50, v/v), the breakthrough occurs at a shorter dimensionless time due to the relatively small separation ratio of CO2/CH4 compared to the CO2/N2 (15/85, v/v) binary mixture.\n\nTo better understand these results, the adsorption enthalpies (Q st) of CO2 are counted from the adsorption data at 273 and 298 K by using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to quantitatively assess the binding strengths between CO2 and the frameworks (see the Supporting Information). As depicted in d, the Q st values at zero coverage, respectively, reach 26.0 and 29.5 kJ mol-1 for 1 and 1-NH2 showing the good interaction of CO2-framework in 1 and 1-NH2. The high Q st value of 1-NH2 is consistent with the fact that the amine group in the pores of MOFs could enhance the interaction of CO2-framework. What's more, the DFT calculations were also provided to further confirm the probable position of CO2 in the pores. A specific spatial possibility distribution can be exhibited in Figure S9 and , which illustrate the tendency of particles after equilibrium. On the direction of b and c, there was an obvious difference between two MOFs. For 1, the position of CO2 was mainly influenced by the acylamino and metal-cluster jointly. After amination, the molecules of CO2 begin to adsorb parallel with the plane of acylaminos for the existence of these two groups on both sides. Besides, the specific spatial possibility distribution increased near the amino. In one pore, because of the symmetry of both acylaminos and amino, CO2 will have a conformation that was completely parallel with their plane. This phenomenon provided an evidence that the amino and acylamide group in 1-NH  2  provide the interaction sites with CO2.\n\nTo further reveal the quenching efficiency of TNP, 1 mM TNP solution was gradually added to a dispersed solution of 1 in DMA and the fluorescence intensity showed decrease gradually (Figures S21 and S22). Besides, the Stern-Volmer equation, (I 0/I) = K sv[A] + 1, was used to calculated the quenching constant (K sv). b shows that the Stern-Volmer plot for TNP is the typically linear at low concentrations, and the values of K sv for TNP of 1 and 1-NH2 are estimated to be 2.5 \u00d7 104 and 4.8 \u00d7 104 M-1, respectively. Likewise, the difference of K sv values also reflects that free NH2 group in channels of MOFs may improve the fluorescence sensitivity of sensing TNP, and its K sv value from Table S6 is higher than most of the reported interpenetrating MOFs. For the practical applications, the detection of TNP was also performed in the medium of water. The same quenching detection efficiency could also be observed and the K sv value of 1 and 1-NH2 both present a slightly decrease which might due to the effect of water polarity on charge transfer (Figures S23-S26). What's more, the detection limits (DL) was calculated based on the equation DL = 3S b/K sv in which the S b is the standard deviations for 10 repeated fluorescent measurement of blank solutions and it came out that the DL of 1 and 1-NH2 were calculated to be 1.3 and 0.29 ppm, respectively (Table S7).", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "400", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "lattice collapse", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "Complex 4", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "155", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "weight loss", "condition": ""}, {"value": "250", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "removal of coordinated solvent molecules", "condition": ""}, {"value": "680", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "consecutive weight loss", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "MOF-XYZ", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "120", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "an initial weight loss", "condition": ""}, {"value": "110 to 280", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "gradual removal of coordinated water molecules", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "35.6", "unit": "wt%", "temperature": "25\u00b0C", "pressure": "1 atm", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "MOF-B", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "27.8", "unit": "wt%", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "1 atm", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["decomposition_temperature", "gas_adsorption"]}, {"idx": 5, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Structures of Ligands\nfor Hhbhdpy, H<sub>2</sub>bdc, and H<sub>2</sub>bdc-NH<sub>2</sub>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"am-2016-14051m_0010.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Structures of Ligands for Hhbhdpy, H2bdc, and H2bdc-NH2    ", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 12, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>In complex <bold>1</bold>, (a) the coordination environment\nof\nCd\u00ad(II) ions.
