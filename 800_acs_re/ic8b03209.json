Moreover, their thermal stability was further investigated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) in an air atmosphere in the temperature range 30-600 \u00b0C (Figure S6). In1 loses 9.29% of weight in the temperature range of 30-170 \u00b0C, which is thought to correspond with the removal of free CH3CN molecules (calcd 9.42%), and the framework can remain stable up to about 310 \u00b0C. In2 shows a weight loss of 10.41% in the range of 30-135 \u00b0C, which is attributed to the departure of guest H2O and CH3CN molecules (calculated 10.88%), followed by a further weight loss at about 200 \u00b0C, corresponding to the collapse of the framework. The higher thermal stability of compound In1 in comparison to that of In2 should be attributed to the stronger rigidity of coordinate bonds in comparison to the hydrogen bond interactions. Finally, the In2O3 phase should be left over for both In1 and In2 with the theoretical values 32.02% for In1 and 25.59% for In2, which are in agreement with the experimental results (found: 31.43% for In1 and 26.03% for In2).\n\nSolid/Liquid State Fluorescence Performance Tests\n\nMetal-organic complexes, especially those constructed from d10 metal centers and organic linkers with large conjugate systems, have been investigated as promising candidates for potential fluorescent materials. The solid-state fluorescence properties of the ligand H2bpydc and as-synthesized In1 and In2 were tested at room temperature (Figure S7). Almost the same excitation peaks for all of them at around 350 nm indicate that the fluorescence emissions of In1 and In2 were both ligand-based. In comparison with the pure ligand H2bpydc, In1 and In2 show obviously stronger fluorescence intensity (emission bands at 479 nm for In1 and 454 nm for In2, respectively), implying that the formation of MOCs could effectively stabilize the radiative transition pathway and ensure the transformation of excited state energy to intense fluorescence emission. In addition, the small changes in the position and shape of their emission peaks might result from the different electronic structures of In1 and In2. Notably, the fluorescence quantum yield (\u03c6) of In1 (13.9%) is slightly lower than that of In2 (15.3%), which might be attributed to the robust \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 stacking interactions in In2, providing greater restriction of the intramolecular rotation to reduce the nonradiative decay process. Moreover, the solid-state fluorescence lifetimes (\u03c4) of In1 and In2 were also measured to be 7.91 and 8.63 ns, respectively. According to the definitions of k r = \u03c6/\u03c4 and k nr = (1 - \u03c6)/\u03c4, radiative (k r) and nonradiative (k nr) decay rate constants were estimated (k r = 1.76 \u00d7 107 s-1 for In1 and 1.77 \u00d7 107 s-1 for In2; k nr = 1.09 \u00d7 108 s-1 for In1 and 9.81 \u00d7 107 s-1 for In2; Table S4). The higher k r/k nr value for In2 in comparison to that of In1 further affirmed the benign effect of robust \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 stacking interactions on intense fluorescence emission. Obviously, such fluorescence dynamics provide very favorable conditions for a deep understanding of the photophysical properties of fluorescent molecules.\n\nEncouraged by the highest quenching efficiency up to 99% of Fe(III) ions for the fluorescence emission of In2, we performed quantitative titration experiments of the suspensions upon incremental addition of Fe(III) ions (5 mM, 5 \u03bcL addition each time) to assess the sensing sensitivity of In2. Obviously, the fluorescence intensity of In2 is heavily dependent on the concentration of Fe(III) ions. As shown in a, with an increase i Fe3+ concentration from 0 to 0.40 mM, the fluorescence emission decreased monotonically. The quenching efficiency can be quantitatively explained by the Stern-Volmer (SV) equation: I 0/I = 1 + K SV[M], where I 0 and I are the fluorescence intensities of pure In2 and Fe(III)-incorporated In2 (Fe(III)@In2) suspensions, respectively, K sv is the quenching constant (M-1), and [M] is the molar concentration of the Fe(III) ions. It was found that the SV plot reveals a great linear correlation (R 2 = 0.9915) in the low concentration range from 0 to 0.10 mM (b) but subsequently deviates from linearity with an upward bend as the concentration is increased and tends to be horizontal over 0.35 mM. On the basis of the experimental data, the K SV value was calculated to be 1.17 \u00d7 104 M-1 for In2. According to the K SV values and the standard error (\u03c3) from three repeated fluorescence measurements of blank solutions, the detection limit (3\u03c3/K SV) was calculated to be 3.95 \u03bcM. In comparison with reported MOC sensors, the sensing sensitivity of In2 toward Fe(III) is relatively good under the same conditions, as shown in Table S5. Moreover, In2 exhibits an extremely short response time with a nearly 70% quenching of emission within 10 s and complete quenching after 40 s, further demonstrating its sensitivity (Figure S13).",
