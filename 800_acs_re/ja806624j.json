Preparation of Benzene-1,3-dicarboxyethylester-5-boronic Acid\n\n1,3-Dimethyl-5-bromobenzene (100.0 g, 0.54 mol) in Et2O (800 mL) was added slowly over 2 h to Mg turnings (16.0 g, 0.66 mol) with vigorous stirring under an Ar atmosphere in the presence of 2 drops of iodomethane. The addition of 1,3-dimethyl-5-bromobenzene was controlled so that the reaction mixture refluxed gently without heating, and after the addition was complete, the reaction mixture was refluxed for 6 h. Under vigorous stirring, the resulting Grignard solution was added dropwise into a solution of trimethyl borate (56.2 g, 0.54 mol) in Et2O (500 mL) cooled to -60 \u00b0C using a dry ice-acetone bath. The mixture was then allowed to warm to room temperature slowly with stirring and carefully poured into 20% H2SO4 (500 mL) and stirred until the two phases were clear. The Et2O layer was separated and the water phase extracted with further aliquots of Et2O (3 portions of 100 mL), after which the ether phases were combined. The Et2O solution was washed with water (3 portions of 100 mL) and dried over MgSO4, and the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation to afford a pale yellow solid (yield: 65.1 g, 82%). The crude product of 1,3-dimethylbenzene-5-boronic acid was used in the following reaction without further purification.\n\n1,3-Dimethylbenzene-5-boronic acid (10.0 g, 0.068 mol) and NaOH (5.0 g, 0.125 mol) were dissolved in tert-butanol/water (v/v = 1:1; 500 mL). The reaction mixture was heated to 50 \u00b0C with stirring, and small portions (ca. 1 g) of KMnO4 (totalling 65.0 g, 0.41 mol) were added to the solution once the purple color of the previous portion had faded. After 50 g of KMnO4 had been added, the reaction temperature was raised to 70 \u00b0C and addition of KMnO4 continued until the purple color persisted for over 3 h, indicating full oxidation of the methyl groups. The excess KMnO4 was reduced by addition of Na2S2O3 (1.00 g) and the solution filtered when hot. The MnO2 cake was washed with excess boiling water (1 L) and the aqueous filtrate concentrated to ~150 mL by evaporation and acidified to pH = 1 using concentrated HCl. The white precipitate of benzene-1,3-dicarboxylic-5-boronic triacid was collected by filtration and washed with cold water and dried in an oven at 100 \u00b0C. The dried white solid was mixed with 98% H2SO4 (5 mL) in anhydrous EtOH (250 mL), and the solution refluxed for 12 h. The resulting solution was concentrated by evaporation to a volume of ~20 mL, whereupon water (250 mL) was added to give the desired product benzene-1,3-dicarboxyethylester-5-boronic acid as a white precipitate which was collected by filtration and washed with water and dried.

At 78 K and 20 bar, the highest total uptake was observed for NOTT-103 with 65.1 mg g<sup>\u22121</sup> H<sub>2</sub>. From NOTT-100 to NOTT-102, the increasing ligand length results in an increase in BET surface area and pore volume, and this accounts for the increase in overall H<sub>2</sub> capacities on going from NOTT-100 to NOTT-102. Thus, the increasing pore volume provides more space to accommodate H<sub>2</sub>; however, the large pore size in NOTT-102 gives a weaker overlap potential from the walls, and a higher pressure is thus required to store the same amount of H<sub>2</sub> in the pores compared to NOTT-100 and NOTT-101. This can be clearly identified from the adsorption data at 1 bar. Thus, increasing the pore size from 6.5 \u00c5 in NOTT-100 to 7.3 \u00c5 in NOTT-101 leads to a small <italic toggle=\"yes\">reduction</italic> of total H<sub>2</sub> uptake at 1 bar from 25.9 to 25.2 mg g<sup>\u22121</sup>, while NOTT-102 with the largest pore size of 8.3 \u00c5 adsorbs only 22.4 mg g<sup>\u22121</sup> H<sub>2</sub>, the lowest value of all samples at 1 bar. Although NOTT-102 has a much larger pore size and volume than NOTT-101, its H<sub>2</sub> uptake does not exceed NOTT-101 until the pressure reaches 20 bar. This demonstrates that larger pore size materials require higher pressure to confine the H<sub>2</sub> into the channels and suggests that there may well be an optimum pore size and dimension to maximize H<sub>2</sub> uptake. Based upon our observations this optimum pore size lies between 7.3 and 8.3 \u00c5. This is further supported by the successful synthesis of NOTT-103 which has a pore size of 8.0 \u00c5 and its H<sub>2</sub> adsorption at 20 bar and 77 K is the highest in the series of complexes. So far only two metal\u2212organic framework compounds (MOF-5 and MOF-177) are known to have such high H<sub>2</sub> uptake at 20 bar. More interestingly, at 1 bar NOTT-103 adsorbed 26.3 mg g<sup>\u22121</sup> H<sub>2</sub>, higher than any other framework showing a total H<sub>2</sub> uptake of more than 6 wt% at 20 bar. Thus, at 1 bar MOF-5  adsorbs 14.2 mg g<sup>\u22121</sup>, MOF-177 13.2 mg g<sup>\u22121</sup>, Mn-BTT 22.8 mg g<sup>\u22121</sup>, and Cu-BTT 23.0 mg g<sup>\u22121</sup>. This suggests that, in addition to using optimum ligand lengths to form intermediate pore size materials, the shape and nature of the central functional group (i.e., the napthyl in NOTT-103) can give a stronger potential overlap to improve adsorption of H<sub>2</sub> at low pressures.</p><p>The high pressure H<sub>2</sub> adsorption measurements revealed that NOTT-103 has the highest excess and total uptake of all the materials studied. The total uptake is given by <italic toggle=\"yes\">n</italic>\n<sub>T</sub> = <italic toggle=\"yes\">n</italic>\n<sub>E</sub> + \u03c1<sub>B</sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">V</italic> where <italic toggle=\"yes\">n</italic>\n<sub>E</sub> is the experimental excess uptake, \u03c1<sub>B</sub> is the bulk density of H<sub>2</sub>, and <italic toggle=\"yes\">V</italic> is the pore volume which at this stage we take to be the volume obtained from the 78 K N<sub>2</sub> isotherms (see ). We used the Redlich\u2212Kwong\u2212Soave equation of state to calculate \u03c1<sub>B</sub>. Up to 20 bar excess H<sub>2</sub> adsorptions obtained by the volumetric method (using the Sievert\u2019s apparatus) and the gravimetric method (using the IGA system) are in very good agreement. The total H<sub>2</sub> adsorption data in Figure  show that NOTT-101 is nearly saturated at 30 bar. The larger pores of NOTT-102 reach saturation at higher pressures, 40 bar, and the higher pore volume allows the total uptake of NOTT-102 to reach 72.0 mg g<sup>\u22121</sup> at 60 bar. These experiments confirm the importance of high pore volume for high H<sub>2</sub> adsorption and are in line with previous theoretical modeling analyses. NOTT-103 has almost the same pore volume and BET surface as NOTT-102 according to their N<sub>2</sub> isotherms, but the total H<sub>2</sub> adsorption on NOTT-103 is 5.8 mg g<sup>\u22121</sup> higher at 60 bar, reaching 77.8 mg g<sup>\u22121</sup>. This derives from and correlates with the higher adsorption heat of NOTT-103 (see below).</p><p>The hydrogen storage capacities for the NOTT series complexes are also very impressive in volumetric units and are among the highest obtained for physisorption materials. At 60 bar and 77 K the total volumetric capacities are 43.1 g L<sup>\u22121</sup> for NOTT-101, 42.3 g L<sup>\u22121</sup> for NOTT-102, and 50.0 g L<sup>\u22121</sup> for NOTT-103, the latter being comparable to MOF-177. Only MOF-5, when prepared and handled under anhydrous conditions, shows a higher volumetric storage capacity (60 g L<sup>\u22121</sup> at 60 bar and 77 K).</p><p>Comparisons of NOTT-100 with NOTT-101, -102, and -103 can give us an insight to the effects of pore size and the presence of additional aromatic rings on the enthalpy of H<sub>2</sub> binding. As shown in Figure a, the adsorption heat of NOTT-100 at zero coverage is 0.9 kJ mol<sup>\u22121</sup> higher than those of NOTT-101 and NOTT-102, and the difference is the same in most loading ranges. Pore size appears to affect the adsorption heat significantly, even at zero surface coverage when the exposed Cu(II) coordination sites are readily accessible to H<sub>2</sub> molecules. The [Cu<sub>12</sub>(L)<sub>12</sub>] and [Cu<sub>24</sub>(L)<sub>6</sub>] cavities in NOTT-100 have approximate spherical diameters of 8.0 and 10.0 \u00c5, respectively. Cavities in this size range can potentially provide more effective profile overlap than the corresponding larger cavities in NOTT-101 and NOTT-102. The spherical cavities [Cu<sub>12</sub>(L)<sub>12</sub>] in NOTT-101 and NOTT-102 have diameters of 12.7 and 13.4 \u00c5, respectively, and the long axes in the ellipsoidal [Cu<sub>24</sub>(L)<sub>6</sub>] cavities of NOTT-101 and NOTT-102 are 19.6 and 32.0 \u00c5, which are too long to allow the potential profiles from opposite ends to overlap efficiently. The adsorption enthalpies obtained are, therefore, strongly correlated to the local structures, i.e., the binding energies of the three adsorption sites which are located at the bottom of the ellipsoid [Cu<sub>24</sub>(L)<sub>6</sub>] cavity as revealed by NPD results. For NOTT-101 and NOTT-102, the local structures are very similar. As shown in Figure a, the adsorption enthalpies of NOTT-101 and NOTT-102 at zero loading are essentially the same taking into account the uncertainties in the measurement, which is consistent with the similarity in their local structure, and their different pore sizes do not noticeably affect the adsorption heat at low H<sub>2</sub> loading. This also suggests that the introduction of phenyl (NOTT-101) or biphenyl groups (NOTT-102) and the significant difference (19.6 vs 32.0 \u00c5) in the shape of their ellipsoid [Cu<sub>24</sub>(L)<sub>6</sub>] cavities has very little impact on the adsorption heat at low coverage. The adsorption heat of NOTT-101 becomes evidently higher than that of NOTT-102 at higher H<sub>2</sub> loading (Figure b). Such a difference (0.5 kJ mol<sup>\u22121</sup> at 0.025 mol g<sup>\u22121</sup> H<sub>2</sub> loading) corresponds to the filling of the middle of the cavities and the differences between the H<sub>2</sub> interactions with the cavities in NOTT-101 and NOTT-102. The adsorption heat of NOTT-100 at high H<sub>2</sub> loading is 1.2 kJ mol<sup>\u22121</sup> higher than that of NOTT-101 and 1.7 kJ mol<sup>\u22121</sup> higher than that of NOTT-102, and this reflects the smaller cavity in NOTT-100 (diameters below 10 \u00c5) and the greater potential overlap in the narrower pore.</p><p>Comparison of NOTT-101 with its structural derivatives NOTT-105, -106, -107 reveals how the heat of adsorption at low loading can be modified by introducing functional groups into the cavities. As shown in Figure a, the heat of adsorption for NOTT-105\u2212107 is significantly higher than that for NOTT-101 and ranges from 5.77 to 6.70 kJ mol<sup>\u22121</sup> at zero coverage and decreases much more rapidly with increasing H<sub>2</sub> loading (Figure b). The highest initial adsorption heat (6.70 kJ mol<sup>\u22121</sup>) was observed for NOTT-107, followed by NOTT-106, suggesting that the four methyl groups contribute toward the increased isosteric heat. It decreases rapidly with increasing loading due to the saturation of the strong adsorption sites. NOTT-106 has an initial adsorption heat of 6.34 kJ mol<sup>\u22121</sup>, 0.57 kJ mol<sup>\u22121</sup> higher than that for NOTT-105. The difference of adsorption heat between NOTT-105, NOTT-106, and NOTT-107 becomes smaller with the increasing H<sub>2</sub> loading, and above 0.0075 mol g<sup>\u22121</sup>, their adsorption enthalpies converge (Figure b). The adsorption enthalpies of NOTT-105, NOTT-106, and NOTT-107 decrease at the same rate from the loading of 0.0075 mol g<sup>\u22121</sup> indicating that H<sub>2</sub>\u2212pore interactions at higher loading are similar and not affected significantly by the introduction of fluorine or methyl substituents. At high loading, H<sub>2</sub>\u2212H<sub>2</sub> interactions may also contribute to changes in enthalpies of adsorption.</p>", "clean_text": "H4L3 \n\n 1H NMR (DMSO-d 6, 300 MHz): 8.49 (t, 1H, J = 1.8 Hz), 8.44 (d, 2H, J = 1.5 Hz), 7.92 (d, 4H, J = 0.9 Hz).

At 78 K and 20 bar, the highest total uptake was observed for NOTT-103 with 65.1 mg g-1 H2. From NOTT-100 to NOTT-102, the increasing ligand length results in an increase in BET surface area and pore volume, and this accounts for the increase in overall H2 capacities on going from NOTT-100 to NOTT-102. Thus, the increasing pore volume provides more space to accommodate H2; however, the large pore size in NOTT-102 gives a weaker overlap potential from the walls, and a higher pressure is thus required to store the same amount of H2 in the pores compared to NOTT-100 and NOTT-101. This can be clearly identified from the adsorption data at 1 bar. Thus, increasing the pore size from 6.5 \u00c5 in NOTT-100 to 7.3 \u00c5 in NOTT-101 leads to a small reduction of total H2 uptake at 1 bar from 25.9 to 25.2 mg g-1, while NOTT-102 with the largest pore size of 8.3 \u00c5 adsorbs only 22.4 mg g-1 H2, the lowest value of all samples at 1 bar. Although NOTT-102 has a much larger pore size and volume than NOTT-101, its H2 uptake does not exceed NOTT-101 until the pressure reaches 20 bar. This demonstrates that larger pore size materials require higher pressure to confine the H2 into the channels and suggests that there may well be an optimum pore size and dimension to maximize H2 uptake. Based upon our observations this optimum pore size lies between 7.3 and 8.3 \u00c5. This is further supported by the successful synthesis of NOTT-103 which has a pore size of 8.0 \u00c5 and its H2 adsorption at 20 bar and 77 K is the highest in the series of complexes. So far only two metal-organic framework compounds (MOF-5 and MOF-177) are known to have such high H2 uptake at 20 bar. More interestingly, at 1 bar NOTT-103 adsorbed 26.3 mg g-1 H2, higher than any other framework showing a total H2 uptake of more than 6 wt% at 20 bar. Thus, at 1 bar MOF-5  adsorbs 14.2 mg g-1, MOF-177 13.2 mg g-1, Mn-BTT 22.8 mg g-1, and Cu-BTT 23.0 mg g-1. This suggests that, in addition to using optimum ligand lengths to form intermediate pore size materials, the shape and nature of the central functional group (i.e., the napthyl in NOTT-103) can give a stronger potential overlap to improve adsorption of H2 at low pressures.\n\nThe high pressure H2 adsorption measurements revealed that NOTT-103 has the highest excess and total uptake of all the materials studied. The total uptake is given by n T = n E + \u03c1B V where n E is the experimental excess uptake, \u03c1B is the bulk density of H2, and V is the pore volume which at this stage we take to be the volume obtained from the 78 K N2 isotherms (see ). We used the Redlich-Kwong-Soave equation of state to calculate \u03c1B. Up to 20 bar excess H2 adsorptions obtained by the volumetric method (using the Sievert's apparatus) and the gravimetric method (using the IGA system) are in very good agreement. The total H2 adsorption data in Figure  show that NOTT-101 is nearly saturated at 30 bar. The larger pores of NOTT-102 reach saturation at higher pressures, 40 bar, and the higher pore volume allows the total uptake of NOTT-102 to reach 72.0 mg g-1 at 60 bar. These experiments confirm the importance of high pore volume for high H2 adsorption and are in line with previous theoretical modeling analyses. NOTT-103 has almost the same pore volume and BET surface as NOTT-102 according to their N2 isotherms, but the total H2 adsorption on NOTT-103 is 5.8 mg g-1 higher at 60 bar, reaching 77.8 mg g-1. This derives from and correlates with the higher adsorption heat of NOTT-103 (see below).\n\nThe hydrogen storage capacities for the NOTT series complexes are also very impressive in volumetric units and are among the highest obtained for physisorption materials. At 60 bar and 77 K the total volumetric capacities are 43.1 g L-1 for NOTT-101, 42.3 g L-1 for NOTT-102, and 50.0 g L-1 for NOTT-103, the latter being comparable to MOF-177. Only MOF-5, when prepared and handled under anhydrous conditions, shows a higher volumetric storage capacity (60 g L-1 at 60 bar and 77 K).\n\nComparisons of NOTT-100 with NOTT-101, -102, and -103 can give us an insight to the effects of pore size and the presence of additional aromatic rings on the enthalpy of H2 binding. As shown in Figure a, the adsorption heat of NOTT-100 at zero coverage is 0.9 kJ mol-1 higher than those of NOTT-101 and NOTT-102, and the difference is the same in most loading ranges. Pore size appears to affect the adsorption heat significantly, even at zero surface coverage when the exposed Cu(II) coordination sites are readily accessible to H2 molecules. The [Cu12(L)12] and [Cu24(L)6] cavities in NOTT-100 have approximate spherical diameters of 8.0 and 10.0 \u00c5, respectively. Cavities in this size range can potentially provide more effective profile overlap than the corresponding larger cavities in NOTT-101 and NOTT-102. The spherical cavities [Cu12(L)12] in NOTT-101 and NOTT-102 have diameters of 12.7 and 13.4 \u00c5, respectively, and the long axes in the ellipsoidal [Cu24(L)6] cavities of NOTT-101 and NOTT-102 are 19.6 and 32.0 \u00c5, which are too long to allow the potential profiles from opposite ends to overlap efficiently. The adsorption enthalpies obtained are, therefore, strongly correlated to the local structures, i.e., the binding energies of the three adsorption sites which are located at the bottom of the ellipsoid [Cu24(L)6] cavity as revealed by NPD results. For NOTT-101 and NOTT-102, the local structures are very similar. As shown in Figure a, the adsorption enthalpies of NOTT-101 and NOTT-102 at zero loading are essentially the same taking into account the uncertainties in the measurement, which is consistent with the similarity in their local structure, and their different pore sizes do not noticeably affect the adsorption heat at low H2 loading. This also suggests that the introduction of phenyl (NOTT-101) or biphenyl groups (NOTT-102) and the significant difference (19.6 vs 32.0 \u00c5) in the shape of their ellipsoid [Cu24(L)6] cavities has very little impact on the adsorption heat at low coverage. The adsorption heat of NOTT-101 becomes evidently higher than that of NOTT-102 at higher H2 loading (Figure b). Such a difference (0.5 kJ mol-1 at 0.025 mol g-1 H2 loading) corresponds to the filling of the middle of the cavities and the differences between the H2 interactions with the cavities in NOTT-101 and NOTT-102. The adsorption heat of NOTT-100 at high H2 loading is 1.2 kJ mol-1 higher than that of NOTT-101 and 1.7 kJ mol-1 higher than that of NOTT-102, and this reflects the smaller cavity in NOTT-100 (diameters below 10 \u00c5) and the greater potential overlap in the narrower pore.\n\nComparison of NOTT-101 with its structural derivatives NOTT-105, -106, -107 reveals how the heat of adsorption at low loading can be modified by introducing functional groups into the cavities. As shown in Figure a, the heat of adsorption for NOTT-105-107 is significantly higher than that for NOTT-101 and ranges from 5.77 to 6.70 kJ mol-1 at zero coverage and decreases much more rapidly with increasing H2 loading (Figure b). The highest initial adsorption heat (6.70 kJ mol-1) was observed for NOTT-107, followed by NOTT-106, suggesting that the four methyl groups contribute toward the increased isosteric heat. It decreases rapidly with increasing loading due to the saturation of the strong adsorption sites. NOTT-106 has an initial adsorption heat of 6.34 kJ mol-1, 0.57 kJ mol-1 higher than that for NOTT-105. The difference of adsorption heat between NOTT-105, NOTT-106, and NOTT-107 becomes smaller with the increasing H2 loading, and above 0.0075 mol g-1, their adsorption enthalpies converge (Figure b). The adsorption enthalpies of NOTT-105, NOTT-106, and NOTT-107 decrease at the same rate from the loading of 0.0075 mol g-1 indicating that H2-pore interactions at higher loading are similar and not affected significantly by the introduction of fluorine or methyl substituents. At high loading, H2-H2 interactions may also contribute to changes in enthalpies of adsorption.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "H4L3", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "C28H18O8"}, "gas adsorption": []}, {"meta": {"name": "H4L6", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "C22H12F2O8"}, "gas adsorption": []}, {"meta": {"name": "H4L9", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "C22H10F4O8"}, "gas adsorption": []}, {"meta": {"name": "H4L10", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "C26H16O8"}, "gas adsorption": []}, {"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "H2", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "H2", "adsorbed amount": "65.1", "unit": "mg g-1", "temperature": "78 K", "pressure": "20 bar", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "H2", "adsorbed amount": "25.9", "unit": "mg g-1", "temperature": "1 bar", "pressure": "", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "H2", "adsorbed amount": "25.2", "unit": "mg g-1", "temperature": "1 bar", "pressure": "", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "H2", "adsorbed amount": "22.4", "unit": "mg g-1", "temperature": "1 bar", "pressure": "", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "H2", "adsorbed amount": "26.3", "unit": "mg g-1", "temperature": "1 bar", "pressure": "", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["gas_adsorption"]}, {"idx": "63, 64, 67", "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<p>Compared to NOTT-100, NOTT-101, and NOTT-102, NOTT-103 has improved performance in both heat of adsorption and total H<sub>2</sub> uptake.
