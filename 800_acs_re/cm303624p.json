The pillaring bipy ligand is statistically disordered. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms were assigned isotropic displacement coefficients U(H) = 1.2U(C), and their coordinates were allowed to ride on their respective atoms. A hydrogen atom attached to a carboxylate group of a HBTC ligand was not included in the least-squares refinement of the structural model, which was performed under geometry restraints and displacement parameter restraints, such as DFIX, DANG, EXYZ, EADP, and ISOR for the disordered bipy sites. The final refinement was performed with modification of the structural factors for the electron densities of the disordered solvent region (2219 \u00c53, 50.9% of the crystal volume) using the SQUEEZE option of the PLATON software package. Refinement of the structure converged at the following final values: R1 = 0.0945 and wR2 = 0.2337 for 5571 reflections for which I > 2\u03c3(I), and R1 = 0.1403 and wR2 = 0.2700 for all 10213 reflections.

The pore dimensions and the specific surfaces areas were accessed using N2 sorption isotherms (Figure ). The N2 uptake amount and the BET specific area of 2a are 251 cm3/g and 930 m2/g, respectively, which are significantly smaller than those of 1a (391 cm3/g and 1540 m2/g, respectively). The complete exchange of the longer pillaring ligand bipy by the shorter pillaring ligand dabco in 2a significantly reduced the pore volume and the specific surface area. The partial exchange of the pillaring ligand by the shorter pillaring ligand dabco in 3a also led to a reduced N2 uptake amount and BET surface area compared with those of 1a. The N2 uptake amount and the BET specific area of 3a were 305 cm3/g and 1150 m2/g, respectively. As expected from the intermediate dimension with the selectively and alternatively exchanged mixed pillars, these values are smaller than those of 1a with pure bipy pillar, but larger than those of 2a with pure dabco pillar. All the activated samples, 1a-3a, are stable in air at least for a couple of hours. The activated samples exposed in air for a couple of hours did not indicate any decrease in N2 uptake amounts. However, an extended exposure in air or a soaking in water led to the complete loss of the crystallinity and the porosity of the activated samples. The activated samples exposed to air for one month or soaked in water overnight did not show any powder diffraction peaks and did not adsorb any N2 at 77 K.\n\nCO2 and CH4 Sorption Behaviors of the MOFs\n\nThe effects of the modified pore dimensions of 2a and 3a compared with that of 1a are reflected in the sorption behavior of CH4 and CO2 (Figures  and  and Figures S4 and S5 of the ). At 195 K, decreased CH4 uptake amounts on 2a and 3a (106 and 118 mg/g, respectively) were observed compared with that of 1a (152 mg/g) (Figure  and Figure S5 of the ). However, at 273 K, slightly increased uptake amounts on 2a and 3a were observed compared with that on 1a (Figure a). The larger CH4 sorption uptake amounts at 273 K on 2a and 3a with the smaller pore volumes compared with that on 1a with the larger pore volume are due to the larger CH4 adsorption enthalpy on 2a and 3a (approximately -21 and -23 kJ/mol, respectively) than that on 1a (approximately -17 kJ/mol) (Figure b). On the other hand, at 273 K, the CH4 uptake amount on 2a (38 mg/g) is similar to that on 3a (34 mg/g) even though the pore volume of 2a is significantly larger than that of 3a.\n\nThe sorption behavior of CO2 on 1a-3a is different from that of CH4 (Figure  and Figure S6 of the ). The qualitative uptake behavior of CO2 on 1a-3a looks similar to that of CH4 (Figure a). Although, at 195 K, the CO2 uptake amount on 3a (447 mg/g) is ~1.2 times that on 2a (379 mg/g), at 273 K the CO2 uptake amount on 3a (261 mg/g) is ~2.2 times that on 2a (119 mg/g), which is caused by the larger CO2 adsorption enthalpy on 3a (approximately -27 kJ/mol) than that on 2a (approximately -22 kJ/mol) (Figure b). Although the pore dimension of 3a based on the N2 uptake amount is larger than that of 2a, the adsorption enthalpy of 3a on CO2 is larger than that of 2a, which is due to the combined effects of the different properties of the pillaring ligands and of the unsaturated metal sites generated from the solvent or monodentate dabco-ligated Ni(II) centers in 3a. The less hydrophobic nature of aromatic bipy and aliphatic dabco as mixed pillaring ligands in 3a compared to that of pure aliphatic dabco in 2a is responsible for the larger adsorption enthalpy of CO2 with a larger polarizability and quadrupole moment on 3a than 2a. In addition, the presence of the unsaturated metal sites is also contributing to the larger adsorption enthalpy of 3a versus that of 2a. At 1 bar and 273 K, the CO2 uptake amount of 1a is 316 mg/g, which is the second largest amount yet reported at this temperature, and almost comparable with the largest amount of SNU-5, 385 mg/g. More interestingly, although the uptake amount of 3a at 1 bar and 273 K is smaller than those of 1a and SNU-5, the uptake amount at ~0.15 bar (which is the partial pressure of CO2 in flue gas), 141 mg/g, is almost twice the uptake amounts of 1a and SNU-5 at the same pressure, 72 and 73 mg/g, respectively.\n\nH2 Sorption Behaviors of the MOFs\n\nAt 77 K, interestingly, although the specific surface areas and the pore dimensions of 2a and 3a were significantly reduced compared with those of 1a, the H2 uptake amounts of 2a and 3a (19.5 and 21.1 mg/g, respectively) were only slightly reduced compared with that of 1a (23.1 mg/g) (Figure a). At 87 K, more interestingly, the H2 uptake amounts of 2a and 3a (16.5 and 16.6 mg/g, respectively) are even slightly larger than that of 1a (16.0 mg/g). The increased adsorption enthalpies of 2a and 3a (Figure b), which come from the more extensive interaction of the adsorbate H2 with the pore surface of the reduced pore dimensions, are responsible for the H2 sorption behaviors. Surprisingly, the H2 adsorption enthalpy of 2a with no unsaturated metal sites is slightly larger than that of 3a with the unsaturated metal sites. The interaction of H2 with the pore surface of 2a with the smaller pore dimension compared with that of 3a with the larger pore dimension is responsible for the slightly larger H2 adsorption enthalpy of 2a versus that of 3a.\n\nThe authors declare no competing financial interest.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nBrunauer-Emmett-Teller\n\n4,4'-bipyridine\n\ntwo-dimensional\n\nthree-dimensional\n\n1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane\n\n N,N'-dimethylformamide\n\nelemental analysis\n\n1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid\n\nmetal-organic frameworks\n\npostsynthetic ligand exchange\n\npostsynthetic modification\n\npowder X-ray diffraction\n\nsingle-crystal-to-single-crystal\n\nReferences\n\nEven though the sample of 1 was activated according to the reported procedure at 150 \u00b0C under vacuum for 12 h, the N2 uptake amount and the BET specific area of 1a are significantly larger than the reported values, 290 cm3/g and 970 m2/g, respectively.
