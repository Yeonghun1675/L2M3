As shown in Figure S3, three isomorphous frameworks showed similar TGA curves; thus we chose compound 1 as a representative to discuss their stability. From room temperature to 265 \u00b0C, a weight loss of 15.33% can be observed, which corresponds to the encapsulated [H3O]+ cations, DMA, and H2O molecules (calcd 15.35%). Subsequently, a complicated weight above 265 \u00b0C was observed, possibly attributed to the collapse of the charge-imbalanced framework. Finally, compound 1 starts to decompose sharply above 521 \u00b0C.\n\nThe powder XRD diffractions of 1, 2, and 3 are shown in Figure S4, and the PXRD patterns are almost identical to the simulated one, indicating that compounds 1, 2, and 3 are pure phases.\n\nLuminescent Behaviors and Sensing Properties\n\nUnder excitation at 295 nm, the emission spectra of compounds 1 and 2 were measured and are recorded in Figure S5. For compound 1, the five characteristic emission peaks of Eu3+ were observed at 538, 592, 614, 653, and 696 nm (Figure S5a), attributed to the transitions of 5D1 \u2192 7F1 and 5D0 \u2192 7F J  (J = 1, 2, 3, 4) from Eu3+ ions, respectively. In terms of Eu3+ transition rules, Eu3+ ions with inversion center sites emit orange light due to the transitions of the magnetic dipole (5D0 \u2192 7F1); on the other hand, Eu3+ ions with noninversion center sites emit red light, due to the transitions of the electric dipole (5D0 \u21927F2). Considering the transitions of 5D0 \u2192 7F1 and 5D0 \u2192 7F2 in compound 1, the stronger 5D0 \u2192 7F2 transition clearly revealed that Eu3+ ions locate at noninversion centers, according to the structural analyses. In 2, two typical emission peaks of Dy3+ were observed, at 480 and 575 nm (), attributed to the 4F9/2 \u2192 6H15/2 and 4F9/2 \u2192 6H13/2 transitions, respectively. \n\nMoreover, the detection limit of 1 as a chemical sensor for detecting Al3+ was also investigated: 4 mg samples of 1 were ground and immersed in a series of concentrations of Al(NO3)3 DMF solutions (1 \u00d7 10-4 to 7 \u00d7 10-4 M) for 5 min. As shown in , the luminescence intensity of samples of 1 gradually decreases as the Al3+ concentration increases, and the luminescence intensity almost completely quenches as Al3+ increases to 7 \u00d7 10-4 M. Additionally, the decrease of emission still could be observed clearly under a 10-4 M Al3+ DMF solution, revealing that the detection limit of 1 as a chemical sensor for sensing Al3+ ions could reach 10-4 M. To further investigate the Al3+ concentration of the quenching effect on compound 1, the luminescence intensity (614 nm) versus Al3+ concentration was charted (Figure S7), which could not be linear fitted to the Stern-Volmer equation, indicating that the quenching mechanisms are caused not only by the dynamic quenching processes. \n\nMagnetic Properties\n\nThe magnetic susceptibilities of the microcrystalline samples of compound 2 were measured in a temperature range from 1.8 to 300 K and under a 1000 Oe field (). Generally, 2S+1L J  states are derived from the split of the 4f n  configuration due to the coexistence of spin-orbit coupling and interelectronic repulsion. Additionally, because of the influence of the weak crystal field perturbation, each 2S+1L J  state would be split into Stark sublevels, and the thermal depopulation of these Stark sublevels would cause the \u03c7M T to gradually decrease with decreasing temperature. As shown in , the value of \u03c7M T for compound 2 is 35.18 cm3\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1 at 300 K, which is close to the calculated value of 35.43 cm3\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1 expected for two and a half noninteracting Dy3+ in the 6H15/2 ground state (g = 4/3). Upon cooling, the value of \u03c7M T decreases gradually to reach 26.69 cm3\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1 at 1.8 K; hence, the essence of the interaction between Dy3+ ions in compound 2 cannot be completely decided, since the \u03c7M T value decreases when the temperature is lowered.\n\nThe investigations of the alternating current (ac) magnetic measurements on 2 were carried out to further explore the dynamics of magnetization ( and S10). The corresponding measurements were performed with a frequency range from 10 to 700 Hz under temperatures between 2 and 15 K. The out-of-phase (\u03c7\") components of the ac magnetic susceptibilities display a clear frequency dependence signal for 2 (), suggesting the presence of SMM behaviors. However, the maxima in \u03c7\" are not found until the temperature is below 2 K. Such results were frequently observed in a number of Dy SMM species. The magnitude of the M\" values in the measured region is less than 10% of \u03c7M', which was observed in reported compounds.
