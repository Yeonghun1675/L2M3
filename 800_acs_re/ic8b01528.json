Inspired by these results, we first introduced a tripodal alcohol ligand H3L to the Lindqvist-type POM cluster and obtained a new hybrid lindqvist-type POM TBA2[V6O13(L)2]\u22c52CH3CN (1). 1 was prepared with high yield through refluxing (TBA)3[H3V10O28] precursor and H3L in dry acetonitrile (Supporting Information). The successful incorporation of L into the POM cluster can be deduced from 1H NMR spectrum (Figure S1). Furthermore, high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) also confirms the identity of 1. The peak at m/z 436.87 is assigned as [V6O13(L)2]2- (1a), which is in good consistent with the theoretical peak of 1a (). It has been reported that tripodal alcohol ligands functionalized Lindqvist-type structures usually possess trans- and cis-configurations. Here, the expected trans-configuration in 1a is proved by SCXRD analysis. The structural analysis indicates that 1 consists of one L-grafted cluster 1a, two TBA cations, and two guest acetonitrile molecules. 1a can be depicted as two deprotonated L ligands capped on two opposite sides of a Lindqvist-type hexavanadate cluster, and the Lindqvist-type anion rests on an inversion center.

Compared with POMs functionalized with flexible pyridyl groups, 1a is preferable for further assembly because its contains rigid pyridyl groups which hold more definite directional information. What's more, the coordination sites of 4-pyridyl groups in 1a are easily accessible without any steric hindrance from the POM cluster, thus providing new opportunities for further assembly with transition metal ions. Using 1 as a precursor to react with CuI under solvothermal conditions, dark brown crystals of 2 were obtained. When silver salts were used to instead CuI under similar conditions, no crystal forms and black silver precipitate was observed, mainly because Ag+ ions are easily reduced under high temperature. Therefore, a mild method was used for the reactions of silver salts with 1.

The ORR onset potential on <bold>2</bold>-modified electrode is ca. 100 mV, while the onset potential\non bare electrode is almost 300 mV, further identifying that <bold>2</bold> is an efficient electrocatalyst for ORR.</p><p>To further evaluate the ORR activity of <bold>2</bold>, linear\nsweep voltammogram (LSV) measurements at a rotating speed of 1600\nrpm were recorded. As shown in b, on bare electrode, the rate of ORR is really sluggish,\nwith an apparent current response at almost \u22120.60 V and a final\nreach of 1.0 mA cm<sup>\u20132</sup> at \u22121.0 V. As for <bold>2</bold>-modified electrode, discernible ORR current is observed\nat above \u22120.25 V and the current quickly increases with the\npotential sweeping to more negative direction, with a final current\ndensity approaching to 2.5 mA cm<sup>\u20132</sup> at \u22121.0\nV. It should be mentioned that there is an almost constantly a huge\npotential gap of ca. 300 mV required for the bare electrode to reach\nthe same current density as that on <bold>2</bold>-modified electrode,\nalthough ORR on both electrodes are far from reaching a diffusion-controlled\nprocess with the appearance of current plateaus. Obviously, the positive\nshift of the potentials further suggests the efficient electrocatalytic\nactivity of <bold>2</bold>. We have also investigated the number of\nelectrons transferred (<italic>n</italic>) per O<sub>2</sub> molecule\non <bold>2</bold> during the ORR process based on the disk and ring\ncurrents recorded on <bold>2</bold>-modified RRDE (b).

Every 1a anion acts as a linear bridge to join two neighboring Cu+ ions, and the Cu-Cu distance is about 2.09 nm. Such linkage between tetrahedral Cu+ ions and linear 1a anions lead to the creation of a 3D anionic framework with diamond topology (c and S2). It is noteworthy that Hill and co-workers made the first Lindqvist-type POM-based cluster organic framework Tb[V6O13{(OCH2)3C(NH2CH2C6H4-4-CO2)}{(OCH2)3C(NHCH2-C6H4-4-CO2)}2] (Tb1). However, an auxiliary ligand 4,4-bis(pyridine-N-oxide) is indispensable in their assembly process for the formation of the framework structure. Comparatively, no additional auxiliary ligand is needed during the formation of the framework of 2. The size of tetragonal channels based on opposite atoms and polyhedra in 2 is about 2.43 \u00d7 4.24 nm2. The whole size of the diamondoid cage is 5.88 \u00d7 4.21 nm2, and the inner diameter is about 3.04 nm (d). Such extremely porous characteristic gives rise to 6-fold interpenetration of six symmetry-related frameworks (e). Although the final structure is 6-fold interpenetrated, there is still a large irregular channels with size of about 0.90 \u00d7 0.90 nm2 in the ab plane. The disordered TBA cations and solvent molecules which play the role of charge balancing and framework stabilization occupied those approximate nanoscale channels. PLATON calculation indicates that the total empty volume of the 6-fold interpenetrated anionic framework is 1764.8 \u00c53, corresponding to 41.2% of the total crystal volume (4287.0 \u00c53).\n\nCrystal Structural Description of 3 \n\nSCXRD analysis revealed that 3 crystallizes in the centrosymmetric space group R3\u0305 and exhibits a 3D structure. There are half a Ag+ ion and half a [V6O13(L)2]2- cluster in the asymmetric unit. Different from Cu+ ion in 2, the Ag+ ion in 3 has a square-planar geometry and is surrounded by two nitrogen atoms from two pyridyl groups and two bridge oxygen atoms of two Linqvist-type clusters (a). The Ag-N and Ag-O bond distances are 2.174(5) and 2.811(5) \u00c5, respectively. In 3, the Ag+ ions are linked by [V6O13(L)2]2- polyanions to give rise to an infinite 1D cluster chain with Ag-Ag distance of 2.13 nm (a). The most intriguing structural feature in 3 is further assembly of these 1D cluster chains. Three discrete chains are aligned in a crossed mode to generate a unique layer containing a three-membered window in the ab plane (Figure S3). The adjoining layer is rotated by 60\u00b0 along the vertical axis in the center of the three-membered window, giving rise to a larger six-membered hole and a smaller three-membered hole along the c axis (b,c and S4). Furthermore, the adjacent layers are interconnected by Ag-O bonds of two intersected chains from different layers, resulting in the formation of a 3D open framework with two kinds of channels with smaller triangular and large hexagonal shapes (d). As is well known, such structure is not common in cluster organic framework materials. The size of the larger hexagonal channel is about 1.52 nm. The total potential accessible volume of the framework is about 50.6% based on PLATON calculation, which is a slightly higher than that of 2.\n\nPXRD Patterns, Thermalgravimetric Analysis, and IR Spectra\n\nIn powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) of 2, the good consistence between the experimental pattern of the as-synthesized sample and the simulated pattern based on SCXRD result indicates the phase purity of 2 (). Thermogravimetric analysis of 2 exhibits a weight loss of 7.83% from 30 to 200 \u00b0C approximately corresponding to the removal of free DEF molecules (calcd 7.38%, Figure S5). Variable-temperature PXRD patterns prove that 2 can keep its crystallinity up to 230 \u00b0C (), which is superior than that of Tb1 (decomposition above 200 \u00b0C). In the IR spectra of 1 and 2 (Figure S6), the typical vibrational peaks of V-Ot and V-Ob (Ot, terminal oxo, and Ob, bridge oxo) on the Lindqvist-type skeleton are situated at 1016-856 cm-1 and 810-700 cm-1, respectively. The characteristic stretching vibrations of TBA cations can be found at 1370-1460 and 3059-2844 cm-1. \n\nElectrocatalytic Study\n\nConsidering rich redox chemistry with stable redox states and multiple electron transfer steps of POM, as well as particular oxygen reduction activity of the Cu-N x  moiety, we investigated the electrocatalytic activity of 2 using oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells as a model reaction. The test was conducted in 0.2 M neutral phosphate-buffered solution (pH 7.0) by using 2-modified RRDE as the working electrode. PXRD patterns (Figure S7) proved that 2 is stable in neutral phosphate-buffered solution. As depicted in a, clearly different from the cases in N2-saturated electrolyte, cyclic voltammograms (CV) recorded on 2-modified electrode and bare electrode (i.e., no 2 modification) in O2-saturated electrolyte exhibit steep rise in the cathodic oxygen reduction current. The ORR current on 2-modified electrode is significantly larger across the whole potential range than that on bare electrode, indicating 2 is beneficial for ORR. The ORR onset potential on 2-modified electrode is ca. 100 mV, while the onset potential on bare electrode is almost 300 mV, further identifying that 2 is an efficient electrocatalyst for ORR.\n\nTo further evaluate the ORR activity of 2, linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) measurements at a rotating speed of 1600 rpm were recorded. As shown in b, on bare electrode, the rate of ORR is really sluggish, with an apparent current response at almost -0.60 V and a final reach of 1.0 mA cm-2 at -1.0 V. As for 2-modified electrode, discernible ORR current is observed at above -0.25 V and the current quickly increases with the potential sweeping to more negative direction, with a final current density approaching to 2.5 mA cm-2 at -1.0 V. It should be mentioned that there is an almost constantly a huge potential gap of ca. 300 mV required for the bare electrode to reach the same current density as that on 2-modified electrode, although ORR on both electrodes are far from reaching a diffusion-controlled process with the appearance of current plateaus. Obviously, the positive shift of the potentials further suggests the efficient electrocatalytic activity of 2. We have also investigated the number of electrons transferred (n) per O2 molecule on 2 during the ORR process based on the disk and ring currents recorded on 2-modified RRDE (b). As illustrated in c, an average value of 3.46 in a wide range of potentials from -0.25 to -1.0 V is determined, and the corresponding HO2 - yield is only at 20-30%, demonstrating a highly desired four-electron-dominant ORR pathway on 2-modified RRDE, which is very close to the theoretical value for ideal one-step direct reduction of O2 with high selectivity for H2O production. Although the mechanism underlying the nearly four-electron electrocatalytic reduction of O2 on 2 still remains to be investigated in our future studies, the above results may shed some light on the design and synthesis of POM-based ORR electrocatalysts with more superior activity.\n\nThe stability of 2 under catalytic conditions was further tested with chronoamperometric measurements. As depicted in d, the current-time (i-t) curve for 2-modified electrode at the constant potential of -0.8 V exhibits a small attenuation and high current retention (>95%) after a nearly 10 h of durability test. Furthermore, the LSV curve on 2-modified electrode measured after the durability test shows very little deviation from the one measured before the durability test. These promising results strongly conclude that 2 is also a highly robust ORR catalyst in the natural media.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "2", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "crystal system":
