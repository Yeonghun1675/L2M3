The luminescent intensity of the MgII-ion-incorporated 3a is enhanced rapidly until a 0.003 mol/L Mg(NO3)2 solution was added. This is probably due to free MgII cation being coordinated to the Hmimda ligand within the MOF and causing an energy transition to the TbIII ion, enhancing the luminescence in the range of 0-6 \u00d7 10 -4 mol/L. Remarkably, the intensity increases linearly with the concentration of added Mg(NO3)2, as illustrated in Figure S17 in the Supporting Information. The sensing efficiency can be quantitatively treated with the Stern-Volmer (SV) equation expressed as I 0/I - 1 = K SV[M], in which I and I 0 are the luminescence intensities of the samples after and before the incorporation of Mg(NO3)2 and [M] presents the concentration of Mg(NO3)2. A linear SV relationship for nitrobenzene is observed at low concentrations. K SV is the enhancement efficiency, which was calculated as 1.81 \u00d7 103. The detection limit calculated using the criteria of 3\u03c3 is 1.38 \u00d7 10-5 mol/L. The electronic communication between the MgII cation and mixed ligands was encouraged by chelation of the bipy ligand with MgII and thus enhancement of the fluorescence, allowing trace amounts of MgII to be detected. This obvious enhancement could be ascribed to the chelation-enhanced fluorescence effect. The luminescence intensity and PXRD of the recycled 3b are well consistent with the simulated data from 3a and that after two runs were performed, indicating that framework 3a remains intact (Figure S9b in the Supporting Information). Second, upon the addition of CuII ions [using Cu(NO3)2], the TbIII characteristic 5D4 \u2192 7F5 transition intensity maximum at ca. 549 nm is involved. The intensity decreased sharply upon the addition of 0.001 mol/L CuII, and the intensity continually decreased with more Cu(NO3)2 solution being added, as illustrated in Figure S18 in the Supporting Information. This may have arisen from the CuII ion entering the porosity coordinated to the weak binding of pyridyl N atoms with CuII, and the antenna effect of the Hmimda and bipy linkers can be reduced, leading to luminescence quenching of TbIII and Hmimda ligands, forming the luminescent CuII moiety, and enhancing the luminescence originating from ligand-to-ligand charge transfer.

This is close to the internationally\npure white-light CIE chromaticity coordinates (0.333, 0.333). The\nsinglet-state energy (1\u03c0\u03c0*) level of [Zn<sub>6</sub>(bipy)<sub>2</sub>(Hmimda)<sub>7</sub>] is estimated by referencing its absorbance\nedge, which is 25000 cm<sup>\u20131</sup> (400 nm; Figure S10a in\nthe <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b02851/suppl_file/ic6b02851_si_007.pdf\">Supporting Information</ext-link>).

Therefore, it is easily understandable that energy transfer from\n[Zn<sub>6</sub>(bipy)<sub>2</sub>(Hmimda)<sub>7</sub>] to Tb<sup>III</sup> is sufficient, whereas that to Eu<sup>III</sup> is incomplete, and\nthe mechanism on the energy transition process is illuminated in Figure\nS16 in the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b02851/suppl_file/ic6b02851_si_007.pdf\">Supporting Information</ext-link>.\n</p>", "clean_text": "After the hypothetical removal of guest water molecules, the total potential solvent-accessible void is found for this 3D noninterpentrating framework of 1 to be 1966.6 \u00c53 per cell volume (accounts for 21.5% of the total unit cell system), calculated using the PLATON program, while for the Tb-Zn MOF 3, the total potential solvent-accessible volume is 2117.0 \u00c53, which accounts for 23.2% per unit cell volume of 9124.7 \u00c53. The most outstanding structural feature of 1 is that the different arrangements of armed ribbon chains. A pair of one-end-coordinated bipy ligands act as rods that thread the [Zn6Mimda6] ring from the adjacent ribbon chains, resulting in the existence of 3D pseudorotaxane character. This kind of 3D polyrotaxane structure is exceedingly rare to observe. Both Nd1 and Nd2 are 3-connected nodes, Zn1 and Zn2 are 3-connected nodes, the Mimda ligand exhibits 3- and 4-connected nodes, and the whole structure is a 3,4-connected (4.82)(4.83.92) (6.8.9)2 (6.92) (83) topology, which presents a new topology. Notably, the YbIII MOF 5 is slightly different from the others, and this compound is based on two kinds of heteronuclear cluster cages, as displayed in Figure S6 in the Supporting Information.\n\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA; see Figure S7 and S8 in the Supporting Information) indicates that 3 exhibits an initial mass loss of 6.0% in the temperature range of 250-300 \u00b0C, corresponding to the release of coordination and free water molecules (calculated 5.9%). According the TGA and EA (Table S4 in the Supporting Information) results, dehydrated samples 3a were easily obtained by heating the as-synthesized sample 3 at 70 \u00b0C in a vacuum for 80 min to produce a new guest-free phase, {[Tb3Zn6(bipy2)2(Hmimda)7]} n  (3a). It is thermally stable up to 350 \u00b0C, and a similar process was performed to afford 2a. The phase purities of bulk materials 1-5 were independently confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and the slight difference between the simulated and experimental patterns may be due to variation in the preferred orientation of the powder samples. As illustrated in Figure S9 in the Supporting Information. The pattern of the guest-free phase [Tb3Zn6(bipy2)2(Hmimda)7] n  (3a) is almost identical with that of the as-synthesized 3, indicating that the basic 3D framework is retained. Before further luminescent sensing investigation, a porosity luminescent study of 3a was performed by measuring the iodine uptake. The MOF 3 was immersed in a dichloromethane (DCM) saturated solution of iodine for a certain length of time and dried to obtain 3b after 6 h and 3c after 20 h. The PXRD pattern of 3b is slightly different from that of 3a, indicating that structural changes occur in response to the absorption of guest molecules. The I2 release experiment is also investigated by immersing the sample 3c-I2 in pure CH2Cl2 and replacing CH2Cl2 (4 mL) per 1 h after 2 days to recover 3, followed by luminescence measurements for samples 3a-I2 and 3b after being immersed in pure CH2Cl2 for different lengths of time, as shown in . However, as can be seen, the process of adsorption and release of I2 is quasi-reversible.\n\nSpectroscopic Studies and Photophysical Properties\n\nThe PL spectra of 2 and 3 at room temperature are described in  and S10-S12 in the Supporting Information, respectively. The spectra of 2 (red) display the characteristic emissions of EuIII ions originating from 5D0 \u2192 7F J  (J = 0, 1, 2,3, 4) at 582, 594, 616, 652, and 702 nm with CIE coordinates of (0.403, 0.434) (Figure S11 in the Supporting Information). The weak emission at 460 nm may have originated from the ligand, which means that ligand-to-metal charge transfer is not in effect for the EuIII MOF. As shown in  (blue), polymer 3 exhibits characteristic emission peaks at 492, 548, 586, and 621 nm, which are assignable to 5D4 \u2192 7F J  (J = 6, 5, 4, 3) transitions of the TbIII ion, respectively. The spectrum shows a dominant green-light emission at ca. 550 nm due to the 5D4 \u2192 7F5 transition (Figure S12 in the Supporting Information), which is attributed to a magnetic-dipole-induced transition. \n\nLanthanide luminescence lifetimes were measured at 549 nm for Tb and 616 nm for EuIII recorded at ambient temperature and were up to 603 and 764 \u03bcs long (Figure S13 in the Supporting Information). The luminescence is measured for samples 3a-I2 and 3b after being immersed in pure CH2Cl2 for different lengths of time, and the morphology/color and emission spectra are shown in  and S14 in the Supporting Information. The intensity decreases with the time immersed in an iodine solution, until the characteristic emission peak disappeared after 40 h. The quenched fluorescence is due to the heavy-atom effect of iodide or an aggregation-induced new emission (Figure S15 in the Supporting Information). The intrinsic porosities of luminescent MOFs allow them to adsorb and release guest molecules via modification of the approaches and to provide a platform for specific luminescent recognition of targets due to host-guest interactions. Considering that both the Hmimda and bipy ligands were incorporated, which can sensitize EuIII and TbIII simultaneously, the color of the emission can be tuned with the in situ doping of different Ln ions, and the production of white light should be achievable with the right combination of Ln ions in appropriate molar ratios. In order to explore the luminescent properties of EuIII and TbIII compounds, a series of mixed-lanthanide-contained complexes {[Eu3x Tb3(1-x)Zn6(bipy)2(Hmimda)7]\u22c5mH2O} n  (x = 1, 0.8, 0.6, 0.45, 0.2, 0.1, 0) are developed (see the experimentsl details in the Supporting Information). The spectroscopic properties of the mixed-lanthanide complexes are investigated (a). From 2a to 3a, with the increasing quality of TbIII being in situ doped emission spectra (\u03bbex = 363 nm), the characteristic peaks of TbIII 5D4 \u2192 7F2 and 5D4 \u2192 7F5 (548 nm) are enhanced gradually, corresponding to a decrease of the emission intensity of 5D0 \u2192 7F2 of EuIII (616 nm). As expected, the variation trends of the CIE coordinates are similar to those for two groups of mixing components. As shown in b, points a and e represent the CIE coordinates of MOFs 2a and 3a, respectively, while points b-d represent the CIE coordinates for Eu-Tb mixed components, which change from (0.403, 0.344) to (0.243, 0.402). White-light emission is realized by the EuIII ion in situ doped into the TbIII framework. This reveals that the emission color of the doped materials can be finely tuned by varying the doping ratio, as depicted in Table S4 in the Supporting Information, and white-light emission of the doped material with a molar ratio at x = 0.45, compound [Eu1.35Tb1.65Zn6(bipy)2(Hmimda)7] n , was obtained at CIE chromaticity coordinates (0.331, 0.342) (Table S5 in the Supporting Information) at an excitation wavelength of 363 nm. This is close to the internationally pure white-light CIE chromaticity coordinates (0.333, 0.333). The singlet-state energy (1\u03c0\u03c0*) level of [Zn6(bipy)2(Hmimda)7] is estimated by referencing its absorbance edge, which is 25000 cm-1 (400 nm; Figure S10a in the Supporting Information). The triplet (T1) energy levels were calculated by referring to the lower-wavelength emission peak of the corresponding phosphorescence spectrum of the GdIII complex, which is 20600 cm-1 (478 nm; Figure S10b in the Supporting Information). Therefore, it is easily understandable that energy transfer from [Zn6(bipy)2(Hmimda)7] to TbIII is sufficient, whereas that to EuIII is incomplete, and the mechanism on the energy transition process is illuminated in Figure S16 in the Supporting Information.

Initially, different concentrations of Mg\u00ad(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> were introduced into the MOFs (excited at 307 nm), and their\nliquid-state photoluminescent spectra were investigated in a DMF suspension.\nAs can be seen in , upon excitation (\u03bb<sub>ex</sub> = 307 nm), with titration\nof a 2 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20135</sup> mol/L Mg\u00ad(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> solution in DMF, the responding luminescence spectrum still\nshows four characteristic emission peaks of the Tb<sup>III</sup> ion\nand the emission intensity peaks of <bold>3a</bold> at both 491 and\n549 nm increased gradually. Herein, only the highest emission peak\nat 549 nm was monitored under the perturbation of various ions. The\nluminescent intensity of the Mg<sup>II</sup>-ion-incorporated <bold>3a</bold> is enhanced rapidly until a 0.003 mol/L Mg\u00ad(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> solution was added. This is probably due to free Mg<sup>II</sup> cation being coordinated to the Hmimda ligand within the\nMOF and causing an energy transition to the Tb<sup>III</sup> ion,\nenhancing the luminescence in the range of 0\u20136 \u00d7 10 <sup>\u20134</sup> mol/L. Remarkably, the intensity increases linearly\nwith the concentration of added Mg\u00ad(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, as\nillustrated in Figure S17 in the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b02851/suppl_file/ic6b02851_si_007.pdf\">Supporting Information</ext-link>.

The detection limit calculated\nusing the criteria of 3\u03c3 is 1.38 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20135</sup> mol/L. The electronic communication between the Mg<sup>II</sup> cation\nand mixed ligands was encouraged by chelation of the bipy ligand with\nMg<sup>II</sup> and thus enhancement of the fluorescence, allowing\ntrace amounts of Mg<sup>II</sup> to be detected. This obvious enhancement\ncould be ascribed to the chelation-enhanced fluorescence effect. The luminescence intensity and PXRD of the recycled <bold>3b</bold> are well consistent with the simulated data from <bold>3a</bold> and that after two runs were performed, indicating that framework <bold>3a</bold> remains intact (Figure S9b in the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b02851/suppl_file/ic6b02851_si_007.pdf\">Supporting Information</ext-link>). Second, upon the addition of Cu<sup>II</sup> ions\n[using Cu\u00ad(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>], the Tb<sup>III</sup> characteristic <sup>5</sup>D<sub>4</sub> \u2192 <sup>7</sup>F<sub>5</sub> transition\nintensity maximum at ca. 549 nm is involved. The intensity decreased\nsharply upon the addition of 0.001 mol/L Cu<sup>II</sup>, and the\nintensity continually decreased with more Cu\u00ad(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> solution being added, as illustrated in Figure S18 in the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b02851/suppl_file/ic6b02851_si_007.pdf\">Supporting Information</ext-link>. This may have arisen\nfrom the Cu<sup>II</sup> ion entering the porosity coordinated to\nthe weak binding of pyridyl N atoms with Cu<sup>II</sup>, and the\nantenna effect of the Hmimda and bipy linkers can be reduced, leading\nto luminescence quenching of Tb<sup>III</sup> and Hmimda ligands,\nforming the luminescent Cu<sup>II</sup> moiety, and enhancing the\nluminescence originating from ligand-to-ligand charge transfer.\n</p><p>To further examine the potential\nof <bold>3a</bold> for the sensing of pollutant anions, the fluorescent\nproperties were measured using the water-polluting sources KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and K<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>, added in\na NH<sub>3</sub>\u00b7H<sub>2</sub>O\u2013NH<sub>4</sub>Cl-buffered\nsolution (pH 7.4) at room temperature (\u03bb<sub>ex</sub> = 310\nnm).

The luminescent sensing properties\nprobably depend on the hydrogen anions involved. As for K<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>, upon continuous addition, the\nluminescent intensity dropped gradually. The distinction is due to\nvariation of the acid radical\u2013anion interaction with polymer <bold>3</bold>, as displayed in Figure S25 in the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b02851/suppl_file/ic6b02851_si_007.pdf\">Supporting Information</ext-link>. The nonlinear nature of the plot of the analytes\nmay be ascribed to self-absorption or an energy-transfer process. Moreover, the emission intensity based on the\ncharacteristic <sup>5</sup>D<sub>4</sub> \u2192 <sup>7</sup>F<sub>5</sub> emission in chloroform gradually decreased with increasing\nDCM introduction, as shown in Figure S23 in the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b02851/suppl_file/ic6b02851_si_007.pdf\">Supporting Information</ext-link>. While emission line maxima at 549\nand 623 nm of Tb<sup>III</sup> disappeared and the MOF materials had\ntwo broad bands from 330 to 380 nm, a peak maximum at 360 nm was progressively\naugmented, ascribed to the effect of organic DCM. When the concentration\nwas 7.23 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20133</sup> mol/L, the band at 360 nm was\nvery strong, which originated from the DCM solvent rather than the\ncharacteristic Tb<sup>III</sup> emission, and the <sup>5</sup>D<sub>4</sub> \u2192 <sup>7</sup>F<sub>5</sub> emission was significantly\nquenched because of a nonradiative transition. This demonstrates tunable\nor switchable fluorescence signals in response to the different solvates.\nAs in methanol and water, presumably this is because the small molecules\ncould enter the coordination spheres of the Tb<sup>III</sup> ions\nwithin the framework, which effectively quenches the luminescence\nintensities. The luminescence intensity\nof the sample in DCM and water is lower, may arise from the intensity,\n is often quenched by the nonradiative exchange of the electronic\nenergy of Ln<sup>III</sup> to the high vibration modes of O\u2013H\nand C\u2013H bonding, especially for the former, leaving just a\nstrong emission originating from the Hmimda ligand.</p><p>Uric acid\n(UA) can reflect the physiological and biochemical properties and\nmeasurement of UA\u2019s constituents, which is important to humans\nas biological exposure indices. To evaluate\nthe sensitivity of <bold>3a</bold> toward UA, fluorescence titration\nexperiments were carried out. It is observed that the <sup>5</sup>D<sub>4</sub> \u2192 <sup>7</sup>F<sub>5</sub> transition emission\nintensity of <bold>3a</bold> gradually decreased, and then it gave\na sharp reduction immediately after UA addition and leveled off in\n11 min, showing the fast response rate of this method. With increasing\nUA concentration, the results clearly show that it induced a remarkable\nreduction (ca. 90%) in the luminescence intensity of the characteristic\nemission maximum at 549 nm by adding 4 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20133</sup> mol/L UA, as shown in . A good linear relationship (<italic>R</italic> =\n0.982) is found between the emission intensity ratios (<italic>I</italic>\n<sub>0</sub>/<italic>I</italic> \u2013 1) and the logarithm of\nthe UA concentration over the range from 1 to 7 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20133</sup> mol/L (<italic>I</italic>\n<sub>0</sub>/<italic>I</italic> \u2013\n1 = 2.427 + 1.736 log [UA]). The limit of detection determined following\nthe IUPAC criteria is 2.71 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20135</sup> mol/L. The quenching effect of UA on the luminescence\nintensity of Tb<sup>III</sup> has been further confirmed by emission\nlifetime studies of doped MOF <bold>3a</bold>.

The mechanism for the quenching effects of UA on Tb<sup>III</sup> can be described as follows: (i) The shortened emission lifetime\nindicates that UA weakly coordinates to Tb<sup>III</sup> sites. This\nincreases nonradiative deactivation through the vibrations of UA (such\nas N\u2013H) and leads to a reduction of luminescence. (ii) Because\nof the intermolecular interactions between the bipy ligand and UA,\nhydrogen bonds, and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking, the energy absorbed\nby the bipy ligand can be transferred to the UA molecules, which will\ndecrease the efficiency of intersystem crossing and thus reduce the\nefficiency of ligand-to-Tb<sup>III</sup> energy transfer. This is confirmed by UV\u2013vis absorption spectra (Figure S10c\nin the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b02851/suppl_file/ic6b02851_si_007.pdf\">Supporting Information</ext-link>). The significant\nfluorescence change is attributed to inhibition of the \u201cantenna\u201d\neffect between the ligand and Tb<sup>III</sup> ion with the addition\nof organic acid molecules.\n</p>", "clean_text": "Sensing Properties\n\nAs fluorescent sensors, MOFs provide several advantages over conventional fluorophores, due to their high surface areas, which may allow more analyte molecules to come into contact with the MOF surface, imparting them with the capability of transducing interactions to detectable changes in fluorescence. Considering pores in the MOF 3 and aiming at investigating the effect of inorganic ions on the luminescence of 3a, we tried to examine the potential ion sensing of 3a. Sample 3a was treated with a NaNO3 solution, and then the PXRD patterns for samples of 3 both pre- and postimmersed in a DMF/DCM solution were determined and compared. The results show that there are no obvious effects on the luminescence of 3a treated by NaNO3. The PXRD patterns illustrate good solvent stability following treatment by a DCM solution, and the nearly identical PXRD pattern of sample 3 indicates that the Ln MOF remained intact in solution (Figure S9 in the Supporting Information). Initially, different concentrations of Mg(NO3)2 were introduced into the MOFs (excited at 307 nm), and their liquid-state photoluminescent spectra were investigated in a DMF suspension. As can be seen in , upon excitation (\u03bbex = 307 nm), with titration of a 2 \u00d7 10-5 mol/L Mg(NO3)2 solution in DMF, the responding luminescence spectrum still shows four characteristic emission peaks of the TbIII ion and the emission intensity peaks of 3a at both 491 and 549 nm increased gradually. Herein, only the highest emission peak at 549 nm was monitored under the perturbation of various ions. The luminescent intensity of the MgII-ion-incorporated 3a is enhanced rapidly until a 0.003 mol/L Mg(NO3)2 solution was added. This is probably due to free MgII cation being coordinated to the Hmimda ligand within the MOF and causing an energy transition to the TbIII ion, enhancing the luminescence in the range of 0-6 \u00d7 10 -4 mol/L. Remarkably, the intensity increases linearly with the concentration of added Mg(NO3)2, as illustrated in Figure S17 in the Supporting Information. The sensing efficiency can be quantitatively treated with the Stern-Volmer (SV) equation expressed as I 0/I - 1 = K SV[M], in which I and I 0 are the luminescence intensities of the samples after and before the incorporation of Mg(NO3)2 and [M] presents the concentration of Mg(NO3)2. A linear SV relationship for nitrobenzene is observed at low concentrations. K SV is the enhancement efficiency, which was calculated as 1.81 \u00d7 103. The detection limit calculated using the criteria of 3\u03c3 is 1.38 \u00d7 10-5 mol/L. The electronic communication between the MgII cation and mixed ligands was encouraged by chelation of the bipy ligand with MgII and thus enhancement of the fluorescence, allowing trace amounts of MgII to be detected. This obvious enhancement could be ascribed to the chelation-enhanced fluorescence effect. The luminescence intensity and PXRD of the recycled 3b are well consistent with the simulated data from 3a and that after two runs were performed, indicating that framework 3a remains intact (Figure S9b in the Supporting Information). Second, upon the addition of CuII ions [using Cu(NO3)2], the TbIII characteristic 5D4 \u2192 7F5 transition intensity maximum at ca. 549 nm is involved. The intensity decreased sharply upon the addition of 0.001 mol/L CuII, and the intensity continually decreased with more Cu(NO3)2 solution being added, as illustrated in Figure S18 in the Supporting Information. This may have arisen from the CuII ion entering the porosity coordinated to the weak binding of pyridyl N atoms with CuII, and the antenna effect of the Hmimda and bipy linkers can be reduced, leading to luminescence quenching of TbIII and Hmimda ligands, forming the luminescent CuII moiety, and enhancing the luminescence originating from ligand-to-ligand charge transfer. \n\nTo further examine the potential of 3a for the sensing of pollutant anions, the fluorescent properties were measured using the water-polluting sources KH2PO4 and K2CrO4, added in a NH3\u22c5H2O-NH4Cl-buffered solution (pH 7.4) at room temperature (\u03bbex = 310 nm). Apparently, the intensity of 5D4 \u2192 7F5 (549 nm) increases sharply up to 2 \u00d7 10-3 mol/L dihydrogen phosphate (from sodium dihydrogen phosphate), while the rapid emission intensity sharply decreased when more dihydrogen phosphate was introduced, as illustrated in Figure S24 in the Supporting Information, and an emission maximum appeared at 470 nm. The luminescent sensing properties probably depend on the hydrogen anions involved. As for K2CrO4, upon continuous addition, the luminescent intensity dropped gradually. The distinction is due to variation of the acid radical-anion interaction with polymer 3, as displayed in Figure S25 in the Supporting Information. The nonlinear nature of the plot of the analytes may be ascribed to self-absorption or an energy-transfer process. Moreover, the emission intensity based on the characteristic 5D4 \u2192 7F5 emission in chloroform gradually decreased with increasing DCM introduction, as shown in Figure S23 in the Supporting Information. While emission line maxima at 549 and 623 nm of TbIII disappeared and the MOF materials had two broad bands from 330 to 380 nm, a peak maximum at 360 nm was progressively augmented, ascribed to the effect of organic DCM. When the concentration was 7.23 \u00d7 10-3 mol/L, the band at 360 nm was very strong, which originated from the DCM solvent rather than the characteristic TbIII emission, and the 5D4 \u2192 7F5 emission was significantly quenched because of a nonradiative transition. This demonstrates tunable or switchable fluorescence signals in response to the different solvates. As in methanol and water, presumably this is because the small molecules could enter the coordination spheres of the TbIII ions within the framework, which effectively quenches the luminescence intensities. The luminescence intensity of the sample in DCM and water is lower, may arise from the intensity,  is often quenched by the nonradiative exchange of the electronic energy of LnIII to the high vibration modes of O-H and C-H bonding, especially for the former, leaving just a strong emission originating from the Hmimda ligand.\n\nUric acid (UA) can reflect the physiological and biochemical properties and measurement of UA's constituents, which is important to humans as biological exposure indices. To evaluate the sensitivity of 3a toward UA, fluorescence titration experiments were carried out. It is observed that the 5D4 \u2192 7F5 transition emission intensity of 3a gradually decreased, and then it gave a sharp reduction immediately after UA addition and leveled off in 11 min, showing the fast response rate of this method. With increasing UA concentration, the results clearly show that it induced a remarkable reduction (ca. 90%) in the luminescence intensity of the characteristic emission maximum at 549 nm by adding 4 \u00d7 10-3 mol/L UA, as shown in . A good linear relationship (R = 0.982) is found between the emission intensity ratios (I 0/I - 1) and the logarithm of the UA concentration over the range from 1 to 7 \u00d7 10-3 mol/L (I 0/I - 1 = 2.427 + 1.736 log [UA]). The limit of detection determined following the IUPAC criteria is 2.71 \u00d7 10-5 mol/L. The quenching effect of UA on the luminescence intensity of TbIII has been further confirmed by emission lifetime studies of doped MOF 3a. As shown in Figure S13 in the Supporting Information, the lifetime is greatly reduced from 764 to 603 \u03bcs in the presence of 3% UA. In addition to steady-state luminescence measurements, the lifetimes of the emission are also measured for the Tb-MOF 3a and 3a-doped UA systems. The data analyzed in terms of a biexponential decay model with recovered parameters are reported in Table S6 in the Supporting Information. The mechanism for the quenching effects of UA on TbIII can be described as follows: (i) The shortened emission lifetime indicates that UA weakly coordinates to TbIII sites. This increases nonradiative deactivation through the vibrations of UA (such as N-H) and leads to a reduction of luminescence. (ii) Because of the intermolecular interactions between the bipy ligand and UA, hydrogen bonds, and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, the energy absorbed by the bipy ligand can be transferred to the UA molecules, which will decrease the efficiency of intersystem crossing and thus reduce the efficiency of ligand-to-TbIII energy transfer. This is confirmed by UV-vis absorption spectra (Figure S10c in the Supporting Information). The significant fluorescence change is attributed to inhibition of the \"antenna\" effect between the ligand and TbIII ion with the addition of organic acid molecules.
