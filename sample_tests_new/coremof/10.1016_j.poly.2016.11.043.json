The Ag-S bond distances are almost identical (2.5185(6) and 2.5186(6)\u00c5, respectively), falling in the range of Ag-S bond lengths reported in the literature , yet the Ag-O bonds are slightly different in length (2.357(3) and 2.533(3)\u00c5). Propagation of the repeat structure unit along the silver(II) centers results in the formation of an infinite 2-D coordination network which is composed of 20-membered macrocycles containing two ligand units, two silver(I) centers and two bridging nitrato-O atoms (b and c). In each macrocycle, the Ag\u22efAg nonbonding distance between two silver(I) centers bonded to the same ligand is approximately 10.7\u00c5, while the O-bridged Ag\u22efAg nonbonding distance is approximately 4.6\u00c5. The two phenyl rings of ligands in the macrocycle are arranged in an edge-to-face fashion and thus effective C-H\u22ef\u03c0 interaction is observed between the rings. The C-H\u22ef \u03c0 (centroid) distance as illustrated in c is as short as ca. 2.85\u00c5 (c). It is worth mentioning that previously a silver(I) perchlorate complex based on a similar thioether ligand, 1,3-bis(phenylthiomethyl)benzene has been reported, where a structurally related grid-like network was observed . However, the structure of the repeating macrocyclic motif in this network is essentially distinct with that of 1. In the structure reported previously , the silver centers are bridged by two oxygen atoms of the perchlorate anion, and the Ag-O bond distances are relatively longer (2.556(10) and 2.719(4)\u00c5, respectively), indicating weaker bonding interactions. In addition, the phenyl rings in the macrocycle are arranged in a face-to-face mode by \u03c0\u22ef\u03c0 stacking interaction (the distance between two aromatic planes is ca. 3.5\u00c5), in sharp contrast to the C-H\u22ef\u03c0 interactions found in 1 (c)", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 24, "type": "text", "classification": ["property"], "content": "<ce:section-title id=\"st070\">Synthesis and characterization of Ag<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>(L)(BF<ce:inf loc=\"post\">4</ce:inf>)<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>\u00b70.25(H<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>O) (<ce:bold>2</ce:bold>)</ce:section-title><ce:para id=\"p0060\" view=\"all\">The critical role played by the counter anion (nitrate ion) in bridging the silver(I) center to form the 2-D network in <ce:bold>1</ce:bold> encouraged us to investigate the impact of other silver salts on the self-assembly process.

Compound 2 undergoes a small weight loss (ca. 4.2%) between 50 and 147\u00b0C, accounting for the loss of water molecules from the 3D silver framework of 2 (ca. 1.5 H2O per unit, calcd. 4.4%), which is in agreement with the data of elemental analysis, indicating 2 is hygroscopic in the air. 2 is then decomposed upon heating to 196\u00b0C by removing the ligand molecules. Compound 3 proves to be less thermostable and begins to decompose gradually from 163\u00b0C. In contrast, 4 is stable up to 212\u00b0C at which temperature a slight weight loss (ca. 1.25%) is observed, consistent with the removal of two coordinated CH3CN molecules per structural unit (calcd. 1.3%).

Relevant bond parameters around metal centers are summarized in \n<ce:float-anchor refid=\"t0010\"></ce:float-anchor>. The silver(I) center is tetracoordinate with two sulfur atoms from symmetry-related ligands and two oxygen atoms of the bridging nitrate ions, being in a slightly distorted tetrahedral environment. The Ag-S bond distances are almost identical (2.5185(6) and 2.5186(6)<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>\u00c5, respectively), falling in the range of Ag\u2013S bond lengths reported in the literature , yet the Ag\u2013O bonds are slightly different in length (2.357(3) and 2.533(3)<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>\u00c5). Propagation of the repeat structure unit along the silver(II) centers results in the formation of an infinite 2-D coordination network which is composed of 20-membered macrocycles containing two ligand units, two silver(I) centers and two bridging nitrato-O atoms (b\u00a0and\u00a0c). In each macrocycle, the Ag\u22efAg nonbonding distance between two silver(I) centers bonded to the same ligand is approximately 10.7<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>\u00c5, while the O-bridged Ag\u22efAg nonbonding distance is approximately 4.6<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>\u00c5. The two phenyl rings of ligands in the macrocycle are arranged in an edge-to-face fashion and thus effective C\u2013H\u22ef\u03c0 interaction is observed between the rings. The C\u2013H\u22ef \u03c0 (centroid) distance as illustrated in c is as short as ca. 2.85<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>\u00c5 (c). It is worth mentioning that previously a silver(I) perchlorate complex based on a similar thioether ligand, 1,3-bis(phenylthiomethyl)benzene has been reported, where a structurally related grid-like network was observed . However, the structure of the repeating macrocyclic motif in this network is essentially distinct with that of <ce:bold>1</ce:bold>. In the structure reported previously , the silver centers are bridged by two oxygen atoms of the perchlorate anion, and the Ag\u2013O bond distances are relatively longer (2.556(10) and 2.719(4)<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>\u00c5, respectively), indicating weaker bonding interactions. In addition, the phenyl rings in the macrocycle are arranged in a face-to-face mode by \u03c0\u22ef\u03c0 stacking interaction (the distance between two aromatic planes is ca. 3.5<ce:hsp sp=\"0.25\"></ce:hsp>\u00c5), in sharp contrast to the C\u2013H\u22ef\u03c0 interactions found in <ce:bold>1</ce:bold> (c)</ce:para><ce:section-title id=\"st070\">Synthesis and characterization of Ag<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>(L)(BF<ce:inf loc=\"post\">4</ce:inf>)<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>\u00b70.25(H<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>O) (<ce:bold>2</ce:bold>)</ce:section-title><ce:para id=\"p0060\" view=\"all\">The critical role played by the counter anion (nitrate ion) in bridging the silver(I) center to form the 2-D network in <ce:bold>1</ce:bold> encouraged us to investigate the impact of other silver salts on the self-assembly process.
