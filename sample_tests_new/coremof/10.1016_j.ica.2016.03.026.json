Consequently, the final MOFs exhibit ordinary thermal stability, which can be attributed to the anion nature of the frameworks strengthened by charge-balancing guest cations.</ce:para>", "clean_text": "Description of the crystal structures\n\nSingle crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that 1 shows a 3D anionic framework with three kinds of polynuclear clusters and 1D channels occupied by unknown charge-balancing guest solvent molecules. Complex 1 crystallizes in triclinic space group   P   1   \u00af    . There are four Cu(II) ions, two bptca4 - ligands, one OH- group and two coordinated water molecules in the asymmetric coordination unit of 1 ( a). Presumably, [(CH3)2NH2]+ decomposed from DMA and H3O+ might be inclosed into the channels to fit the global charge balance of anionic framework . The guest cations are severely disordered, but whether the confirmation of the guest solvent molecules has little influence on the exploration of main frameworks. Cu1, Cu2 and Cu3 centers are five-coordinated, residing in a distorted square pyramidal geometry. Each Cu1 atom is linked with four oxygen atoms of four carboxylate groups from four bptca4 - linkers and one coordinated water molecule (Cu1-O 1.958(6)-2.144(9)\u00c5), Cu2 center is coordinated to four oxygen atoms from four separate bptca4 - ligands and one oxygen atom of one hydroxyl (Cu2-O 1.916(5)-2.216(6)\u00c5), while Cu3 is bridged by three carboxylate oxygen atoms of three bptca4- anions and two hydroxyl oxygen atoms (Cu3-O 1.923(6)-2.207(6)\u00c5). Cu4 adopts a distorted octahedral geometry defined by five oxygen atoms of four carboxylate groups from three bptca4 - linkers in consideration of a nonnegligible Cu4-O16 interaction of 2.653\u00c5 and one coordinate water ligand (Cu4-O 1.925(6)-2.384(5)\u00c5). For the two independent bptca4 - anions in 1, one exhibits a \u03bc8-bridging mode with the carboxylate groups in \u03bc2-\u03b71:\u03b71 and \u03bc2-\u03b71:\u03b72 fashions ( a). The other tetracarboxylate features a \u03bc6-bridging mode with \u03bc2-\u03b71:\u03b71 and \u03bc1-\u03b71:\u03b70 fashions of carboxylate groups (b).\n\nSignificantly, the assembly of paddle-wheel clusters as rigid SBUs with polytopic carboxylate linkers could generate rigid porous frameworks with permanent porosity and open functionalized metal sites . As a consequence, Cu2(COO)4 paddle-wheel subunits for different orientations act as square SBUs linking 1D chains to provide a 3D framework with regular 1D parallelogram nanosized channels along the a axis (grid dimensions of 10.55\u00d79.42\u00c52, calculated from the neighboring Cu(II) atoms) (c). Furthermore, two different kinds of square apertures are present. The first one is polar owing to the effective pore surface occupied mainly by uncoordinate carboxylate oxygen atoms and coordinate aqua molecules, and the twisted benzenyl groups of bptca4 - take up the second hydrophobic channels. When seen from a  \u00d7  b plane, the framework structure of 1 is closely compact (), and thus, show noninterpenetrating single network, which depends on the asymmetrical nature of the bptca4 - molecules possessing long molecular backbone to stretch space and large metal clusters laterally to block the interpenetrating aisles. A calculation using platon revealed that the potential total solvent-accessible void space of the framework is 1072.2\u00c53, corresponding to the 43.5% of the unit cell volume 2466.1\u00c53 . From the view of topology, the SBUs of dimer [Cu2O2] subunit and tetranuclear [Cu4(\u03bc 3-OH)2] cluster serve as 4-connected and 8-connected nodes, respectively. The bptca4 - ligands show two kinds of coordinated modes, but both of them link four copper-based SBUs, and thus, the organic ligands act as 4-connected nodes. So, the whole 3D framework adopts an unusual tetranodal (4,4,4,8)-connected net with the point symbol of {412.812.104}{43.83}4{46}{86} (d).\n\nExcept for the molar ratio variation of reactants, the assembly of the same starting materials as those of 1 offers the other complex 2, in which single Cu2(COO)4 paddle-wheel supporting layers interacting with mononuclear Cu(bptca)2 result in a 3D anionic nanoporous framework. Single-crystal XRD analysis makes clear that complex 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system with space group C2/c. As shown in  a, the asymmetric unit of 2 contains three Cu2+ ions, two deprotoned bptca4- ligands, three coordinated water molecules. Fitting the global charge balance of anionic nanoporous framework 2 from the same starting materials as 1 should be similar to that of complex 1. Each Cu(II) center is five-coordinated mode of distorted square pyramidal geometry. Cu1 is coordinated by four oxygen atoms from four carboxylate groups of four isophthalate moieties of four bptca4- (Cu1-O 1.957(5)-1.987(5)\u00c5) and one oxygen atom from one terminal water (Cu1-O9 2.134(6)\u00c5). Whereas, the mononuclear Cu2 is surrounded by four oxygen atoms of four monodentate carboxylates from two phthalates of two bptca4 - in the equatorial positions (Cu2-O 1.869(9)-1.951(9)\u00c5), and the axial oxygen atom of coordinated aqua molecule (Cu2-O10 2.408(18)\u00c5). The bptca4 - ligand exhibits a unique \u03bc5-bridging mode with the carboxylate groups in \u03bc2-\u03b71:\u03b71 and \u03bc1-\u03b71:\u03b70 fashions (c).\n\nTwo adjacent Cu1 ions are linked by four bidentate bridging carboxylate groups to afford a paddle-wheel Cu2(COO)4 subunit with the Cu-Cu distance of 2.6391(18)\u00c5, being shorter than that of complex 1 (b). Due to the different coordination environment of Cu atoms, the respective paddle-wheel units in 1 and 2, also display some differences, which each bptca4 - ligand of 1 connects only one paddle-wheel cluster and the cation of 2 does two paddle-wheel clusters. The Cu2(COO)4 fragment gets ulteriorly incorporation with four neighboring paddle-wheel clusters via two bidentate bridging carboxylate groups of isophthalate to give a single Cu2(COO)4 paddle-wheel supporting grid structure. These 2D layers are linked in the third direction by folded mononuclear Cu(bptc)2 units, to form a 3D nanoporous framework (c). Similar to 1, the framework accommodates infinite open 1D quadrate channels with 11.20\u00c5 caliber (Cu\u2026Cu distance). Meanwhile, the closely arrangement of the components on the a  \u00d7  b or a  \u00d7  c plane suggests the noninterpenetrating features of the final framework (). The potential solvent-accessible volume of 2 is 2129.5\u00c53, which corresponds to 42.7% of unit cell volume 4991.0\u00c53 according to the platon calculations . From the viewpoint of the network topology, 2 possesses 3D (4,4)-connected binodal frameworks with {42.84} PtS-type topology, by considering each mononuclear Cu(bptca)2 and paddle-wheel Cu2(COO)4 clusters as 4-connected nodes (d).\n\nComplexes 1 and 2 are air-stable and can retain the crystalline integrity at ambient conditions. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) show that 1 and 2 have onset weight losses within the temperature range of 125-240\u00b0C and 110-205\u00b0C, respectively ( ). The first steps of TGA curves correspond to the release of the unknown disordered solvent molecules. Almost without pause, the host MOFs begin to decompose continuously until the final products CuO obtained. Consequently, the final MOFs exhibit ordinary thermal stability, which can be attributed to the anion nature of the frameworks strengthened by charge-balancing guest cations.", "data": ["This model's maximum context length is 4097 tokens.
