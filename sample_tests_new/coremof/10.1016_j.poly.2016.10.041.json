So the emissions of these compounds are neither metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) nor ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) in nature. However, for the three complexes, the main emission peak is highly red-shifted by 33, 60 and 38nm, respectively, relative to the free H3TZI ligand. It is known that the replacement of the hydrogen proton by Zn2+ or Cd2+ ions decreases the \u03c0\u2217 \u2192\u03c0 or \u03c0\u2217 \u2192n gap of the carboxylate ligands, resulting in a red shift of the emission peaks . So the emission can be assigned to the chelation of the ligands to the central metals.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "H3TZI ligand", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "H3TZI"}, "spectrum": [{"value":
