X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that complex 1 exhibits a 3D porous framework featuring a (4,8)-connected sqc net. The solid sample of 1 exhibits strong green fluorescence in the visible region upon excitation at 354nm. The fine grinding particles of 1 dispersed in ethanol shows good sensitivity for picric acid (PA), which can be reused at least five times for detecting PA. The good sensitivity and recyclability of 1 make it a potential fluorescent sensor for explosives detection.\n\nResults and discussion\n\nCrystal structure description\n\nSingle-crystal X-ray analysis indicates that complex 1 crystallizes in the tetragonal crystal system with space group of I-42d. The asymmetrical unit of 1 contains half a Tb3+ ion, half a L4- ligand and the negative charge of the framework is balanced by half a (CH3)2NH2 + cation, which was generated from the decomposed DMF. As shown in  a, the central Tb3+ ion possesses an eight-coordinated square antiprism coordination mode, being linked to eight carboxylate oxygen atoms from six different L4- ligands. The Tb-O bond lengths vary from 2.260(5) to 2.501(5)\u00c5, which are similar to those reported in other Tb3+ compounds . Two symmetry related Tb3+ ions are bridged by carboxylate groups to form a noteworthy paddle-wheel [Tb2(CO2)8] subunit with a Tb\u22efTb distance of 4.2938(17)\u00c5. Each L4- anion coordinates to 8 Tb3+ ions, with carboxylate groups adopting two kinds of coordination modes: \u03bc2-\u03b71:\u03b71 and \u03bc1-\u03b71:\u03b71 mode. Finally, each binuclear [Tb2(CO2)8] subunit are linked by L4- anions to generate a fascinating 3D porous framework (b). The solvent-accessible volume in 1 is 2206.6\u00c53, equal to 36.6% of the volume of the unit cell calculated by the platon program. Topological analysis was carried out to get insight into the structure . As shown in c, the L4- anions and the [Tb2(CO2)8] subunits can be defined as 4- and 8-connected nodes, respectively. Therefore, complex 1 can be simplified as a (4,8)-connected sqc network with Schl\u00e4fli symbol of (43 \u22c563)(412 \u22c5616).\n\nPXRD patterns and thermogravimetric analysis\n\nThe PXRD patterns of complex 1 are shown in . The peak positions of experimental PXRD patterns are in line with the simulated ones, showing the pure phase of the complex. As shown in , the TGA of 1 shows an initial gradual weight loss of 6.12% between 85\u00b0C and 242\u00b0C, corresponding to the release of (CH3)2NH2 + (Calc.: 6.62%). The compound 1 begins to decompose upon further heating and underwent a rapid weight loss of 64.58% from 242\u00b0C to 563\u00b0C, corresponding to the destruction of the H4L ligands.\n\nFluorescence behaviors and sensing properties\n\nThe lanthanide coordination polymers have displayed excellent fluorescence properties in the respect of their high color purity . So we investigated the ligand-assisted fluorescence properties of powder samples of the lanthanide complex at room temperature (). When excited at 354nm, complex 1 exhibits the characteristic emissions of Tb3+ ions in the visible region. The emission peaks at 490, 545, 585 and 621nm can be attributed to the transitions of 5D4-7F J  (J =6, 5, 4, 3) from Tb3+ ions, respectively. Upon excitation at 243nm, the free H4L ligand exhibits a luminescent emission band at 388nm, which is attributed to the \u03c0-\u03c0\u2217 transition. The luminescent investigation on the complex 1 suggests that H4L ligand may sensitize the luminescence of Tb3+ ions. The strongest emission in 1 appears at 545nm which can be easily observed as bright green light by the naked eye. The remarkable fluorescence offers the possibility of 1 being a fluorescence sensor.\n\nThe sensing properties of 1 for NB prompted us to investigate its application in detecting different electron-withdrawing nitroaromatics. The nitroaromatics such as 4-nitrotoulene (4-NT), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT), 4-ni-tro-chlorobenzene (4-NC), 2,4-dinitro-chlorobenzene (2,4-DNC), picric acid (PA) were added to a suspension of 1 (3mg) in ethanol (3mL). As shown in  , upon the addition of the same amount of nitroaromatics ([nitroaromatics]=10ppm), different degrees of fluorescence quenching of the suspension were tested. The descending order of quenching efficiency was PA>4-NC>2,4-DNC>2,4-DNT>4-NT>NB.

The fluorescent intensity obviously decreased with the increasing PA concentration ( ). When the concentration of PA reached 30ppm, the quenching efficiency was 94.2% for 1, which is higher than or comparable to other MOF sensors, polymeric nanocomposites  and conjugated polymer sensors for PA. For example, the micrometer-sized MOF [Cd3(TPT)2(DMF)2]\u22c5(H2O)0.5 show an 82.5% quenching efficiency for PA . The quenching efficiency of the reported carbon and silver nanocomposites for PA is 99% . The fluorescence intensity of conjugated polymer flim only decreased with 77-fold fluorescence quenching .
