It is worth noting that two furan rings of two \u03bc4-\u03b72, \u03b71, \u03b71, \u03b71- FDAs (top in b) occupy the opposite positions with \u03c0-\u03c0 conjugation, in which stacking h (center-plane) is in 3.276~3.290\u00c5, d(center-center) in 3.4645~3.367\u00c5 and shift r (displacement of two centers) in 1.1272~0.7159\u00c5. However, two furan rings of \u03bc4-\u03b71, \u03b71, \u03b71, \u03b71- FDAs (bottom in b) depart head-to-head from each other with the distance of two oxygens being 4.7954\u00c5. This is owing to \u03b72-O of \u03bc4-\u03b72, \u03b71, \u03b71, \u03b71- FDAs (top in b) which shortens the distance between furan rings. The dihedral angles of three furan rings is close to 120\u00b0 (dihedral angle of two furan rings of two \u03bc4-\u03b72, \u03b71, \u03b71, \u03b71- FDAs in 111.6\u00b0, two furan rings of \u03bc4-\u03b72, \u03b71, \u03b71, \u03b71- FDA and \u03bc4-\u03b71, \u03b71, \u03b71, \u03b71- FDA in 117.1\u00b0 and 113.3\u00b0, which promotes the formation of (6,3) net. The sheets are linked by bpp to 5-c bnn type topology with the Schl\u00e4fli symbol of (46\u22c564) (d). When the framework of MOF material is neutral and no balanced ion exists in the channel, water molecule or solvent often occupy the channel by the H-bond or van der waals force. In this work, water molecule remains in the channel. With the removal of the water, large accessible void is 676.2\u01fa3 about 32.0% of the unit cell volume (2114.9\u01fa3).\n\nOwing to the symmetrical geometry of 2 (Pccn), two sets of structures 3-dimesionally interpenetrate each other, each one of which is reduced to pcu topology with the Zn-dimer as node and FDA/bipy as the connector (b). Although every FDA connects three Zn, FDA acts as two-connector because FDA connects two Zn-dimers. Both sets of structures consist of such a SBU served as octahedral geometry, in which four 2-c FDAs occupy the equatorial plane and two pairs of 2-c bipy molecules respectively locate on the apices (a and b). Weak \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions exist between two bipy molecules of every pair with twist \u03c6 of 26.7\u00b0 and stacking h of 3.379\u00c5. The distances of two Zn-dimers linked by bipy and FDA are 11.405\u00c5 and 11.889\u00c5, respectively. The torsion angle of two furan rings in different set of structure is 25.04\u00b0.\n\nThe thermogravimetric analysis of 1 (in N2) shows a sharp weight loss ranging from 270\u00b0C to 450\u00b0C (52.3%) corresponding to decomposition of FDA and bpp (Fig. S7). This also exhibits the framework stability (only 4% weight loss from room temperature to 270\u00b0C assigned to the structural water). The thermogravimetric analysis of 2 (in N2) shows continuously two-step weight loss (gradual and sharp) ranging from 150\u00b0C to 450\u00b0C (62.8%) corresponding to decomposition of FDA and bipy, which indicates the structural unstability of compound 2 (Fig. S8).\n\nThe gas-storage of MOF is of very interest. In this work, the experiments of gas adsorptions (degassed at 200\u00b0C) indicate that 1 can adsorb CO2 instead of N2, which is attributed to the strong quadrupole interaction of CO2. The CO2 gas-sorption isotherms for compound 1 at 273K indicate that the BET and Langmuir surface area are calculated to be 234.1 and 262.4m2/g, and the median pore diameter calculated by H-K method is 4.6\u00c5.
