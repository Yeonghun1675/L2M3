The latter emission, located at lower energy is due to the bispiperidine diphosphonate ligand, since it is detectable also in the pure bispiperidine diphosphonic solid phase. The other emission, recorded only for 1, is most likely due to a charge transfer (CT) transition from the oxygen atoms of ligands to the Ce4+ ions; Ce3+ ions are produced that relax by emitting UV radiation. The CT nature of the transition is implicitly confirmed by the large Stokes shift (7138cm-1) and the FWHM of the emission band (3480cm-1) .

NaCl, loses all the water molecules in the range 25-150\u00b0C. The initial weight loss (14.3%) can be ascribed to the loss of the eight water molecules (calc. 14.8%)\n\nA plateau is then observed between 170 and 320\u00b0C and it should correspond to the formation of the anhydrous phase.\n\nBetween 320 and 500\u00b0C a second weight loss (calc. 21.3%, obs. 22%) is observed and it corresponds to the combustion of the organic part. The third weight loss of about 7% is observed in 650-780\u00b0C temperature range and it should correspond to the sublimation of the sulfate groups, probably as SO2. \n\nThe plateau observed in the TG curve suggests that the phase stability is retained till 320\u00b0C.\n\nCompound 1, whose absorption spectrum is depicted in Kubelka Munk units in   (black trace), is a dual luminescent material. Upon irradiation with \u03bb <300nm, a strong and narrow band, confined in the UV region, appears. If 1 is excited by wavelengths longer than 300nm, a broad band, included between 400 and 800nm, emerges (see ). The latter emission, located at lower energy is due to the bispiperidine diphosphonate ligand, since it is detectable also in the pure bispiperidine diphosphonic solid phase. The other emission, recorded only for 1, is most likely due to a charge transfer (CT) transition from the oxygen atoms of ligands to the Ce4+ ions; Ce3+ ions are produced that relax by emitting UV radiation. The CT nature of the transition is implicitly confirmed by the large Stokes shift (7138cm-1) and the FWHM of the emission band (3480cm-1) . It gives rise to a peaked band centered at 272nm, as inferred from the shape of the excitation spectrum (blue dashed trace of ).\n\nThe two kinds of emission shown by 1 have different lifetimes.
