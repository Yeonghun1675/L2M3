However, the hydrogen atoms of water solvates can not be located from the difference Fourier maps.</ce:simple-para>", "clean_text": "Both Tb2 and Tb4 clusters are interlinked by L4- to generate a 3D framework ( ). Interestingly, this interlinkage generates elliptic and narrow channels along the b-axis. The elliptic channel has the sizes of 11.7\u00d77.4\u00c52 (excluding van der Walls radii of the atoms) and is hydrophilic due to its effective channel surface surrounded mainly by coordinated water molecules, carboxylate groups and aryl fragments of L4-. While the narrow channel features hydrophobicity because its surface is occupied by the C(CF3)2-units of L4-, moreover, the C(CF3)2-units point to inner of the channel, which induces the small channel sizes of 10.1\u00d73.1\u00c52. Despite of large elliptic channel sizes, 1 remains noninterpenetrated, the reasons should result from the formation of Tb2 and Tb4 clusters, especially the bulky Tb4 cluster can avoid the framework interpenetrated, on the other hand, the CF3 groups of L4- reduce the channel sizes, which is also responsible for noninterpenetrated framework. Upon removing all water molecules, 1 generates a microporous framework containing 21.4% solvent void accessible, which consists of 17.0% hydrophilic void and 4.4% hydrophobic void . Due to hydrophobicity of narrow channels, there are no water accommodated, and the water guests are filled in the hydrophilic channels by hydrogen bond interactions with carboxylate O atoms and aqua ligands. It should be noted that, in comparison with the PXRD of the as-synthesized 1, the PXRD of desolvated 1 exhibits some obvious changes of part peak intensity (Fig. S1), suggesting a slight framework change, which verifies that the fill of water guests in hydrophilic channels is crucial for the framework stability.\n\nTGA shows that 1 releases seven water guests and seven aqua ligands below 200\u00b0C with a total weight loss of 10.0% (calc. 10.7%), following a plateau observed from 200 to 295\u00b0C (Fig. S6). The further heating leads to two residual aqua ligands escaping within 295-360\u00b0C with a weight loss of 1.4% (calc. 1.5%). The high releasing temperature of these two aqua ligands can be attributed to their short Tb-Owater bond lengths of 2.367(6)-2.372(7) \u00c5, on the contrary, the other seven aqua ligands are released under lower temperature arising from their longer Tb-Owater bond lengths of 2.391(6)-2.468(6) \u00c5. Beyond 360\u00b0C, an abrupt weight loss is followed by the departure of L4- up to 620\u00b0C, leaving a residue of Tb4O7 (observ. 32.5%, calc. 31.8%) . The TGA result basically agrees with the formula of 1.\n\nTaking into account the excellent luminescent property of Tb3+-containing compounds, the solid-state luminescence of 1 was investigated at room temperature. Upon excitation at 340nm, 1 exhibits typical Tb3+ ion emission peaks at 488, 544, 583 and 620nm, attributing to the expected sequence of D4 \u2192 7FJ (J =6, 5, 4 and 3) transitions, respectively ( ). The spectrum is dominated by the D4 \u2192 7 F5 transition at 542nm, leading to an intense green luminescence. The splitting for the peak at 583nm is due to the crystal-field splitting . The decay lifetime curve of 1 can be well fitted with single-exponential decay (Fig. S7), giving the lifetime of 1.0ms, which suggests phosphorescence . This value is comparable with those observed in various Tb-MOFs . Noteworthily, the free H4L shows weak solid-state luminescence at 410nm stemming from intraligand \u03c0*\u2192\u03c0 transition, however, no apparent residual H4L-based emission is observed in the emission spectrum of 1, indicating an efficient energy transfer from L4- to the Tb3+ center, which sensitizes the Tb3+ emission to a large extent .\n\nTo estimate the magnetic behavior of 1, the temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility was collected on 1 at temperature range 300-1.8K. As shown in  , at 300K, the \u03c7 mT value of 11.91cm3\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1 is slightly higher than the value of 11.82cm3 Kmol-1 for one magnetically isolated Tb3+ ion, indicating a spot of contribution of the 4f orbital (4f8, J =6, S =3, L =3, g =1.5, 7F6). Lowing the temperature causes a gradually decrease of \u03c7 mT to 7.51cm3 Kmol-1 at 1.8K. The data between 300 and 30K were fitted by Curie-Weiss law to give Curie constant C =12.1cm3 Kmol-1 and Weiss constant \u03b8 =-5.3K. The small negative \u03b8 indicates the weak antiferromagnetic interactions between Tb3+ ions, moreover, this magnetic exchange interactions should be weak because the Tb\u22efTb distances within Tb2 and Tb4 clusters are long.\n\n Crystal data for 1: C57H50F18O40Tb4, M r =2352.65, T =295(2) K, triclinic, space group P\u012b, a =8.1360(7), b =21.3945(18), c =22.8798(19), \u03b1 =82.374(1), \u03b2 =82.746(1), \u03b3 =79.437(1), V =3859.2(6), Z =2, D c =2.025gcm-3, \u03bc =3.758mm-1, R int =0.0333, final R 1 =0.0473, wR 2 =0.1140 for 14792 unique reflections (I \u22652\u03c3(I)), S =1.053.
