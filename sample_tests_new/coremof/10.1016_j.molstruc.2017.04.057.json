For 2, the first loss of 39.34%, occurs between 25 \u00b0C and 150 \u00b0C, corresponding to the loss of three lattice DMF molecules and two L molecules (Calcd 38.49%). The second that occurs between 300\u00b0 and 475\u00b0 are ascribed to the collapse of the framework. The final residual of 9.08% may be the mixture of ZnCO3 and ZnO (Calcd 7.33%). For 3, the first loss, of 9.42%, occurs between 25 \u00b0C and 80 \u00b0C, corresponding to the loss of one lattice DMF molecule (Calcd 9.02%). The second occurs between 130 \u00b0C and 240 \u00b0C, amounting to about 10.09%, corresponding to escape of one lattice DMF molecule (Calcd 9.02%), and the third weight loss between 350 \u00b0C and 500 \u00b0C amounts to about 60.02%, which is ascribed to the collapse of the framework (Calcd 60.35%), and the final residual of 19.37% may be CdCO3 (Calcd 20.84%).\n\nFluorescent properties\n\nIt is known that many d10 metal complexes exhibit luminescence properties. The coordination complexes with the rational selection and design of conjugated organic spacers with metal centers can be efficient for obtaining new luminescent materials . To investigate the luminescence properties of complexes 1-3, the solid-state fluorescent properties of 1-3 as well as the ligand L have been studied at room temperature under the same experimental condition and their emission spectra are given in Supplementary 2 . When excited with 390 nm light, the free L ligand exhibited an emission peak at 470 nm, which originated from ligand internal change transfer. Upon excitation with 390 nm light, complexes 1-3 all display intense photoluminescence, with emission maxima at 474, 440 and 440 nm, respectively. Compared with the free L Ligand, the introduction of Zn(II) and Cd(II) to ligand L led to a weak blue-shift for complexes 2 and 3. On the one hand, because the N atoms coordination to the metal center, the electron transfer to the metal ions and occurs Ligand-to-Metal Charge Transition (LMCT). Moreover, the ligand \u03c0* track as the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the metal d track for the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), the electron transfer when subjected to external excitation, resulting in the maximum absorption wavelength of the compounds blue shift. On the other hand, the differences of the peaks for 1 may be resulted from different coordination environments around Zn(II) and Cd(II) centers . In addition, the high-dimensional structures of complexes 2 and 3 lead to significant enhancement of fluorescence intensity compared to that of the free ligand. The enhancement of fluorescence intensity of complexes 1-3 can be attributed to the following aspects: firstly, anthracene is a kind of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with strong fluorescence emission; secondly, the ligand coordination to the metal center and increase plane conjugated system of ligands, which the intraligand \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* transition occurs more easily; on the other hand, the ligand rigidity enhancement and thus reduces the loss of energy through a radiationless pathway , however, fluorescence enhancement of complexes 1-3.", "data": ["This model's maximum context length is 4097 tokens.
