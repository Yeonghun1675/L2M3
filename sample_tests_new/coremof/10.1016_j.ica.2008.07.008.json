Found: C, 25.45; H, 4.00; O, 46.05; La, 21.05; Na, 3.45%.\n\nSimilar IR spectra have been observed for both compounds. They clearly show vibration bands characteristic of the -(O-C-O)- groups around 1560cm-1 and 1490cm-1 confirming the presence of carboxylate groups.\n\nThermal analysis\n\nThermogravimetric and thermal differential analysis were performed in a platinum crucible under nitrogen atmosphere between room temperature and 1000\u00b0C with a heating rate of 5\u00b0Cmin-1, using a Perkin-Elmer Pyris-Diamond thermal analyzer. At 1000\u00b0C, the gas is switched to oxygen and the temperature is maintained during 1h in order to complete the oxidation.\n\nThermal analysis of compound [LaNa[(C10H4)(COO)4](H2O)7 \u22c54H2O]\u221e \n\nThe thermal behavior of this compound has been studied by thermal analysis (TGA/TDA) and by TDXD (see  ).\n\n(i) First a total dehydration occurs between room temperature and 130\u00b0C leading to an anhydrous compound with chemical formula LaNaC14H4O8. The dehydration is accompanied by a loss of crystallinity. (ii) The resulting powder is stable from 130\u00b0C to 450\u00b0C and does not rehydrate when exposed to moisture. (iii) At last, above 450\u00b0C, the ligand decomposes leading, at high temperature, to the two oxides La2O3 and Na2O.\n\n Anal. Calc. for LaNa[(C10H4)(COO)4](H2O)7, (MW=587.9gmol-1): C, 28.57; H, 3.06; O, 40.83; La, 23.63; Na, 3.91. Found: C, 28.5; H, 3.1; O, 40.83; La, 23.6; Na, 3.9%.\n\nSimilar IR spectra have been observed for both hydrated and partially dehydrated compounds. The partial dehydration has been checked and confirmed by thermogravimetric measurements.\n\nAt last, the partially dehydrated compound reversibly binds water when exposed to moisture.\n\nEstimated porosity of compound [LaNa[(C10H4)(COO)4](H2O)7]\u221e \n\nIn order to evaluate the porosity of [LaNa[(C10H4)(COO)4](H2O)7]\u221e, we have formally removed the crystallization water molecules from the crystal structure of [LaNa[(C10H4)(COO)4](H2O)7 \u22c54H2O]\u221e and applied a computational method  based on Connolly's algorithm . Thanks to this method, the porosity of a partially dehydrated material can be calculated on the basis of its crystal structure. Furthermore, this method allows obtaining the maximal kinetic radius a guest molecule can present for being hosted by the structure. In this case (see  ), it appears that the compound can host molecules with a kinetic radius smaller than 1.5\u00c5, for instance, He (1.3\u00c5) or H2 (1.45\u00c5). The estimated potential porosity, calculated with 1.45\u00c5 as probe sphere radius, is actually 757m2 g-1.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "Zn4O"}, "chemical
