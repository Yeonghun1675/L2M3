The corner-sharing 1D chains are alternately linked together by Cu2 atoms in different directions to generate a 3D open framework (b), which displays rhombic openings with an approximate diameter of 13.7\u00d76.2\u00c5 (point-to-point and not including van der Waals radii) along [010] direction (c). The uncoordinated ammonium ions serve as guest molecules in the channels and are protonated in order to balance the negative charge provided by framework. Excluding the guest molecules, compound 1 has a 3898\u00c53 potential solvent volume estimated by PLATON , accounting for 35.2% of the total cell volume.\n\nSingle crystal X-ray diffraction study reveals that compound 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/c. In the structure of 2, there are two crystallographically independent Cu(I) and Cu(II) ions. The HPyImDC2- anion adopts the same coordination mode as in compound 1 which bridges two Cu(I) ions and one Cu(II) ion. As shown in Fig. S2, the Cu(I) ion, with distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry, is coordinated to two HPyImDC2- anions in a bidentate fashion through N-, O-heterocoordination (Cu1-N1, 1.894(3)\u00c5; Cu1-N2A, 1.888(3)\u00c5; Cu1-O1, 2.534\u00c5; Cu1-O4A, 2.506\u00c5). The Cu(II) ion adopts an octahedral coordination sphere in contrast to the Cu(I) ion. The Cu(II) ion is surrounded by four N atoms from two HPyImDC2- anions, one 1,2-diaminopropane ligand, and two O atoms from two terminal water molecules (Cu2-N4, 2.032\u00c5; Cu2-N3, 2.044\u00c5; Cu2-O1W, 2.533\u00c5). The oxidation states of Cu ions are confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. S3). Furthermore, Cu(I) ions and HPyImDC2- anions are arranged in a line to form 1D chains {-CuI-HPyImDC2--CuI-} (a), and two chains are interconnected by the Cu(II) ions to build a 1D rhombic chains along the [110] direction (b). Inside the chains, \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions exist since the distance between two parallel HPyImDC2- ligands is 3.849\u00c5 (c).\n\nThe thermal stabilities of compounds 1 and 2 are investigated through TGA experiments in the temperature range of 35-800\u00b0C as shown in Fig. S7. An initial weight loss of compound 1 below 150\u00b0C can be attributed to the removal of N, N-dimethylformamide on the surface of the compounds. Upon further heating the organic ligand and the ammonium ions start to decompose and exhibit a weight loss of 73.30% between 165 and 393\u00b0C (calcd: 75.86%). The final product of 25.86% is attributed to the formation of CuO powder.\n\nFor compound 2, the first step weight loss of 3.75% below 273\u00b0C can be attributed to the removal of water molecules (calcd: 4.70%). The second weight loss that occurred from 273 to 462\u00b0C (68.38%) can be attributed to the decomposition of the 1,2-diaminopropane and the HPyImDC2- ligand (calcd: 70.24%).
