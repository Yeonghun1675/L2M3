ZIF-67 (Figure S1a) looks like a diamond dodecahedron, the average side length of which is 200 nm. After calcination at 800 \u00b0C under a N2 atmosphere, a lot of the tube structure could be found on the surface of the diamond dodecahedron particles (a,b), and the nanotube diameter is about 3 nm on average (inset in b). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of the resulting CNT represents two kinds of lattice structures: one with an interplanar spacing of 0.34 nm ascribed to the lattice plane (111) of metallic cobalt (JCPDS 15-0806) and the other one with d = 0.21 nm attributed to the plane (002) of graphitic carbon, which determines the generation of Co@CNT based on the pyrolysis of ZIF-67. The original aminated MIL-53(Al) is irregular-shaped with a size of about 150 nm (Figure S1b). While aminated MIL-53(Al) is synthesized in Co@CNT, as shown in d and S1c,d, lamellar-shaped MIL-53(Al) with an average side length of about 200 nm is observed, and the compact heterostructure is produced between CNT and lamellar-shaped MIL-53(Al). The inset in d illustrates the possible construction of a N-MIL@CNT composite nanostructure. The morphology changes of MIL-53(Al) may be caused by the presence of CNT in the formation of MIL-53(Al); in that case, heterogeneous nucleation instead of homogeneous nucleation may be conducted, and CNT acts as part of the nucleation center. A similar dependence is also reported in the synthesis of ZIF-8 in the presence of CNT, and the spherical-like ZIF-8 with smaller size is ornamented around the CNT sidewall, leading to the creation of a hierarchical pore structure. The elemental composition of N-MIL@CNT is given in Figure S1f, in which there are four elements (Al, N, O, and C), and the relative atomic percentages of C, N, O, and Al are 70.49%, 9.47%, 17.76%, and 2.22%, respectively. The Co cannot be found in the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy profile, indicating that Co may be removed in the construction of N-MIL@CNT due to HCl produced in the corresponding hydrothermal process.\n\nThe representative N2 sorption isotherm and corresponding pore size are depicted in g,h,i. The N2 sorption curves display a combined type I/IV sorption isotherm, implying the existence of both micropores and mesopores in Co@CNT, aminated MIL-53(Al), and N-MIL@CNT. Furthermore, comparing the N2 adsorption-desorption curves of NH2-MIL-53(Al) and N-MIL@CNT, we can find increased micropores and mesopores in N-MIL@CNT, and a distinct H4-type hysteresis loop at p/p 2 of more than 0.45 also indicated stacked pores by the lamellar structure in N-MIL@CNT. According to the corresponding pore-size distribution profile of N-MIL@CNT, there are mesopores centered at 2.5 nm in addition to the micropores. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) values of Co@CNT, aminated MIL-53(Al), and N-MIL@CNT are 311.2, 319.1, and 811.1 m2/g, and the total pore volumes are 0.450, 0.574, and 0.662 cm3/g respectively. It should be noticed that the BET value and pore volume of N-MIL@CNT are both clearly larger than the values of aminated MIL-53 (Al) and Co@CNT, implying increased open channels and pores, which are beneficial for organics adsorption.\n\nTo estimate the theoretical maximum adsorption capacity, the sorption isotherms of the two organics were performed. With regard to a,b, the maximum equilibrium sorption capacities of BPAF are 175 mg/g (Co@CNT), 67 mg/g [aminated MIL-53(Al)], and 270 mg/g (N-MIL@CNT), the values of which for Metribuzin are 85, 64, and 206 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption isotherms of the two organics by ZIF-67 were also measured, and the results are given in Figure S6. The maximum adsorption capacities of both organics are 47 mg/g (BPAF) and 12 mg/g (Metribuzin). Obviously, compared to the single component, N-MIL@CNT represents the excellent enhanced adsorption performance, which may result from the synergistic effect of the large open cavities of CNT and high affinity of aminated MIL-53(Al).\n\nParts c-f of  show the fitting curves replotted according to the Langmuir and Freundlich formulas, and the calculated isotherm constants are illustrated in . The highest correlation coefficients (R 2) and the closer values for the theoretical q max and experimental q e prove that the Langmuir pattern is more applicable for the two organics' adsorption on N-MIL@CNT, and the theoretical q max values are 274 mg/g (BPAF) and 213.2 mg/g (Metribuzin), respectively. These results are larger than the formerly reported adsorption results of BPAF or Metribuzin by other adsorbents. For example, multiwalled CNT and chitosan-modified zeolite can adsorb BPAF with capacities of 88.89 and 26.2 mg/g; Metribuzin was absorbed by switch grass biochar and Mag-H+ with values of 151 and 65 mg/g.\n\nThe fitting results of the sorption isotherm by single aminated MIL-53(Al) and Co@CNT represent the close R 2 by using the two isotherm equations, suggesting that the sorption on aminated MIL-53(Al) and Co@CNT may feature in mixed adsorption behavior, and the theoretical q max values on Co@CNT are 209.2 mg/g (BPAF) and 104.7 mg/g (Metribuzin), much lower than that on N-MIL@CNT.\n\nAs displayed in a, most of the ions except Cu2+ have no significant negative impact on the BPAF adsorption, which can be well retained above 78% of the original value obtained without coexisting ions. The influence of other phenol organics (i.e., phenol, resorcinol, 3-aminophenol) on the BPAF adsorption was also studied to further verify the selectivity. As shown in b, the adsorption capacities are 159.5 mg/g (BPAF), 9.8 mg/g (phenol), 5.9 mg/g (resorcinol), and 11.8 mg/g (3-aminophenol). The excellent adsorption selectivity for BPAF by the as-constructed N-MIL@CNT is well presented, mainly thanks to the high affinity of aminated MIL-53(Al) with BPAF via hydrogen bonding as well as the interface synergy brought by the compact heterostructure. In addition, we also conducted selective adsorption studies on Metribuzin. As presented in Figure S9, the adsorption capacities are 150.0 mg/g (Metribuzin), 15.9 mg/g (Tartrazine), 14.0 mg/g (Acid Blue 90), and 16.2 mg/g (Acid Blue 1). The excellent adsorption selectivity for Metribuzin could be explained by hydrogen bonding between Metribuzin and N-MIL@CNT.\n\nReusability and Stability\n\nN-MIL@CNT can be renewed by washing with ethanol and reapplied in sorption tests. Figure S11 demonstrates the cyclic adsorption capacity of BPAF and Metribuzin by N-MIL@CNT. For example, the removal rates of BPAF within the six cyclic adsorption processes are 93.3%, 93.45%, 93.5%, 91.1%, 91.7%, and 90.8%, and those for Metribuzin are 96.35%, 92%, 97.05%, 91.15%, 90.5%, and 89.5%. There is almost no change for the adsorption capacities of BPAF and Metribuzin undergoing six runs of adsorption procedures.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "ZIF-67", "symbol": "", "chemical formula":
