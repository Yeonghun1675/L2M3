Integration in the reciprocal space was achieved using the Monkhorst-Pack method with three k-points in the Brillouin zone. The convergence with respect to the number of k-points was better than that of the cutoff energy. Geometry optimization on selected starting geometries obtained from single crystal X-ray diffraction was carried out using a gradient-conjugate method until forces on all atoms were less than 0.3 eV/nm. The apparent formation energy was calculated as an energy difference between the corresponding reagents and MOFs products. All calculations were performed on a parallel CESCA supercomputer.

Compound II is more active (TOF = 4140 h-1), but causes the overoxidation to the sulfone, showing a selectivity toward the sulfoxide of 47%.\n\nTo compare these catalytic behaviors with that of our previously reported Yb succinate framework (compound 0 from now on), we have performed the same reaction using it as catalyst in the new optimized conditions; the resulting TOF value is 1536 h-1 (457 h-1 under the previous condition, 50% conversion in 6 h), with a conversion of 80% in 5 h. No induction period is observed under these new conditions, neither for Yb compound nor for the erbium-contained ones (Figure ).", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "Compound I", "symbol": "", "chemical
