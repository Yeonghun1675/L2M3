A structural analysis revealed that the asymmetric unit of 1 consists of a Keggin-type SiW12O40 4- (SiW12) cluster, two crystallographically independent Co ions (Co1 and Co2), three distinct organic ligands (3,3'-bpy, 3,5-bpp, and 4,3'-bpy), and six coordinated water molecules (). Co1 and Co2 show an identical six-coordinated mode, but they possess different coordination environments (Figure S2). Co1 is connected to four nitrogen atoms (N1, N2, N4, and N9) from two 4,3'-bpy and two 3,3'-bpy molecules and two oxygen atoms, respectively, from one terminal oxygen of a SiW12 anion (O21) and one water molecule. The Co2 is linked to three nitrogen atoms (N6, N7, and N8) from one 3,5-bpp and two 4,3'-bpy molecules and to three oxygen atoms from a terminal oxygen of a SiW12 anion and two water molecules, respectively. The Co-N and Co-O bond lengths are in the range of 2.07(2)-2.18(14) \u00c5 and 2.12(13)-2.19 (14) \u00c5, respectively, which are in the normal range. The POM-based three-dimensional (3D) framework of 1 is built from the in situ-created new ligands that exhibit different coordination modes. The simultaneous presence of 3,5-bpp, together with the in situ-formed 4,3'-bpy and 3,3'-bpy ligands, generates a 3D (3,5)-connected open framework with a (3674) (3272) topology (Figure S5). The 3,3'-bpy ligand exhibits two configurations (Figure S3) to connect Co1 with Co2. The 3,5-bpp ligand favors the formation of a helicoidal structure because it is a linked heterocyclic ligand with three nitrogen donor atoms. The Keggin SiW12 clusters act as charge-compensating guests and as bridges connecting Co1 and Co2 ions through two edge-sharing WO6 octahedra (Figure S1), but they are not necessary for the construction of this 3D framework.

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image shows that 1 crystallizes as regular polyhedral crystals with typical dimensions of ca. 500 \u00d7 250 \u00d7 150 \u03bcm3 (Figure S8). The energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) measurement demonstrates that it contains C, O, N, Co, Si, and W (Figure S9) and that all of the elements are uniformly distributed (Figure S10). To further confirm the structure of 1, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) studies were also conducted. The results of XPS, FTIR, PXRD, and TG tests were also consistent with the results of the above structural analyses (Figures S11-S14). The semiconductor behavior and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) area are good indicators of potential catalytic activity, and therefore, we measured the band gap and BET area of 1 (Figure S15). The bandgap value (2.17 eV) and the BET surface area (7.8 m2 g-1) suggest that compound 1 may have abundant ion/electron active sites for electron transfer. \n\nElectrocatalytic HER Measurements\n\nTo explore the electrocatalytic performance of compound 1, we tested the electrocatalytic activity of 1-doped composites with different contents, measured under the same conditions, using a classical three-electrode method in 1.0 mol/L KOH solution using nickel foam (NF) and 20 wt % Pt/C (commercial)-loaded nickel foam.

The C 0 - C/C 0 vs reaction time plots (c) demonstrate that approximately 92% of the dye was decomposed after 120 min in the presence of compound 1 in contrast to less than 12% when no photocatalyst was added (b,c).
