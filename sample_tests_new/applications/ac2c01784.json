According to different clinical subtypes, a divide-and-conquer approach can effectively avoid illness delay and promote the precise treatment and rapid remission of the patient's condition. Considering that the current discrimination standard in clinics depends on invasive renal puncture, molecular typing becomes particularly significant. However, the above-mentioned nine metabolites differentially expressed between PNS and HC present similar expression levels in MCD and MNWT (), suggesting that the above-established marker panel cannot be employed for the discrimination of MCD and MNWT. As a result, we continue to exert the OPLS-DA model to discriminate the subtype MCD, subtype MNWT, and HC based on all the UMFs.

First, we assigned these 266 samples (n = 141/125; PNS/HC) into the discovery cohort (n = 116/95; PNS/HC) and the independent validation cohort (n = 25/30; PNS/HC) at random to avoid overestimating the diagnostic performance of models. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) values of four models were obtained based on all m/z signals from the discovery cohort. As shown in Figure S6, these four models perform great in the discrimination of PNS from HC, and all AUC values are over 0.970, indicating the high quality of UMFs benefiting from the outstanding ionization efficiency and desorption ability of Au/HMOHs. Slightly, the most satisfactory performance was afforded by OPLS-DA with an AUC value of up to 1.000, which corresponds to the best ROC cutoff value of 0.708 (Figure S7d). The evident separation of 116 NS and 95 HC in the discovery cohort by the OPLS-DA model is presented in c (R 2 Y (cum) = 0.930, Q 2 (cum) = 0.863). The permutation with 200 iterations in d displays that all right points are higher than those on the left and the intercepts of lines R 2 and Q 2 are lower than 0.4 and 0, respectively, indicating that the OPLS-DA model is not overfitted. To demonstrate the reliability of the OPLS-DA model, all m/z signals from urine samples in the independent validation cohort are applied, showing the equally excellent diagnostic results (R 2 Y (cum) = 0.941, Q 2 (cum) = 0.842, AUC = 1.000, the best cutoff value = 0.585, Figure S7). Additionally, the OPLS-DA model was also used to discriminate subtype MCD and subtype MNWT from HC based on all UMFs. As shown in e,f, the explicit group separation between MCD and HC (R 2Y (cum) = 0.926, Q 2 (cum) = 0.874), MNWT and HC (R 2 Y (cum) = 0.921, Q 2 (cum) = 0.853) from the discovery cohort is observed. All the AUC values reach 1.000, corresponding to the thresholds of 0.719 and 0.680. The reliabilities of these results are confirmed by their permutation tests of 200 iterations in Figure S8. Likewise, the thrilling results can be acquired in the independent validation cohort (Figure S9).\n\nEncouraged by the above-mentioned results, we tried to find out specific metabolic signals with significant difference between PNS and HC from the discovery cohort. To avoid biases related to individual feature selection algorithms, we integrate multiple feature selection approaches to rank the m/z signals. In addition to those with variable importance for the protection (VIP) > 1, which is a significant parameter in OPLS-DA, m/z signals with significant variation including a p-value (t-test) < 0.05 and fold change > 2 or < 0.5 are selected. Eventually, nine highly representative signals are defined as potential biomarkers for PNS diagnosis (Table S3). As expected, the high-confidence marker panel presents excellent performance in the discrimination of PNS (including MCD and MNWT) and HC for both discovery and independent validation cohorts. From Figure S10, we observe that the AUC values of PNS (R 2 Y (cum) = 0.780, Q 2 (cum) = 0.725), MNWT (R 2 Y (cum) = 0.773, Q 2 (cum) = 0.719), and MCD (R 2 Y (cum) = 0.756, Q 2 (cum) = 0.704) vs HC are 0.986 (the optimal cutoff value, 0.438), 0.983 (the best cut-off value, 0.524), and 1.000 (the cutoff value, 0.558), respectively, in the discovery cohort. The corresponding 200 iterations confirm the reliability of these results (Figure S10c). From the blind test results in Figure S11a-c, all the AUC values achieve 1.000, suggesting the high application value of the established marker panel.", "data": [["\"I do not know.\""]], "include_properties": []}, {"idx": 6, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Schematic illustrations of (a) synthetic strategy\nof Au/HMOHs and\n(b) urine metabolic fingerprints based on Au/HMOH-assisted LDI-MS\nfor PNS diagnosis, typing, and prognosis evaluation.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ac2c01784_0002.eps\" xlink:type=\"simple\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Schematic illustrations of (a) synthetic strategy of Au/HMOHs and (b) urine metabolic fingerprints based on Au/HMOH-assisted LDI-MS for PNS diagnosis, typing, and prognosis evaluation.
