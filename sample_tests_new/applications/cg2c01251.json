Interestingly, the Co-MOF shows a light-dependent behavior with conductivity values of 9.09 \u00d7 10-5 S/m (dark) and 6.31 \u00d7 10-4 S/m (light) and ideality factors of 0.78 (dark) and 0.92 (light). The MOFs, fitted with a free sulfonic acid moiety and extensive H-bonded water clusters, show high potential for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) development with corroborating proton conductivity values of 1.95\u00d7 10-3 S/cm and 5.80 \u00d7 10-4 S/cm for Ni-MOF and Co-MOF, respectively, at 95% relative humidity and 85 \u00b0C. Moreover, the interesting structural aspects like syn-anti bridged carboxylates prompt us to explore the magnetic behavior of the MOFs. The Ni-MOF shows some interesting antiferromagnetic behavior. The Co-MOF reveals intriguing single molecule magnet behavior with a U eff value of 34 K and moderate relaxation time of 3.5\u00d7 10-8 s.\n\nAnal.

Raw data were integrated and corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects using the Bruker APEX III program suite. The structures were solved by direct methods in SHELXS and refined by full-matrix least-squares on F2 in SHELXL. The crystallographic data are tabulated in Supporting Information, and CIF files are deposited with the CCDC. Deposition numbers are provided in Supporting Information.\n\nStability and Phase Purity Studies\n\nThe TGA of the MOFs confirms their high thermal stability up to 450 \u00b0C (Figures S7-S8). The retention of crystallinity in terms of thermal stability up to 150 \u00b0C was also confirmed using variable temperature PXRD experiments (Figures S9-S10). Keeping in mind that experiments related to proton conductivity and diode fabrication often involve conditions like high humidity and high temperature, both in powder and high-pressure induced pelletized forms, the physical stability of the MOFs were also checked to evaluate their candidature. A hydraulic press was used to generate 5 Ton cm-2 pressure on the MOFs for 1 h duration. The subsequently PXRD pattern obtained for the pressure-induced sample shows no significant change, confirming the retention of structural framework integrity (Figure S15). In another experiment, MOFs were boiled in water at 100 \u00b0C for 3 days to check their chemical stability. The PXRD pattern collected for the air-dried samples of the above retains the same diffraction patterns, thereby confirming their structural integrity.\n\nSurface Area Determination\n\nAlthough porosity does not guarantee intrinsic proton conductivity, the presence of empty channels or a cavity can have a profound impact on the conductivity values. This is particularly important when the conductivity is measured under externally applied high humidity conditions or in other words in the presence of water vapor that can easily reside or migrate across the porous channels. Naturally, the current MOFs with distinct pores and infinite channels warrant a detail investigation on their surface area and absorbent ability. Standard N2 gas sorption experiments at 77 K were carried out for the MOFs, for which occurrence of Type-III isotherm (Figures S11 and S12) turns out to be a recurrent theme. Both the MOFs show a common trend of uptaking a moderate to low amount of N2 gas, 30.66 cm3/g for Co-MOF and 28.5 cm3/g for Ni-MOF, at STP. Subsequently calculated Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area data, 11.26 m2/g for Co-MOF and 10.35 m2/g for Ni-MOF, further support their relevance in providing porous channels, thereby enhancing the possibility of improved conductivity by providing the required space to entrap and transport the proton carriers.\n\nOptical Band Gap\n\nThe success of a Schottky barrier diode fabrication often depends on the optical band gap, which can easily be determined from the UV-vis spectra. To prepare the samples, 10 mg of each MOFs was taken in a sample vial with 5 mL of DMF and sonicated for 5 h. Subsequently, a thin film of the MOFs was prepared separately and used for collecting UV-vis (300-800 nm) absorption spectra, which show maxima at approximately 270 nm for Ni-MOF and 272 nm for Co-MOF. The band gap (E g) of the MOFs was determined using the following Tauc formula and by extrapolating the linear region of the plot (\u03b1h\u03bd)2 vs h\u03bd to \u03b1 = 0 absorption.     \u03b1 h \u03bd = A   ( h \u03bd -   E   g   )   n     where \u03b1 - absorption coefficient, E g - band gap, h - Planck's constant, \u03bd - frequency of light, n - electron transition processes dependent constant (considered as 1 2), and A - constant (for an ideal case taken as 1).\n\nThe calculated value of E g turns out to be 3.18 eV for Ni-MOF and 3.49 eV for Co-MOF (Figure S16), which indicate both the MOFs can be considered as wide band gap semiconductors.\n\nSchottky Barrier Diode (SBD) Fabrication\n\nHighly ordered unitary cell-like self-assembled networks showing extensive weak intermolecular interactions among the \u03c0-conjugated aromatic rings usually promotes charge transportation through-space, adopting a so-called \"hopping\" mechanism. These kinds of noncovalent interaction-mediated charge transportations often turned out to be the main driving force of optoelectronic device fabrication. We envisioned that the current MOFs with the substantial presence of pi-conjugated rings in the chassis would drive home the through-space charge transportation, thereby improving the prospect of optoelectronic device fabrication. Further encouragement comes from the calculated optical band gap (3.18 and 3.49 eV), which clearly indicates that the materials are semiconducting in nature. Naturally, it prompted us to explore the electrical and optoelectronic potentials of the MOFs. Accordingly, we have developed an as-synthesized Co-MOF and Ni-MOF based metal (Al)-semiconductor Co-MOF and Ni-MOF (MS) junction thin film device, using our previously published methodology. The I-V experiments have been performed under inert conditions (inside nitrogen-glovebox) using those two fabricated devices in dark and photoirradiation (intensity ~ 100 mW cm-2) conditions at RT at the corresponding applied bias voltage sequentially within the limit \u00b11 V to analyze the charge transport behavior.\n\nThe current-voltage characteristic of the cobalt-based system has been measured in the dark as well as in photoirradiation conditions (). The measured electrical conductivity for the Co-system in the dark condition turned out to be 9.09 \u00d7 10-5 S m-1, which is a typical example of a semiconductor. The conductivity shows a significant enhancement after photoirradiation, and it turns out to be 6.31 \u00d7 10-4 S m-1, confirming an optoelectronic phenomenon.\n\nIn a stark contrast, no such changes were observed for the Ni-based device when data were collected under the dark and irradiation condition. The electrical conductivity of the corresponding Ni-system turns out to be 1.80 \u00d7 10-4 S/m that also resembles typical semiconductor behavior.\n\nBesides, the illustrative current-voltage features of the Al/cobalt based interface in dark as well as photo illumination conditions () represent a nonlinear rectifying behavior, reminiscent to the Schottky diode (SD). Under the photo illumination condition, the Co-based device exhibits a larger current, which is the significance of photosensitivity. Hence, the photosensitivity of the device has been measured, which has been turned to 1.72.", "data": ["(SyntaxError('EOL while scanning string literal', ('<unknown>', 1, 10, \"['chemical\")), \"['chemical\")"], "include_properties": null}, {"idx": "52, 55, 60, 62, 65, 68", "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<p>As tabulated\nin (), the conductivity\nvalues at 65% humidity and at 30 \u00b0C\nare 3.94 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20137</sup> S/cm for Ni-MOF and 1.69 \u00d7\n10<sup>\u20137</sup> S/cm for Co-MOF.

This indicates the improvement of proton conductivity with an increase in temperature due to the thermal activation of charge carriers or protons.\n\nMagnetic MOFs\n\nThe above results are in good agreement with our assumption that electrical properties can be imparted and improved through molecular engineering of ligands during synthesis of a MOF. Of particular interest was the syn-anti bridging mode of carboxylate groups that are situated in tandem with the chelating coordination of the carboxylate and ortho-oriented sulfonic moiety in Co-MOF (). From a magnetic point view, such coordination modes are of significant importance. Naturally, we shift our focus toward the second objectives of magnetic properties to fully justify the notion of generating an integrated system showing mutually inclusive electrical and magnetic properties. It is worth mentioning here that crystalline phase purity of the MOFs was verified by powder diffraction patterns before magnetic data collection. The variable temperature direct current (DC) magnetic susceptibility data were collected with the crushed microcrystalline samples in the temperature range between 2 and 300 K, with an applied magnetic field of 0.1 T. The \u03c7m T (\u03c7m is the molar magnetic susceptibility) vs T plots for Co-MOF (a) give the \u03c7m T value of 8.67 cm3 mol-1 K at 300 K, for three Co-centers, which is much higher than the expected spin-only value of three noninteracting Co(II) centers is 5.625 cm3 mol-1 K (S = 3/2, g = 2.0); this is due to the orbital contribution arising from each Co(II) center. The \u03c7m T value decreases with decreasing temperature, and after 100 K it sharply falls; with further cooling, the value decreases smoothly and finally reaches a value of 5.16 cm3 mol-1 K at 2 K. The behavior closely resembles to the antiferromagnetic interaction between the neighboring metal ions. Using the Curie-Weiss equation (b), data were fitted. From the curve of 1/\u03c7m vs T, the Curie-Weiss law 1/\u03c7m= (T - \u03b8)/C gives the results for C = 8.77 cm3 mol-1 K and \u03b8 = -10.87 K. The negative \u03b8 for Co-MOF demonstrates antiferromagnetic interactions between adjacent Co(II) centers. Similar experimental measurements were carried out for Ni-MOF. The \u03c7m T versus T plots for Ni-MOF reveal the \u03c7m T value of 6.40 cm3 mol-1 K at 300 K, for four Ni(II) centers which is greater than the theoretical spin only value of four noninteracting Ni centers 4 cm3 mol-1 K (S = 1, g = 2.0); this is also due to antiferromagnetic interactions between four Ni(II) centers at room temperature (e). With decreasing the temperature, the \u03c7m T value initially decreases slightly until it reaches 5.53 cm3 mol-1 K at 15 K. Subsequent cooling of the sample slightly increases the \u03c7m T value, and it reaches 5.62 cm3 mol-1 K at 9 K. On further cooling, it falls sharply and finally gives the value of 4.26 cm3 mol-1 K at 2 K. These types of phenomena indicate the ferromagnetic interactions at low temperature. These data also follow the Curie-Weiss law with C = 12.76 cm3 mol-1 K and \u03b8 = -7.91 K (f). The result clearly hints at antiferromagnetic interactions between the adjacent Ni(II) ions at higher temperature.\n\nIn between the temperature range of 8-13 K from 0 to 5 T isothermal magnetization (M vs H) for Co-MOF was plotted, from which it was observed that the plot does not saturate even at the highest field of 5 T (c). The maximum magnetic moment value was 21.4 emu/g obtained at 8 K. To examine the anisotropy of the system, the magnetic moment was plotted against H/T for 8-13 K, and this shows that all of the isotherms do not fall on the same master plot, which clearly reveals the existence of anisotropy of Co-MOF (d). Further, if we carefully noticed the geometry around the Co center which is bound with the H2MDP in the structure of the Co-MOF it will be observed that there is distortion in the Oh geometry, which may result in magnetic anisotropy for slow relaxation of magnetization. It sparks interest to look for the possibility of slow magnetic relaxation for the Co-MOF. This prompted us to measure AC susceptibility data to evaluate the SMM potential of the Co-MOF. Ni-MOF, however, did not show any significant peak for SMM.\n\nFrequency dependency in-phase (\u03c7 M') and out-of-phase (\u03c7 M\") AC susceptibility plots were also examined. The SMM behavior of the sample (c,d) was confirmed by the lack of merging of the plots. ln(\u03c9) was plotted versus 1/T and fitted using the Arrhenius equation: ln(\u03c9) = ln(1/\u03c40) - (E eff/kT) (), where \u03c9 is the frequency, (\u03c9 = 1/\u03c4)\u03c40 is the relaxation time, and E eff is the energy barrier to estimate the relaxation time and energy barrier of Co-MOF. From the fitting, the energy barrier (E/k) = 34(5) K and the relaxation time (\u03c40) = 3.5 \u00d7 10-8 s. The relaxation time is in the range of an SMM. The spin disorder parameter (\u03d5) calculated using the equation \u03d5 = (\u0394T P/T P)/(log \u03c5) (\u03c5 denotes the frequency used in AC measurement) for Co-MOF is 0.22 (Figure S14), which is greater than 0.1 and belongs to a normal value for a super-paramagnet (\u03d5 > 0.1), and hence Co-MOF can be considered as an SMM, ruling out the possibility of a spin glass state (\u03d5 ~ 0.01). \n\nThe Co-MOF shows an excellent light-dependent diode with ideality factors of 0.78 (in dark) and 0.92 (in the presence of light), while the corresponding conductivity values are 9.09 \u00d7 10-5 S/m (dark) 6.31 \u00d7 10-4 S/m (light). Ni-MOF, on the other hand, shows a light-independent ideality factor of 1.06 and a conductivity value of 1.80 \u00d7 10-4 S/m when it is used as a Schottky barrier diode. Furthermore, both the MOFs show excellent proton conductivity. The free sulfonic acid moiety present inside the network of Ni-MOF acts as a proton carrier facilitator and shows a high proton conductivity value of 1.95\u00d7 10-3 S/cm at 95% relative humidity and 85 \u00b0C. The Co-MOF, on the other hand, shows an impressive proton conductivity value of 5.80 \u00d7 10-4 S/cm at 95% relative humidity and 85 \u00b0C, resulting from an inherent extensive H-bonded water cluster residing inside the porous network.
