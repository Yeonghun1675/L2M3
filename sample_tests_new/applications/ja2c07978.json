This effect was further investigated using a strong noncoordinating\nHBF<sub>4</sub> acid, which resulted in amorphous powders after water\nevaporation.</p>", "clean_text": "With these considerations in mind, we investigated the self-polymerization of SO  3  H-RhMOP in water in the presence of HOTf (a). We found that after almost total evaporation of a solution of SO  3  H-RhMOP   a   in water/HOTf (80:1, v/v) solvent mixture at 80 \u00b0C, green crystals of SO  3  H-RhMOF were obtained (Figures S14 and S15). SC-XRD analysis revealed that under these conditions, SO  3  H-RhMOP cages assemble into a 3D MOF architecture, SO  3  H-RhMOF (Table S5). The crystal structure of SO  3  H-RhMOF is very similar to SO  3  -RhMOP, with space group I4/m and two MOP molecules per unit cell. However, in SO  3  H-RhMOF, each cage is coordinatively connected to the eight equivalent neighboring cages situated at the vertices of a tetragonal prism. This linkage is based on the coordination of one oxygen atom of one -SO3H group of the central cage to the external axial position of a Rh2 dimer of a neighboring cage (b). Reciprocally, each one of these cages coordinates in the same fashion to one of the eight geometrically accessible Rh2 units of the central cage. Consequently, in SO  3  H-RhMOF, each cage presents 16 noncoordinated sulfonic groups and four coplanar Rh2 dimers with nonconnected external sites, which are occupied by coordinated water molecules (Figure S16). The Rh-O(sulfonic) bond length is 2.325 \u00c5, which falls within the range of typical M-O bond of aryl sulfonate complexes (Figures S17 and S18) and previously reported Rh(II)-based MOPs with O-donor ligands (2.224-2.383 \u00c5). Note here that while the coordination of triflate anion (OTf-) to Rh(I) and Rh(III) in organometallic complexes is well known, the OTf- coordination of Rh(II) is extremely rare with only one previous precedent. To our knowledge, SO  3  H-RhMOF represents the first example of an 8-connected (8-c) network based on the crystalline assembly of MOPs. Previous examples based on OH-functionalized Cu MOP (vide supra) resulted in 4-c, 6-c, and (4,6)-c networks, where the role of coordinated solvent molecules determines the resulting structure (Figure S19). In this case, the competition between DMSO solvent molecules and phenolic hydroxyl groups on the ligand dictates the degree of connectivity between the cages. Thus, the reduction of the DMSO concentration during crystallization involves the formation of networks with higher connectivity, 6-c and (4,6)-c, whereas 4-c is formed when the DMSO concentration is increased. However, in all the cases, the coordination of organic solvents (i.e., DMSO, MeOH, and DMF) exerts some steric hindrance around the metal site, limiting the formation of networks with higher connectivity. On the contrary, in the crystallization of SO  3  H-RhMOF from SO  3  H-RhMOP   a  , the use of water as solvent involves minimum steric hindrance between solvated cages, allowing a denser packing to give an 8-c network. Thus, the high stability and solubility in water of SO  3  H-RhMOP   a   are crucial to achieve such type of connectivity. HOTf also plays a critical role in the formation of SO  3  H-RhMOF. All of the experiments without HOTf involving the evaporation of water solutions of SO  3  H-RhMOP   a  , with or without heating, yielded amorphous powders. The presence of HOTf not only guarantees a highly acid medium, favoring the formation of SO3H-(bdc) groups, but also can aid crystallization by modulating the coordination equilibrium (Figure S20).

Cryospray-ionization mass spectrometry (CSI-MS) experiment revealed a peak at m/z = 2081.2, matching the theoretical value of [Rh24(SOH3-bdc)24] - 4H+ (expected m/z = 2081.2) (Figure S7). Thanks to the hydrophilic nature of the -SO3 - group, SO  3  -RhMOP   a   was found to be highly soluble in water and methanol but insoluble in other organic solvents. We attributed this behavior to the formation of an ionic pair between anionic [Rh24(SO3-bdc)24]24- cage and cationic dimethyl ammonium, [Me2NH2]+, generated upon acid treatment. This was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure S8) and elemental analysis (Table S3), showing a SO3-bdc/[Me2NH2]+ ratio of 1:0.92, which corresponds to ~1.9 SO3H groups per cage. The number of -SO3H groups was estimated at ~2.7 per cage by titration with aqueous NaOH ( and S9), confirming the anionic character of the cage. The prevalence of the deprotonated form of the cage, even after TFA treatment, was ascribed to the higher acidity of arylsulfonic acids (e.g., SO3H-Ph, pK a = -2.8) compared to TFA (pK a = 0.3). Correspondingly, we used stronger triflic acid (HOTf, pK a = -5.9) to produce the sulfonic acid-functionalized cage (). SO  3  -RhMOP(Me2NH) was dissolved in methanol, treated with HOTf, and precipitated with diethyl ether. After washing, turquoise amorphous bulk powder SO  3  H-RhMOP   a   was obtained (Figures S9 and S11). HOTf-treated SO  3  H-RhMOP   a   was found to be soluble in water and methanol but also in other polar organic solvents, such as ethanol, ethylene glycol, dimethylformamide (DMF), or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (a). The observed blue shift in the DMSO solution can be attributed to its \u03c0-acceptor capacity. Following this methodology, the number of -SO3H groups per cage was successfully increased from 2.7 (11%) to 17.1 (71%) (Figure S12), which correlates with the improved solubility of SO  3  H-RhMOP   a   in organic solvents.

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) analysis revealed that SO  3  -RhMOP(Me2NH) crystallizes in the tetragonal space group I4/m, containing two cages in the unit cell (Table S1). The molecular structure of SO  3  -RhMOP(Me2NH) consists of 12 Rh2 paddlewheel nodes connected through 24 5-sulfo-1,3-benzenedicarboxylate ligands to form a cuboctahedral architecture (a). The size of the cage, defined by the average distance between the centroids of the O atoms in -SO3 groups of the opposing dicarboxylate ligands, was estimated at ca. 2.9 nm. Likewise, the pore size of SO  3  -RhMOP(Me2NH), defined by the average distance between the opposing internal Rh atoms, was found to be ca. 1.6 nm.

This array involves the alignment of the cages along the [001] direction, resulting in the formation of solvent-accessible channels (c).\n\nDespite the structural similarities between SO  3  -RhMOP and SO  3  H-RhMOF, the connection between the cages in SO  3  H-RhMOF involves the reduction of the unit cell volume by ~19%, with a shortening of the unit cell along the [001] direction (~28%) and a smaller elongation along [100] and [010] directions (~6%). Correspondingly, the distance between the centers of the cages is shorter in SO  3  H-RhMOF (26.613 \u00c5) than that in SO  3  -RhMOP (29.342 \u00c5).

We also estimated the pore size distribution (PSD) of these samples by nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT). PSDs of SO  3  H-RhMOP   a   and SO  3  H-RhMOF   a   show the maxima at 0.7 nm (b), which correspond to the expected value for the cage cavity.

Although both solids are amorphous, in the case of SO  3  H-RhMOF   a  , the contribution of this intercage pore is higher, indicative of better retention of the intercage voids upon activation. Thus, the higher adsorption capacity observed for SO  3  H-RhMOF   a   can be ascribed to the higher contribution of the extrinsic porosity, as can be expected for an extended network in which cages are chemically bounded.\n\nCO2 sorption measurements at 195 K were also conducted, showing the same trend (c). Thus, SO  3  H-RhMOF   a   displayed the highest adsorption capacity at P/P 0 ~ 1.0 (132 cm3 g-1), whereas SO  3  H-RhMOP   a   presented a value of 97 cm3 g-1, which is much higher than that of SO  3  -RhMOP   a   (39 cm3 g-1). The effect of processing SO  3  H-RhMOP cage into SO  3  H-RhMOF on the sorption behavior was further confirmed. Thus, the N2 (77 K) adsorption isotherm of the solid resulting from the solubilization and further precipitation of SO  3  H-RhMOF   a   exhibited a lower BET surface area of 315 m2 g-1, which is identical to the one displayed by SO  3  H-RhMOP   a   (Figure S25).\n\nThe presence of accessible hydrophilic -SO3H groups in SO  3  H-RhMOP   a   and SO  3  H-RhMOF   a   motivated us to study their water sorption capacity. d shows the water vapor isotherms at 298 K, revealing a similar behavior for both compounds with very high water uptake.

The hydrophilic sulfonic groups can not only act as proton sources but also can establish hydrogen bonds with neighboring water molecules, favoring the creation of efficient pathways for conduction. In our case, the high concentration of acidic sulfonic groups and the superior water vapor adsorption capacity exhibited by SO  3  H-RhMOP   a   and SO  3  H-RhMOF   a   drive us to investigate their potential as proton-conducting materials. To this end, alternating-current (AC) impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed on pressed pellets of powder samples. The proton conductivity was estimated by fitting the semicircle of the Nyquist plots. Preliminary tests were conducted with SO  3  H-RhMOP   a  . At 25 \u00b0C and 60% RH, we found a moderate proton conductivity of 3.2 \u00d7 10-5 S cm-1. We next kept the sample at 25 \u00b0C and increased humidity up to 90% RH, resulting in a higher conductivity value of 1.2 \u00d7 10-3 S cm-1 (Figure S26). The improvement of conductivity upon increasing humidity pointed out the relevant role of water in the proton transport. The effect of the temperature was also checked by measuring the conductivity at different temperatures (40-95 \u00b0C) while keeping RH constant at 90% (a). SO  3  H-RhMOP   a   exhibited a continuous increment of conductivity upon heating, achieving a maximum value of 2.5 \u00d7 10-2 S cm-1 at 95 \u00b0C (c). Then, the proton conductivity of SO  3  H-RhMOF   a   at different temperatures (90% RH) was also measured, displaying a lower but still high conductivity value of 4.4 \u00d7 10-3 S cm-1 at 95 \u00b0C (b,c). The performance of the presented materials is in the range of previously reported high-proton-conducting metal-organic compounds such as MOFs and MOPs (>10-3 S cm-1). Particularly, compared to other conducting MOPs (Table S6), the conductivity exhibited by SO  3  H-RhMOP   a   is the highest for a MOP measured as a compacted pellet of powder, and it is very close to the highest value obtained from a MOP single-crystal measurement (5.8 \u00d7 10-2 S cm-1). We attributed this high conductivity to the elevated number of sulfonic acid groups located at the outer surface of SO  3  H-RhMOP   a   and the resulting high water adsorption capacity for both SO  3  H-RhMOP   a   and SO  3  H-RhMOF   a  . Thus, previously reported sulfonate-functionalized Zr-based MOP with six groups on its surface showed lower water adsorption capacity of ~240 cm3 g-1 at 90% RH, exhibiting high conductivity (2.8 \u00d7 10-3 S cm-1) but one order of magnitude lower than SO  3  H-RhMOP   a  . Likewise, the difference between SO  3  H-RhMOP   a   and SO  3  H-RhMOF   a   conductivities can be ascribed to the presence of coordinated sulfonic acid groups in SO  3  H-RhMOF   a  , which involves a smaller number of sulfonic acid groups available for conduction (16 per cage) compared to SO  3  H-RhMOP   a   (24 per cage).\n\nThe activation energies E a of proton conductivities from the Arrhenius plot (d) were found to be 0.59 and 0.38 eV for SO  3  H-RhMOP   a   and SO  3  H-RhMOF   a  , respectively. Despite these values being relatively high compared to typical hydrated proton conductors, E a values for SO  3  H-RhMOP   a   and SO  3  H-RhMOF   a   are lower than those found in other highly conducting MOPs (E a > 0.65 mV). The observed higher E a for more conducting SO  3  H-RhMOP   a   compared to less conducting SO  3  H-RhMOF   a  , with lower E a, can be indicative of a complex conduction mechanism, in which both proton jumping through available sulfonic groups (Grotthuss mechanism) and direct transport with water molecules (vehicle mechanism) contribute to the proton conduction.
