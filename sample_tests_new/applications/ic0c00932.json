The parallel arrangement of the photoactive bpee linkers in 1 and 2 facilitates a topochemical [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction in both frameworks in a single-crystal to single-crystal transformation fashion.

This selectivity for C2H2 has been further exploited by a breakthrough measurement of the gas mixture C2H2/C2H4 (1/99 v/v). Such a high selectivity and separation capacity can be attributed to the perfect window size of the 1D pore in compound 2, where C2H2 molecules can easily diffuse and strongly interact with pores decorated with an aromatic \u03c0 cloud. In contrast, the other small molecules with kinetic diameter relatively higher than that of C2H2 cannot enter into the 1D channel.

The nonporous nature may\nbe attributed to the smaller aperture size of the 1D channel in comparison\nto the kinetic diameter of N<sub>2</sub> (3.64 \u00c5) as well as\nthe low kinetic energy of the N<sub>2</sub> molecules at low temperature\n(77 K), which results in N<sub>2</sub> molecules being unable to enter\neffectively into the pores.</p><p>The window size (7.2 \u00d7 3.7\n\u00c5<sup>2</sup>) of the 1D channel present in compound <bold>2a</bold> further encouraged us to probe the adsorption property of C2 hydrocarbons\nhaving kinetic diameters similar to the pore size (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> 3.3 \u00c5, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> 4.2 \u00c5 and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> 4.5 \u00c5). Interestingly,\nat 293 K, the desolvated framework only allows the inclusion of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> gas (3.10 wt %; 27 mL/g), while it completely\nexcludes other small molecules such as CO<sub>2</sub> (0.46 wt %;\n3 mL/g), CH<sub>4</sub> (0.18 wt %; 2 mL/g), C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> (0.26 wt %; 5 mL/g), and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> (0.13 wt %;\n3.5 mL/g) (a). A similar type of selective gas uptake was also documented in\nthe case of the irradiated compound <bold>2IRa</bold>, where the final\nC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> uptake was found to be 2.27 wt % (20 mL/g)\n(b). The lesser\namount of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> uptake by <bold>2IR</bold> in\ncomparison to <bold>2</bold> is due to the overall shrinkage of the\nframework along with the decrease in void volume after the photoreaction\n(<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c00932/suppl_file/ic0c00932_si_001.pdf\">Figure S24</ext-link>).

The higher acetylene adsorption capacity\nin comparison with the other C2 hydrocarbons indicates that the compounds\nare an attractive material for the selective adsorptive-based separation\nof acetylene from the three-gas mixture. The stronger interaction\nbetween C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> and the MOF surface is also reflected\nin the selectivity estimation of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> over other\nhydrocarbons employing the IAST model (ideal adsorbed solution theory;\ndetails are given in <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c00932/suppl_file/ic0c00932_si_001.pdf\">Figures S18\u2013S23</ext-link> in the Supporting Information) (d).

The asymmetric unit of 2 contains two crystallographically independent ZnII ions (Zn1 and Zn2), one and a half succinates, one bpee linker, one hydroxyl anion, two guest water molecules and one guest methanol molecule (a). A structure determination confirmed the presence of a secondary building unit (SBU) constructed by the zinc hydroxyl carboxylate cluster {Zn4(\u03bc3-OH)2(COO)6N4} (b). In the asymmetric unit, the ZnII center (Zn1) showed a distorted-tetrahedral geometry with a ZnO3N core. Each Zn1 is coordinated with two different carboxylate oxygen atoms (O4 and O5c; (c) 2 - x, 2 - y, 1 - z), one \u03bc3-bridging hydroxyl group oxygen (O7) and one pyridyl nitrogen atom (N1) of bpee (Zn1-O bond lengths are in the range of 1.926(3)-1.980(3) \u00c5, and the Zn1-N bond length is 2.033(3) \u00c5). The other ZnII (Zn2) center is in a distorted-octahedral geometry with a ZnO5N core. The coordination of the Zn2 metal center is furnished by three carboxylate oxygen atoms (O2, O3b, and O6b; (b) -1 + x, y, z) of three different succinates, two O atoms from \u03bc3-bridging hydroxyl groups (O7 and O7a; (a) 1 - x, 2 - y, 1 - z), and one pyridyl nitrogen atom (N2) of one bpee ligand (b). The Zn2-O bond lengths lie in the range of 2.049(3)-2.185(2) \u00c5, and the Zn2-N bond length is 2.132(3) \u00c5. Each tetranuclear SBU cluster {Zn4(\u03bc3-OH)2(COO)6N4} is composed of two scalene triangles (formed by the three ZnII metal ions Zn2-Zn2-Zn1)) which share two symmetry-related ZnII ions (Zn2 and Zn2a) as the base (b).

Two consecutive tetranuclear SBUs are connected by the eclipsed-succinic acid (O3, O4, O5, and O6 of SUC-A; c) through the Zn1 and Zn2 centers, which are further extended along the a direction to form a 1D chain. These 1D chains are interconnected with each other through the carboxylate oxygen atom (O2) of staggered-succinic acid (SUC-B) to generate a 2D layer along the ab plane (e). The formation of the 3D architecture of compound 2 is constructed by the connection of two successive 2D layers along the c direction through the N,N' linear linker 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene (bpee; N1 and N2) (a).

Further examination shows that 2 adopts an unprecedented network topology with the Schla\u0308fli symbol {44.832.129}4. It is very interesting to note that the olefinic double bonds of adjacent bpee pairs are aligned parallel with the support of the Zn1-O7-Zn2 unit, where the distance between the centers of C\ue5fbC bonds is 3.87 \u00c5 (a). The pyridyl parts of the bpee ligands are also aligned parallel with strong \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions with a center to center distance of 4.0 \u00c5. This geometry is ideal for a topochemical [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction in the solid state as postulated by Schmidt. \n\nStructural Description of [{Zn2(\u03bc3-OH)(bpee)(suc)1.5}\u22c5CH3OH\u22c53H2O] (2LT)\n\nA single-crystal structure determination of compound 2LT showed that it retains its crystal symmetry similarly to that of compound 2 at 140 K. However, interestingly we observed that one axis is exactly double in comparison to the cell parameters collected at 293 K. A detailed structural analysis showed that the orientations of the olefinic groups in bpee molecules connecting the Zn1 and Zn2 centers of two adjacent layers are similar, as shown in a. However, at low temperature, due to the change in orientation of one olefinic group (see a, molecule presented in yellow) the symmetry between the two bpee molecules breaks and hence the crystallographic axis was found to be twice that of the room temperature structure. Therefore, compounds 2 and 2LT can be related as polymorphs, where a temperature-driven phase change was observed. To prove this, we performed a DSC analysis of compound 2 (b) in the temperature range of 150-313 K; we observed an exothermic peak with a maximum at 278 K. The corresponding \u0394H value is 2.19 kJ/mol, suggesting much less energy involved in this polymorphic phase transition. The single-crystal data of the irradiated compound collected at low temperature also demonstrates a similar kind of phase transition.\n\nStructural Description of [{Zn4(\u03bc3-OH)2(rctt-tpcb)(suc)3}\u22c52CH3OH\u22c54H2O] (2IR)\n\nA single-crystal structure determination of compound 2IR shows that the framework structure almost remains unchanged except for the formation of new C-C bonds across the olefinic bonds between the parallel bpee ligands along the c direction (d). The newly formed C-C single-bond distance is 1.6 \u00c5, which is comparable to that of a normal C-C single bond. The distance between the two successive 2D layers (through Zn1-Zn2d; (d) -x, 1 - y, -z) along the newly formed 4,4'-rctt tpcb linker is 13.315(3) \u00c5, which is shorter than the distance through the bpee pillar in the as-synthesized compound (13.520(4) \u00c5). The distance between the adjacent metal centers (Zn1 and Zn2) in the SBU has increased from 3.614(2) to 3.703(3) \u00c5. The structural contraction is also reflected from the reduced cell volume, where it decreased from 1156 to 1110 \u00c53 after the photoreaction (Table S1). A comparative image is given in Figure S9 in the Supporting Information, which demonstrates the movement of the pyridine ring of the bpee ligand due to the formation of the cyclobutane ring. The dimerization reaction also results in a decrease of the total solvent-accessible area, which is reflected in the reduced void space from 18.9% to 14.6% with respect to unit cell volume. Compound 2IR is also a trinodal (2-c)2(2-c)2(8-c) periodic net formed by 2-connected succinates (suc), 2-connected newly formed tpcb linkers, and an 8-connected tetranuclear Zn SBU (Figure S8b). Further examination shows that 2IR adopts an unprecedented network topology with the Schla\u0308fli symbol {42.820.126}2. \n\nFramework Stability: Thermogravimetric (TG) and Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) Analysis\n\nThermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out to study the stability of the frameworks. TGA of all the compounds was performed in the temperature range 30-700 \u00b0C under a nitrogen atmosphere. In the case of 1 and 1IR, the compounds are stable up to 250 \u00b0C without showing any step (Figure S10). The TGA profile of 2 (Figure S11) indicates a weight loss of 11.21% at 100 \u00b0C, which corroborates the removal of guest (one methanol and two water) molecules (calcd 11.89%). The desolvated framework is stable up to 205 \u00b0C. After that, it gradually decomposes into unidentified products. A similar profile was also obtained for 2IR (Figure S12). The PXRD patterns of all the compounds in different states are shown in  and Figure S13. In all of the compounds good correspondence of the different peak positions in the simulated and as-synthesized patterns suggests the phase purity of the as-synthesized compounds. In the cases of 2a and 2IRa, the similarity between the PXRD patterns of as-synthesized and heated samples indicate that there is no significant structural change upon desolvation. Even after exposure to water vapor for 15 days, the structure of the rehydrated samples remained intact, as evidenced by the PXRD patterns. This suggested that the framework is stable in the presence of water vapor.\n\nProbing the Porous Properties\n\nRemoval of guest methanol and water molecules offers a 1D channel along the a direction, which encouraged us to study the permanent porosity and storage capacity of compound 2. The desolvated framework of 2 (i.e., 2a) was found to be nonporous with respect to N2 (77 K) and CO2 (273 K) (Figures S14 and S15). The nonporous nature may be attributed to the smaller aperture size of the 1D channel in comparison to the kinetic diameter of N2 (3.64 \u00c5) as well as the low kinetic energy of the N2 molecules at low temperature (77 K), which results in N2 molecules being unable to enter effectively into the pores.\n\nThe window size (7.2 \u00d7 3.7 \u00c52) of the 1D channel present in compound 2a further encouraged us to probe the adsorption property of C2 hydrocarbons having kinetic diameters similar to the pore size (C2H2 3.3 \u00c5, C2H4 4.2 \u00c5 and C2H6 4.5 \u00c5). Interestingly, at 293 K, the desolvated framework only allows the inclusion of C2H2 gas (3.10 wt %; 27 mL/g), while it completely excludes other small molecules such as CO2 (0.46 wt %; 3 mL/g), CH4 (0.18 wt %; 2 mL/g), C2H4 (0.26 wt %; 5 mL/g), and C2H6 (0.13 wt %; 3.5 mL/g) (a). A similar type of selective gas uptake was also documented in the case of the irradiated compound 2IRa, where the final C2H2 uptake was found to be 2.27 wt % (20 mL/g) (b). The lesser amount of C2H2 uptake by 2IR in comparison to 2 is due to the overall shrinkage of the framework along with the decrease in void volume after the photoreaction (Figure S24). To better understand the interactions between C2H2 and the desolvated frameworks (2a and 2IRa), we have calculated the zero coverage isosteric heat of adsorption (Q st) using a virial equation (adsorption data collected at 283 and 293 K; details are given in Figures S16 and S17 in the Supporting Information). As shown in c, the zero coverage isosteric heats of adsorption were calculated to be 27 and 29 kJ mol-1 for 2a and 2IRa, respectively. Interestingly, the binding energy values for both compounds are decreasing with an increase in pressure, which implies that the regeneration energy requirement of compound 2a would be much less under ambient conditions. The higher acetylene adsorption capacity in comparison with the other C2 hydrocarbons indicates that the compounds are an attractive material for the selective adsorptive-based separation of acetylene from the three-gas mixture. The stronger interaction between C2H2 and the MOF surface is also reflected in the selectivity estimation of C2H2 over other hydrocarbons employing the IAST model (ideal adsorbed solution theory; details are given in Figures S18-S23 in the Supporting Information) (d). Applying the IAST on pure component isotherms, we have determined the adsorption selectivity of the binary gas mixture of C2H2/C2H4 (1/99 v/v), C2H2/C2H6 (50/50 v/v), and C2H2/CH4 (50/50 v/v) (d). We have used the Langmuir-Freundlich equation to obtain a perfect fit over the single-component isotherms, and the obtained precise fitting parameters were employed to accurately perform the necessary integrations (see the Supporting Information for details of the calculation). The IAST-predicted binary gas mixture selectivities of C2H2 over C2H4, C2H6, and CH4 are 7, 22, and 7, respectively, whereas those for the irradiated compound (2IRa) are 28, 18, and 7 at 100 kPa (d), which are comparable with values found in other reports ().
