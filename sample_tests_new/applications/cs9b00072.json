It was reasonable that the\ndehydration was expected to evaluate the bonding environment, taking\nplace along with the strength of the chemical bond during the thermal\ndecomposition step. Therefore,  thermogravimetric\n(TG) analysis was measured to compare the environment of open metal\nsites for Co-MOF and CoFe-MOF (c).

Comparatively, the initial weight loss of CoFe-MOF\nwas lighter than that of Co-MOF, indicating that the content of water\nmolecules in CoFe-MOF was partially missed (Model B in b).

The potential of Co-MOF increased after  addition of Co2+ impurity and decreased after  addition of Fe2+ impurity, while the potential of CoFe-MOF changed little. In addition, the activation rates of both Co-MOF and CoFe-MOF were free of an obvious influence. The phenomenon indicated that the rate of electrochemical activation is mainly determined by the MOFs. In other words, only the Co or Fe component in the inner framework was the key factor to affect the activation rate.

The oxygen and nitrogen atoms from the organic linker chelated the central metal atom by a single mode in the same plane, and two water molecules coordinated in the vertical plane to adopt an octahedral geometry (Figure S3). Besides, the bond strength of the central metal ion with the ligands (M-OL) was much stronger than that with the water molecule (M-OW), meaning that the property of open metal sites was strongly associated with the state of coordinated water molecules. It was reasonable that the dehydration was expected to evaluate the bonding environment, taking place along with the strength of the chemical bond during the thermal decomposition step.

The XPS survey spectra of as-prepared MOFs confirmed the presence of C, N, O, and Co elements, and the existence of Fe signal for CoFe-MOF and CoFe-MOF-OH also verified  incorporation of the Fe component (Figure S5). The Co, Fe, O, and N atomic percentages of Co-MOF, CoFe-MOF, and CoFe-MOF-OH are shown in Table S2. The O/N ratio of Co-MOF was determined to be 2.8, larger than the theoretical value of 2.5, because of the absorbed water on the surface. After introduction of Fe, the O/N ratio was reduced to 2.6, which can be assumed that the weakening function of chemical bonds M-OW benefited  the exposure of open metal sites for an expedited hydroxide transformation. However, the ratio increased rapidly to 6.1 after electrochemical activation owing to  in-situ formation of the hydroxide function on open metal sites accompanying with the degradation of some organic ligands (Model C in b).\n\nOER Property\n\nThe electrocatalytic performance was measured in 1 M KOH electrolyte, and all of the catalysts were loaded onto a glass carbon electrode by simple drop casting with a loading of 0.212 mg cm-2. Fe-MOF showed a very low current density even at high overpotential, suggesting the poor activity for OER (a). On the contrary, CoFe-MOF exhibited a low overpotential of 351 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2, lower than that of Co-MOF (385 mV), suggesting an enhanced OER performance. A small Tafel slope of CoFe-MOF was 44 mV dec-1, which can provide a significantly increased OER rate with the increased overpotentials (b). By virtue of the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves under different scan rates, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was obtained from  calculation of the electrochemical double-layer capacitances (C dl) (Figure S6). As a result, CoFe-MOF manifested the largest values of C dl (0.40 mF cm-2), implying a great number of active sites (c). After electrochemical activation, CoFe-MOF-OH exhibited the lowest overpotential of 310 mV, which was 41 mV lower than that of CoFe-MOF, and it was also superior to benchmark IrO2 in the high potential range (a). The Tafel slope and the C dl of CoFe-MOF-OH still remained a reasonable value. To estimate the intrinsic activities of catalysts, the LSV curves of Co-MOF, CoFe-MOF, Fe-MOF, and CoFe-MOF-OH were normalized by ECSA (d). CoFe-MOF-OH showed the best OER activity after expedited electrochemical activation, which reflected the real principle for the improved OER performance. Likewise, the TOF value was also related with the intrinsic activity. CoFe-MOF-OH exhibited a remarkable TOF value of 0.4004 s-1 at an overpotential of 400 mV, far exceeding the CoFe-MOF and Co-MOF (e). Moreover, CoFe-MOF-OH also demonstrated good long-term electrochemical durability for at least 40 h (f). Also,  oxygen production remained at a larger current density of 50 mA cm-2 for about 12 h (Figure S7). In order to distinguish the measured current density deriving from the possible dissolution of catalyst, the content of Co and Fe in the electrolyte after the OER duration of 20 and 40 h was also detected by ICP. As shown in Table S1, the deviation of their content in electrolyte is negligible after a long time stability test, indicating the measured current exclusively to the OER as opposed to possible dissolution of the catalyst's constituents. Comprehensively, the electrocatalyst treated with a period of 40 h OER was also surveyed. The electrocatalyst completely reconstructed to 3D crystalline metal oxides (Figure S8). It was interesting that the metal oxides were detected until around 10 min (Figure S8a). It can be seen that the transition state of CoFe-MOF-OH was an indispensable bridging between CoFe-MOF and (Fe1-x Co x )2O3 to contribute to the exposure of active sites. In addition, the native (Fe1-x Co x )2O3, which was directly synthesized by a hydrothermal method, showed a rather poor OER activity and small electrochemically active surface area (Figure S9). In other words, the OER property of derived (Fe1-x Co x )2O3 was still strongly associated with the structure-dependent catalytic performance. \n\nElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was then measured to further probe the transfer kinetics of charge carriers. CoFe-MOF exhibited a small charge transfer resistance (R ct) of 19.2 ohm at a potential of 1.58 V vs RHE, correlated with the fast kinetics of water oxidation, which was far less than that of Co-MOF (114 ohm) and Fe-MOF (949 ohm) (Figure S10).
