As indicated by the XRD pattern in , the crystal structure of UIO-66(DPA) remains unchanged after Eu3+ coordination. The morphology of the obtained materials can be examined by SEM. In Figure S2, the morphology of UIO-66(DPA) is similar to that of UIO-66; this indicates that a moderate amount of DPA did not change the structure of the UIO-66 MOF. Moreover, the morphology of Eu3+-modified UIO-66(DPA) is also similar to that of UIO-66. These results coincide with the changes of XRD. The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis (Figure S3 and Table S3) of the obtained materials also confirms the presence of the nitrogen element and the successful incorporation of Eu3+ in Zr-MOFs. The thermal stability of Eu3+@UIO-66(DPA) was controlled by TGA. The TGA and DTG curves of Eu3+@UIO-66(DPA) are given in Figure S4. The main mass loss peak of Eu3+@UIO-66(DPA) appears at 550 \u00b0C, which indicates that the obtained materials exhibit excellent thermal stability.
