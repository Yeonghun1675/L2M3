Namely, Zr/Hf square tetramers (Zr  4 ) and cubic hexamers have dominated the solution phase chemistry, and materials formed from the solution phase. We have shown that the compositionally simple but complexly reactive peroxide ligand can disassemble these stable building units, yielding unprecedented cluster topologies, including Zr  25 , the largest Zr/Hf polycation to date, yet it is readily dissolved in organic solvent. Using this cluster and its smaller fragments to build cluster-based materials is one future pursuit. The reaction pathway of Zr  4  to peroxide ligated oligomers (with 3 to 6 nuclearity) to Zr  25  in water is partially reversible, controlled by the self-buffering pH of dissolved Zr. On the other hand, the conversion of Zr  4  to the oxo-centered tetrahedron ZrT  d  goes through formation of larger cluster assemblies that are yet to be isolated and identified. This study provides a new mechanism and dimension to expanding Zr/Hf cluster chemistry via peroxide-promoted disassembly reassembly. In addition, the bridging motif of the peroxide ligand observed in Zr  25  and ZrT  d  provides structure and reactivity models for Zr/Hf-sulfate-peroxide lithographic processes (a topic of future study). The high solubility of Zr  25  and ZrT  d , the yet-to-be isolated reaction intermediates, and analogous Hf chemistry all provide future direction and opportunity in group IV solution and solid-state chemistry.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 32, "type": "text", "classification": ["synthesis condition"], "content": "<title>Experimental\nSection</title><title>Synthesis</title><p>\n<bold>Zr</bold>\n<sub>\n<bold>4</bold>\n</sub>:\nCommercial zirconium basic carbonate (ZBC, Alfa Aesar, Lot X09A021,\nHf unseparated, about 1 mol % Hf/Zr, assayed at 41.5 wt % (Zr + Hf)\u00adO<sub>2</sub>, 12.29 g (0.0377 mol of Zr + Hf)) was added to a mixture\nof 25 mL of H<sub>2</sub>O (deionized, 18 M\u03a9) + 12.20 g of 62.1\nwt % perchloric acid, warmed to 65 \u00b0C.
