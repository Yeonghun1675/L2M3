The optical band gap is defined as the minimum energy needed to excite an electron from the top of the VB to the bottom of the CB. The optical band gap is smaller than the fundamental band gap because of the electrostatic interaction between the photogenerated charges (electrons and holes). The measured optical band gap is ca. 3.6 eV (345 nm) and 2.6 eV (475 nm) for MIL-125 and MIL-125-NH2, respectively. We calculate the optical band gap using LR-TDDFT as implemented in the CP2K code. We find that the 0 K optical band gap is 4.44 and 3.36 eV for MIL-125 and MIL-125-NH2, respectively. As expected, the 0 K optical band gap is about 1 eV smaller than the 0 K fundamental band gap (), revealing a large excitonic effect, which is consistent with the low density of these materials and with their low dielectric constants (see calculations in the Supporting Information). By including the previously computed band gap renormalization, we finally obtain an optical band gap at room temperature of 3.69 and 2.61 eV for MIL-125 and its amino counterpart, in remarkable agreement with the measured optical band gaps ().\n\n  reports the relaxation energies for the negative (E -) and the positive (E +) polarons for the two MOFs. The negative polaron relaxes by -0.34 and -0.50 eV for MIL-125 and MIL-125-NH2, respectively. As shown in a,b, the electron induces a distortion that breaks the crystal symmetry. As a result, the charge localizes in a section of the metal cluster. To further describe the observed polaronic states, we also evaluate the corresponding binding energies, employing a grand canonical formulation of defects in semiconductors (see the Supporting Information for details). The electron polaron is found 0.44 and 0.69 eV below the CB edge, in MIL and MIL-NH2, respectively. Because the CB edge for these materials is made up of the same states at almost equivalent energy, the electron polarons are found at very similar energies. For the hole, the relaxation energies are -0.04 and -0.19 eV for de-aminated and aminated MOFs, respectively. In both cases, the hole localizes into one of the linkers of the crystal, as shown in a,b. The higher stabilization in MIL-125-NH2 may be ascribed to the electron donor nature of the amino group. Hole polarons are found to occur as shallow states with binding energies of 0.08 and 0.15 eV, for MIL and MIL-NH2, respectively.\n\nIt is interesting to note that we make this prediction for a material that has not yet been synthesized. To confirm these predictions, we synthesized MIL-125-NH2-[10%](OH)2 and we performed transient absorption spectroscopy for this material (see the Supporting Information for details on the synthesis and the measurements) and its pure amino counterpart MIL-125-NH2.
