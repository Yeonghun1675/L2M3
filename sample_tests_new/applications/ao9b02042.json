It can also be clearly seen that UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 has much higher light absorption compared with Ag3PO4.

Furthermore, these results confirm that the heterojunction interface was successfully constructed between the UMOFNs and Ag3PO4 because their suitable band positions could easily migrate photoinduced charge carriers at the hetero-interface.\n\nThe chemical composition of UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 was evaluated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. a gives the XPS survey spectrum of UMOFNs/Ag3PO4, which indicates UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 is composed of C, O, P, Ni, Co, and Ag. In addition, no peaks for other elements were observed, confirming UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 was of high purity. In b, the C 1s spectrum of the composite photocatalyst has two peaks located at 284.5 and 288.1 eV. The strong peak at 284.5 eV corresponds to C\ue5fbC for aromatic hydrocarbons, while the small peak at 288.1 eV is associated with the C-O in carbonate species. c shows the O 1s peak of the composite photocatalyst at 531.2 eV is associated with the Ni-O bond, Co-O bond, or hydroxyl oxygen. d displays the P 2p spectrum of the composite photocatalyst, which is associated with the phosphorus from PO4 3-. In e, the Co 2p spectrum gives two main peaks at 781.2 and 785.2 eV. The former is associated with Co 2p3/2, while the latter corresponds to the shakeup satellite peak, indicative of the presence of Co2+. It can be seen in f that the composite photocatalyst showed two Ni 2p peaks located at 856.3 and 861.8 eV, which were attributed to the characteristic peak of Ni2+ (Ni 2p3/2) and its shakeup satellite peak, respectively. As shown in g, the two peaks located at 367.9 and 373.9 eV were assigned to Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2, indicating the presence of Ag+ in the composite photocatalyst.

Figure S4 shows the photocatalytic degradation of 2-CP over UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 composite photocatalysts with different amounts of UMOFNs (1, 5, 10, 20, and 30%).

UMOFNs were also unable to degrade 2-CP under visible-light irradiation.
