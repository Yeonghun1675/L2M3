To address such issues, for the first time, we design and synthesize FeNi3-Fe3O4 heterogeneous nanoparticles (NPs) homogenously anchored on a matrix of metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheets and carbon nanotubes (FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT) by a facile hydrothermal reaction and subsequent partial decomposition of a low-cost and earth-abundant Ni/Fe/C precursor. Due to its unique porous nanoarchitecture constructed by ultrafine nanoparticles anchored on two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets/one-dimensional (1D) CNT matrix, it can be employed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst with superior electrocatalytic activity for water splitting: it delivers a small Tafel slope of 37 mV/dec for OER and requires only a very low overpotential of 234 mV to obtain 10 mA/cm2; it has a very low overpotential of 108 mV for HER and also shows an ultralow overpotential of 360 mV to reach 10 mA/cm2 for overall water splitting by outperforming the precious-metal-based electrocatalysts (Pt/C and RuO2; 393 mV at \u03b710). Moreover, it exhibits excellent long-term stability. This work presents a rational nanoarchitecture design and facile fabrication strategy to obtain nonprecious metal-based electrocatalysts with high efficiency and excellent long-lasting abilities.\n\nTherefore, it is possible to develop extremely active and robust semi-MOF derivatives by combining the advantages of carbon nanotube (CNT) and the partial pyrolysis strategy. Herein, for the first time, we synthesize FeNi3-Fe3O4 heterogeneous nanoparticles homogenously anchored on a matrix of MOF nanosheets and carbon nanotubes (FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT), by a facile hydrothermal reaction and subsequent partial thermal decomposition of NiFe0.5-MOF/CNT. Due to its unique three-dimensional (3D) porous nanoarchitecture fabricated by ultrathin nanoparticles anchored on two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets/one-dimensional (1D) CNT matrix, there are abundant active catalytic sites in the FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT hybrid, which makes it a bifunctional electrocatalyst with superior electrocatalytic performance for water splitting. This hybrid delivers an ultralow overpotential of 234 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm2 in the OER process on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE), surpassing those of as-prepared NiFe0.5-MOF, NiFe0.5-MOF/CNT, FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF (prepared by partial annealing of NiFe0.5-MOF), commercial RuO2, and the non-noble-metal catalysts reported earlier (Table S1). However, in HER, it displays an overpotential of 108 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm2 on a glassy carbon electrode, exceeding all other materials prepared herein. This material also shows better performance in overall water splitting with an overpotential of 360 mV to reach 10 mA/cm2 current density by outperforming the noble-metal catalyst combination (393 mV at \u03b710). Moreover, FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT exhibits appreciable stability and performance even after 20 h for long-term OER, HER, and water-splitting processes.\n\nMeasurements of Electrocatalytic Performance\n\nAll of the electrocatalytic properties (HER, OER, and water splitting) of these materials were tested in an alkaline solution (1 M KOH) at an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660D) with a standard three-electrode system at ambient temperature (298 K). A home-made three-compartment electrode cell setup is used with a working electrode as constructed electrocatalysts (RuO2, CNT, NiFe x -MOF, NiFe0.5-MOF@300, NiFe0.5-MOF@400, NiFe0.5-MOF@500, NiFe0.5-MOF/CNT, NiFe0.5-MOF/CNT@300, NiFe0.5-MOF/CNT@400, NiFe0.5-MOF/CNT@500, FeNi3 NPs/MOF, and Fe3O4 NPs/MOF) modified at the glassy carbon electrode (GCE), the counter electrode as a graphite rod, and the reference electrode as a saturated mercury/mercury oxide (Hg/HgO) in alkaline solution (1 M KOH). Throughout the OER performance, the measured potential values corresponding to Hg/HgO in 1 M KOH were corrected versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) as follows: E RHE = E Hg/HgO + 0.923 V. The overpotential from the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) polarization measurements was calculated based on the E (RHE) - 1.23 V formula. Catalysts are drop-casted onto a 3 mm diameter polished GCE with a loading of ~0.28 mg/cm2, and then dried at 50 \u00b0C in an electric hot-oven. Next, 4 mg of as-prepared electrocatalysts is dispersed using a sonoprobe for 10 min in 1 mL of a mixed solution of 3:1 ratio of water/ethanol content (750:250 \u03bcL) with 50 \u03bcL of Nafion (homogeneously dispersed ink) to achieve the electrocatalyst-modified GCE. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) polarization measurements are performed at 0.005 V/s to find the onset overpotentials (at various current densities (j)). The Tafel slopes were extracted from the corresponding LSV plots in order to access the OER kinetics. Double-layer capacitances (C dl) were also measured from the cyclic voltammogram (CV) in an alkaline solution. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in the frequency range between 100 kHz and 0.1 Hz. The long-lasting abilities of FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT were examined by continuous voltage chronoamperometry using a carbon cloth (1 \u00d7 1 cm2). For the overall water-splitting test, a two-electrode setup was constructed by using two aforementioned GCE working electrodes with the same catalyst loading of 0.28 mg/cm2. Faradaic efficiency is another important parameter in the water electrolysis process, which describes the efficiency of electric charge toward facilitating the electrochemical reaction. To calculate the faradaic efficiency, the FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT catalyst was loaded on a 1 cm2 carbon cloth (loading: 2 mg/cm2) to conduct HER and OER reactions, and the amounts of oxygen (O2) and hydrogen (H2) released were measured by gas chromatography (GC-2018PT, Shimadzu, argon as the carrier gas) at a constant current of 20 mA. The detailed calculation process is displayed in the Supporting Information (SI). All of the above-mentioned electrochemical studies have been repeated twice to ensure reliability and reproducibility of all of the reported results.\n\nStructural and Physicochemical Properties of FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT\n\nThe crystal structure features of obtained materials were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis. The associated powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for the FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF and FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT are shown in a, where the bimetallic MOF (NiFe0.5-MOF) and its CNT composite (NiFe0.5-MOF/CNT) prepared display similar XRD patterns with Fe-MIL-88B (CCDC no. 1415803; Figure S1a), demonstrating the successful construction of a MIL-type architecture via a solvothermal process. The corresponding characteristic diffraction peaks of the annealed samples at 400 \u00b0C confirmed the presence of two different phases, i.e., FeNi3 alloy and Fe3O4 nanoparticles in NiFe0.5-MOF and its CNT composite. The XRD patterns of FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT match with cubic FeNi3 (44.27\u00b0 (111), 51.53\u00b0 (200), and 75.86\u00b0 (220), JCPDS PDF# 38-0419) with a highly symmetric space group Pm3\u0305m (221), and the remaining diffraction peaks are indexed to cubic Fe3O4 (30.09\u00b0 (220), 35.42\u00b0 (311), 43.05\u00b0 (400), 56.94\u00b0 (511), and 62.51\u00b0 (440), JCPDS PDF# 19-0629) with a highly symmetric space group Fd3\u0305m (227). As shown in a, the XRD diffraction peaks belonging to the pristine MOF or the MOF/CNT composite still remain in the annealed samples, demonstrating the persistence of the crystalline bimetallic MOF structure even after annealing treatment as we intended (evidenced by the (100) plane at 9.09\u00b0). Attempts to prepare nanoparticles within the MOF architecture at higher temperatures, such as at 500 \u00b0C, for 1 h under a N2 atmosphere led to the complete decomposition of the MOF skeleton and produced Fe3O4 and FeNi3 heterostructural nanoparticles (Figure S1b). Particularly, the diffraction peaks assigned to Fe3O4 were not clearly noticed in the XRD pattern compared to FeNi3, which may be due to the small grain size and concise diffraction peak intensity of Fe3O4. Similarly, NiFe0.5-MOF after annealing displayed the XRD patterns of FeNi3 and Fe3O4 heterogeneous particles within the MOF skeleton (FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF). Besides, diffraction peaks corresponding to CNT are not quite noticeable in XRD, while they were clearly evidenced by Raman spectroscopy.\n\nThe hysteresis diagram of NiFe0.5-MOF, NiFe0.5-MOF/CNT, FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF, and FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT reflects surface areas of 84.11, 154.74, 31.77, and 104.15 m2/g, respectively. The average N2-adsorption pore diameters are 13.03, 7.62, 14.22, and 14.46 nm (4 V/A by BET) for NiFe0.5-MOF, NiFe0.5-MOF/CNT, FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF, and FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT, respectively. The inclusion of CNT with NiFe0.5-MOF shows a high surface area than the materials without CNT addition (c,d and S2), whereas the obtained results endorse the mesoporous behaviors of materials with a greatly enlarged surface area, which is consistent with the earlier reports on materials anchored by CNT. More essentially, BET analysis reveals the existence of the surface area of annealed samples to that of pristine MOF materials. FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF (31.77 m2/g) engaged 37.8% of the initial specific surface area of its pristine NiFe0.5-MOF (84.11 m2/g), while FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT (104.15 m2/g) retained 67.3% of the initial specific surface area of the NiFe0.5-MOF/CNT composite (154.74 m2/g), thus confirming the existence of the microporous nature of NiFe0.5-MOF and NiFe0.5-MOF/CNT after controlled pyrolysis.

The analysis revealed the coexistence of Ni, Fe, O, and C elements in FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT. The high-resolution XPS spectra of Ni 2p and Fe 2p were further analyzed, and the data of FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF and FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT are presented in  (Figures S3 and S4). The Ni 2p peak located at 855.69 eV in the XPS spectrum indicates the valence state of +2 in FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT, the typical Fe 2p peaks at 710.9 and 724.0 eV () represent the oxidation state of +2, and the peaks at 714.4 and 726.1 eV confirm the presence of the +3 oxidation state of iron in Fe3O4. The high-resolution Ni 2p emission spectra (Ni 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 with binding energy difference \u0394E g = 17.81 eV) can be deconvoluted in between the range of 850 and 885 eV into two strong bands with parallel satellite peaks (a). Besides, a typical Ni0 peak appeared at 852.6 and 870.01 eV for FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT, which confirms the presence of FeNi3 particles. Similarly, the Fe 2p emission spectrum (Fe 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 with binding energy differences \u0394E = 13.1 eV) also appears in between the binding energies of 700 and 735 eV and was deconvoluted into four strong peaks with corresponding satellite peaks at 719.6 and 732.4 eV, which further provides very good agreement with the characteristics of typical Fe3O4 nanoparticles. In addition, small peaks at 706.52 and 722.4 eV signify the presence of Fe0 in FeNi3. \n\nEvolution of Electrocatalytic Behavior\n\nOxygen Evolution Reaction\n\nNi-/Fe-based electrocatalysts have demonstrated great potential in replacing precious-metal-based catalysts, particularly in the process of the oxygen evolution reaction, due to their unique physicochemical abilities, earth-abundant nature, and low cost. Particularly, in Ni-/Fe-based electrocatalysts, nickel is considered as the active metal center for oxygen evolution, while the incorporation of iron would lead to the existence of a synergistic effect, followed by changes in intrinsic properties of mixed-metal catalysts, thus promoting the OER performance. Ni-/Fe-bimetallic MOFs isolated in this study can directly be used as electrocatalysts to investigate their OER performance without any annealing treatment as reported earlier. The OER performance of as-prepared NiFe x -MOF (x = 0.75, 0.5, 0.25) was evaluated with a typical three-electrode system in an O2-saturated 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution at room temperature (Figure S7a). The potential values are calibrated against the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Among the bimetallic NiFe x -MOFs prepared, NiFe0.5-MOF displayed the best OER performance with the overpotential of 281 mV at the current density of 10 mA/cm2.\n\nConsequently, the best bimetallic MOF has been subjected to controlled partial oxidation to prepare the nanoparticle-embedded MOFs and to realize the annealing effect on electrocatalysis. In controlled experiments, the influence of different annealing temperatures (300, 400, and 500 \u00b0C, samples denoted NiFe0.5-MOF@300, NiFe0.5-MOF@400 (confirmed as FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF), and NiFe0.5-MOF@500) of the samples was tested by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements (Figure S7b). The optimal annealing temperature of the sample for OER performance was 400 \u00b0C, and the NiFe0.5-MOF@400 displayed improved OER performance with 261 mV overpotential at the current density of 10 mA/cm2, which is considerably better than the as-prepared MOF due to the existence of FeNi3-Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs). Keeping this improved performance in mind, the CNT-anchored bimetallic MOF composite (NiFe0.5-MOF/CNT) has been prepared and was subjected to controlled partial oxidation at 300, 400, and 500 \u00b0C (denoted NiFe0.5-MOF/CNT@300, NiFe0.5-MOF/CNT@400, and NiFe0.5-MOF/CNT@500) under a N2 flow to prepare CNT-anchored FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF in the MOF architecture. Among them, NiFe0.5-MOF/CNT@400 (confirmed as FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT) displayed phenomenal OER performance (Figure S9a) compared to the bimetallic MOFs prepared without CNT and FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF prepared by partial annealing treatment. The commercial RuO2, bare glassy carbon electrode, and pure CNT were also tested for comparison.\n\nAs expected, RuO2 displays a good OER activity with an overpotential of 271 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2, whereas the bare glassy carbon electrode and CNT do not display OER activity, which was consistent with previous reports. It was evidently found that the NiFe0.5-MOF, NiFe0.5-MOF/CNT, FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF, and FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT all exhibit superior OER activity (a). Among them, the FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT (R = 8.10 \u03a9) electrocatalyst displays the best OER performance with the smallest onset overpotential of 108 mV (versus RHE), achieving the current density of 10 mV/cm2 at an overpotential (\u03b710) of 234 mV in alkaline solution, which was lower than that of NiFe0.5-MOF (281 mV; R = 8.26 \u03a9), NiFe0.5-MOF/CNT (271 mV; R = 7.06 \u03a9), and FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF (261 mV; R = 8.35 \u03a9). Moreover, as shown in , compared to commercial CNT, NiFe0.5-MOF, FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF, and NiFe0.5-MOF/CNT, the FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT synthesized by controlled partial oxidation of NiFe0.5-MOF/CNT shows the best OER performance in alkaline solution, which is mainly attributed to the unique nanostructural architecture and the synergistic effect of the FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT electrocatalyst together with the modification of the surface electronic state of FeNi3 caused by the Fe3O4. However, the as-prepared FeNi3 (\u03b710 = 358 mV) and Fe3O4 (\u03b710 = 406 mV) nanoparticles have not displayed significant OER activity. Besides, the recent theoretical calculation studies on electrocatalysts also approve the possible electronic modification in heterogeneous nanoparticles, which can enhance the catalytic performance. However, the experimental innovations confirmed that the heterogeneous nanoparticles indeed improve the catalytic performance due to the modification of the electronic structure. In this study, to scrutinize the strong electron interaction between FeNi3 and Fe3O4, which is able to improve the \"electrophilicity of NiFe0.5-MOF@400 (Fe3O4-FeNi3 NPs/MOF)\", we prepared new samples of Fe3O4 NPs/MOF and FeNi3 NPs/MOF and measured their catalytic performance for comparison. As shown in Figure S8, one can observe that the performance of Fe3O4-FeNi3 NPs/MOF (NiFe0.5-MOF@400; \u03b710 = 261 mV) is better than those of Fe3O4 NPs/MOF (\u03b710 = 341 mV) and FeNi3 NPs/MOF (\u03b710 = 316 mV). This OER activity test suggests the existence of strong interactions between FeNi3 and Fe3O4, which can improve the catalytic performance.

To further investigate the surface status and overall structure (morphology and composition changes) of the FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT material during the water oxidation process, SEM and XPS characterizations were performed after a 20 h i-t test and also XRD and XPS tests were performed after 5000 CV cycles. Figure S15 displays the SEM images of FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT before and after the OER process. Obviously, the nanosheets, like the CNT network structure, well remained after the i-t test, demonstrating robust structural stability. As it was evidenced earlier for Ni-based electrocatalysts, the actual active species could be nickel hydroxide during the OER process. To have a clear understanding of the active species during the OER process, the FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT after the 20 h i-t test was subjected to XPS analysis. The high-resolution XPS core-level spectra of Ni 2p and Fe 2p regions of FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT after the i-t test revealed the existence of Ni0, Ni2+, Fe0, Fe2+, and Fe3+ ions, which signifies the phenomenal stability of the material during the OER process (Figure S16). Similar XPS results have been obtained for FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT after 5000 CV cycles during the OER process (Figure S17). In addition to this, the FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT material after 5000 CV cycles for OER was analyzed by the powder XRD technique. As presented in Figure S18, the FeNi3 (JCPDS PDF# 38-0419) and Fe3O4 (JCPDS PDF# 19-0629) heterostructural nanoparticles still exist in the material, signifying its phenomenal stability during OER processes in the alkaline solution. Interestingly, the XRD peak corresponding to the MOF material [at 9.09\u00b0 (100)] did not appear, which can be attributed to the small grain size and concise diffraction peak intensity of the MOF material in the sample.\n\nTo further clarify the high OER activity of FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT, the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (C dl) was evaluated in a non-faradaic capacitive current range by operating cyclic voltammograms to estimate the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) (a and S10). The capacitance of FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT (1.63 mF/cm2) was larger than that of the NiFe0.5-MOF (0.13 mF/cm2), NiFe0.5-MOF/CNT (0.21 mF/cm2), and FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF (0.84 mF/cm2), demonstrating its large surface area with highly exposed active centers for the OER process (a). Moreover, the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT is estimated by conducting cyclic voltammograms after the 20 h i-t test to investigate the active sites and specific surface area. Interestingly, the C dl value detected after the i-t test (1.62 mF/cm2; Figure S19) is almost the same as the C dl value estimated before the i-t test, suggesting the similar active sites and specific surface area. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also conducted to investigate the catalytic kinetics under the OER process. Nyquist plots of NiFe0.5-MOF (71.9 \u03a9), NiFe0.5-MOF/CNT (39.61 \u03a9), and FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF (18.98 \u03a9) are higher than FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT (13.2 \u03a9), suggesting the least charge transfer resistance, which is in accordance with the result of its large surface area (BET), C dl values, and lower Tafel slope. Although FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT (1.63 mF/cm2) has a higher ECSA value over FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF (0.84 mF/cm2), the specific activity calculated by normalizing the current to the ECSA was found to be almost the same for both the electrocatalysts (Figure S12b), signifying the similar intrinsic catalytic abilities during the OER process. Obviously, the higher C dl value and the presence of the conductive CNT matrix in FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT as well as the significantly lowered charge transfer resistance (13.2 \u03a9) clearly emphasize the boost in the catalytic active surface area, which can be attributed to the interface coupling effect between the FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs and the CNT support.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "FeNi3\u2013Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "FeNi3\u2013Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT"}, "catalytic activity": [{"value": "98.5", "unit": "%", "time": "", "condition": "for O2 generation"}], "equation": [{"equation name": "Tafel equation", "value": "h = blogj + a", "parameters": "j stands for current density and b stands for the Tafel slope"}]}]], "include_properties": ["catalytic_activity", "equation"]}, {"idx": "31, 33, 34, 36", "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<p>Besides, the obtained ECSA values of FeNi<sub>3</sub>\u2013Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> NPs/MOF (0.84 mF/cm<sup>2</sup>) and FeNi<sub>3</sub>\u2013Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> NPs/MOF-CNT\n(1.63 mF/cm<sup>2</sup>) together with their retained surface areas\n(31.77 and 104.15\nm<sup>2</sup>/g, respectively) after controlled thermal treatment\nsuggested that most of the active metal sites in the FeNi<sub>3</sub>\u2013Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> NPs/MOF material would have been\nembedded in the bulk phase produced due to the substantial decomposition,\nthereby displaying lower efficiency during the OER process.

Similarly, the amount of hydrogen generated during the water electrolysis process and its faradaic efficiency were also detected by loading (2 mg/cm2) the FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT material on the 1 cm2 carbon cloth.

The faradaic efficiency of the FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT electrode for H2 generation is 96.8%, suggesting that the introduced electric charge is completely used for the water electrolysis process. \n\nOverall Water Splitting\n\nThe superior electrocatalytic activity of FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT for both OER and HER processes unveils its exceptional potential as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting. Therefore, FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT was used to prepare GCE-modified electrocatalysts with the same catalyst loading of 0.28 mg/cm2, which are used as both the anode and cathode to construct a two-electrode cell in an alkaline medium to investigate the water-splitting ability. The FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT electrocatalyst displayed an overpotential of 360 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and is consistent with the sum of overpotentials of its HER (108 mV) and OER (234 mV) at the same current density (a), while the FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF developed without CNTs displayed an overpotential of 449 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm2. Interestingly, our best catalyst outperforms the water-splitting ability of the benchmark precious-metal catalyst combination (Pt/C: cathode; RuO2: anode), which displays an overpotential of 393 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm2 (b). This study demonstrated the significance of a conductive CNT matrix in developing MOF-derived electrocatalysts for overall water splitting than the materials prepared without conductive additives including CNTs, graphene oxide, and so on. A similar effect has been noticed recently by MOF-derived layered reduced graphene oxide-supported CoP (CoP/rGO-400) with an overpotential of 470 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2, which actually outperforms the noble-metal combination (Pt/C and IrO2; \u03b710 is 480 mV) in overall water splitting. \n\nBesides this, the excellent water-splitting ability of FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/MOF-CNT (360 mV) is in great agreement with other transition-metal-based oxide bifunctional catalysts reported recently, i.e., FeNi3/NiFeO x  nanohybrid (320 mV), octahedral Co3O4 electrocatalyst (370 mV), carbon fiber paper-supported NiFeO x  (NiFeO x /CFP) (280 mV), and the other metal alloys decorated MOF derivatives.
