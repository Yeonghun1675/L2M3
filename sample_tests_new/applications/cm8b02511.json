Single crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD) reveals that FDM-22 crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/m space group, and Zn-based secondary building units (SBUs) in paddle-wheel geometry connect with BPDC to construct square grids.

It is not surprising that FDM-22 is doubly interpenetrated, with the SBUs from the second framework sit in the body center of the first framework.

Two representative adsorption isotherms are shown in a, and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of FDM-22S and FDM-22V are calculated to be 135 and 112 m2 g-1, respectively. Despite similar profiles at the P/P 0 < 0.45 region for both samples, FDM-22S shows a more significant N2 uptake with hysteresis afterward, suggesting more mesopores. The surface area values are far below the theoretical value based on pristine FDM-22 (3201 m2 g-1, see the Supporting Information), indicating evident structure transformation upon solvent removal. The pore size distribution of FDM-22S shows both micropores at ~1.2 nm and a wide range of mesopores at 3.0-10.0 nm (Figure S13). Local structure collapse due to the Zn-N coordination dissociations was accounted for the mesopore formation. On the other hand, FDM-22V shows a 42% mesopore volume loss compared to FDM-22S (a) in the 3.0-10.0 nm range, suggesting mesopores closing induced by the unbearable amount of defects and extensive collapse in the dilapidated frameworks.\n\nThe coordination bond dissociations in the FDM-22 could also be demonstrated by probing the coordination environment of Zn with the sensitive XPS. As shown in c, deconvolution of the Zn 2p3/2 regions reveals the presence of two distinct Zn 2p3/2 peaks for all three samples.

The 0.7 eV shift of Zn 2p3/2 peaks is in accordance with that in similar 5-coordinated Zn-based complexes when the axial Zn-N bond dissociates, such as the shift from 1021.8 to 1022.1 eV when (ammine)(tetraphenylporphyrinato)Zn(II) eliminates the NH3 ligand.
