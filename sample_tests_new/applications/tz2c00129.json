A bimetallic MOF, namely BUT-85 (BUT = Beijing University of Technology), has been successfully synthesized with a rationally designed pyrazolate-carboxylate ligand. Its robust [Ni2(OH)(H2O)2Pz3] n  chain (Pz = pyrazolate) with bridging OH-/H2O and pyrazolate groups is reported for the first time. This material shows good chemical stability in water and aqueous solutions with a pH range from 3 to 13. In addition, BUT-85 exhibits preferential adsorption behavior of C2H2 over CO2. It is proposed to be attributed to the abundant exposed bridging OH-/H2O sites in [Ni2(OH)(H2O)2Pz3] n  chains, which is supported by the results of molecular simulations. Column breakthrough experiments further confirm that this MOF can realize efficient C2H2/CO2 separation. This strategy can not only enrich the structural library of MOFs but also optimize their properties and functions for promoting applications.\n\nThe permanent porosity of BUT-85 was determined by N2 sorption measurements at 77 K. As shown in a, the saturated N2 uptake of BUT-85 is 204.8 cm3 g-1, and its evaluated Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area reaches 730.3 m2 g-1. On the basis of the N2 adsorption data, the pore size distribution of BUT-85 is evaluated to be in the range of 9.9-13.4 \u00c5 by the calculation with a nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) model, being close to the result of crystallographic structure analysis (Figure S10).\n\nTo further explore the properties of BUT-85, its thermal and chemical stabilities were evaluated based on thermogravimetric curves, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns and N2 isotherms. As shown in Figure S8, this bimetallic MOF can be stable in the air up to 400 \u00b0C, demonstrating its good thermal stability. Then, the chemical stability of BUT-85 was tested by soaking activated MOF samples in different aqueous solutions. As shown in a,b, after being immersed into water or aqueous solutions with pH of 3 and 13, the PXRD peak intensities and N2 uptakes of the treated samples remain almost unchanged, further indicating the high chemical resistance of BUT-85.\n\nIt is well-known that rare-earth-carboxylate MOFs are generally labile to water because the weak coordination bonds would accelerate the substitution reaction of water molecules to organic ligands. Therefore, we speculate that the good acid/base stability of BUT-85 may be mainly attributed to the robust [Ni2(OH)(H2O)2Pz3] n  chain and rare-earth cluster chain SBUs. After 40 mg of BUT-85 was soaked in 50 mL of water at room temperature for 24 h, the residual solution was taken for inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) measurements. The concentrations of Yb3+ (6.38 \u00d7 10-6 mg mL-1) and Ni2+ (3.45 \u00d7 10-6 mg mL-1) were detected in the solution, demonstrating almost no metal ion was leaked out from BUT-85. This result further confirmed the good chemical stability of BUT-85 in water and its potential to be exploited in significant applications.\n\nThe abundant exposed bridging OH-/H2O and good chemical stability of BUT-85 suggest that it could be a good sorbent candidate for gases. In addition, the C2H2/CO2 separation is particularly important in the industry but challenging because of their similar physical properties and molecular shapes/sizes, in which porous MOF materials have great potential. Single-component adsorption isotherms of BUT-85 for C2H2 and CO2 were measured at 298 and 273 K. As illustrated in a, at 298 K and 101.325 kPa, BUT-85 shows 66.01 and 28.84 cm3 g-1 of C2H2 and CO2 uptakes, respectively, affording preferential adsorption of C2H2 over CO2. The isosteric heats of adsorption (Q st) values for C2H2 and CO2 were calculated to be ~35.4 and ~16.6 kJ mol-1 in BUT-85, indicating this MOF has a strong C2H2 affinity, which can be comparable to other benchmark MOF materials (c and Table S2). Moreover, the gas selectivity of C2H2 over CO2 for BUT-85 was predicted by using the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) on the binary mixture (50/50 volume ratio) based on single-component adsorption isotherms. As shown in b, the simulated C2H2/CO2 selectivity ranges between 6.1 and 12.1 for BUT-85. Particularly, this selectivity value exceeds those observed in most of other reported MOFs (Table S2). As presented in Figure S11, the cycling adsorption experiments revealed that BUT-85 could maintain its adsorption performances over at least three cycles. These results demonstrated the potential of BUT-85 in a practical application for C2H2/CO2 separation.\n\nTo further probe the C2H2/CO2 separation performance of BUT-85 in the practical process, column breakthrough experiments were conducted. An equal proportion of mixed gases of C2H2/CO2 flowed through the packed column of activated MOF samples with a flow rate of 2 mL min-1 at 298 K. The experimental results presented in d revealed that CO2 passed through the fixed bed at first, whereas no C2H2 was found until a final dimensionless time of 178, demonstrating the successful separation of C2H2/CO2 mixture achieved by BUT-85. Remarkably, the C2H2 retention dimensionless time for BUT-85 (132) can be comparable to those of other MOF materials with good performance on C2H2/CO2 separation under the same conditions. In addition, BUT-85 could also maintain its separation performance and porous structure after three cycles, verifying the good recyclability of this MOF (Figure S16).\n\nTo understand the selective adsorption behavior of C2H2 over CO2 for BUT-85, grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out. As shown in Figure S17, the simulated adsorption isotherms for C2H2 and CO2 of BUT-85 matched well with the experimental ones, suggesting the reasonableness of the molecular simulation model built to understand the adsorption behavior of BUT-85. Both C2H2 and CO2 molecules preferentially occupy the bridging hydroxyl sites of the [Ni2(OH)(H2O)2Pz3] n  chains in the quadrilateral channels through van der Waals interactions (). As indicated, one C\ue5f8H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O (2.62 \u00c5) and six C\ue5f8H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 (2.96-3.46 \u00c5) interactions were found for each adsorbed C2H2 molecule. By contrast, CO2 exhibits two C\ue5fbO\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5H interactions (3.23-3.46 \u00c5) and one C\ue5fbO\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C interaction (3.58 \u00c5) with one benzene ring. In addition, the calculated static C2H2 binding energy value is 31.5 kJ mol-1, considerably higher than the value of CO2 (19.2 kJ mol-1), which is similar to the experimental Q st values. These calculation results clearly proved that the exposed bridging hydroxyl sites of the [Ni2(OH)(H2O)2Pz3] n  chains could be strong C2H2 binding sites, thus promoting the selective adsorption of C2H2 over CO2 for BUT-85.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "BUT-85", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "porosity": [{"probe": "N2", "value": "204.8", "unit": "cm3/g", "condition": "77 K"}], "surface area": [{"type": "Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller", "probe": "N2", "value": "730.3", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": "77 K"}]}]], "include_properties": ["porosity", "surface_area"]}, {"idx": 6, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Crystal structures of MOFs: (a) One-dimensional pore channels\nof <bold>BUT-85</bold> view along the <italic toggle=\"yes\">c</italic>-axis.
