In DMA and DMSO cases, ELM leakage from the composite into the two solvents is suggested to be the main reason for the sensor's special luminescence behavior (Figure S22). The interesting sensing behaviors can be further used for 1D code recognition of solvents based on the emission peak height ratio. In comparison with the above luminescent measurement based on a single emission, such a self-referencing ratiometric luminescence method has the ability to overcome errors caused by optical occlusion, concentration inhomogeneities, excitation power fluctuations, or environment-induced nonradiative relaxation during the measurement. Thus, it is more accurate and reliable. Using this method, DMA, DMSO, DMF, and MeOH with I  MOF/I FRS values of 2.53, 2.19, 1.19, and 0.72, respectively, can be undoubtedly recognized. However, for the other 10 VOSs, the values are in the range of 1.03-0.85 and the difference between them is less than 0.1. Even a ratiometric luminescence method cannot be used to differentiate them. Interestingly, under illumination at 365 nm, B4 changed to blue upon exposure to DMA and DMSO, while it was green upon exposure to other VOSs. Therefore, B4 is a sensitive luminescent sensor that can enable the detection of DMA and DMSO that is visible to the naked eye.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 23, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig5\" position=\"float\">\n<label>5</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Emission spectra (a), the corresponding 1D code map based on ratiometric\nintensities (b), and photographic images (c) of the emulsions of <bold>B4</bold> in different solvents under UV light illumination (365\nnm).</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr5\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cg0c01026_0005.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 5  Emission spectra (a), the corresponding 1D code map based on ratiometric intensities (b), and photographic images (c) of the emulsions of B4 in different solvents under UV light illumination (365 nm).

According to the literature, the quenching of 1 by the NACs can be clarified as the result of several points, including MOF to NAC electron transfer, as evidenced by a comparison of the HOMOs and LUMOs of H2L and all the NACs calculated through density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G* level (Figure S30A), MOF to NAC resonance energy transfer, as established by the spectral overlap between the emission spectrum of 1 and the absorption spectra of some NACs (Figure S30B), weak supramolecular interactions between the ligands and NACs, etc.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 31, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The quenching behavior of <bold>B4</bold> was also investigated,\nand the results are shown in <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.cgd.0c01026/suppl_file/cg0c01026_si_001.pdf\">Figures S31 and S32</ext-link>.

A summary of the most important crystal and structure refinement data is given in Table S1. As shown in , the three Pb2+ ions all have hemidirected geometries and the corresponding donor sets are very distorted tetrahedral {O2N2} and monocapped pyramidal {O4N2} and {O3N2}, respectively (Figure S1). The three Pb(II) ions are bridged by three imidazole groups to form a triangular metal skeleton with Pb\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Pb separations in the range of 6.56-6.92 \u00c5. In addition, Pb1 and Pb2 are each further coordinated to a carboxylate group, in either a monodentate or chelate fashion. In contrast, Pb3 is further coordinated by two monodentate and one chelate carboxylate group. Thus, an unusual {Pb3(im)3(COO)5} SBU is formed. As the five carboxylate and three imidazole groups are from eight ligands, the SBU can be treated as an 8-connected node. Three independent ligands are observed in the structure. As shown in Figure S2, their coordination modes are \u03bc3-\u03baN 1:\u03baN 1:\u03baO 2, \u03bc4-\u03baN 1: \u03baN 1:\u03baO 2:\u03baO 1, and \u03bc4-\u03baN 1:\u03baN 1:\u03baO 1:\u03baO 1 respectively. All of them can be treated as 3-connected nodes.\n\nThe combination of the 8-connected {Pb3(im)3(COO)5} SBUs and the 3-connected ligands leads to a 3D neutral network with a new (3,3,8)-connected topology, as revealed by TOPOS calculations. The corresponding Schlafli symbol is {3; 4; 5}{42; 6}{32; 43; 56; 610; 74; 83} (see Figure S3). The framework exhibits 26 \u00d7 14 \u00c52 rhombus channels along the c crystallographic direction. Disordered solvent molecules are located in these channels. The solvent-accessible volume of 1 without guest molecules, calculated by PLATON, is about 47.1% of the unit cell volume. \n\nThe purity and crystallinity of the bulk samples of 1 and 2 were confirmed by a powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis (Figure S8). Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) under an N2 atmosphere was used to study their thermal stabilities. The thermal behavior of 1 (Figure S12) involves the loss of all the free H2O and 3.5 DMF solvent molecules before 277 \u00b0C (experimental, 15.38%; calculated, 15.40%). In the second step it loses 2 DMF solvent molecules until 442 \u00b0C (experimental, 6.47%; calculated, 6.04%). Then the compound continues to lose weight until complete decomposition of the structure. The first step (17.23%) of weight loss of 2 occurs at temperatures below 327 \u00b0C and is assigned to the loss of 1.5 coordinated DMSO solvent molecules (calculated, 17.53%). Then there is a plateau in the temperature range 327-425 \u00b0C. After 425 \u00b0C 2 shows a striking weight loss, indicating the complete decomposition of the structure.\n\nThe solid-state luminescence spectra of H2L, 1, and 2 (\u03bbex = 365 nm) were collected at room temperature (Figure S13). An intense emission peak at 467 nm is observed in the emission spectrum of H2L. In contrast, 1 and 2 exhibit obvious blue shifts with strong peaks at 452 and 434 nm, respectively, both of which can also be attributed to a linker-localized transition. The different emission blue shifts may be attributed to the different configurations and coordination modes of the ligands in the compounds. The CIE coordinates for the blue emission of 1 and 2 were calculated to be (0.17, 0.17) and (0.17, 0.14), close to those of a saturated blue emitter (0.14, 0.08).\n\nAs shown in Figure S23, the peaks of both the framework and FRS are observed in FRS@1. Upon an increase in the concentration of FRS in the FRS@1 composite, the dye-based emission peak shows an obvious red shift (from 522 to 558 nm), accompanied by an increase in intensity. At the same time, the emission peak of the framework decreases and blue-shifts. Both the peak shifts and changes in emission peak intensity indicate excitation energy transfer from the framework to guests. Such an efficient resonance energy transfer was also evidenced by the spectral overlap between the FRS absorption and 1 emission spectra (Figure S25). Similar results are also observed in the solid-state emission spectra of [Ru]2+@1 (Figure S24). One interesting difference between FRS@1 and [Ru]2+@1 is the loading amounts of the ELMs. In FRS@1, the loading amount of the FRS can be adjusted over a large range and the luminescence colors of the resulting composites can be tuned from blue to green and then yellow. In contrast, the loading amount of [Ru]2+ is less adjustable. As shown in Figure S24, the strongest red emission intensity is observed in Q4 (0.620 wt % [Ru]2+@1) with the smallest I MOF/I [Ru] 2+ value among all the [Ru]2+@1 composites. Further increasing the concentration of the soaked [Ru](PF6)2 solution only leads to a slight increase in the loaded [Ru]2+ guest and the maximum load capacity is 0.655 wt % (Q3), accompanied by a slight decrease of the red emission intensity, which can be explained by the concentration quenching effect. Such a low saturated load capacity in the cationic ELM@neutral framework immobilization of [Ru]2+@1 is quite different from that of the neutral ELM@neutral framework immobilization of FRS@1 and the reported cationic ELM@anionic framework immobilizations and can be explained as strong electrostatic repulsion between the loaded [Ru]2+ ELMs while the neutral framework is not helpful in reducing the repulsion.\n\nLuminescent Sensing of VOSs\n\nSince 1, FRS@1, and (FRS+[Ru]2+)@1 composites are all stable in various VOSs, their sensing behaviors for various VOSs were investigated. Finely ground samples of them were dispersed in 10 common solvents (MeOH, EtOH, acetone, MeCN, ethyl acetate (EA), hexane, cyclohexane (Cyclo), DMF, DMA, and DMSO) and four aromatic solvents (benzene (Ben), fluorobenzene (F-Ben), chlorobenzene (Cl-Ben), and bromobenzene (Br-Ben)) to form emulsions for luminescence studies. As shown in , both the peak shifts and the intensities of 1 in the emission spectra excited at 365 nm are dependent on the solvent. In comparison with that in the solid state, the peak in MeOH is slightly red shifted (457 nm). In contrast, the peaks in all other solvents are more or less blue shifted, particularly for Br-Ben, which exhibits the largest red-shifted value (~14 nm). From an intensity point of view, three solvents (MeOH, EtOH, and DMSO) show outstanding enhancement effects, while hexane exhibits the most significant quenching effect. However, under 365 nm UV light illumination, only the hexane suspension has an obviously darkened luminescence and can be clearly differentiated by the naked eye, as shown in c.", "data": [[{"meta":
