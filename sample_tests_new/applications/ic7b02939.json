Furthermore, the gaps (\u0394<italic>E</italic>) between the\nHOMO and LUMO levels are closely related with electronic conductivities,\nand a lower gap means good electroconductivity. Thus, the high gap (6.851 eV) demonstrates an intrinsic\ninsulation feature of mellitic acid. It is well-documented that the\nconjugated carboxylate groups, as weakly electron withdrawing ligands,\ncan be used directly for Li storage. However, the\nlow redox activity and electroconductivity restrict its performance.\nDue to the coordination of Ni\u00ad(II) and mellitic acid with consequent\n2p-3d orbital overlap and hybridization, the gaps are effectively\nreduced, suggesting the higher electronic conductivities of Ni-BHC\nand evacuated Ni-BHC. It should also be noticed that water molecules\nin the 3D structure can reduce the activation energy for lithium-ion\ninsertion; hence, the Ni-BHC with many coordinated water molecules\nshows a lower energy gap (0.541 eV) than that of evacuated Ni-BHC\n(0.850 eV). However, the water content is\nquite high for Ni-BHC (\u223c40%), which would lead to limited reversible\ncapacity and large amount of side reactions.</p><title>Li-Storage Performance</title><p>A CR2032 coin-type cell configuration\nwas used to evaluate the electrochemical performance of the evacuated\nNi-BHC.

Two kinds of Ni(II) node with octahedral geometries are connected by six oxygen atoms from mellitate ligands and water molecules to form the secondary building block, in which the Ni-O distances are in the range of 2.0431(15)-2.0987(15) \u00c5.

As displayed in a, the first weight loss of ~40% between 100 and 300 \u00b0C in TGA curve of Ni-BHC can be attributed to the liberating of coordinated water (calcd 38.73%), and the following weight loss of ~40% at 350 \u00b0C can be ascribed to the pyrolysis of the organic linkers.

As shown in , the LUMOs of Ni-BHC (-3.306 eV) and evacuated Ni-BHC (-3.789 eV) are much lower than that of mellitic acid (1.802 eV). Lower LUMO usually stands for greater electron affinities and higher redox activity with Li. So, the evacuated Ni-BHC has the highest redox activity, while the mellitic acid cannot react with Li for its highest LUMO value. Furthermore, the gaps (\u0394E) between the HOMO and LUMO levels are closely related with electronic conductivities, and a lower gap means good electroconductivity. Thus, the high gap (6.851 eV) demonstrates an intrinsic insulation feature of mellitic acid. It is well-documented that the conjugated carboxylate groups, as weakly electron withdrawing ligands, can be used directly for Li storage. However, the low redox activity and electroconductivity restrict its performance. Due to the coordination of Ni(II) and mellitic acid with consequent 2p-3d orbital overlap and hybridization, the gaps are effectively reduced, suggesting the higher electronic conductivities of Ni-BHC and evacuated Ni-BHC. It should also be noticed that water molecules in the 3D structure can reduce the activation energy for lithium-ion insertion; hence, the Ni-BHC with many coordinated water molecules shows a lower energy gap (0.541 eV) than that of evacuated Ni-BHC (0.850 eV). However, the water content is quite high for Ni-BHC (~40%), which would lead to limited reversible capacity and large amount of side reactions.\n\nLi-Storage Performance\n\nA CR2032 coin-type cell configuration was used to evaluate the electrochemical performance of the evacuated Ni-BHC.

While the Ni-BHC and mellitic acid possessed only initial discharge capacities of 1398.7 and 135.8 mA h g-1, far below that of evacuated Ni-BHC. The evacuated Ni-BHC displayed a capacity of 1664.4 mA h g-1 after 5 cycles and a capacity of 1261.3 mA h g-1 after 50 cycles. By contrast, Ni-BHC and mellitic acid maintained a low reversible capacity of only 910.4 and 82.6 mA h g-1 after 50 cycles. It should be noted that supposing that this system could absorb 30 Li ions, the evacuated Ni-BHC could reach a high theoretical capacity of 1570 mA h g-1, while the Ni-BHC could maintain a low theoretical capacity of only 961 mA h g-1. The initial two discharge/charge profiles plotted in Figure S4 also declare their different performances. The overall performances of the three materials are quite in line with our forecast, showing the alluring promise of designing functional MOFs with luxuriant carboxylate-metal units as high performance LIB anode. Furthermore, the reversible capacity of 1261.3 mA h g-1 outperforms all the other MOF anodes reported to date as far as we know ().\n\nTo further investigate the high power performance of the evacuated Ni-BHC, rate capability was evaluated from 100 to 200, 500, 1000, 2000, and 5000 mA g-1, as plotted in b. The discharge capacities corresponding to these current densities are 1563.1, 1437.2, 1215.1, 983.6, 740.8, and 422.0 mA h g-1, respectively. After the rate test, the capacity could recover to 1293.0 at 100 mA g-1, demonstrating excellent rate performance. Figure S5 shows the corresponding rate profiles of the evacuated Ni-BHC. It should be noticed that there is no plateau in the profiles, indicating a capacitive-controlled electrochemical behavior. To measure this behavior, CV measurements were performed at various sweep rates (from 0.2 to 1.2 mV s-1), as displayed in c. The capacitive effect of the electrode can be described by the following equation:     i = a   v   b   ,  log \u2061 i = b log \u2061 v + log \u2061 a    (where i is the measured peak current, v is the scan rate, and a and b are adjustable parameters). It is well-known that for a diffusion-controlled Faradaic process, b approaches 0.5, while for a surface-controlled capacitive process, b is close to 1.0. In this case, as displayed in d, the b-values for the 4 oxidation and reduction CV peaks are 1.046, 0.906, 0.817, and 0.680, respectively. The high b-values, especially for cathodic peaks, demonstrate the ultrahigh capacitive contribution (in some cases, we use the word pseudocapacitance) in evacuated Ni-BHC. Such a capacitive behavior can be attributed to the layered fast-kinetics structure which will notably increase the diffusion rate of Li ions inside the bulk MOF.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn summary, a hexacarboxylate-based layered MOF [Ni2(H2O)10][Ni(H2O)2(C12O12)]\u22c56H2O (Ni-BHC) was synthesized. After dehydration by thermal treatment, this MOF with abundant carboxylate groups was applied as an anode for Li storage, exhibiting a superior reversible capacity of 1261.3 mA h g-1 at a rate of 100 mA g-1. To our knowledge, such reversible capacity is the highest one ever reported for MOF-based materials. DFT calculation and O K-edge soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy suggest that the luxuriant carboxylate-metal units play an important part in the electrochemical process. More work to improve the cycling stability is still in progress. Our work develops a new method to improve the energy density of MOFs by increasing the content of carboxylate groups within a proper topology choice.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "Ni-BHC", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "[Ni2(H2O)10][Ni(H2O)2(C12O12)]\u00b76H2O"}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "100 and 300", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "liberating of coordinated water", "condition": "TGA curve"}, {"value": "350", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "pyrolysis of the organic linkers", "condition": "TGA curve"}, {"value": "220", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "removal of coordinated water molecules", "condition": "drying in air for 3 h"}, {"value": "300-400", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "removal of water molecules in the framework", "condition": "TGA curve of the evacuated Ni-BHC"}]}]], "include_properties": ["decomposition_temperature"]}, {"idx": 11, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Coordination mode of the mellitic acid ligand\nin Ni-BHC.
