High crystallinity samples are all retained carbon species, but diffraction peaks for TiO2@NC and (TiO2)9-Co1@NC-NCNTs at 26\u00b0 are indistinguishable. This diffraction peak appeared and goes sharply increases with the addition of cobalt acetate, indicating that the cobalt species plays an important role in carbon fixation on TiO2. As shown in Figure S1, we found that the diffraction peak of cobalt disappeared in the catalyst and can hardly see the diffraction peak of Pt, caused by the very strong diffraction peak of TiO2. This phenomenon can be better explained and proved by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As shown in b, the shape of TiO2@NC and (TiO2) x -Co y @NC-NCNTs composites in the air atmosphere are similar and all exhibit a major weight loss in the temperature range from ~350 to ~600 \u00b0C, corresponding to the combustion of carbon. The content of carbon in TiO2@NC, (TiO2)9-Co1@NC-NCNTs, (TiO2)7-Co3@NC-NCNTs, and (TiO2)5-Co5@NC-NCNTs are calculated to be 9.2, 14.8, 42.4, and 50.5%, respectively, from the analysis of TGA results. Raman spectroscopy characteristic signatures of TiO2@NC and (TiO2) x -Co y @NC-NCNTs were shown in c, which are described by renowned D and G bands emerging at ~1350 and 1590 cm-1, respectively. Generally, the intensity of the D band can be assigned to the disordered defective in graphite, while the intensity of the G band is related to the ordered crystal graphite. The D/G intensity ratio (I D/I G) value of TiO2@NC, (TiO2)9-Co1@NC-NCNTs, (TiO2)7-Co3@NC-NCNTs, and (TiO2)5-Co5@NC-NCNTs are 1.14, 1.33, 1.29, and 1.24, respectively. In addition, a broad 2D and 2G band centered at around 2660 and 2900 cm-1 are obviously observed in Raman spectra of TiO2@NC and (TiO2) x -Co y @NC-NCNTs, indicating the existence of graphitic carbon materials in all samples, and intensity of these two peaks gradually become stronger and more distinct with the increase of Co content in the MOF precursor. Typical Raman bands appeared at 140, 251, 426, and 610 cm-1 ascribe to the B1g, two-phonon scattering, Eg, and A1g modes of the rutile phase, respectively (Figure S2) and the peaks detected at about 187, 465, and 667 cm-1 correspond to F2g, Eg, and A1g modes of Co3O4, respectively. Raman reflects the vibration behavior of molecular bonds. Metal, as an elementary substance, has no molecular bonds. Therefore, there are weak diffraction peaks of Co3O4 but no diffraction peak of the Co metal in Figure S2. Based on the above results, metallic cobalt under high-temperature reduction can act as the catalytic center to produce more content of graphic carbon, improvement of overall electroconductibility of materials, while it can also introduce more amount of defect in carbon, leading to smaller Pt NPs as well as strengthening the interaction between carbon and metal NPs. (TiO2)7-Co3@NC-NCNTs was artfully endowed with both a high degree of carbon crystallinity and abundant defect edge.\n\nFourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was operated to disclose the different chemical bond in MIL-Ti and MIL-Ti x Co y  (d). The band at about 1700 cm-1 is most likely attributed to asymmetric vibrations of carboxylate groups. The strong bands at ~1400 and ~1600 cm-1 can be assigned to the vibrational stretching of carboxylic acids (O-C-O), and peaks located at 1280 and 1149 cm-1 can be attributed to the vibrations of C-O. The intensity of C\ue5fbO bonds considerably weaken while that of C-O bonds remarkably increase with continuous enhancement of cobalt content, which shows that more C-O bonds are derived from the C\ue5fbO bond. The obvious O-Ti-O vibrations can be clearly observed at ~800 cm-1. Figure S3 shows the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm and pore size distribution of the final products. All curves show typical IV-type isotherms with H3-type hysteresis loops. Remarkably, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area of TiO2@NC, (TiO2)9-Co1@NC-NCNTs, (TiO2)7-Co3@NC-NCNTs, and (TiO2)5-Co5@NC-NCNTs are 226.3, 90.4, 181, and 186.6 m2 g-1, respectively. The value of the BET specific surface area becomes more and more larger with increasing the content of cobalt in the MOFs, confirming the fact that carbon improves the specific surface area of the whole electrocatalyst. Mesopores mainly below 4 nm overall exist in the final products, which help reduce local electrical resistance and dielectric constant, increasing the electrical conductivity of the materials. \n\nThe morphological analysis of MIL-Ti7Co3 and (TiO2)7-Co3@NC-NCNTs is carried out by using a field-emission electron microscope, as respectively shown in . The low-resolution FESEM image of MIL-Ti7Co3 (a) reveals that the lengths of spindle-type microrods are roughly 3.3 \u03bcm with a diameter of ca. 0.9-1.1 \u03bcm. On close inspection, the surface of spindle rods is rough and clearly observed many spileholes (b), benefiting from the natural advantage of MOFs. The element mapping analysis identify that MIL-Ti7Co3 consisted of elemental C, O, Co, and Ti components (c), and these four elements are distributed homogeneously throughout the whole spindle-type microrods, which further verify the carboxyl in TA incorporating both Ti4+ and Co2+ (d). In addition, the morphology of precursors exhibtis spindle-type microrods with the appearance of the cobalt specimen and the ratio of length and diameter of spindle-type microrods become bigger, from 2.91 to 3.30, with the increasing content of cobalt in MOFs (b and S4). d,e clearly demonstrates that the high density of long length N-CNTs with random orientations twine around and in situ grew on the (TiO2)7-Co3@NC-NCNTs surface. During the pyrolysis process, in situ Co metal reduced by high-temperature catalyzes the abundant organic residuals thermal decomposition from melamine to grow N-CNTs from the inside to outside of the spindle-type microrods. As shown in f, C, O, and N element mainly distribute both on spindle-type microrods and N-CNTs, elemental Ti mostly allocate on spindle-type microrods, and elemental Co distribute whole EDX image. The above results indicate that Co metal is mainly retained in the cusp of CNTs, the CNTs are doped by the N element from melamine, and the C element of spindle-type microrods mainly originates from the pyrolysis of terephthalic acid.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "Pt/TiO2@NC\u2013NCNTs-7", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "catalytic activity": [{"value": "577", "unit": "mA mgPt\u20131", "time": "", "condition": "in acidic medium"}, {"value": "3100", "unit": "mA mgPt\u20131", "time": "", "condition": "in alkaline medium"}]}]], "include_properties": ["catalytic_activity"]}, {"idx": "12, 14, 16", "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<p>To further investigate detailed structure of support and\nobserve\nthe size distribution of Pt NPs on nanomaterials, transmission electron\nmicroscopy (TEM) images of (TiO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>7</sub>\u2013Co<sub>3</sub>@NC\u2013NCNTs (a\u2013f) and Pt/TiO<sub>2</sub>@NC\u2013NCNTs-7\n(g\u2013l)\nare provided.

In contrast to Pt/TiO<sub>2</sub>@NC,\nthe Pt 4f peaks of the other three electrocatalysts expressively negative\nshift, ascribing to the electronic interaction between defects on\nNCNTs (NC) and Pt NPs. The negative shift\nof binding energy of the Pt 4f means that the Pt NPs can get electrons\nfrom the support, leading to a decrease in the d-band vacancy of Pt,\naccording to the d-band center theory, the CO adsorption would be\nweakened as the d-band center decreases. Thus, the negative shift is facilitating the removal of the adsorbed\npoisoning intermediates such as CO<sub>ads</sub> for MOR. Obviously, the Pt 4f peaks of Pt/TiO<sub>2</sub>@NC\u2013NCNTs-7 and Pt/TiO<sub>2</sub>@NC\u2013NCNTs-5 were\nshifted positively compared with that of Pt/TiO<sub>2</sub>@NC\u2013NCNTs-9,\nwhich can be attributed to the decreasing size of Pt NPs on the support.

The excellent catalytic activities are mainly attributed\nto electroneutrality break and electron transfer induced by N doping\n(especially pyridinic-N), which alter the charge and spin distribution\nin the carbon materials. Compared with\nPt/TiO<sub>2</sub>@NC, the negative shift of pyridinic N in Pt/TiO<sub>2</sub>@NC\u2013NCNTs-9, Pt/TiO<sub>2</sub>@NC\u2013NCNTs-7,\nand Pt/TiO<sub>2</sub>@NC\u2013NCNTs-5 is attributed to strong metal\u2013support\ninteraction and electron transfer.

The larger ECSA\nmeans that the Pt/TiO<sub>2</sub>@NC\u2013NCNTs-7 has more active\nsites in the electrocatalytic process.

In contrast to Pt/TiO2@NC, the Pt 4f peaks of the other three electrocatalysts expressively negative shift, ascribing to the electronic interaction between defects on NCNTs (NC) and Pt NPs.

The larger ECSA means that the Pt/TiO2@NC-NCNTs-7 has more active sites in the electrocatalytic process. Meanwhile, the small size and uniform dispersion of Pt NPs on the support ascribes to a large ECSA, avoiding agglomeration of Pt NPs. The electrocatalytic properties of MOR were investigated in 0.5 M H2SO4 containing 1 M CH3OH and 1 M KOH containing 1 M CH3OH, respectively, and the current density is normalized by the current per content of Pt NP deposition (d,e). Among all the electrocatalysts, the MOR demonstrate that the forward scan of the Pt/TiO2@NC-NCNTs-7 catalyst exhibits the highest mass current density of 577 mA mgPt -1 in acid and 3100 mA mgPt -1 in alkali, which is 2.02 times and 4.08 times that of commercial Pt/C.
