Close contacts of nHEX molecules with the bridging hydroxyl from the MOF have been found, with a H-H distance of 2.19 \u00c5, while the closest H-H distance from 3MP to the MOF is 2.27 \u00c5 (Figure S14).", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 15, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>To understand the underlying\nmechanisms for the experimentally\nobserved preferential adsorption in channel B and its accommodation\nof nHEX and 3MP but not 22DMB, we perform a computational study at\nthe DFT level.
