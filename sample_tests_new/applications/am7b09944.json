As we all know, PPy tubes store charges via Faradaic electron charge transfer (i.e. pseudocapacitance), while ZIF particles store charges via forming electrical double-layer capacitance. In our ZIF-PPy hybrid structure, ZIF particles do not change the structural and intrinsic properties of PPy tubes because PPy tubes just serve as the support for the growth of ZIF particles, and there is no strong chemical interfacial interaction between PPy tubes and ZIF particles. Thus, the pseudocapacitance of PPy tubes (C PPy = 443.3 F g-1) would be hardly influenced before and after interweaving the ZIF particles. On the basis of this assumption, the total capacitance of ZIF-PPy can be described by the equation C ZIF-PPy \u00d7 (m ZIF + m PPy) = C ZIF \u00d7 m ZIF + C PPy \u00d7 m PPy, where C ZIF-PPy is the specific capacitance of ZIF-PPy (F g-1), m ZIF and m PPy are the masses of ZIF and PPy in ZIF-PPy, respectively, C ZIF is the specific capacitance of ZIF in ZIF-PPy (F g-1), and C PPy is the specific capacitance of PPy (F g-1). Because we already know the mass ratio of PPy to ZIF in the ZIF-PPy hybrids (Table S3), C ZIF in different ZIF-PPy samples would be calculated after excluding the capacitive contribution from the PPy tubes. Thus, the C ZIF in each ZIF-PPy is estimated to be 412.2, 597.6, 556.3, and 497.2 F g-1 for ZIF-PPy-1, -2, -3, and -5, respectively (Table S3).

As we all know, PPy tubes\nstore charges via Faradaic electron charge transfer (i.e. pseudocapacitance), while ZIF particles store charges via forming electrical double-layer\ncapacitance. In our ZIF\u2013PPy hybrid\nstructure, ZIF particles do not change the structural and intrinsic\nproperties of PPy tubes because PPy tubes just serve as the support\nfor the growth of ZIF particles, and there is no strong chemical interfacial\ninteraction between PPy tubes and ZIF particles. Thus, the pseudocapacitance\nof PPy tubes (<italic>C</italic>\n<sub>PPy</sub> = 443.3 F g<sup>\u20131</sup>) would be hardly influenced before and after interweaving the ZIF\nparticles.

As shown in c, the typical intense diffraction peaks of ZIF-PPy match well with those of pure ZIF-67, indicating the presence of highly-crystallized ZIF-67 in ZIF-PPy hybrids. The diffraction pattern of PPy is not observed because the diffraction intensity of PPy tubes is too weak compared with that of the ZIF crystals. The porosities of ZIF-67 and ZIF-PPy hybrids were investigated by N2 adsorption-desorption measurements (d). The results show that the specific surface area of ZIF-PPy decreases from 1545.2 m2 g-1 for ZIF-PPy-1 to 518.8 m2 g-1 for ZIF-PPy-5 (Table S2) because of the increased proportion of PPy tubes, which have only a low specific surface area of 16.9 m2 g-1.\n\nGenerally, high specific surface area, regular pore size (especially sub-1 nm), and good electrical conductivity of porous materials usually lead to high capacitance. Considering that the prepared ZIF-PPy will combine the advantages of each component, including the high porosity and abundant micropores (sub-1 nm) of ZIF-67 and the good electrical conductivity from the famously conductive PPy tubes, ZIF-PPy would be a promising electrode material for electrochemical capacitors. The electrochemical performances of the ZIF-PPy hybrids, pure ZIF-67, and PPy tubes were first investigated in a three-electrode system. The CV curves shown in Figure S4a indicate that all samples display rectangle-like curves, and ZIF-PPy-2 exhibits the highest current density, suggesting that ZIF-PPy-2 has the best capacitive properties among all samples. The specific capacitances at 0.5 A g-1 (denoted as C 0.5) and 20 A g-1 (denoted as C 20) were calculated by GCD measurements (a, S4b) and are summarized in Table S3. The C 0.5 of ZIF-PPy-2 is 554.4 F g-1, which is much higher than those of the other ZIF-PPy hybrids (417.5-514.5 F g-1) and that of pure PPy (443.3 F g-1), and is almost 5 times higher than that of pure ZIF-67 (99.2 F g-1). To the best of our knowledge, this value is also much higher than those of activated carbons (74-260 F g-1), carbon nanotubes (80-228 F g-1), graphene (154-484 F g-1), MOF-derived carbons (188-332 F g-1), and pristine MOF-based electrodes (0.3-552 F g-1), as summarized and compared in Table S4. The corresponding capacitance retentions (C 20/C 0.5) are shown in b and Table S3. Clearly, ZIF-PPy-2 exhibits the best capacitance retention capability.\n\nTo determine the origin of the high capacitance in ZIF-PPy, we tried to separate the capacitive contributions from ZIF and PPy in the ZIF-PPy hybrid electrode. As we all know, PPy tubes store charges via Faradaic electron charge transfer (i.e. pseudocapacitance), while ZIF particles store charges via forming electrical double-layer capacitance. In our ZIF-PPy hybrid structure, ZIF particles do not change the structural and intrinsic properties of PPy tubes because PPy tubes just serve as the support for the growth of ZIF particles, and there is no strong chemical interfacial interaction between PPy tubes and ZIF particles. Thus, the pseudocapacitance of PPy tubes (C PPy = 443.3 F g-1) would be hardly influenced before and after interweaving the ZIF particles. On the basis of this assumption, the total capacitance of ZIF-PPy can be described by the equation C ZIF-PPy \u00d7 (m ZIF + m PPy) = C ZIF \u00d7 m ZIF + C PPy \u00d7 m PPy, where C ZIF-PPy is the specific capacitance of ZIF-PPy (F g-1), m ZIF and m PPy are the masses of ZIF and PPy in ZIF-PPy, respectively, C ZIF is the specific capacitance of ZIF in ZIF-PPy (F g-1), and C PPy is the specific capacitance of PPy (F g-1). Because we already know the mass ratio of PPy to ZIF in the ZIF-PPy hybrids (Table S3), C ZIF in different ZIF-PPy samples would be calculated after excluding the capacitive contribution from the PPy tubes. Thus, the C ZIF in each ZIF-PPy is estimated to be 412.2, 597.6, 556.3, and 497.2 F g-1 for ZIF-PPy-1, -2, -3, and -5, respectively (Table S3). As plotted in b, it is clear that the specific capacitance of ZIF can be increased remarkably after integrating with PPy tubes, and the value can be maximized by adjusting the proportion of the PPy substrate and exceeds all those obtained from the previous research. \n\nThe electrical conductivities of the ZIF-PPy electrodes were investigated by EIS (c and Table S3). After incorporation of PPy into ZIF-67, the charge transfer resistance (R ct) of ZIF-PPy gradually decreases with the increase of PPy, indicating that the introduction of PPy is favorable for accelerating the charge transfer in the ZIF-PPy electrodes. Additionally, ZIF-PPy electrodes also show steeper linear gradients in the sloped region of the Nyquist plot (which is known as the Warburg region), providing evidence for the lower resistance in the ZIF-PPy electrode than in the pure ZIF-67 electrode. \n\nThe long-term cycling stability of ZIF-PPy-2 was investigated by GCD measurements at a current density of 20 A g-1 (d). ZIF-PPy-2 shows much higher capacitance retention compared with the PPy tubes and ZIF-67. The SEM images of the ZIF-PPy-2 electrode shown in Figure S5 reveal that the morphology of our ZIF-PPy still remains well even after 10000 cycles, indicating the good reversibility of ZIF-PPy-2. To further demonstrate the superiority of our ZIF-PPy structure produced by in situ growth of ZIF-67 around PPy tubes, we simply mixed ZIF-67 and PPy tubes in the same proportions as ZIF-PPy-2. The mixed sample was denoted as ZIF/PPy, and the proportion of PPy was ~28 wt %. The capacitive performance of ZIF/PPy was measured by GCD measurements in a three-electrode system (Figure S6). The C 0.5 of ZIF/PPy is 196.7 F g-1, which is much lower than that of ZIF-PPy-2 (554.4 F g-1), demonstrating the importance of the design of our ZIF-PPy continuous microstructure.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "PPy tubes", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": [{"type": "", "probe": "", "value": "16.9", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "ZIF\u2013PPy", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": [{"type": "", "probe": "", "value": "1545.2", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": "for ZIF\u2013PPy-1"}, {"type": "", "probe": "", "value": "518.8", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": "for ZIF\u2013PPy-5"}]}]], "include_properties": ["surface_area"]}, {"idx": "29, 33", "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<p>Flexible supercapacitors have gained worldwide attention as an\nemerging energy storage device for wearable and miniaturized electronics.
