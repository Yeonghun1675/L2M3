The average crystallite size of Co NPs was estimated using the Scherrer formula: D h = \u03bb/(\u03b2h \u00d7 cos \u03b8 h ). D h is the domain size of the diffraction line, \u03bb is the wavelength of the Cu K\u03b1 source used, \u03b2h is the width in radians of the diffraction peak measured at half-maximum intensity (full-width at half-maximum, fwhm) corrected for instrumental broadening, and \u03b8h is the angle of the particular hkl reflection. Raman spectrum was recorded on a Renishaw RM-1000 with excitation from the 514 nm line of an Ar-ion laser with a power of about 5 mW. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra measurements were carried out on a NICOLET 380 Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a PHI quantera SXM spectrometer with an Al K\u03b1 = 280.00 eV excitation source, where binding energies were calibrated by referencing the C 1s peak (284.8 eV) to reduce the sample charge effect. The morphology of as-prepared product was studied by using transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN electron microscope, operating at 200 kV). The N2 sorption isotherms were measured on NOVA 1000e surface area and poresize analyzer (Quantachrome Instrument, USA) at 77 K. From the adsorption branch of isotherm curves in the P/P 0 range between 0.05 and 0.35, the specific surface areas (S BET) of Co@CoO x @C-XX are calculated by the multipoint Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The pore size distribution was evaluated by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model. The total pore volume (V total) was determined from the amount adsorbed at the relative pressure of about 0.99. For the analysis of the magnetic material of the hysteresis loop used for the PPMS-9T-type physical magnetic test system, the temperature was 300 K, and the magnetic field strength is -40-40 kOe, plus field cooling (FC) and zero field cooling (ZFC) response curve (magnetic field 100 Oe). Elemental analysis (EA) is The Thermo Flash EA 1112.\n\nThe microstructures of Co-MOF, Co-MOF-GO, Co-MOF-PVP, and Co-MOF-PVP-GO precursors were observed by TEM images (Figure S3). Co-MOF showed uniform flake-like and somewhat curled up together (Figure S3a,b). In Co-MOF-GO, flakes curled up together and covered uniformly on GO sheets (Figure S3c,d). Co-MOF-PVP also showed sheet-like because PVP prevented MOF from curling and maintained the flake shape (Figure S3e,f). Co-MOF-PVP-GO sheets covered uniformly on GO (Figure S3g,h). These MOFs precursors were used as catalysts for hydrogen generation from hydrolysis of NaBH4 (Figure S4a). Different MOFs composites exhibited somewhat catalytic activity for hydrogen generation with various moderate reaction rates. There was little positive effect on catalytic activity with NaOH (Figure S4b). In the reaction process, the MOFs composites gradually turned into black powder with significant magnetism due to the reduction effect of NaBH4. The XRD pattern of used composites presented the diffraction peaks at 44.2\u00b0, 51.5\u00b0, and 75.9\u00b0, corresponding to ferromagnetic Co(0) (Figure S4c). To obtain catalytic materials with higher activity, the thermal pyrolysis of MOFs precursors through annealing treatment should be necessary. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of Co-MOF-GO was performed in air and Ar atmosphere to demonstrate 700 \u00b0C as appropriate annealing temperature (). \n\nThe surface composition of four composites was determined by XPS spectra. The C 1s peaks in Co@CoO x @CG and Co@CoO x @N-CG corresponded to C\ue5fbC (284.4 eV), C-O (285.05 eV), and O\ue5fbC (288.7 eV) bonds (a,b). The peaks of C-O and O\ue5fbC were very weak, which exhibited that GO is partially reduced during the solvothermal process. The possible formation of interfacial C-O-Co bonds is also suggested, which is responsible for anchoring CoO x . The O 1s peaks of Co@CoO x @CG and Co@CoO x @N-CG were divided into the Co\ue5fbO (529.69 eV), C-O (530.0 eV), and O\ue5fbC (532.74 eV), which proved that Co became CoO x  after 200 \u00b0C at air (c,d). The main peaks centered at 285 eV, 530 eV, and 778-798 eV are attributed to C 1s, O 1s, and Co 2p in Co@CoO x @CG, respectively (g,h). The N 1s peak in Co@CoO x @N-CG is centered at 402 eV (h). The weak N 1s peak in Co@CoO x @N-CG accounts for the small amount of N in composite (Figure S8a,b). In Co@CoO x @C and Co@CoO x @N-C, it is similar to each other (e and S9a). The EA perfectly echoed the Raman and XPS spectra. The TGA curves of composites were measured in air atmosphere (Figure S10). The mass ratios of Co were calculated as 72%, 62%, 75%, and 67% for Co@CoO x @C, Co@CoO x @CG, Co@CoO x @N-C, and Co@CoO x @N-CG, respectively. By EA, the mass ratios of Co were calculated as 89%, 58%, 83%, and 64% for Co@CoO x @C, Co@CoO x @CG, Co@CoO x @N-C, and Co@CoO x @N-CG, respectively (Table S1). The relative atomic ratio proved that C is the main component, and Co is very little in surface, due to the core-shells structure (Table S2). \n\nThe nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of Co@CoO x @CG and Co@CoO x @N-CG were measured by at 77 K (). The S BET values of 67 and 46 m2 g-1 were obtained for Co@CoO x @CG and Co@CoO x @N-CG with pore volumes of 0.2 and 0.1 cm3 g-1 between 15 and 300 nm. Such large specific surface areas were of importance for enhancing the catalyst activity. These textural properties were comparable to those of typical catalysts.\n\nThe magnetization curves of Co@CoO x @CG were measured at 300 K in a variable applied field (a). The hysteresis loop of Co@CoO x @CG showed a coercive force (H c) of 480.97 Oe and remanent magnetization (M r) of 446.46 emu g-1 with a S r = M r/H c value of 0.93. These parameters were evidence for the ferromagnetism of Co@CoO x @CG (Figure S11). The ferromagnetism properties with strong magnetic response make Co@CoO x @CG are easily isolated from water mixing system (Figure S12). The ZFC and FC magnetization curves of Co@CoO x @CG and Co@CoO x @N-CG were measured with an applied field of 500 Oe (c,d). The Co@CoO x @CG and Co@CoO x @N-CG showed ferromagnetic properties in 2-219.4 K and 2-215.3 K due to the existence of ferromagnetic Co. In ZFC curves, Co@CoO x @CG and Co@CoO x @N-CG reached the maximum magnetization at 219.4 and 215.3 K, respectively. The weak temperature dependence of magnetism ensures Co@CoO x @CG and Co@CoO x @N-CG be easily used in a wide temperature range. The Co@CoO x @C and Co@CoO x @N-C showed similar performances (Figure S12).\n\nThrough linear slopes, the reaction activation energy values were calculated as 23.3, 25.8, 40.0, and 36.6 kJ mol-1 for Co@CoO x @C, Co@CoO x @N-C, Co@CoO x @CG, and Co@CoO x @N-CG, respectively.\n\nThe high r B values of 2140, 2435, 5560, and 3270 mL min-1 gCo -1 were calculated for Co@CoO x @C, Co@CoO x @N-C, Co@CoO x @CG, and Co@CoO x @N-CG at 303 K, respectively (a). With Co@CoO x @CG as optimized catalyst, the highest r B value of 17360 mL min-1 gCo -1 can be obtained at an elevated temperature of 328 K. The catalytic activity of Co@CoO x @CG and Co@CoO x @N-CG also exhibited obvious advantages compared to those of Co@CG and Co@N-CG at various temperatures (b). These catalytic activities are comparable to those in the literature (Table S3). The existences of CoO x  shells, rGO sheets, and N-doping atoms in composites do improve the catalytic activity of composites due to the synergistic effect (a,b). Two composites showed excellent recyclability, even if being reused for five times, and the catalytic activity did not fade drastically (c,d). The composition and phase structure also were maintained well after being used (Figure S17). The weak decreasing catalytic activity of reused catalysts is mainly caused by the separation treatment in air atmosphere. These excellent catalytic properties ensure that the multilayer core-shells on sheets composites can be applied into some other reactions such as oxygen evolution reaction or oxygen reduction reaction. Generally, the thickness of shells in core-shell structures has a significant effect on catalytic activity due to the diffusion restriction in thick shells.
