The Ru-Oeq bond distances of N-1-N-17 were in the range of 2.056(3)-2.071(2) \u00c5, which is similar to that previously reported for [Ru2 II,II] compounds (Table S2). In contrast, the Ru-Oeq bond distances of I-1 and I-2 were between 2.016(1) and 2.025(5) \u00c5, which is quite similar to the characteristic bond distances previously reported for the [Ru2 II,III]+ moieties in D2A systems. Except for N-11, the Ru-Nax (Nax = nitrogen atom of acceptor) bond lengths of N-1-N17 were in the range of 2.265(2)-2.350(5) \u00c5, whereas those of I-1 and I-2 fell between 2.188(5) and 2.252(3) \u00c5, which makes them significantly shorter than those of N-1-N17. This is characteristic of the oxidation state of these complexes. Meanwhile, only N-11 had a slightly shorter Ru-N bond distance (2.236(2) \u00c5) in comparison to those of the ionic systems. This could be due to the effect of intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the free OH group of the TCNQ(OC2H4OH)2 moiety and the Oeq atoms of [Ru2], where O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Oeq = 3.00 \u00c5 (Figure S14).\n\nIonicity Diagrams for DA and D2A Systems\n\nA plot of \u0394E H-L(DA) vs \u0394E 1/2(DA) for all DA and D2A series reported to date, including the present DA chains, is shown in a and displays a linear least-squares fitted line (LS-FL). The respective plots for the DA chains and the D2A systems composed of D2A layers and D2A finite network were extracted into b,c, respectively, from a (the linear LS-FL is fixed from a). The crossover point of the linear LS-FL with \u0394E H-L(DA) = 0 was ~357 mV (a), corresponding to an averaged Madelung potential (M av) commonly applied for all compounds of these D/A-MOFs. This sort of crossover point might be scientifically meaningless because the \u0394E H-L(DA) values of the vertical axis are not directly obtained from the assembled D/A-MOFs. Nevertheless, the N/I charge assignments experimentally determined for each compound indicates that the actual M potential in these D/A-MOFs reflecting their structures should be located near this potential, although it may be somewhat shifted from M av depending on the DA chain or D2A network structural dimensionality. Some DA chain compounds were assigned as neutral despite their negative \u0394E H-L(DA) values (a). This could mainly be due to their one-dimensionality, which means they should possess M values lower than those of two-dimensional compounds, such as D2A. Consequently, a new ionicity diagram for DA chains was roughly determined (b) using the M potential (M 1D) of 293 mV, which was tentatively defined on the basis of the M value of N-14.

systems, (b) only DA chains, and (c) only D2A layers, where the plots in (b) and (c) were extracted from (a). The solid linear lines displayed in (a-c) are least-squares fitted lines (LS-FLs) for all compounds, and M av (average Madelung potential; black dotted line) was evaluated from the crossover point with \u0394E H-L(DA) = 0 (black dotted line). The red dotted lines in (b) were determined at the crossover point with the LS-FL on the basis of the plot of N-14. The blue dotted lines in (c) were determined from the crossover point with the LS-FL on the basis of the plot of No. 26 of D2A.
