As a part of our systematic study on this subject, a luminescent emission spectrum was used to monitor the anion-exchange process. Interestingly, these anions\u2282Ag2 L 2 systems show an interesting anion-responsive photoluminescence. As shown in Figure , 1 exhibits intense green emission at 527 nm upon excitation at 448 nm, which is of great interest because of an emission characteristic similar to that of a green fluorescent protein of Topaz (T203Y type). In comparison with the emission of free L (528 nm upon excitation at 448 nm; ), the emission of 1 should be assigned to the ligand-centered (n-\u03c0* or \u03c0-\u03c0*) emission because almost identical emission bands are observed. Compared to 1, 2 and 3 show distinctly different emission properties. The ligand-centered emission intensity in 2 or 3 is dramatically quenched (Figure ), which is clearly attributed to the different anion inclusions. As expected, the emission intensity of 1 decreased by degrees as the incorporated PF6 - was gradually replaced by ClO4 - in 2 and SbF6 - in 3, respectively. So, such a metal-organic tube also acts as a luminescent receptor for selective anion monitoring, which might be of biological, environmental, and industrial interest.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']"}}, {"idx": 17, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig6\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>6</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Left: Emission\nspectra of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> and\nanion-exchanged products based on <bold>1</bold> (PF<sub>6</sub>\n<sup>\u2013</sup> by ClO<sub>4</sub>\n<sup>\u2013</sup>) at 1 h (<bold>1a</bold>), 4 h (<bold>1b</bold>), and 8 h (<bold>1c</bold>).
