The Cu(II) ion is coordinated to four INA ligands bonded through alternating carboxylate and nitrogen ends to form one mononuclear heterotopic secondary building unit (SBU) and also connected to water oxygen with bond distances: Cu-O (carboxylate) ~1.94 \u00c5, Cu-N 2.02 and 2.04 \u00c5, and Cu-O (water) ~2.24 \u00c5. The coordination of water oxygen to Cu(II) center orients perpendicularly to the square planar INA ligands, forming the square pyramidal geometry; nevertheless, this oxygen was omitted for structure clarity purposes. The Cu-INA ligands are bridging through the N and O to form 2D multilayers as shown in C. The carboxylate and pyridine units attached to Cu(II) are in trans positions; hence, two of the uncoordinated oxygen atoms point either toward or away from the subsequent layer. There exist one-dimensional (1D) porous channels centered around the distorted squared Cu4(INA)4 units with the Cu-Cu distances of 8.85 and 8.93 \u00c5 and the Cu-Cu diagonal distances of 11.93 and 13.19 \u00c5 (Figure S1). The distance between these layers is the size of the b-axis, and it is ~5.80 \u00c5 taking the Cu ions as reference. The layers are weakly connected to each other through hydrogen bonds between water and nitrogen and carboxylate groups. These interactions present between the layers are critical for delamination to occur by ultrasonic exfoliation.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 14, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(A) Multilayer view of the 1D channels of AUBM-6 (C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>17</sub>CuN<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6</sub>).
