Among the two perchlorate anions bound to the metal site, one was monodentately bound while the other was bidentately bound (Figure A). Coordination via terminal N-pyridyl donors extended the structure in a zigzag fashion to form a two-dimensional net (Figure ). The nets were not planar owing to the cis geometry of one of the ligands (Figure B). Guest molecules were encapsulated in the voids between the two nets. C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions were observed between the C-H of the cis ligand and the \u03c0 cloud of toluene (Figure S11, ). Various framework-anion noncovalent interactions were also observed in 1\u2283ClO4 - (Figure S12, ). SC-XRD analysis showed that 2\u2283ClO4 - crystallized in the triclinic system, space group P1\u0305. The asymmetric unit of the compound consisted of two metal sites coordinated to four ligand molecules, four perchlorate anions and mesitylene guest molecules denoted by [{Cd2(L)4(ClO4)4}\u22c53(mesitylene)] n . One metal site was bound to four different ligands and two perchlorate anions in a monodentate fashion, leading to an octahedral geometry of the metal center (Figures D and C). The ligand was coordinated to the metal centers via the terminal nitrogens, thereby extending the framework to form a 2D net (Figure ). The trans dispositions of each ligand in 2\u2283ClO4 - facilitate formation of 2D planar sheets (Figure D).

Upon photoexcitation at 355 nm, L displayed two emission bands at 408 and 427 nm. 1\u2283ClO4 - showed an emission with a maximum at around 432 nm and a higher energy but less intense shoulder at 411 nm. All the other anion-exchanged products displayed emission bands with intensity maxima similar to that of compound 1\u2283ClO4 -. For 1\u2283N(CN)2 -, the band obtained was at around 437 nm with a less intense shoulder at 416 nm. In the case of 1\u2283SCN-, an intensity maximum at 436 nm and a higher energy shoulder at 415 nm were observed. However, for 1\u2283N3 -, two bands were located at 435 and 413 nm, the former being more intense. The anion-exchanged compounds exhibited different emission intensities compared to the parent compound 1\u2283ClO4 -. The highest enhancement in fluorescence was observed in the case of 1\u2283N(CN)2 - followed by 1\u2283SCN-; however, 1\u2283N3 - showed fluorescence quenching with respect to 1\u2283ClO4 - (Figure A). \u03c0*-n or \u03c0*-\u03c0 intraligand (IL) transitions are possible for the emissions of 1\u2283ClO4 - and the exchanged compounds. The low-energy emissions in the 430-440 nm region may arise due to mixed events, IL and metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) transition. Solid samples of 2\u2283ClO4 - showed an emission profile similar to that of 1\u2283ClO4 - upon photoexcitation at 350 nm at room temperature. The parent compound showed two emission bands at 413 and 434 nm, respectively. The anion-exchanged compounds, viz., 2\u2283N(CN)2 -, 2\u2283SCN-, and 2\u2283N3 - displayed emission bands with intensity maxima at 437, 435, and 434 nm and higher energy shoulders at 417, 414, and 412 nm, respectively. Similar to the trend observed in the case of 1, 2\u2283N(CN)2 - showed the highest intensity profile, followed by 2\u2283SCN- and 2\u2283N3 - (Figure B). The plausible rationale to the variation in luminescence intensities can be attributed to the diverse electronic interactions of the respective anions with the framework and metal node, along with their characteristic coordinating tendencies, sizes, shapes, and geometries.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 21, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig6\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>6</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Solid-state luminescence spectra of (A) <bold>1</bold>\u2283ClO<sub>4</sub>\n<sup>\u2013</sup> and its various anion-exchanged\nproducts and (B) <bold>2</bold>\u2283ClO<sub>4</sub>\n<sup>\u2013</sup> and its various anion-exchanged products at rt.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr7\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2014-01879w_0007.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 6  Solid-state luminescence spectra of (A) 1\u2283ClO4 - and its various anion-exchanged products and (B) 2\u2283ClO4 - and its various anion-exchanged products at rt.
