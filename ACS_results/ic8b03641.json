Interesting differences between CuI-3 and CuI-4 were observed for both temperatures: The emission quantum yields of CuI-3 (0.58 and 0.80 at 298 and 77 K, respectively) were remarkably higher than those of CuI-4 (<0.01 and 0.04 at 298 and 77 K, respectively). Similarly, the observed emission decay of CuI-3 was remarkably longer than that of CuI-4 (Figure S8). Although the emission decays were analyzed using two exponential decays ( in the \"\" section), the dependence of the time-resolved emission spectra of CuI- m, at both 298 and 77 K, on the measurement time range was negligible (Figure S9). This suggested that only one emission species contributes to their luminescence behavior. Thus, the emission decay was next analyzed, using  to calculate the averaged emission lifetimes and estimate the radiative and nonradiative rate constants (k r and k nr) based the on the average lifetimes and emission quantum yields (). The k r values of these two coordination polymers were comparable, while the k nr value of CuI-3 was 2 orders of magnitude smaller than that of CuI-4. Thus, the emissions of both CuI-3 and CuI-4 should originate from a similar charge-transfer excited state, as suggested by the similarly broadened emission band shape. However, the nonradiative decay of CuI-3 was more effectively suppressed, even at 298 K, by the higher emission wavelength (energy gap law) as well as the tightly packed crystal structure, as suggested by the larger crystal density. One noteworthy difference was observed for CuI-3 obtained from the thermal synthesis (Figure S8 and ). Although the emission lifetime and quantum yield at 77 K of both CuI-3 samples were comparable, the thermally synthesized CuI-3 exhibited shorter lifetime and smaller quantum yield at 298 K than those of CuI-3 obtained from the solution reaction. The three times larger k nr value suggests that nonemissive impurity and/or defect sites could be generated in the thermally synthesized CuI-3.
