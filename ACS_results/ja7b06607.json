In the asymmetric unit, four guest molecules of 6 were observed, two of which directly interact with (S,S)-2 through a hydrogen bond with HO\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O distances of 1.94 and 2.41 \u00c5 (b). The absolute configuration of the first fraction was thus reliably determined to be R (c, left). The S configuration for the second fraction was also confirmed by X-ray analysis using (R,R)-1 (c, right). In a similar way, a racemic mixture of the enantiomers of 4-bromo-\u03b1-methylbenzyl alcohol (rac-7), obtained from NaBH4 reduction of 4'-bromoacetophenone, was analyzed by chiral HPLC. The first fraction collected (t ret = 58.3 min) was deduced to be (R)-7 using (S,S)-1 as the chiral CS, and second fraction (t ret = 64.0 min) was assigned to be (S)-7 using (R,R)-1 (d).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 15, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig5\" position=\"float\">\n<label>5</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) HPLC chromatogram\nof <italic>rac</italic>-<bold>6</bold> (black,\nUV absorption at 210 nm; red, CD signal at 254 nm).
