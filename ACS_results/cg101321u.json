Here the seemingly unusually long bond distances of Cu\u2212C/N can be reasonable when the four-coordination mode of cyanide ion is taken into consideration. The \u03bd(CN) stretching vibration in FTIR spectrum is known to be sensitive to Cu\u2212C/N bond lengths in Cu(I)-cyanide complexes and a correlation exists between \u03bd(CN) and Cu(I)\u2212C/N bond lengths; that is, \u03bd(CN) decreases with increasing Cu\u2212C/N bond length. So the FTIR spectrum of compound <bold>2</bold> was recorded (Figure ) and the adsorption band corresponding to the CN<sup>\u2212</sup> stretching vibration appeared at 2038 cm<sup>\u22121</sup>, which is much lower than the typical wavenumber 2080\u22122158 cm<sup>\u22121</sup> for the \u03bc<sub>2</sub>-bridging cyanide groups. For compound <bold>2</bold>, the CN<sup>\u2212</sup> group adopts a rare \u03bc<sub>4</sub>-bridging mode, and the Cu\u2212C/N bond lengths are as long as about 2.0 \u00c5, so it is reasonable that the \u03bd(CN) stretching vibration is decreased dramatically. Notably, the \u03bc<sub>4</sub>-bridging mode of cyanide group is very rare. As far as we know, only two examples are reported in the literature. For one example, the nitrogen atom of CN<sup>\u2212</sup> is simultaneously coordinated to three potassium atoms and the carbon atom to one copper atom; for the other example, the nitrogen atom is simultaneously coordinated to three mercury atoms and the carbon atom to one iron atom.\n</p>", "clean_text": "Interestingly, the bidentate CN- ligand adopts a rare \u03bc4-bridging mode in compound 2; that is, the nitrogen atom is simultaneously coordinated to three type I Cu atoms from one Cu4I3 + cluster and the carbon atom is coordinated to one type II Cu atom from another Cu4I3 + cluster. The bond distances of the Cu-N, Cu-C, and triple C-N bonds are 2.1434(1) \u00c5, 1.9368(1) \u00c5 and 1.10961(1) \u00c5, respectively. For crystallographically characterized cyanocuprates, Cu(I)-C/N distances are found to range from 1.80 to 1.86 \u00c5 in nearly linear dicoordinated systems, increasing to 1.92-1.96 \u00c5 in three-coordinated complexes and further to 1.94-2.0 \u00c5 for four-coordinated cynocuprates. Here the seemingly unusually long bond distances of Cu-C/N can be reasonable when the four-coordination mode of cyanide ion is taken into consideration. The \u03bd(CN) stretching vibration in FTIR spectrum is known to be sensitive to Cu-C/N bond lengths in Cu(I)-cyanide complexes and a correlation exists between \u03bd(CN) and Cu(I)-C/N bond lengths; that is, \u03bd(CN) decreases with increasing Cu-C/N bond length. So the FTIR spectrum of compound 2 was recorded (Figure ) and the adsorption band corresponding to the CN- stretching vibration appeared at 2038 cm-1, which is much lower than the typical wavenumber 2080-2158 cm-1 for the \u03bc2-bridging cyanide groups.
