Although 1 has no free space because the methanol molecules coordinating Cu2+ ions and water molecules occupy the channels, they can be removed to obtain desolvated crystal 2. Crystal 2, containing accessible coordination sites on Cu2+ sites, reveals selective sorption capabilities for CO2 gas and small hydroxylic molecules. The coordinatively unsaturated Cu2+ metal sites have strong interactions with some small hydroxylic molecules, and meanwhile, the other small hydroxylic molecules can be adsorbed in channels' surface by H-bonding interactions with the carbonyl groups of the ligand, which shows that the adsorbate-adsorbent interaction is very important in the selective sorption phenomenon. Furthermore, its adsorption capacity for CO2 gas over N2 and H2 gases may be applied in the removal of CO2 from synthesis gas and flue gas mixtures. The MOF selectively interacts with hydroxylic guests and shows sorption selectivity for water, methanol, ethanol, and n-propanol guests.

Thus, the rehydration process is accompanied by return of the original blue color. The single-crystal X-ray structure determination of 3 revealed that the crystal system and space group remain the same as those of 2, but the copper center has re-form from a square planar (as in 2) to an octahedral coordination environment, owing to the introduction of coordinated water molecules.

The TG profile of 3 also exhibits a stepwise release and shows that all the coordinated and uncoordinated water molecules are lost at 80 \u00b0C (calcd, 10.0%; found, 9.8%) (Figure S2, ). Thus, heating 3 to 110 \u00b0C for 2 h completely reverses the structural change, and the original material 2 is reconstituted after the removal of all the water molecules. After determining the structure, the simulated powder X-ray diffraction (XRPD) was found to match that of as-synthesized compound 1.\n\nThermal Stability\n\nThe stepwise thermogravimetric curve of 1 indicates that the release of the guest water molecules and coordinated methanol molecules occurred at 77 \u00b0C to give the desolvated form, [Cu(4-pmpmd)(opd)] n  (2), which is stable up to 210 \u00b0C (calcd, 14.0%; found, 14.4%). Therefore, the desolvation can be accomplished by heating at the temperature range between 77 and 210 \u00b0C. On further heating, one 4-pmpmd molecule is lost at a temperature of 400 \u00b0C, and then the compound decomposes to form unidentified products (Figure S2a, ). For 2, the first step occurs in the range of 25-250 \u00b0C, corresponding to no escape of guest molecules, which proves 2 to be the void framework.

The TG profile of 3 also exhibits a stepwise release and shows that all the coordinated and uncoordinated water molecules are lost at 80 \u00b0C (calcd, 10.0%; found, 9.8%) (Figure S2c, ).\n\nSorption Properties of 2 \n\nTo study the effect of structural transformation and verify the porosity of 2, which contains coordinatively unsaturated Cu2+ ions, the gas sorption properties were measured for N2 (kinetic diameter = 3.64 \u00c5), H2 (2.8 \u00c5), and CO2 (3.3 \u00c5) gases. All adsorption isotherms of 2 show type I behavior, as expected for materials with micropores (~5 \u00c5). (Figure a). Interestingly, 2 can absorb a significant amount of CO2 at 1 atm and 77 K [84.6 cm3 g-1 (STP)], exhibiting highly selective sorption of CO2 over N2 [12.4 cm3 g-1 (STP)] and H2 [4.4 cm3 g-1 (STP)]. It was also observed that there is some sort of hysteresis between CO2 sorption/desorption curves, which might originate from the strong interactions of CO2 molecules with the host solid 2 and/or a dynamic structural transformation from desolvated to guest occupied structure. The different adsorption capabilities for gases can be ascribed to the existence of a larger quadrupolar moment for CO2 (quadrupolar moment = 4.30 \u00d7 1026 esu cm2) than N2 (1.52 \u00d7 1026 esu cm2) and H2 (0.662 \u00d7 1026 esu cm2), thereby providing stronger framework partial charge/quadrupole interactions for CO2.
