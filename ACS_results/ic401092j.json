After that, a huge weight loss is observed, suggesting the decomposition of the entire framework. After the removal of guest molecules, the high decomposition temperature is further confirmed by its TGA curve. Compared to the decomposition temperature of carboxylate-based Zn7O2 framework (~380 \u00b0C), MAC-7 shows higher thermal stability.\n\nGas Adsorption\n\nTo assess the porosity of MAC-7, N2 adsorption at 77 K was performed on samples activated by supercritical CO2 (Figure a). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area is 533 m2/g (803 m2/g, using the Langmuir methodology). The average pore size (as determined using the Horvath-Kawazoe method) is ~6.8 \u00c5, and the pore volume (using the t-Plot method) is ~0.13 cm3 g-1. The surface area is much smaller than the theoretically calculated accessible surface area of 1744 m2 g-1 (see ). We ascribe the low BET surface area to the structural transformation after removal of guest molecules, while partial collapse of the host frameworks could not be excluded. In addition, the step adsorption in the P/P 0 range of 0.1-0.4 and large hysteresis of desorption isotherm also confirm the framework flexibility, to some extent. \n\nThe sorption of CO2, O2, and N2 at room temperature was then carried out on the activated sample. The results (Figure b) indicate that the framework of MAC-7 shows nil adsorption of N2 and O2 at room temperature, and the uptake amount is ca. 0.23 and 0.07 mmol/g at a pressure of 800 mmHg, respectively. On the other hand, the uptake amount of CO2 increases quickly as the pressure increases, and it reaches to ca. 1.19 mmol/g at 800 mmHg. In the case of post-combustion CO2 capture, the partial pressures of CO2, N2, and O2 are ~0.15, 0.75, and 0.03 bar, respectively. The selectivity of CO2 over N2 and O2, based on the single-component adsorption results, was simply calculated using  S =    x 1  /  y 1     x 2  /  y 2     where S is the selectivity factor, x  i  represents the quantity adsorbed of component i, and y  i  represents the partial pressure of component i. The selectivity of CO2 over N2 is ~17, and the selectivity of CO2 over O2 is ~57; this suggests the potential selective adsorption of CO2 over N2 and O2.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MAC-7",
