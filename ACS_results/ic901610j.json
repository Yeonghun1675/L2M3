As the temperature is lowered, \u03c7m T increases steadily and then abruptly. This implies the clear existence of ferromagnetic interactions between WV and MnIII, which is in sharp contrast to 1 but consistent with the WV-MnIII tetramer. The approximate fit gives g Mn = 2.03, g W = 2, and J = 0.34 cm-1. The intrachain ferromagnetic coupling is also supported by the M(H) curve at 2 K (Figure S5 in the ). In the low-field regime, the Brillouin curve with S = 5/2 agrees well with the experimental data, and a saturation magnetization of 4.11 N\u03b2 approaches the ferromagnetic arrangement (5 N\u03b2).
