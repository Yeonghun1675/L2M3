Yield: 224 mg (71.5%) for DUT-67(Zr) and 259 mg (63.9%) for DUT-67(Hf).\n\nSynthesis of DUT-68\n\nZrCl4/HfCl4 (230 mg/320 mg, 1 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (25 mL) by sonication for 10 min. H2tdc (258 mg, 1.5 mmol) was added to resulting solution, and the mixture was sonicated additional 5 min. After that acetic acid (11 mL, 183 mmol) was added and the mixture was sonicated for further 10 min. The reaction mixture was distributed to 12 Pyrex tubes, which were subsequently tempered at 120 \u00b0C for 72 h. The washing and drying procedure was the same as applied to DUT-67. Yield: 384 mg (53.9%) for DUT-67(Zr) and 453 mg (52.3%) for DUT-67(Hf). The single crystals of DUT-68(Zr) were obtained using the same synthetic protocol, but utilizing larger amount of modulator.\n\nSynthesis of DUT-69\n\nZrCl4 or HfCl4 (230/320 mg, 1 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (50 mL) by sonication for 10 min. H2tdc (172 mg, 1 mmol) was added to the solution and sonicated additional 5 min. After that acetic acid (3 mL, 50 mmol) was added to the mixture and sonicated for 10 min. The mixture was distributed to 10 Pyrex tubes, which were subsequently tempered at 120 \u00b0C for 12 h. The precipitated crystalline powder was centrifuged and washed several times with DMF. The powder was filtered and dried under argon atmosphere for 30 min. Yield: 228 mg (52.4%) for DUT-69(Zr) and 348 mg (58.2%). Single crystals of DUT-69(Zr) and DUT-69(Hf) were obtained using the same procedure that was used for DUT-69(Zr) but utilizing 25 mL of solvent and 6 mL of modulator (acetic acid).", "data":

In accordance with X-ray single crystal analysis, the pores of DUT-67 and DUT-68, which were obtained at high modulator concentrations, are partially occupied by additional clusters. All novel materials are found to be robust, hydrophilic, chemically, and thermally stable. The BET specific surface area amounts to 1064 and 810 m2\u22c5g-1 for DUT-67(Zr) and DUT-67(Hf), 891 and 749 m2\u22c5g-1 for DUT-68(Zr) and DUT-68(Hf), and 560 and 450 m2\u22c5g-1 for DUT-69(Zr) and DUT-69(Hf), respectively.\n\nCrystal data for DUT-67(Zr) C24H8O32S4Zr6.45: M r = 1495.91, cubic Fm3\u0305m, a = 39.120(5) \u00c5,  V =  59868(12) \u00c53, Z = 24, D c = 1.015 g cm-3, 3021 independent reflections observed, R1 = 0.0705 (I > 2\u03c3(I)), wR2 = 0.2064 (all data), and GOF = 1.104, residual electron density max/min 1.513/ -2.614 e \u00c5-3.

The new compound crystallizes in Fm3\u0305m space group with a = 39.120(5) \u00c5, which is significantly smaller than that of DUT-51 (a = 49.964(6) \u00c5). This causes decreasing of inner pores diameters from 18.8 \u00c5 for cuboctahedral and 15.6 \u00c5 for octahedral cage in the case of DUT-51 to 14.2 \u00c5 and 11.7 \u00c5 in DUT-67, respectively (Figure a). The structure of DUT-67, similar to DUT-51, contains an 8-connected cluster (Figure ).\n\nThe complicated hierarchical pore architecture of DUT-68 consist of 4 types of pores (Figure a): rhombicuboctahedral mesopore with inner diameter of 27.7 \u00c5, cuboctahedral cage with 13.9 \u00c5 in diameter, square antiprismatic pore with 12.5 \u00c5 in size, and smallest octahedral pores with 8 \u00c5 in diameter of the inner sphere (vdW radii of atoms were taken into account).\n\nPorosity and Adsorption Experiments\n\nThe thermal stability of DUT-67, DUT-68, and DUT-69 materials (up to 300 \u00b0C) ( Figure S6-S13) is significantly higher in comparison to DUT-51 (150 \u00b0C) but is lower in comparison to UiO-66 (500 \u00b0C).\n\nThe solvent accessible void volume of the DUT-67, DUT-68 (the encapsulated clusters were omitted), and DUT-69 amounts to 66.1%, 60.2%, and 50.9%, respectively. \n\nThe specific surface area, calculated geometrically using the program Poreblazer, is 1767 m2 g-1 for DUT-67(Zr) and 1221 m2 g-1 for DUT-67(Hf), 1786 for DUT-68(Zr) and 1299 m2 g-1 for DUT-68(Hf) (encapsulated clusters are omitted), 1110 m2g-1 for DUT-69(Zr) and 843 m2g-1 for DUT-69(Hf).\n\nNitrogen physisorption experiments at 77 K up to 1 bar revealed \"Type I\" isotherms with maximum nitrogen uptake of 287 cm3 g-1 for DUT-67(Zr) and 216 cm3 g-1 for DUT-67(Hf) (Figure ). The specific surface area, calculated using multipoint BET theory (in the relative pressure range 3 \u00d7 10-3 to 5 \u00d7 10-2 p/p 0) amounts only to 1064 and 810 m2 g-1 for DUT-67(Zr) and DUT-67(Hf), respectively, confirming the possible partial pore blocking by additional cluster incorporated in the compounds. The corresponding specific pore volume is 0.44 cm3 g-1 for DUT-67(Zr) and 0.33 cm3 g-1 for DUT-67(Hf).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "DUT-67", "symbol": "Zr", "chemical formula": "C24H8O32S4Zr6.45"},
