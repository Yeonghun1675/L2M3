According to the equation, we can obtain the -\u0394S m of 1 from the experimental magnetization data (Figure a), and the curves of -\u0394S m are depicted in Figure b. The -\u0394S m per unit of mass reaches the maximum value of 40.6 J kg-1 K-1 [the calculated -\u0394S m max is 46.49 J kg-1 K-1 by using 2R ln(2S + 1)] for a field change of \u0394H = 70 kG at 2 K. Accordingly, the volumetric -\u0394S m max for 1 is 100.69 mJ cm-3 K-1 (falling among the largest values known to date, see Table S1 of the ). Among the reported GdIII complexes which were developed as potential cryogenic molecule-based magnetic refrigerant materials, -\u0394S m max above 35.0 J kg-1 K-1 is relatively rare (also summarized in Table S1 of the ). In addition, the -\u0394S m per unit of mass reaches the value of 34.9 J kg-1 K-1 with \u0394H = 40 kG, which is much larger than most reported GdIII complexes. However, the -\u0394S m of 1 is lower than the calculated value as a significant splitting of the low-lying spin levels is expected in this system because of the AF exchange.

For 1, the \u03c7M T value is 15.55 emu mol-1 K at room temperature, which agrees with the expected spin-only value (15.76 emu mol-1 K) for two uncoupled GdIII ions.
