In comparison with other MOFs for hydrogen or carbon dioxide storage, however, compound 3 has a small surface area (3.2 m2/g vs 181-4500 m2/g) but a big pore diameter (267.8 vs 3.6-17 \u00c5), the latter of which is probably responsible for the fast N2 uptake and release. Indeed, it is possible to observe a hysteresis in the N2 isotherms, showing that the pores can be filled and emptied many times without losing this absorption and desorption potential (see the ). The crystal structure, admitting stretched out ligands between the cluster units, confirms the huge dimension of these pores in 3.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "3", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "N2", "value": "3.2", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}], "pore diameter": [{"value": "267.8", "unit": "\u00c5", "condition": ""}]}]]], "include_properties": ["surface_area", "pore_diameter"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['surface_area', 'pore_diameter']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n  {\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"name\": \"\",\n      \"symbol\": \"3\",\n      \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"surface area\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"BET\",\n        \"probe\": \"N2\",\n        \"value\": \"3.2\",\n        \"unit\": \"m2/g\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"pore diameter\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"267.8\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00c5\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 21, "type": "table", "classification": ["Bond & Angle"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Selected Bond Lengths and Angles for Compounds <bold>1</bold>, <bold>2</bold>, and <bold>4</bold>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table>\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"4\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\"></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<bold>1</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<bold>2</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<bold>4</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>O1\u2212Ca</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.39(1)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.41(7)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>O3\u2212Ca</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.424</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.56(9)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.58(3)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>O4\u2212Ca</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.394</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.46(4)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.50(2)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>O5\u2212Ca</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.55(1)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.60(9)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.58(3)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>O7\u2212Ca</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.35(2)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.39(8)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.41(7)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>O8\u2212Ca</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.35(1)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.38(4)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>O5\u2212Ca 2.395</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>O9\u2212Ca</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.34(9)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.48(7)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>O6\u2212Ca 2.365</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>O10 \u2212Ca</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.33(1)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.45(2)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>Ca\u2212I4</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>3.68(1)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>C1\u2212C6\u2212O1</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>124.4(6)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>123.9(7)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>124.2(1)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>C1\u2212C6\u2212O2</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>113.8(2)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>112.8(2)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>110.30</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>C16\u2212C15\u2212O6</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>113.7(1)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>115.7(2)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>C16\u2212C15\u2212O7</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>124.0(5)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>122.9(8)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "Table 1.
