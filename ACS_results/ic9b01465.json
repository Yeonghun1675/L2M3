For Tb-N, the total weight loss was about 11.3% in the temperature range of 30-150 \u00b0C, and this loss is consistent with the release of lattice and coordinated H2O molecules (calcd 11.3%).

This phenomenon further indicates the influence of different substituents of ligands on the luminescence efficiency of rare-earth ions.\n\nSorption Properties\n\nThe PXRD patterns indicate that the desolvated Tb-N keeps the framework integrity, whereas the framework of Tb-F becomes nonporous after the removal of guest molecules (Figure S12). Thus, the porosity of Tb-N was further evaluated. N2 sorption isotherm of Tb-N shows only surface absorption (Figure S13), and the reason should be the small open channel sizes, which hinder the entry of N2 molecules. Furthermore, the stable and small open channel sizes of Tb-N encourage us to examine its potential application for C2H2/CH4 separation. As shown in a, the C2H2 and CH4 adsorption properties on Tb-N under ambient temperature were investigated. The C2H2 uptakes are 32.3 cm3 g-1 at 273 K and 21.8 cm3 g-1 at 298 K and 1 bar. Meanwhile, negligible amounts of uptake of CH4 (4.2 and 3.0 cm3 g-1 at 273 and 298 K, respectively), bespeaking Tb-N, prefer selective adsorption of C2H2 over CH4. To estimate the practical separation ability for C2H2, a theoretical gas mixture of C2H2/CH4 is guided by the ideal absorbed solution theory (IAST) model (Figure S14). As shown in b, the C2H2/CH4 selectivity for an equimolar mixture is 43, and the value is superior among those MOFs that are reported to possess high C2H2 selectivity.
