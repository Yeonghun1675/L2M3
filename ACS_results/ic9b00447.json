The initial transient absorption spectra of Ru/HA-/H2A and Ru/2/HA-/H2A systems ( and ) exhibit the three characteristic bands of Ru* at 370, 450, and 625 nm that correspond to the absorption of the radical anion located on bipyridine ligand, the ground state depopulation band of Ru and the emission of Ru*, respectively. By monitoring these three bands, the time constant of Ru* extinction has been determined to be quasi identical with and without catalyst, respectively with 72 and 70 ns. These values are also relatively close to those obtained with catalysts 1 (64 ns) and [Co(N4Py)(H2O)]2+ (66 ns). This confirms that, as with earlier systems, the reductive quenching of Ru* by HA- is the dominant mechanism. This reductive quenching leads to the formation of Ru  -  with a peculiar signature at 510 nm observed in the transient spectra ( and ). In absence of 2, we previously reported that Ru  -  decays is observed at 510 nm with two time constants of 11.6 \u03bcs (40%) and 68.6 \u03bcs (60%) via an intricate back electron transfer with the various oxidized forms of ascorbate such as the neutral radical HA\u22c5, the radical anion A\u22c5- and the dehydroascorbic acid A.
