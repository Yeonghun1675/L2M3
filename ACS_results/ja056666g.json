Fits of the high-temperature susceptibility data of lindgrenite to the Curie-Weiss law indicate a net antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor coupling, with \u03d1CW = -16 K. Low temperature data show ferromagnetic long range ordering occurring at T C = 13 K (Figure S2a). This presence of a dominant ferromagnetic exchange interaction was confirmed by the observation of hysteresis loops in M(H) plots (Figure S2b). \n\nThe magnetic properties of (4,4\u2018-bpy)Cu3(OH)2(MoO4)2 (1) shown in Figure  are notably distinct from lindgrenite. A Curie-Weiss fit to the high-temperature susceptibility data yields a \u03d1CW of -60 K. Consistent with the observed antiparallel nearest-neighbor coupling, antiferromagnetic ordering is observed at low temperature and low field (H meas = 100 Oe, T N = 3.1 K). Ramirez has provided a measure for spin frustration by defining f = |\u03d1CW|/T N, with values of f >10 signifying a strong effect. As is evident from f = 19.4, 1 exhibits the signature of a highly frustrated magnetic system. In  a larger measuring field (1 T), all ordering is suppressed down to the lowest temperature that we measured, 2 K.
