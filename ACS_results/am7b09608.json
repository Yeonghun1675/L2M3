A solution of MnCl2 (38 mg, 0.3 mmol) in H2O (20 mL) was then introduced. The mixture formed was further stirred at 100 \u00b0C for 0.5 h, cooled to ambient temperature, and filtered. The resulting light yellow solution was maintained at room temperature (rt) for several days and yielded yellow crystals of MOF 1 (78 mg, 85%). Anal.

The pyridinium carboxylate zwitterionic ligand has a stable, polar backbone and is soluble in polar media, such as MeOH and H2O. Upon ultrasonication, MOFs 1 and 2 solubilized in water to maximum concentrations of approximately 2 mM for 1 and 500 \u03bcM for 2. The PXRD patterns of 1 and 2 after immersion in rat serum, H2O, DMEM (10% FBS, 1% PS), or PBS (1\u00d7, pH = 7.4) for 10 days matched the theoretical patterns, indicating their bulky phase purity and material stability (). The bulk purity of MOFs 1 and 2 was also confirmed by combustion analyses. TGAs indicated that both 1 and 2 are stable up to 250 and 300 \u00b0C, respectively. For 1, the weight loss of 8.96% from 30 to 272 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of one lattice water molecule and two coordinated water molecules (calculated 8.85%). For 2, the weight loss of 13.17% from 30 to 150 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of one lattice water molecule and three coordinated water molecules (calculated 13.21%). The other two lattice water molecules are presumably lost during the air-drying process (Figure S1). TEM micrographs of 1 and 2 gave diameter sizes of 50.0 \u00b1 6.7 nm for 1 and 70.0 \u00b1 8.2 nm for 2 (Figure S2). DLS measurements were also carried out to estimate the hydrodynamic radii of the as-synthesized 1 and 2 in H2O. As shown in Figure S3, the hydrodynamic radii were 81.15 \u00b1 13.82 nm for 1 and 90.34 \u00b1 12.21 nm for 2. DLS measurements are anticipated to give an average hydrodynamic radius rather than the actual size of the nanoparticles, so the particle sizes obtained from DLS are higher than those from the TEM study. The average radius of MOF 2 remains constant in urine for 2 weeks, which further indicates its good stability (Figure S3).", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "{[Mn2(Cmdcp)2(H2O)2]\u22c5H2O} n", "symbol":
