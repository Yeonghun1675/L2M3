This ferromagnetic ordering has been found previously in other oxalato-based 2D and 3D bimetallic compounds with higher Curie temperatures (T C ~ 6.0 K or 5.5 K). We suggest that the smaller T C in 1 may be attributed to the smaller spin density present on the neighboring oxygen atoms of manganese in 1, which is due to the increase in the number of neighbors from 6 to 8, to the larger oxalate oxygen-manganese distances, and to the very low symmetry of the highly distorted octacoordinate environment of the MnII ions.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 16, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>Figure a shows the real (<italic toggle=\"yes\">Z</italic>\u2032) and imaginary (<italic toggle=\"yes\">Z\u2033</italic>) parts of the complex-plane impedance data for <bold>1</bold>.
