The TGA curves of the complexes 1-4 are shown in Figure . TGA curve of 1 showed that the initial weight loss observed at 90-200 \u00b0C may be attributed to the release of lattice unresolved solvent molecules; after that, the framework looks stable up to 450 \u00b0C.

When compared with the free ligand, the strongest emission peaks for 1, 2, 3, and 4 are at 397, 406, 418, and 398 nm, and their excitation spectra mainly show strong peaks at 361, 351, 353, and 365 nm, respectively. The emissions of the new complexes are similar to the free ligand transitions and may be ligand-centered electronic transitions perturbed by the coordination to metal ions rather than to protons.

The enhancement of luminescence may be attributed to the chelation of the ligand with metal center, which effectively increases the rigidity of the ligand and reduces the loss of energy by radiationless decay. \n\nGas Sorption Properties\n\nThough, all the complexes have 3D structures, only 1 and 4 have porous channels in it. Due to low thermal stability of 4, the gas sorption properties of 1 have only been investigated. The gas sorption isotherms of 1 were measured for N2, CO2, CH4, and H2 gases. The low-pressure N2 adsorption measurements performed on 1 at 77 K showed that it is closely related to type I isotherms which are characteristic of microporous materials (Figure ). The surface area and pore volume, which were fitted from the data, gave a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 187.3 m2/g and a Langmuir surface area of 264.1 m2/g. It is to be noted that the nitrogen isotherms of adsorption and desorption are not coincidental. It may be due to the weak interaction between frameworks and N2 molecules at low pressure.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn summary, we have successfully synthesized and characterized four novel alkali metal-organic frameworks with 3D networks.
