The effective carrier mobility (\u03bceff) has been estimated at the higher voltage region of the I versus V 2 plot by SCLC theory using by the Mott-Gurney law (b). The obtained mobility values are 7.01 \u00d7 10-10 and 4.04 \u00d7 10-11 m2 V-1 s-1 for 1 and 1', respectively. The higher mobility of the 1-based device implies a higher transport rate. We have also estimated some key parameters such as the transit time (\u03c4), diffusion coefficient (D), and diffusion length (L D) of the charge carrier of the materials. The estimated parameters in the SCLC region have been depicted in Table S5. From the obtained values, it can be clearly stated that the charge-transport properties of compound 1 is better than those of compound 1'. It should be mentioned that the presence of \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions among the aromatic rings of the quin ligands in compound 1 results an increase in charge transport and, consequently, enhanced conductivity. On the other hand, because of the disappearance of \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0-stacking interactions in 1', the charge-carrier mobility significantly decreases. These results are well consisent with our previously published work, in which charge transport enhances with an increase in the extent of \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions on the photochemical [2 + 2] cycloaddition.
