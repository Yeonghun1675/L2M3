Minimization of a singlet beginning with either one or both tetrazine arms rotated away from bonding distance to copper again optimized to this same \u03ba3 geometry with two coordinated arms; this shows that these (long) bonds form spontaneously (i.e., with a favorable energy yield). For (btzp)CuCl, the HOMO/LUMO gap increases from 1.06 to 2.22 eV as the chloride bends out of plane (Figure ). In this distortion, the LUMO energy changes little, consistent with its description as the in-phase combination of the tetrazine \u03c0* orbitals (Figure ); weak conjugation between the tetrazines via pyridine means this LUMO remains relatively unchanged when the bztp ligand becomes nonplanar in the freely optimized geometry of (btzp)CuCl. In contrast, the HOMO experiences significant stabilization (i.e., is less antibonding) due to the fact that the chloride lone pair overlaps less with the occupied d x 2-y 2  in the nonplanar structure, in accord with Walsh's rule.

These thermodynamic preferences are apparently ruled by the \"compromising\" geometry of the pincer being inferior to a simple chlorocuprate salt, so chloride is not a suitable Lewis base probe. Similar treatment with CO (1 atm) causes prompt dissolution of solid (btzp)CuCl slurried in CD2Cl2 to produce a dark red solution whose 1H NMR spectrum shows three signals for btzp with chemical shifts indicating that the ligand is still attached to copper. This is noteworthy regarding Lewis acidity of (btzp)CuCl since the poor \u03c0 basicity of Cu(I) causes CO to be only weakly bound to most copper complexes. This solution actively effervesces from loss of coordinated CO when head space pressure is decreased, showing poor binding of CO to copper.
