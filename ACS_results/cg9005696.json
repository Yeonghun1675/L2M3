Crystal Structures</title><p>X-ray single-crystal diffraction analysis of <bold>1</bold> indicates the presence of five independent Co(II) ions (in general position), four 5-NH<sub>2</sub>-bdc, two \u03bc<sub>3</sub>\u2212OH<sup>\u2212</sup>, two aqua ligands and seven and a half lattice water in the asymmetric unit. This structure is built around a [Co<sub>5</sub>(\u03bc<sub>3</sub>\u2212OH)<sub>2</sub>] cluster, which can also be regarded as two [Co<sub>3</sub>(\u03bc<sub>3</sub>\u2212OH)] triangles sharing a common Co2 vertex. Each triangle has a central \u03bc<sub>3</sub>\u2212OH<sup>\u2212</sup> core, and they are held together by bridging carboxylates around the periphery. Notably, such a pentanuclear Co(II) cluster is quite different from other known examples. First, the two [Co<sub>3</sub>(\u03bc<sub>3</sub>\u2212OH)] triangles lack any symmetry and are not coplanar with a dihedral angle of 80.1(1)\u00b0. The Co\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Co distance in the irregular triangles span in the range of 3.204(1)\u22123.989(1) \u00c5 (Table S1). Second, the pentanuclear cluster contains 4-, 5-, and 6-coordinated Co(II) ions which results from the various linking modes of 5-NH<sub>2</sub>-bdc (Figure a). Furthermore, the ligands adopt \u03b7<sup>1</sup>:\u03b7<sup>1</sup>:\u03b7<sup>1</sup>:\u03b7<sup>1</sup>:\u03b7<sup>1</sup>:\u03bc<sub>5</sub> and \u03b7<sup>1</sup>:\u03b7<sup>1</sup>:\u03b7<sup>1</sup>:\u03b7<sup>1</sup>:\u03bc<sub>4</sub> coordinated fashions. The first one is unique and the largest coordination mode ever seen for this 5-NH<sub>2</sub>-bdc ligand in Co(II) complexes (Scheme S1). In detail, the Co1 and Co5 ions have similar N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> octahedral (<italic toggle=\"yes\">O</italic>\n<sub>h</sub>) geometries surrounded by one \u03bc<sub>3</sub>\u2212OH<sup>\u2212</sup>, three carboxylate oxygen atoms and two amino groups from five different 5-NH<sub>2</sub>-bdc ligands.

Crystal Structures\n\nX-ray single-crystal diffraction analysis of 1 indicates the presence of five independent Co(II) ions (in general position), four 5-NH2-bdc, two \u03bc3-OH-, two aqua ligands and seven and a half lattice water in the asymmetric unit. This structure is built around a [Co5(\u03bc3-OH)2] cluster, which can also be regarded as two [Co3(\u03bc3-OH)] triangles sharing a common Co2 vertex. Each triangle has a central \u03bc3-OH- core, and they are held together by bridging carboxylates around the periphery. Notably, such a pentanuclear Co(II) cluster is quite different from other known examples. First, the two [Co3(\u03bc3-OH)] triangles lack any symmetry and are not coplanar with a dihedral angle of 80.1(1)\u00b0. The Co\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Co distance in the irregular triangles span in the range of 3.204(1)-3.989(1) \u00c5 (Table S1). Second, the pentanuclear cluster contains 4-, 5-, and 6-coordinated Co(II) ions which results from the various linking modes of 5-NH2-bdc (Figure a). Furthermore, the ligands adopt \u03b71:\u03b71:\u03b71:\u03b71:\u03b71:\u03bc5 and \u03b71:\u03b71:\u03b71:\u03b71:\u03bc4 coordinated fashions.

Co2 also has an octahedral sphere that is completed by one terminal water ligand, two \u03bc3-OH-, and three syn-syn bridging carboxylate groups from different 5-NH2-bdc ligands. Co4 is coordinated by one \u03bc3-OH- group, two syn-syn bridging and one monodentate carboxylates from three different 5-NH2-bdc ligands to complete a distorted tetrahedral (T d) geometry, whereas Co3 shows a square-pyramidal (S P) sphere composed by one \u03bc3-OH-, three oxygen atoms from the bridging carboxylates and one terminal water ligand.
