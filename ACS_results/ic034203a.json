Considering this behavior, the broad signal can be attributed to the oxalate copper dimers, the strong antiferromagnetic interaction being responsible for the decreasing intensity with decreasing temperature. However, the observed signal does not correspond to an isolated triplet S = 1 state, and therefore a non-negligible magnetic interaction has to be established between dimers. The exchange pathway must involve the [SiW11O39Cu(H2O)]6- units that link the [Cu2(bpy)2(\u03bc-ox)]2+ entities to build infinite chains. The participation of the Cu(II) ion inside the POM cluster in the magnetic exchange cannot be a priori disregarded, even if it seems not very probable. New studies on related systems are in progress in order to clarify this point.
