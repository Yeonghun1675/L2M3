Synthesis of a Ni-bipy-nitrate framework in ethanol in a manner similar to that described above affords B, Ni2(bipy)3(NO3)4\u22c52C2H5OH. This material contains a T-shaped coordination around the Ni2+ cation similar to that found in A, but these T-shaped units are linked together in a different arrangement, resulting in a two-dimensional bilayer structure. B is stable to guest loss, and the resulting microporous material readily sorbs methanol. As the ethanol- templated framework structure differs from that grown from a solution of the reagents in methanol, it follows that the sorption of methanol into the ethanol-templated structure results in a metastable phase. Desolvation of the powdered ethanol-templated material B at 180 \u00b0C for 1 h followed by room-temperature exposure to the static atmosphere above a reservoir of methanol caused a rapid transformation to the methanol-templated structure A.
