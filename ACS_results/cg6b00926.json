The reformation of an Ag-N bond to the Ag+ ion from the adjacent triangle leads to the new zigzag chain structure (). PXRD measurements were utilized to monitor these transformations (). Single crystals of 1 and 2 were filtered off from their reaction solutions and dried at room temperature for 5 h. For both, 1 and 2, crystals were milled for PXRD measurements. Although samples of 1 and 2 were treated and prepared in the same way, PXRD studies reveal that the structural transformation of 2 occurs faster than that of 1. Crystals of 2 transform instantaneously after separating them from their mother liqueur; the milled sample of 2 shows a diffraction pattern perfectly matching the simulated pattern of 3. In contrast, for sample 1, at low diffraction angles up to 2\u03b8 = 25\u00b0 the diffraction pattern matches that of the simulation based on single crystal structure data of 1, whereas above 2\u0398 = 25\u00b0 the diffraction pattern is in close agreement to the simulation based on single crystal structure data of 3. This suggests that the structure transformation started during the PXRD data collection (). Two hours after milling, the pattern of the same sample is in good agreement with the simulated pattern for 3. These observations indicate an influence of crystal packing in 1 and 2 on the rate of structural transformation to 3.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 24, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch3\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Ring-Opening Structural Transformation</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr3\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cg-2016-00926p_0010.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 3  Ring-Opening Structural Transformation   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 25, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig5\" position=\"float\">\n<label>5</label>\n<caption>\n<p>X-ray powder diffraction patterns of milled crystals of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> and comparison with the simulated diffraction\npatterns of <bold>1</bold>, <bold>2</bold>, and <bold>3</bold> based\non single crystal data (\u03bb = 1.54060 \u00c5).</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr8\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cg-2016-00926p_0006.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 5  X-ray powder diffraction patterns of milled crystals of 1 and 2 and comparison with the simulated diffraction patterns of 1, 2, and 3 based on single crystal data (\u03bb = 1.54060 \u00c5).
