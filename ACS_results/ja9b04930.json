Such a phenomenon has been also observed in the as-synthesized yellow sample 1, which can undergo a rapid visible photochromic transformation with exposure to ultraviolet light in air at room temperature. Upon irradiation with a 300 W xenon lamp for about 1 min, 1 gradually turns from yellow to blue (1P), and no further color change was observed after continuous irradiation for 20 min. The blue crystals (1P) are stable in air and slowly decolored in dark at ambient temperature for more than 14 days. A fast back to orange color can be completed by heating at 120 \u00b0C for about 4 h.

Meanwhile, a similar coloration phenomenon is also observed after Al K\u03b1 X-ray irradiation (Figure S8). The completed decoloration process also can be achieved by heating at 120 \u00b0C or putting in the dark at ambient temperature. When X-rays become harder, no noticeable color change is observed after illumination by a hard X-ray source (Mo K\u03b1, \u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5) for 12 h, indicating that sample 1 is not responsive to hard X-ray irradiation but easily sensitive to UV light and soft X-rays at room temperature.

Before UV light irradiation, 1 shows a weak absorption band centered at about 471 nm, similar to that of some viologen-based materials. Upon UV light irradiation, two new absorption bands were found to center at about 405 and 621 nm (a), and their intensities increase gradually with the duration of UV irradiation. Kinetic studies based on the absorbance at 621 nm indicate that the coloration process exhibit fist-order kinetics with two stages (Figure S11), which show resemblance to the reported viologen-based chromic compounds. At the first stage, the photoresponsive rate increases rapidly with a higher rate constant (k 1 = 1.5 \u00d7 10-2 s-1), because the surfaces of the crystals undergo the photochemical reactions at first. In the second stage, the corresponding rate increases slowly with a lower rate constant (k 2 = 6 \u00d7 10-3 s-1), which is due to that the inner parts begin to undergo the photochemical reaction in this stage. To be noted, the value of k for the photochromic reaction is about 10 times faster than that for the thermochromic reaction, implying that the UV light irradiation is more effective than heat stimuli. During the coloration process, the UV-vis spectra of 1 and 1P are obviously different, but both IR and PXRD spectra have no significant change (Figures S3 and S12), revealing no clear structural transformation or photolysis before and after irradiation. As confirmed by EPR measurements, this photoresponsive phenomenon is caused by a photoinduced charge-transfer chemical process. EPR measurement of sample 1 shows a strong single-line signal with g = 2.0071 after coloration (b), further confirming that the photoinduced chromism is more likely to arise from photostimulated reduction of bpybc ligands to generate bpybc\u22c5- radicals (Scheme S1). To understand the photoinduced electron-transfer processes, DFT calculations have been carefully performed. As shown in Figure S13, the majority of the electron distribution of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is located on the carboxy group, while that of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is mainly centered on the pyridinum cation. Such electron distributions on HOMO and LUMO indicate that the electron-rich benzene carboxylate group and electron-deficient pyridinium unit can act as the electron donor and acceptor, respectively.

Interestingly, with exposure to various amine vapors that has seriously threatened environment safety and human health, the pressed sample 1 differs significantly in the speed and degree of color change. Yellow 1 immediately becomes pale blue once fumed with dimethylamine vapor (from 30% dimethylamine aqueous solution). The color will become more deep with increasing exposure time, and finally the color of the sample changes from pale blue to black purple after ca. 10 s (a). 1@DEA can revert to yellow when fumed with HCl vapor for about 5 min, whereas color bleaching in air at room temperature needs much longer time (~1 h). Once fumed with ethylamine and propylamine vapor, the pressed sample 1 immediately turns to purple, which is faster than the DEA coloration. The purple samples revert to original yellow when fumed with HCl or standing in air at room temperature. Fuming with butylamine and benzylamine for ~10 s, the color of 1 becomes brown and green, respectively. It then reverts to original yellow when fumed with HCl for ~2 min. The sample is less sensitive to NH3 than other amines, and it begins to become pale green after NH3 fuming for 1 min, and increased exposure time will also significantly deepen the color until purple. It will undergo self-recovery to its original color at room temperature after removal from fume. Of course, HCl fume will also bleach the purple sample for 5 min. However, when fumed with aniline, dibenzylamine, diisopropylamine, and triethylamine, sample 1 shows no color change. Notably, the sample is more sensitive to most primary amines and partial secondary amines than to tertiary amines and bulkier amines. Such a selective vapochromic phenomenon can also be observed when the pressed 1 is sprayed on the filter paper or doped into the polymer matrixes to form PMMA-supported films (Figures S24-S26).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 21, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig6\" position=\"float\">\n<label>6</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Vapochromic photographs\n(a) and UV\u2013vis diffuse-reflectance\nspectra (b) of the pressed sample <bold>1</bold> before and after\nexposure to various amine vapors or solutions.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr6\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ja-2019-049304_0005.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 6  Vapochromic photographs (a) and UV-vis diffuse-reflectance spectra (b) of the pressed sample 1 before and after exposure to various amine vapors or solutions.
