Substitution of fluoride, bromide, or iodide for the bridging chloride ligand can be expected to have a significant impact on the strength of the magnetic exchange interactions, with the heavier bridges likely leading to increased coupling. Replacement of the UIV centers with other AnIV centers via the synthesis and implementation of dimeric complexes of the type [An(Me2Pz)4]2 would enable the study of how variation of the number and radial extension of the 5f electrons effects coupling. Of particular interest are actinide ions such as NpIV, for which an odd electron count would prevent complete loss of the total angular momentum, even at very low temperatures, enabling access to high-spin ground states. Such experiments, of course, require that one have the facilities to work with highly radioactive elements. An alternative means of ensuring an odd 5f electron count would be to develop similar modular systems that stabilize uranium in the 3+ oxidation state. This approach would likely have the added benefit of increasing the strength of the exchange interactions, owing to the more diffuse 5f orbitals of the UIII centers. Finally, one could envision using a similar synthetic approach to generate bent trinuclear clusters incorporating cis-dichloro complexes, or even, through the use of transition metal complexes bearing more than two terminal chloride ligands, higher-nuclearity clusters with a higher potential total spin.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 58, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<title>Conclusions and Outlook</title><p>Targeted assembly of simple, low-nuclearity clusters has been and continues to be the key to unraveling the complex interactions that give rise to magnetic exchange coupling in actinide-containing molecules.
