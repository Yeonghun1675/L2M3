In the present case, this paradigm is expressed in the context of a one-pot method that allows for the generation of interlocked species in nearly quantitative yield. Three components are used, namely, a flexible tetraimidazolium molecular box (1 4+), a trianion, and a source of Ag+ cations. Their use gives rise to rotaxane species that are stable in solution and in the solid state. In spite of this stability, the nature of the system can be controlled. For instance, sequential treatment with I- followed by Ag+ ion in DMSO-d 6 solution allows in sequence the partial decomposition and subsequent reconstruction of the core [3]rotaxane entity (complex [(1 4+)2\u22c55 3\u22c5(Ag+)5]4+). Increasing the temperature or adding certain small molecular species (e.g., D2O, methanol-d 4, or acetonitrile-d 3) serves to increase the rate of internal motion within the overall complex. Other additives, namely acetone-d 6 and THF-d 8, serve to retard the conformational flipping process.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 54, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The versatility and simplicity of the current\napproach leads us\nto propose that the use of multicomponent assembly involving anionic\nguests, cationic hosts, and appropriately chosen metal centers may\nallow for the facile synthesis of complex metal\u2013organic MIMs\nthat are not easily accessed via other, more classic synthetic methods.</p>", "clean_text": "The versatility and simplicity of the current approach leads us to propose that the use of multicomponent assembly involving anionic guests, cationic hosts, and appropriately chosen metal centers may allow for the facile synthesis of complex metal-organic MIMs that are not easily accessed via other, more classic synthetic methods.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 55, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>In preliminary work designed to test the above proposition, an\neffort was made to replace the Ag<sup>+</sup> cation by Cd<sup>2+</sup> (as the nitrate salt).
