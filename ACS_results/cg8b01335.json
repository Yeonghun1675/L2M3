As shown in Figures S15-S16, PXRD spectra of two compounds after sensing experiments have slight differences from the ones before sensing experiments, but return to their origins after immersion in DMF. It means that the structures of compounds 1 and 2 are highly robust under the experimental conditions and remained unchanged during the sensing experiments, which rules out the possibility of collapse of the framework leading to the luminescence quenching. Considering the strong \u03c0-conjugated effect of ligand Py2TTz and the nature of electron deficiency of analytes, the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) mechanism is proposed. Generally, the excited electrons lying in the higher LUMO of the fluorescent ligand are transferred to the lower LUMO of the electron-deficient analytes, resulting in fluorescence quenching. The lower the LUMO energy of analytes, the more easily the electrons are transferred to the acceptor. To investigate LUMO energy levels of analytes, the frontier molecular orbitals of above-mentioned analytes and ligand are calculated by density functional theory (DFT), as shown in  and Table S7. It is obvious that TNP has the lowest LUMO energy level among tested nitroaromatics, which explains its highest quenching efficiency.
