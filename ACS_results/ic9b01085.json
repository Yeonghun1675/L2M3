This case is also similar in BSCY (a). However, the molecular gap of BPCY between nonbonding states and anti-\u03c0 states is intersected by two intense bands resulting from Pb atoms: namely, Pb 6p orbitals (red bands) and p-\u03c0* coexisting orbitals (blue bands) (b). In addition, the density of states also demonstrated that Pb atoms make the dominant contribution to the conduction band bottom (from 3.5 to 5 eV) in BPCY whereas the populations from Sr atoms in BSCY are nearly ignorable (c,d). Particularly, the Pb 6s electrons are strongly localized at the deep valence band (-7.5 eV) and make no contribution to the valence band near the Fermi level, which also indicates that Pb 6s2 lone pairs are stereochemically inert.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 13, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig3\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Band structure\nand density of states of BSCY (a, c) and BPCY (b, d).
