Accordingly, we recorded various O2 and CO2 adsorption isotherms for Al-soc-MOF-1. Notably, the amounts of O2 and CO2 adsorbed in Al-soc-MOF-1 near saturation pressures (0.95 p/p 0), derived from adsorption isotherms at 90.2 and 195.15 K for O2 and CO2, respectively, were found to be remarkably high (1757 and 1236 cm3 (STP)/g, respectively) (Figure S29 in the Supporting Information). Markedly, the combination of experimentally accessible low pressure (at 90.2 K) and high-pressure O2 adsorption data up to 115 bar (at 298 K) (combined with the Toth model) revealed that Al-soc-MOF-1 exhibits a record of 29 mmol/g absolute gravimetric O2 uptake at 140 bar, which is much higher than those of HKUST-1 (13.2 mmol/g) and NU-125 (17.4 mmol/g), reference materials for this application (). Additionally, Al-soc-MOF-1 displayed a record deliverable capacity between 5 and 140 bar of 27.5 mmol/g, vs 11.8 and 15.4 mmol/g for HKUST-1 and NU-125, respectively (a). Consequently, by neglecting the effect of packing density and the void space occupied by the material, a 1 L cylinder filled with Al-soc-MOF-1 will potentially enhance the volumetric O2 storage capacity (172 cm3/cm3) by 70% at 100 bar, in comparison to a conventional empty cylinder (b). It is notable that, if we assume a prospective 25% loss associated with packing density, the Al-soc-MOF-1 volumetric O2 storage capacity still offers a 25% enhancement over an empty cylinder. Analysis of the O2 adsorption recorded at variable temperatures indicated that 1 exhibits a relatively low O2 heat of adsorption (10 kJ/mol at low loading) over the whole O2 loading range, slightly higher than the O2 latent heat of evaporation (Figure S33 in the Supporting Information).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 39, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig9\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>9</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Single-component\ngravimetric gas adsorption isotherm for O<sub>2</sub> at 298 K showing\nthat <bold>1</bold> exhibits the highest\ndeliverable uptake reported so far.

It is notable that the resultant high microporosity (surface area and pore volume) is exceptional and has not been observed, prior to this work, using a traditional activation method that often causes pore collapse in the case of highly porous MOFs. Such a unique feature is of prime importance for the implementation and deployment of 1-3 as gas storage media for onboard or stationary gas storage applications.\n\nThe methane adsorption isotherms at 112 K for 1-3 revealed remarkable CH4 uptakes near saturation pressures e.g., 1336, 1205, and 1055 cm3 (STP)/g at p/p 0 = 0.95, respectively (Figures S28a, S35a, and S37a in the Supporting Information).
