Sodium tungstate dihydrate (9.9 g, 0.03 mol) was dissolved in 40 mL of H2O and added to the p-arsanilic acid solution. The pH of the solution was reduced to 6 by the dropwise addition of concentrated HCl. Guanidine hydrochloride (2.4 g, 0.025 mol) was added to the solution. The solution was boiled to reduce the volume to 150 mL. After solvent evaporation for 4 days in an open beaker, 8.73 g of an off-white crystalline material was obtained.
