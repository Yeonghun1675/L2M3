An 81% yield was achieved after 5 h, which was slighter lower than the 86% yield achieved with grinding or stirring. Furthermore, nitrogen sorption measurments after SC-CO2 activation indicated that the exerimentally determined BET surface areas was 1.2358 m2 g-1. In further studies, due to the very low N2 uptake (), the pore size distributions (PSDs) of 2 could not be afforded, which clearly showed that there were no pores in 2. Moreover, PLATON analysis provided no free void volume ratio of 2, which further suggented that 2 was a completely nonporous material. Thus, these resluts afforded unambiguous evidence that the cyclization reactions took place on the surface of the crystals with a cooperative effect rather than in the interior of the crystals. Moreover, to research the influence of the coordinated water molecules for the cyclization reaction, crystalline samples of 2 were activated in a drying oven at 235 \u00b0C to exclude the coordinated water molecules () and formed the activated samples 2a. Subsequently,  cyclization of 4 and 5a was carried out with activated samples of 2a under the same reaction conditions. A 94% yield was obtained by using the activated samples of 2a after 5 h; this clearly demonstrated that the coordinated water molecules were good leaving groups and would be advantageous to make contact with organic substrates with the catalytic active centers in the catalytic process.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 34, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>To examine whether the cyclization\nreactions were homogeneous or heterogeneous, the leaching of silver\nfrom the crystalline sampes of <bold>2</bold> during the cyclization\nreaction was first examined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS)\nanalysis, and only slight leaching (&lt;1 ppm) was achieved.
