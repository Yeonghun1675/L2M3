Furthermore, we have shown that treatment with supercritical CO2 is an effective strategy for eliminating crystal fragmentation (and interior site exposure) during activation. By application of both strategies, high substrate size selectivity can be engendered for epoxidation catalysis by MnSO-MOF, albeit only for a limited time. The synthesis of metallosalen MOFs with large pores will allow for the future exploration of a wide variety of catalytic reactions, especially those that require significantly larger pore environments than have been previously available.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 21, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Synthesis and characterization data for <bold>MnSO-MOF</bold> including single-crystal XRD data in CIF format, an improved synthesis of <bold>2</bold>, details of the supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> processing procedure, a description of the catalytic conditions and full catalytic results, including <italic toggle=\"yes\">safety warnings</italic> and enantioselectivity data.
