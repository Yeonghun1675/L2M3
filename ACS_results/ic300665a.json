The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) observations of Cl 2p peaks in 2-8 () supported well the coexistence of the ClO4 - anion. To further confirm the encapsulated lanthanide species in 1 to be the hydrate form, thermogravimetric analyses were carried out on the samples of 2-8 (). TGA traces showed a gradual weight-loss step (below 150 \u00b0C) of 12.9% for 2, (calcd. 13.3%), 17.3% for 3 (calcd. 16.4%), 12.1% for 4 (calcd. 11.9%), 11.2% for 5 (calcd. 10.1%), 18.7% for 6 (calcd. 18.5%), 10.5% for 7 (calcd. 9.9%), and 14.7% for 8 (calcd. 14.5%), respectively, corresponding to escape of the water guest molecules. In addition, the IR spectra performed on 2-8 also confirmed the existence of water molecules (). It is well-known that the hydration states of the lanthanide complexes have a very significant effect on their metal-centered luminescent behaviors resulted from the O-H vibrational quenching. The intense emission of Ln(H2O)8 3+ herein reasonably indicates that the strong coupling of O-H vibrations on the coordinated water molecules is efficiently reduced within the heteroatom-rich cavities by the interhost-guest O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O and O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5N H-bonding interactions. Besides our research group, some tunable luminescent MOFs based on reversible Ln3+ encapsulation have been reported very recently by others; the lanthanide species loading therein, however, was carried out in DMF solution in nonhydrate form. Lanthanide hydrate species loading in aqueous solution based on porous heteroatom-rich MOFs herein effectively expands the scope of guest-driven lanthanide luminescent materials.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 25, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Luminescence in Water</title><p>To evaluate the protecting and\nsensitizing ability of Cd(II)-MOF in an aqueous medium, the luminescent\nproperties of [Ln(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>8</sub>]<sup>3+</sup>\u2282Cd(II)-MOF\n(<bold>2</bold>\u2013<bold>4</bold>) and [Ln/Ln\u2032(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>8</sub>]<sup>3+</sup>\u2282Cd(II)-MOF (<bold>5</bold>\u2013<bold>7</bold>) were tested in water.
