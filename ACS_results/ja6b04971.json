These films were firmly\nattached to the glass surface while gently washing with the supernatant\nsolution, but could be easily removed by mechanical stress (e.g.,\nscratching the film surface).</p>", "clean_text": "Deposition of pm-MOPs on Glass\n\nImmobilization of MOPs on surfaces has been largely achieved in two steps: synthesis and isolation of soluble MOPs, followed by the slow evaporation of the MOP-containing solution directly onto a substrate. During the course of our experiments, it became apparent that pm-MOP crystals tended to adhere to the surface of the glass scintillation vials. It was hypothesized that polymer 1 could mediate the adhesion of pm-MOP crystals onto glass substrates. Thus, by including small pieces of glass (~0.75 \u00d7 0.75 cm2) in the reaction vial, pm-MOPs affixed to glass could be readily isolated. Moreover, making the reaction mixture somewhat more concentrated, a dense packing of pm-MOP crystals could be formed on the glass slides (Table S2). For example, pm-MOP-H was synthesized by heating a solution containing 0.04 mmol of Cu(NO3)2\u22c52.5H2O, 0.035 mmol of H2 m-bdc, and 0.006 mmol of polymer 1 in 0.75 mL DMF/0.25 mL EtOH at 80 \u00b0C for 16 h.

Due to the aggregation/film formation, the crystals comprising these films were small and their morphology could not be clearly observed under optical microscope (unlike the modulated pm-MOPs described above). The deposition of pm-MOP-H, -OH, -NO2, -CH3, and -NH2 was achieved on glass under solvothermal conditions, resulting in a thin layer of crystals (, S18, S22, and S25).

Generally, at 298 K and 1 atm, all MOPs and pm-MOPs displayed CO2 adsorption range from 10 to 35 cm3 g-1, but negligible N2 adsorption ( and S35). These results are comparable with that of other MOP studies. At low temperature, MOPs and pm-MOPs exhibited very distinct adsorption behaviors. pm-MOP-CH3 and pm-MOP-NH2 lacked a modulator-free MOP counterpart (because they form MOFs in the absence of polymer 1), but behaved similar to other pm-MOPs reported here (Figure S35).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOP", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "10 to 35", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "1 atm", "condition": "After solvent exchange with EtOH and CH2Cl2 for 3 d, activated at 80 \u00b0C for 10 h"}, {"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "negligible", "unit": "", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "1 atm", "condition": "After solvent exchange with EtOH and CH2Cl2 for 3 d, activated at 80 \u00b0C for 10 h"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "pm-MOP", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "10 to 35", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "1 atm", "condition": "After solvent exchange with EtOH and CH2Cl2 for 3 d, activated at 80 \u00b0C for 10 h"}, {"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "negligible", "unit": "", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "1 atm", "condition": "After solvent exchange with EtOH and CH2Cl2 for 3 d, activated at 80 \u00b0C for 10 h"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["gas_adsorption"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['gas_adsorption']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"MOP\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"CO2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"10 to 35\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"298 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"1 atm\",\n                \"condition\": \"After solvent exchange with EtOH and CH2Cl2 for 3 d, activated at 80 \u00b0C for 10 h\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"N2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"negligible\",\n                \"unit\": \"\",\n                \"temperature\": \"298 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"1 atm\",\n                \"condition\": \"After solvent exchange with EtOH and CH2Cl2 for 3 d, activated at 80 \u00b0C for 10 h\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"pm-MOP\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"CO2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"10 to 35\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"298 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"1 atm\",\n                \"condition\": \"After solvent exchange with EtOH and CH2Cl2 for 3 d, activated at 80 \u00b0C for 10 h\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"N2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"negligible\",\n                \"unit\": \"\",\n                \"temperature\": \"298 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"1 atm\",\n                \"condition\": \"After solvent exchange with EtOH and CH2Cl2 for 3 d, activated at 80 \u00b0C for 10 h\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 6, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Proposed strategy to\nuse a metal-binding polymer (i.e., polymer\nligand) as a modulator for the controlled growth and assembly of MOPs.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr2\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ja-2016-04971r_0001.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Proposed strategy to use a metal-binding polymer (i.e., polymer ligand) as a modulator for the controlled growth and assembly of MOPs.
