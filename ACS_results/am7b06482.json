For comparison, the TNP detection performance of the parent Zn-MOF was also predicted. The adsorption energy of TNP in two MOFs is calculated as follows:      E   ads   =   E   total   -  (   E   MOF   +   E   mol   )    where E total is the total adsorption energy of the system, E MOF is the total energy of Zn-MOF, E mol is the energy of adsorbate, and E ads is the calculated adsorption energy.

The calculation results show that E ads of TNP in the amino-functionalized Zn-MOF (2) is -0.99 eV, which is much lower than the value of -0.21 eV in the parent Zn-MOF (1), suggesting that 2 has stronger adsorption ability to TNP than 1. In the optimized structure of TNP in 2, as shown in , the proton from the hydroxyl group of TNP binds to the amino group, and thus strong hydrogen-bonding interactions between the protonated amino group of MOF and the phenolic oxygen atom of TNP molecule contribute to the good adsorption ability of 2 to TNP.

The results show that a new band at 430 nm appeared, which further supports the static mechanism. Additionally, the strong hydrogen-bond interactions between the amino group of bdc-NH2 ligand and the hydroxyl group of TNP also contribute to emission quenching, as confirmed by the above theoretical calculation results. Some other analytes possessing hydroxyl groups\ue5f82,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP), 4-nitrophenol (NP), and phenol\ue5f8were also examined (Figures S30-S32). The order of observed quenching response was TNP > 2,4-DNT > NP > phenol, which is well consistent with the sequence of acidity. However, other nitro analytes have no acidic hydroxyl group to interact with amino groups within the framework, so they show very low quenching effects. Hence, 2 shows highly selective and sensitive detection of TNP in the presence of other nitro explosives, owing to the occurrence of electron-transfer and energy-transfer processes in addition to hydrogen-bond interactions.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 20, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig6\" position=\"float\">\n<label>6</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Extent of spectral overlap between the analyte absorption\nband\nand the emission band of <bold>2</bold>.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr6\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"am-2017-06482p_0006.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 6  Extent of spectral overlap between the analyte absorption band and the emission band of 2.
