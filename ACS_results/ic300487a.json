The \u03c7M T value for 1\u22c5guests at 300 K are 68.26 cm3 K mol-1, significantly higher than the spin-only value expected for 24 isolated CoII ions with S = 3/2 (45.00 cm3 K mol-1; g = 2.0). It gives a realistic g Co value of 2.46 if we assume that the ions are uncoupled; this result is attributed to the unquenched orbital contributions of CoII ions in an octahedral field. Upon temperature cooling, the \u03c7M T value monotonously decreases to attain a value of 4.51 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K, which indicates dominant antiferromagnetic interactions within and between the Co24 wheels; meanwhile, spin-orbital coupling effects may also influence the overall profile. A low-temperature M versus H plot (Figure S5 in the ) further confirms the overall antiferromagnetic interactions. The \u03c7M T value for 2\u22c5guests at 300 K is 28.43 cm3 K mol-1, slightly higher than the spin-only value expected for 24 isolated NiII ions with S = 1 (24.00 cm3 K mol-1; g = 2.0) and giving a realistic g Ni value of 2.18. The \u03c7M T value generally decreases to 22.45 cm3 K mol-1 at 20 K and then rises sharply to reach a value of 33.62 cm3 K mol-1 at 3 K, followed by a sudden drop to 31.93 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K. This profile and the \u03b8 value (-6.6 K; Figure S4 in the ) indicate dominant antiferromagnetic interactions within the Ni24 wheel; the rise of the \u03c7M T value at low temperature implies that extrinsic intrawheel antiferromagnetic interactions may be the result of competitive ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions between NiII ions that lead to a ground-state spin (S T ~ 6 corresponding to the \u03c7M T value at a minimum) and adjacent wheels ferromagnetically coupled or antiferromagnetically coupled with spin canting. The significant magnetic ground state is further supported by the low-temperature M versus H plot (Figure S6 in the ), which shows a quick increase (compared with 1\u22c5guests) at relatively low external fields. The value of the magnetization (12-14 \u03bcB per NiII 24 unit) after this quick increase confirms the presence of dominant antiferromagnetic interactions that are uncompensated for by ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions within the 2 wheel.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 10, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig3\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>\u03c7<sub>M</sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic> versus <italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic> plots of <bold>1</bold>\u00b7guests and <bold>2</bold>\u00b7guests\nmeasured at 1 kOe external field (a) and field-dependent magnetic\nsusceptibilities of <bold>2</bold>\u00b7guests in the 2\u201340\nK temperature range (b).</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr3\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2012-00487a_0005.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 3  \u03c7M T versus T plots of 1\u22c5guests and 2\u22c5guests measured at 1 kOe external field (a) and field-dependent magnetic susceptibilities of 2\u22c5guests in the 2-40 K temperature range (b).
