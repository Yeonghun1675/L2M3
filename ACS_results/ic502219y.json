As shown in Figures a and, two adjacent Zn ions, bridged by the carboxylate groups of BODIPY-based ligands, form a paddle-wheel type secondary building unit (SBU)-[Zn2(COO)4] with Zn-Zn distance about 3.0 \u00c5, which is connected by four BODIPY-based dicarboxylic acid groups and further extended into a 2D sheet-like layer. At the same time, these 2D layers are pillared by the bpp linkers along the c axis to give rise to a 3D pillared-layer porous framework with pore sizes of ~14.8 \u00d7 14.8 \u00c52, while the structure induces 2-fold interpenetration of the framework which reduces the void space with pore sizes of ~11.5 \u00d7 11.5 \u00c52. Therefore, MOF 1 can be represented as a 6-connected 2-fold interpenetration topology, and the point symbol for the net is 412\u22c563. A PXRD experiment for case 1 also has been carried out to check its phase purity. As shown in , the peak positions of the experimental PXRD spectrum match well with that of th esimulated one, indicating that the crystal structure is truly representative of the bulk sample. The differences in intensity may be due to the preferred orientation of the crystal products. In addition, application of the SQUEEZE routine in PLATON suggests that a void volume is 35% in the total cell. These channels are occupied by H2O and EtOH, which are confirmed by elemental analysis and TGA. Furthermore, a TGA experiment was performed under air atmosphere to check the thermal stability of MOF 1 (). For instance, it successively lost weight of 10.05% (calcd 10.03%) in the range of 30-277 \u00b0C due to one lattice water molecule and one EtOH molecule, which also implies the porosity. Over 277 \u00b0C, the framework of sample 1 was unstable and decomposed gradually. Thus, gas sorption measurement for the as-synthesized sample 1 after acetone exchange was conducted up to a relative pressure (p/p 0) of 1.0 on the activated frameworks at STP. N2 adsorption isotherm demonstrates that MOF 1 exhibits a small gas adsorption value of 18 cm3/g with a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 27 m2/g (). This result may be attributed to the change from crystalline phase to amorphous phase of MOF 1, on account of the broadening, or even disappearing of some peaks in the PXRD spectrum (). Furthermore, the flowing SC-CO2 activation also has been used to avoid collapse during volatile solvent evacuation. After SC-CO2 activation, as shown in , the N2 adsorption isotherm of MOF 1 illustrates the BET surface area of 257 m2/g with the gas adsorption value of 121 cm3/g.\n\nSurprisingly, by the same solvothermal method except changing metal salts into Cd(NO3)2\u22c54H2O, coordination polymer 2 features a totally different 3D framework, which can be simplified into a 8-connected topology with the point symbol 424\u22c564 (Figures b and ). Two carboxylic groups of BODIPY-based ligands both adopt \u03bc2 -\u03b7 2 :\u03b7 1-chelate/bridge coordination fashions, which link Cd(II) ions to provide a tetranuclear SBU- [Cd4(CO2)8]. Each tetranuclear SBU is surrounded by eight L2- units and further furnish a complicated 3D MOF, while the bpp ligand just plays a role in connecting Cd(II) ions from two adjacent SBUs to add the linking numbers of the tetranuclear SBUs. Hence, a void volume of 22% in the total cell was indicated by the SQUEEZE routine in PLATON. In case 2, the experimental PXRD data also displayed that the crystal structure was totally representative of the bulk sample (). Moreover, TGA experiment showed that coordination polymer 2 lost two lattice water molecules and one EtOH molecule (obsd 6.05%, calcd 6.19%, ) when the temperature was raised from 30 to 254 \u00b0C. In addition, the resultant structure was stable up to 306 \u00b0C and finally decomposed to CdO.\n\nIn consideration of interpenetration in MOF 1, we tried to reduce the flexibility of pyridine ligand to construct 3D MOF probably containing larger porosity. Surprisingly, when the bpe linker was used instead of the bpp group, two 2D-layer coordination polymers 3 and 4 were obtained by the similar solvothermal method (Figure a,b). For coordination polymer 3, as shown in  and a, the bpe groups connect Cd(II) ions to form a 1D ladder-shape chain, and subsequently, linked by BODIPY-based dicarboxylic acids in chelated coordination modes, the chains are extended into a 2D wave-like layer. Complex 3 illustrated very high phase purity detected by the PXRD experiment (). In contrast, while the volume ratio of reaction solvent DMF/EtOH was turned into 1:1, the two carboxylic groups of ligand L2- adopt \u03bc1 -\u03b7 1 :\u03b7 1 and \u03bc1 -\u03b7 0 :\u03b7 1 coordination modes in complex 4 ( and b), respectively, which provide a 1D infinite chain by linking Cd(II) ions. Interestingly, bridged by the bpe groups, the 1D chains further form a graphene-like 2D layer. In each hexagonal circle unit of such 2D layer, six Cd(II) ions are like the \"C atoms\", which are linked by four BODIPY-based dicarboxylic acids and two bpe moieties. The experimental PXRD data also exhibited that the crystal structure of complex 4 was totally representative of the bulk sample (). As shown in , from 90 to 230 \u00b0C, complex 3 lost two lattice water molecules, one EtOH and one DMF (obsd 10.50%, calcd 10.58%) and became unstable beyond 260 \u00b0C. In comparison with that of case 3, the thermal stability of coordination polymer 4 was better, which lost one coordinated water molecule and one coordinated DMF molecule in the scale of 90-330 \u00b0C (obsd 12.60%, calcd 12.91%), and above 330 \u00b0C, complex 4 decomposed continuously until 800 \u00b0C.\n\nUltimately, under the same solvothermal reaction condition except for raising the reaction temperature to 100 \u00b0C, a 3D pillared-layer framework 5 was successfully synthesized, which was the isoreticular framework of complex 1 deliberated by the crystallographic analysis (Figure c). For instance, ligands L2- chelate Cd1 ion and symmertry-related Cd1A ion to form a [Cd2(CO2)4] binuclear SBU with Cd-Cd distance about 3.04 \u00c5, which further gives rise to a 2D layer (). Furthermore, the 2D networks are sustained by the bpe moieties along the c direction to generate a pillared-layer 3D framework. Structural topology analysis reveals that 412\u22c563 is the point symbol for this net. As a result of 2-fold interpenetration with real pore sizes of ~11.3 \u00d7 11.3 \u00c52, calculation by using PLATON suggests the guest accessible void comprises 40% of the total cell volume. Although complexes 1 and 5 are isoreticular, the distances of two adjacent binuclear SBUs bridged by pyridine ligands bpp or bpe in complexes 1 and 5 are 16.0286 and 16.675 \u00c5, respectively, which may be attributed to differences of the pillar molecules (bpp for complex 1 and bpe for complex 5) and metal nodes (Zn for complex 1 and Cd for complex 5). As shown in , because the data of the experimental PXRD spectrum is consistent with that of simulated one, the crystal structure of 5 completely expressed the bulk sample. For MOF 5, a weight loss of 14.33% in 20-245 \u00b0C range was consistent with the removal of one DMF and one and a half lattice water molecules (calcd 14.00%, ), and the dehydrated compound was stable to 308 \u00b0C. To consider the results of crystallographic analysis and TGA measurement, 1D channels with considerable void spaces are present in MOF 5. As shown in , sample 5 shows a type-I behavior in N2 adsorption isotherm at 77 K, which indicates a gas uptake of 60 cm3/g with the BET surface area of 138 m2/g.\n\nIn this work, the UV-vis absorption spectra of ligand H2L, bpe, bpp, and the coordination polymers 1-5 were recorded in the solid state at room temperature (Table , ). As depicted in Figure a, ligand H2L exhibits several intense absorption bands in the range of 210-570 nm. At the same time, careful inspection of the spectrum on the low-energy side reveals a small peak in the region of 600-800 nm. This could indicate a weak transition centered at around 651 nm (15360 cm-1) within the tail. The intense absorption band is at \u03bbmax = 562 nm (17795 cm-1), which is ascribed to the \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* transition of the monomer-like BODIPY group, while the weak band in lower energy range is possibly the transition of J-aggregates based on dipole-dipole interaction in the aggregate. Furthermore, the lowest energy absorption band of ligand bpp or bpe is at \u03bb < 285 nm (35090 cm-1, ), which is distinctly higher than that of ligand H2L in the energy level. As a result, the BODIPY group of ligand H2L will play a key role as the chromophore after being coordinated with the Zn(II)/Cd(II) metal ions.\n\nFurthermore, to prove the hypothesis for the evidence in absorption spectroscopic measurement, some information was observed in the luminescence studies of the ligand H2L and as-synthesized coordination polymers 1-5. The room temperature emission spectra of the ligand H2L and samples 1-5 in the solid state are shown in Figure b. Upon excitation at \u03bb > 590 nm, ligand H2L has no emission observed, although such S0 \u2192 S1 transition would result in a potential luminescence in the NIR, as the associated long radiative lifetime of the corresponding emission is easily quenched by the surrounding environment in solid state or suffered by the self-quenching due to the high concentration. Interestingly, upon excitation at 450 nm, it exhibited an emission at \u03bbmax = 577 nm (17330 cm-1) at room temperature with a small absolute quantum yield of 0.0073. Moreover, due to the small Stokes shift of 465 cm-1 (Table ), this fluorescence is derived from the 1\u03c0\u03c0* excited state of the monomer-like BODIPY group in nature.", "data": [[[{"meta":
