Structural measurements were performed on a computer-controlled Oxford Xcalibur E diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo/K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bbMo/K\u03b1 = 0.71073 \u00c5) at T = 293(2) K. Absorption corrections were made using the SADABS program. The structures were solved using the direct method and refined by full-matrix least-squares methods on F 2 by using the SHELX-97 program package. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anistropically, and hydrogen atoms attached to carbon atoms were geometrically placed and refined using a riding model. However, the oxygen-bounded hydrogen atoms were located from difference peaks and kept in that position with isotropic thermal parameters fixed at 1.5 times that of respective oxygen atoms. Crystal data, as well as details of data collection and refinements of 1-4 are summarized in Table , and selected bond lengths and angles are given in  Table S1-S4.", "data": null,

Both Ba2 and Ba3 adopt a slightly distorted bicap triagular prism. However, the coordination environments around them (Ba2 and Ba3) are different. Ba2 is coordinated by six carboxylate oxygen atoms (O1f, O1g, O3g, O8e, O2d, and o2d) from five different OBDC ligands, one nitrate oxygen atoms (O9) and one terminal aqua ligand (O1w). Ba3 is coordinated by seven carboxylate oxygen atoms (O2, O6, O7, O3b, O4c, O6d, and O8d) from five individual OBDC ligands and one nitrate oxygen atom (O9a).

Each {Ba3O8} polyhedron shares four edges and two corners with six neighboring {BaO8} polyhedrons. Then, these connectivities link the polyhedrons into a 2D inorganic Ba-O-Ba layer (Figure b), which is decorated by the OBDC ligands and nitrate anions on both sides. Notably, there are two different rings in this inorganic layer: 3- and 4-membered rings (Figure b). Two crystallographically independent OBDC ligands adopt different coordination modes: \u03bc5-(\u03b72-O',O\"),O,O',O,\"O\u2034 and \u03bc6-(\u03b72-O',O\"),O,O,O\",O\u2034,O\u2034.

The first one occurs in the temperature range of 70-130 \u00b0C corresponding to the release of three coordinated water molecules per formula unit. The observed weight loss (21.55%) is in agreement with the calculated one (20.91%).

And in order to understand these emission bands, we have also examined the luminescent properties of the free ligand (H2PBDC, H2OBDC, and H3BTC). The free ligands emit strong fluorescence centered at 447 nm (\u03bbex = 349 nm) for H2PBDC, 433 nm (\u03bbex = 329 nm) for H2OBDC, 448 nm (\u03bbex = 331 nm) for H3BTC, respectively. The luminescent behavior of free ligands can be probably assigned to \u03c0 or n to \u03c0* orbital transitions. For the compounds, the emission bands are 445 nm (\u03bbex = 348 nm) for 1, 448 nm (\u03bbex = 334 nm) for 2, 446 nm (\u03bbex = 314 nm) for 3, 442 nm (\u03bbex = 328 nm) for 4, respectively. It is noteworthy that the emission bands of the compounds are similar to that of corresponding free ligands. Therefore, these emission bands are neither ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) nor metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT), and can probably be attributed to the intraligand fluorescent emission. In addition, the emit light of 1 red-shifted by approximate 57 nm comparing with another PBDC-based Ca(II) compound, [Ca(BDC)(DMF)(H2O)] n  (5, H2BDC = terephthalic acid), which may be due to the binding degree of organic ligand to Ca ions.
