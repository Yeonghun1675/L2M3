The \u03c7M T value per Ni2 unit at 300 K is 2.41 cm3 K mol-1, which is close to the spin-only value (2.00 cm3 K mol-1). First, it exhibits a monotonic decrease in \u03c7M T until a minimum (1.19 cm3 K mol-1) at 10 K with decreasing temperature, which indicates a dominant AF interaction between the NiII ions, and then an increase upon further lowering of the temperature, a peak (4.32 cm3 K mol-1) at 5 K, and finally a rapid decrease to a value of 2.18 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K (Figure ), indicating an AF-like behavior or a system of spin canting followed by the effect of the D parameter (or saturation phenomena). Because the shortest Ni\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Ni distance across the bpt or fum bridge is 6.163(1) \u00c5 in 1, the magnetic exchange coupling through these bridges is expected to be very weak. The observed dominant AF interaction should mainly arise from the magnetic superexchange through the carboxylato and oxo bridges in the Ni2 dimeric subunit. To understand the high-temperature behavior, we used the known expression given by Kahn to fit the experimental data from 300 to 10 K. We have applied the mean-field approach to calculate the intermolecular interactions (z'J'). The best-fit parameters to reproduce satisfactorily the experimental data are g = 2.19, J = -4.13 cm-1, and zJ' = -0.51 cm-1. However, it should be noted that the results only imply weak AF exchanges between metal ions in 1, while an exact estimation of the magnetic interactions is unattainable because of the single-ion anisotropy (D parameter) in these NiII systems.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']"}}, {"idx": 14, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig3\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility of <bold>1</bold>.

We have applied the mean-field approach to calculate the intermolecular interactions (z'J'). The best-fit parameters to reproduce satisfactorily the experimental data are g = 2.19, J = -4.13 cm-1, and zJ' = -0.51 cm-1. However, it should be noted that the results only imply weak AF exchanges between metal ions in 1, while an exact estimation of the magnetic interactions is unattainable because of the single-ion anisotropy (D parameter) in these NiII systems.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "magnetic susceptibility": [{"value": "2.41", "unit": "cm3 K mol-1", "temperature": "300 K", "condition": "crushed single crystals"}, {"value": "1.19", "unit": "cm3 K mol-1", "temperature": "10 K", "condition": "crushed single crystals"}, {"value": "4.32", "unit": "cm3 K mol-1", "temperature": "5 K", "condition": "crushed single crystals"}, {"value": "2.18", "unit": "cm3 K mol-1", "temperature": "2 K", "condition": "crushed single crystals"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["magnetic_susceptibility", "etc"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['magnetic_susceptibility', 'etc']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[{\n\"meta\":{\"name\":\"\", \"symbol\":\"1\", \"chemical formula\":\"\"},\n\"magnetic susceptibility\": [\n    {\n        \"value\": \"2.41\",\n        \"unit\": \"cm3 K mol-1\",\n        \"temperature\": \"300 K\",\n        \"condition\": \"crushed single crystals\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"value\": \"1.19\",\n        \"unit\": \"cm3 K mol-1\",\n        \"temperature\": \"10 K\",\n        \"condition\": \"crushed single crystals\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"value\": \"4.32\",\n        \"unit\": \"cm3 K mol-1\",\n        \"temperature\": \"5 K\",\n        \"condition\": \"crushed single crystals\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"value\": \"2.18\",\n        \"unit\": \"cm3 K mol-1\",\n        \"temperature\": \"2 K\",\n        \"condition\": \"crushed single crystals\"\n    }\n]\n}]\n```"}}, {"idx": 8, "type": "table", "classification": ["Crystal"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Crystal Data and Structure Refinement for <bold>1</bold>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table>\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"2\">\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry valign=\"bottom\">empirical formula</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry valign=\"bottom\">C<sub>32</sub>H<sub>30</sub>N<sub>10</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>fw</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>864.04</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>cryst syst</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>monoclinic</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>space group</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>2<sub>1</sub>/<italic toggle=\"yes\">c</italic>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">a</italic> (\u00c5)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>8.280(2)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">b</italic> (\u00c5)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>28.059(6)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">c</italic> (\u00c5)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>16.424(3)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\u03b2 (deg)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>94.02(3)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>volume (\u00c5<sup>3</sup>)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>3806.4(13)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">Z</italic>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>4</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>calcd density (Mg/m<sup>3</sup>)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.497</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>cryst size (mm<sup>3</sup>)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.23 \u00d7 0.12 \u00d7 0.08</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>indep reflns</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>6651</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>GOF on <italic toggle=\"yes\">F</italic>\n<sup>2</sup>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.01 (<italic toggle=\"yes\">R</italic>\n<sub>int</sub> = 0.085)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>final <italic toggle=\"yes\">R</italic> indices [<italic toggle=\"yes\">I</italic> &gt; 2\u03c3(<italic toggle=\"yes\">I</italic>)]</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.079</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">R</italic> indices (all data)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.166</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "Table 1.
