In contrast, the decamolybdate subunit in 1 is capped by two six-coordinated {MoO5N} octahedra (Figure ). Thus, the decamolybdate subunit in 1 is a new type of decamolybdate polyanion. 1 can be also considered as an \u03b3-octamolybdate linked by [MoVI 2O6EDTA]4- anions.

Because of the similar anionic structures of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>, here only the photochromic properties of <bold>1</bold> were investigated. Photochromism of carboxylate-modified octamolybdate, being induced by intramolecular electron transfer, has been confirmed to display a color change upon UV exposure. However, under irradiation at 254 or 365 nm excitation for more than 2 h, no transparent color change can be observed for a solid sample of <bold>1</bold>, which indicates the high energy to trigger the photochromic reaction. This also relates to the fact that the carboxyl groups do not directly coordinate to the Mo atoms of the octamolybdate cluster but only chelate to the capped Mo atoms. Thus, we further explored the photochromism of <bold>1</bold> in a PVA film on a glass substrate. The hybrid <bold>1</bold>/PVA film is sensitive to irradiation at 254 nm; however, under irradiation at 365 nm, only a slight color change can be observed, suggesting a slow coloration process. The absorption band at 485 nm upon 254 nm irradiation becomes more intense upon irradiation duration (Figure ). Meanwhile, the photochromism of the <bold>1</bold>/PVA film can also be confirmed by the color change from pale-yellow to reddish-brown after irradiation for more than 5 min. The photoinduced color does not evolve after approximately 35 min. When irradiation was taken off, the colored film began to fade gradually in the darkness for about 1 week. A moderate heating at 50 \u00b0C can accelerate a return to the pale-yellow state. Up to now, the reported POM-based photochromic films only show blue coloration due to their combination of classical Keggin- or Dawson-type polyanions. Therefore, the solid <bold>1</bold>/PVA film first shows a pale-yellow to reddish-brown photochromism among the POM-based hybrid films. This phenomenon suggests that the multicolor photochromic films are possibly realized by the mixture of different POM components. The reddish-brown coloration has been observed in other polymolybdates as solid samples. The photochromism of these powder materials is commonly explained by Yamase\u2019s model. Thus, we speculate that the chromic mechanism of the <bold>1</bold>/PVA film is induced similarly. Under the 254 nm UV irradiation, an electron belonging to a terminal O atom of the octamolybdate cluster is transferred into the Mo<sup>6+</sup> 4d block and trapped by a metastable Mo<sup>V</sup> ion. Then, a bridging O atom at the photoreducible site gains a proton from the hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl group belonging to the PVA molecule. Simultaneously, the photogenerated hole left at the O atom interacts with the nonbonding hydroxyl O atom, forming a charge-transfer complex. Scheme  shows the above possible mechanism of one MoO<sub>6</sub> site in the hybrid film. A further systematic investigation of the photochromic properties for these two compounds is in progress.</p>", "clean_text": "Not only from a structural viewpoint, organopolymolybdates are also photochromic materials.
