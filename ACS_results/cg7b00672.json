(v) Control of heating time is required, as the formation of small organic cations from formamide solvent decomposition can influence product composition, as in the isolation of 1 and 2. (vi) Even with deliberate grafting of metal binding units onto POMs, the coordination of metal centers to terminal oxo units is still possible, with the common square structural motif seen in 2, 3, and 4 a potential driving force for formation of materials linked by Zn2+. As the pyridine donors are softer bases than the terminal oxo groups, the use of softer metal ions may offer more structural control, for example, the square grid linked by Cu2+ and the very recent example of three-dimensional frameworks of POM-2 linked by Cu+. It is clear that hybrid POMs can assemble into a diverse range of complex coordination polymer structures, and we expect these synthetic guidelines will assist in future efforts to control the self-assembly of hybrid polyoxometalates into extended porous networks and enhance the reproducibility of their syntheses.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 36, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information\nis available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.cgd.7b00672\">10.1021/acs.cgd.7b00672</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Crystallographic\ndata, elemental analysis, IR spectra,\nand thermogravimetric analysis data (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.cgd.7b00672/suppl_file/cg7b00672_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.cgd.7b00672.

The solution was cooled to room temperature, and the orange solid was filtered off. The orange solid was mixed with an off-white powder, likely [Mo6O19]2-, that was removed by successive addition of acetonitrile, to create a suspension of the white solid that was then pipetted out. When no more pale powder was detected, the orange solid was filtered and redissolved in 80 mL of dimethylformamide. The pure product crystallizes as orange blocks by vapor diffusion of diethyl ether (2.60 g, 75.4% based on Mo). 1H NMR in d 6-DMSO \u03b4/ppm: 63.7 (s, 12H), 7.9 (s, 4H), 6.8 (s, 4H), 2.9 (s, 24H), 1.34 (s, 24H), 1.07 (s, 24H), 0.7 (s, 36H).
