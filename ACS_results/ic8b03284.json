The excitation spectrum of Eu-MOF exhibits a broad band with a maximum at 310 nm (Figure S4). Under excitation at 287 nm, Eu-MOF displays four well-resolved emission peaks at 594, 614, 651, and 699 nm, which are attributed to 5D0 \u2192 7F J  (J = 1-4) transitions of the Eu3+ ion, respectively. The peak at 574 nm is a double-frequency scattering peak, whose wavelength is 2 times the excitation wavelength (287 nm). Such a phenomenon is very common in fluorescence spectra. The strongest 5D0 \u2192 7F2 transition with a bright-red luminescence is attributed to magnetic-dipole-induced transitions. This indicates the occurrence of efficient energy transfer from the sensitizer (H3BTB) to doped Eu3+. In addition, it is worth noting that the broad emission of the ligand cannot be observed in the emission spectrum of Eu-MOF, which indicates the occurrence of \"antenna effects\". The excitation spectrum collected at the wavelength of 614 nm displays a broad band at 250-320 nm. We also studied the luminescence decay curves of a pure ligand and Eu-MOF.
