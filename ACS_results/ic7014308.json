Compound 1 possesses a complicated 3D structure, in which the bivanadium-capped Keggin {AsMo12V2} as a hexadentate inorganic ligand is modified in an unusually asymmetrical coordination mode, whereas compound 2 exhibits a rail-like 1D structure, in which {AsMo12V2}\u2018 as a bidentate inorganic ligand is modified in a symmetrical coordination mode. In the electronic structure point of view, the bivanadium-capped Keggin polyoxoanions are prone to an asymmetrical distribution of negative charge on the POM globe, offering an opportunity to modify the POM in an asymmetrical coordination mode. In the steric hindrance point of view, {AsMo12V2} clusters array in an up-and-down mode along the Cu-bipy chains to avoid unfavorable interactions in compound 1. Whereas the {AsMo12V2}\u2018 clusters adopt a side-by-side arrangement in compound 2, which hinders the further modification of the POMs. The informative structures of the two compounds further indicate that the high-dimensional assembly of POM-TM cation coordination polymers depends on a synergic effect of polyoxoanion templates, metal ion coordination geometries, and the spacer lengths of the rigid organic ligands.
