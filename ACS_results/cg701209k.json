Finally, the residual product weight of 16.02% was found in the temperature range 554-800 \u00b0C, corresponding to the formation of CuO (calcd. 16.1%). Complex 1 emits at \u03bbmax = 394 nm, upon excitation at 247 nm, which is the same as that of the free L. Since there is no significant energy shift observed upon coordinating L ligands to the Cu atoms, the emission bands in 1 may be tentatively assigned as intraligand (IL) \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* transitions.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "Complex 1", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "[CuSO4(L)(H2O)2]\u221e"}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "40", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "stable", "condition": ""}, {"value": "40-80", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "removal of water molecules", "condition": "per formula unit"}, {"value": "81-554", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "removal of L ligands and SO3", "condition": "per formula unit"}, {"value": "554-800", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "formation of CuO", "condition": "residual product weight"}], "peak spectrum": [{"value": "394", "unit": "nm", "type": "emission", "condition": "upon excitation at 247 nm"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["decomposition_temperature", "peak_spectrum"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['decomposition_temperature', 'peak_spectrum']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"Complex 1\",\n            \"symbol\": \"1\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"[CuSO4(L)(H2O)2]\u221e\"\n        },\n        \"decomposition temperature\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"40\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"stable\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"40-80\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"removal of water molecules\",\n                \"condition\": \"per formula unit\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"81-554\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"removal of L ligands and SO3\",\n                \"condition\": \"per formula unit\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"554-800\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"formation of CuO\",\n                \"condition\": \"residual product weight\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"peak spectrum\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"394\",\n                \"unit\": \"nm\",\n                \"type\": \"emission\",\n                \"condition\": \"upon excitation at 247 nm\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 7, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) A molecular structure showing the environments of the two copper centers.
