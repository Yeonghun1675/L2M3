The Eu complex reveals the geometry of elongated dodecahedron, while the Co complex is an almost ideal octahedron (Tables S1 and S2). The coordination chains of 1 are aligned in parallel along [101] axis (bc), and their position in the supramolecular network is stabilized by hydrogen bonds involving cyanides, 3-OHpy, and both coordinated and crystallization water molecules (Figure S4 and Table S3). The powder X-ray diffraction experiment confirmed that the structural model obtained from the single crystal is valid for the bulk polycrystalline sample (Figure S5). In addition, the IR spectrum collected in the broad 750-4000 cm-1 range for the single crystal of 1 overlaps well with the IR spectrum measured for the respective powder sample (Figure S6). This, together with the PXRD studies, confirms the purity of the polycrystalline sample of 1, used in all physical measurements.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step":

With an increasing amount of Eu on going from 7 to 2, we observed the gradual disappearance of the slower relaxation process, which is only residual in the case of 2, where Tb3+ occupies only 20% of positions available for lanthanide(III) complexes (). This material can be considered as a magnetically diluted sample of 8, as the Tb-Tb distances are expected to be much longer. As a result, 2 reveals a nearly single field-induced relaxation process, while the second relaxation appears only as a weak tail existing in the \u03c7M\"(\u03bd) plots at lower frequencies. The limited ac magnetic data for an optimal dc field of 1500 Oe were analyzed using the Debye model for a single relaxation (a-c and S20 and Table S7). The obtained \u03b1-parameters of 0.16-0.26 indicated a much narrower distribution of relaxation times than in 8. The relaxation times obey the Arrhenius law above 3.5 K, giving the energy barrier, \u0394E/k B of 35.8(6) K with \u03c40 = 1.1(2) \u00d7 10-8 s, clearly proving the field-induced SMM character of TbIII complexes embedded in the cyanido-bridged chains of 1-8. As 2 still revealed the residual ac magnetic signal originating from the second relaxation process, we prepared the additional, more magnetically diluted analog of 1-8, with Tb3+ occupying only 5% of all the positions available for trivalent lanthanide ions (see Supporting Information for details). This sample, Eu  095  Tb  0.05  Co, was characterized by CHN and metals elemental analyses, which, together with the PXRD pattern, indicated the perfect isostructurality with 1-8 and the composition of {[EuIII 0.95TbIII 0.05(3-OHpy)2(H2O)4][CoIII(CN)6]\u22c5H2O} n  (Figure S21).

All the compounds, 1-8, reveal very similar thermal stability with a stable composition up to heating to ca. 85-90 \u00b0C. On further increase of temperature, the weights of the samples gradually decrease. This process is independent of the Eu/Tb ratio and occurs in a few subsequent steps of three temperature ranges: 90-110 \u00b0C (ca. 6.2% of weight loss), 110-130 \u00b0C (ca. 3.1-3.2% of weight loss), and 130-180 \u00b0C (ca. 4.5% of weight loss). They all together give a mass loss of ca. 13.8-13.9%, which relates well to the removal of five water molecules corresponding to each lanthanide(III)-cobalt(III) pair. Thus, the multistep change in the 90-180 \u00b0C region can be assigned to the dehydration of the sample that is the phase transition from the initial {[Tb/Eu(3-OHpy)2(H2O)4][Co(CN)6]\u22c5H2O} n  composition to the dehydrated phase with the presumable formula of {[Tb/Eu(3-OHpy)2][Co(CN)6]} n .

The further heating above 180 \u00b0C results in a large decrease of the mass connected with the typical loss of cyanides and expected decomposition of 3-OHpy ligands. \n\nMagnetic Properties\n\nThe direct-current (dc) magnetic properties of 1-8 are presented in . The room-temperature \u03c7M T value of EuIII-containing 1 is 1.5 cm3 mol-1 K, which perfectly suits to 1.5 cm3 mol-1 K predicted for the EuIII center separated by diamagnetic [CoIII(CN)6]3- moieties. In fact, the europium(3+) ion reveals the diamagnetic 7F0 ground state, but its 7F1 and 7F2 paramagnetic excited states are located close in energy and can be thermally populated giving a nonzero contribution to the \u03c7M T. However, the population of the excited states is gradually decreasing on cooling, thus at 1.8 K, only the diamagnetic 7F0 ground state is occupied. This is well documented in the continuous decrease of the \u03c7M T on cooling to the low value of 0.02 cm3 mol-1 K at 1.8 K (a) and by the very slow increase of molar magnetization up to only 0.05 \u03bcB at H = 50 kOe (b). Assuming the occurrence of thermal depopulation of 7FJ excited states of Eu3+ in 1 that originates from the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) splitting, we simulated the \u03c7M T-T plot with the SOC constant (\u03bb) as a fitting parameter ( and S17, see also Supporting Information for details). Satisfactory agreement with the experiment was obtained for \u03bb = 304(4) cm-1, the slightly lower value as compared with EuIII complexes embedded in other cyanido-bridged bimetallic systems. Thus, at very low temperature, 1 behaves almost as a diamagnet with only residual magnetic signal. This precludes any possibility to observe long-range magnetic ordering or slow magnetic relaxation on EuIII complexes in 1.\n\nOn the contrary, TbIII-containing compound 8 exhibits the high \u03c7M T value of 11.5 cm3 mol-1 K at room temperature. This value is only slightly lower than 11.8 cm3 mol-1 K calculated for uncoupled TbIII of the 7F6 ground state (J = 6, g J = 3/2) separated by diamagnetic [CoIII(CN)6]3-. Upon cooling, the \u03c7M T gradually decreases, first very slowly in the 300-100 K range and later faster, reaching 9.2 cm3 mol-1 K at 1.8 K (a). Such decrease of the magnetic signal can be ascribed mainly to the depopulation of the mJ levels arising from the splitting of the 7F6 ground state of TbIII, while the contribution of weak antiferromagnetic Tb-Tb interactions through diamagnetic [CoIII(CN)6]3-, or through the interchain space, plays a minor role. This is supported by the magnetization versus field curve at T = 1.8 K showing the featureless increase of M reaching 4.9 \u03bcB at 50 kOe (b), which is close the value of 5.0 \u03bcB expected for typical isolated TbIII magnetic moment described by an effective spin of S eff = 1/2 with the strong uniaxial Ising-type anisotropy of the g-tensor (g \u2225 = 10, g \u22a5 = 0).
