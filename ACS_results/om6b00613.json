After the solution was stirred for an additional 1 h, 2-fluoropyridine (0.58 g, 6 mmol) was added dropwise via syringe. The dry ice bath was subsequently removed, and the reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight. A 30 mL portion of water was added to quench the reaction. The organic and aqueous layers of the resulting yellow solution were separated, the aqueous layer was extracted with Et2O (3 \u00d7 30 mL), and the combined organic phases were dried over MgSO4. After filtration, the solvents were removed under reduced pressure, and the residual oil was purified by flash chromatography (silica, hexanes/EtOAc/TEA (1/1/0.01)) to yield 0.70 g of the product (57% yield based on 2-fluoropyridine used). 1H NMR (400 MHz, 22 \u00b0C, CDCl3): \u03b4 4.66 (s, 2H), 7.17 (ddd, 3 J HH = 7.6, 4.8 Hz, 4 J HH = 1.6 Hz, 1H), 7.44 (d, 3 J HH = 8.0 Hz, 1H), 7.52 (d, 3 J HH = 8.0 Hz, 1H), 7.62-7.76 (m, 4H), 7.79 (d, 3 J HH = 8.8 Hz, 1H), 7.91 (dd, 3 J HH = 7.2 Hz, 4 J HH = 2.0 Hz, 1H), 8.60 (ddd, 3 J HH = 4.8, 2.0 Hz, 4 J HH = 0.8 Hz, 1H), 9.36 (dd, 3 J HH = 8.0 Hz, 4 J HH = 0.6 Hz, 1H). 13C NMR (125 MHz, 22 \u00b0C, DMSO-d 6): \u03b4 47.1, 118.3, 122.0, 122.6, 124.0, 127.0, 129.1, 129.4, 137.0, 138.1, 139.1, 149.5, 155.9, 159.6, 159.8.

The solution was cooled to -78 \u00b0C, and 2.5 M n-BuLi (1.1 mL, 2.8 mmol) was added dropwise over 10 min with stirring. The resulting dark red solution was stirred for an additional 1/2 h before being removed from the cold bath and brought into an argon atmosphere glovebox. NMe3\u22c5SO3 complex (0.39 g, 2.8 mmol) was added. The Schlenk flask was then closed with a Teflon seal, and the mixture was heated in an oil bath for 24 h at 120 \u00b0C with rapid stirring. The next day a large amount of precipitate had formed. The mixture was then cooled to 5 \u00b0C, and the reaction was quenched with 10 mL of deionized water. The product was extracted in water and washed with diethyl ether (3 \u00d7 10 mL). The water layer was concentrated, and the residue was dried under vacuum. The crude product was dissolved in dry trifluoroethanol and filtered through a paper filter to remove inorganic impurities. The filtrate was concentrated and dried. The resulting residue was purified by flash chromatography (silica, EtOAc/CH2Cl2/MeOH/Et3N (2/2/1/0.01)). The eluent was treated with K2CO3 to convert any triethylammonium salts to TEA and then filtered and dried to yield 0.56 g of the product (61% yield).

The product was obtained as a 1:1 mixture of 9 and LiCl by removing trifluoroethanol (163 mg, 91%), appearing as a yellow solid. This mixture could be used in the preparation of 7.
