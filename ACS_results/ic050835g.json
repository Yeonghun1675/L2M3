To examine the porosity and reactivity we have studied the adsorption property of the dehydrated frameworks of 1 and 2 with different gases (N2, CO2, etc.) as well as different solvent molecules (H2O, CH3OH, Me2CO, etc). The sorption isotherm of N2 (surface area = 16.3 \u00c52) at 77 K of 1 shows a type-II profile (Figure a), which indicates that N2 molecules cannot diffuse into the micropore and only surface adsorption occurs. From this sorption profile, surface areas have been determined using the BET equation, which shows 43.13 m2/g. On the other hand, H2O (10.5 \u00c52) and MeOH (18.0 \u00c52) adsorption measurement shows linear increases in the pressure range (P/P 0 = 0-1 atm) without saturation and the desorption curve does not trace an adsorption one, showing large hysteresis (Figure c,d). This indicates that chemisorption occurs, i.e., H2O and MeOH molecules may directly coordinated to the unsaturated Cu(II) centers. It is worth mentioning that after the H2O and MeOH sorption the color drastically changes from purple to green, which also confirms the reaction of the H2O and MeOH molecules with Cu(II) centers resulting in chemisorption. Conversely, the Me2CO sorption profile suggests only surface adsorption and also no color change was observed after exposing Me2CO vapor. This may be due to the coordination ability of the acetone molecule being less compared to H2O and MeOH and also the size of the Me2CO molecules is large compared to the former two (Figure S7). The structure determination of 1 reveals that the effective pore size has been drastically reduced due to the packing of the 2D layers in a staggered manner, which prevents the diffusion of the adsorbate into the framework.  \n\n Magnetic Properties and Magneto - Structural Correlations. The temperature dependences (300-2 K) of \u03c7M  and \u03c7M T (\u03c7M being the magnetic susceptibility for one Cu(II) ion) for 1 and 2 are shown in Figure . The \u03c7M values of 1 and 2 at 300 K are 0.00142 cm3 mol-1 (\u03c7M T = 0.427 cm3 mol-1 K) and 0.00137 cm3 mol-1 (\u03c7M T = 0.411 cm3 mol-1 K), respectively, and the values are close to the expected value for a magnetically \"isolated\" Cu(II) ion (with g = 2.1). In both cases, \u03c7M T is almost invariable down to 100 K and gradually decreases with cooling to 2 K and there is no maxima in the \u03c7M vs T curve [Figure  (inset)]; the shapes of the \u03c7M T vs T curves are characteristic of the occurrence of weak antiferromagnetic interactions between the Cu(II) centers.
