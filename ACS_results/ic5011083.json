A linear SV relationship\nfor nitrobenzene is observed at low concentrations, but the plots\nsubsequently deviate from linearity at higher concentrations ( Figure S13).

Therefore, such solvent-dependent quenching behavior is appropriate for the detection of nitrobenzene. To examine the sensitivity of sensing nitrobenzene in more detail, a batch of suspensions of IFMC-36-Eu was dispersed in DMA solution, while the nitrobenzene content was gradually increased to monitor the emissive response (Figure a). The luminescence intensity of the IFMC-36-Eu suspension significantly decreases into 55.7% at a nitrobenzene concentration of only 50 ppm, and almost completely quenches at 120 ppm (Figure b). IFMC-36-Eu displays a higher sensitivity than those of other MOFs in sensing nitrobenzene. That is probably largely because of the combined action of Cd(II) and Ln(III) ions. Besides the high selectivity of IFMC-36-Eu toward nitrobenzene, the organic solvent on the anti-interference ability of the sensor is vitally important. We have tested the PL spectra of IFMC-36-Eu dispersed in DMA with the addition of different 4000 ppm organic solvents ( Figure S9) and subsequent addition of 120 ppm nitrobenzene ( Figure S10). The interferences of other organics on the fluorescence response of IFMC-36-Eu to nitrobenzene were nearly unperturbed even when there is a great deal of other organics (4000 ppm) in the system with nitrobenzene (120 ppm, Figure ). The fluorescence intensity ratio at the 5D0 \u2192 7F2 transition was calculated by the formula (I/I 0), in which I is the fluorescence intensity of IFMC-36-Eu after adding other organics and I 0 is the fluorescence intensity of IFMC-36-Eu dispersed in DMA. Apparently, the fluorescence intensities of the suspension were remarkably decreased with the subsequent addition of 120 ppm nitrobenzene into the parallel tests. Additionally, we also found that IFMC-36-Eu can be regenerated and reused for a significant number of cycles by centrifugation of the solution after use and washing several times with DMA. The quenching efficiencies of every cycle are basically unchanged at about 55% (Figure ) through monitoring the emission spectra of IFMC-36-Eu dispersed in the presence of 50 ppm nitrobenzene in DMA from cycle 1 to 8 ( Figure S11). The quenching efficiency (%) was estimated using the formula (I 0  - I)/I 0 \u00d7 100%, where I 0 and I are the 5D0 \u2192 7F2 transition intensities of IFMC-36-Eu before and after exposure to 50 ppm nitrobenzene in DMA, respectively. The PXRD pattern further confirms that the framework is retained after cycle 8 ( Figure S12). These results reveal that IFMC-36-Eu shows outstanding anti-interference ability and could be applied as a fluorescence sensor for nitrobenzene with high sensitivity, selectivity, and recyclability in the systems with complicated components. As a result, IFMC-36-Eu can act as an excellent candidate for its sensitivity and recyclability in the field of detection application. The differences in quenching efficiency can be quantitatively treated with the Stern-Volmer (SV) equation: (I 0/I) = K sv[A] + 1, in which I 0 is the initial fluorescence intensity without analyte, I represents the fluorescence intensity with added analyte of the molar concentration [A], and K sv is the quenching constant (M-1). A linear SV relationship for nitrobenzene is observed at low concentrations, but the plots subsequently deviate from linearity at higher concentrations ( Figure S13). The nonlinear nature of the plot of the analytes may be ascribed to self-absorption or an energy-transfer process. Therefore, the static and dynamic quenching may be coexisting and competitive in the fluorescence quenching process, which results in a nonlinear SV relationship. Fluorescence decays of IFMC-36-Eu at different concentrations of nitrobenzene also verify this ( Figure S14). The excellent fluorescence quenching response to nitrobenzene can be attributed to the photoinduced electron-transfer mechanism. The finely ground powder of IFMC-36-Eu can be dispersed well in the solution, which would enable nitrobenzene to be closely adhered to the surface of the MOF particles and facilitate possible host-guest interactions.
