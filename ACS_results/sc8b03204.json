The following spectroscopic data were collected on the heated sample: mp 286-296 \u00b0C; FTIR (ATR) cm-1 1627 (\u03bdCH=N); 1H NMR (270 MHz, DMSO-d 6) \u03b4 8.80 (s, 1H), 8.31 (s, 1H), 8.07 (s, 4H), 7.80 (s, 1H), 7.74 (d, 2H, J = 8.65 Hz), 7.48 (d, 2H, J = 8.65 Hz), 7.12 (s, 1H). 13C NMR (67.5 MHz, DMSO-d 6) \u03b4 114.1, 121.1, 122.6, 128.8, 129.5, 130.0, 133.2, 135.6, 135.8, 139.5, 149.3, 160.3, 166.9. Five strongest peaks in the PXRD pattern calculated for the single-crystal structure of 8 are present at 2\u03b8 angle of 12.94\u00b0, 15.09\u00b0, 17.33\u00b0, 23.83\u00b0 and 25.52\u00b0. This is in agreement with position of five strongest peaks present in experimental PXRD patterns of SDG, as well as the ball milled sample: 12.88\u00b0, 15.09\u00b0, 17.43\u00b0, 23.87\u00b0 and 25.57\u00b0, Figure S30.\n\nSynthesis of Compound sql-5-Ni-4i (C52H40N14NiO6)\n\nA mixture of Ni(NO3)2\u22c56H2O (0.01 g, 0.05 mmol) and N,N'-(1,4-phenylenebis(methan-1-yl-1-ylidene))bis(4-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)aniline (5) (0.04 g, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in 4 mL of DMF/MeOH (3:1 v/v). The vial was sealed and heated at 120 \u00b0C for 2 days. The reaction system was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 \u00b0C per hour. Yellow uneven single crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction were obtained; yield 67%.", "data": [["('Output does not finished before token limits', '```JSON\\n[{\"meta\":{\"name\":\"Bis(pyridin-4-ylmethylene)benzene-1,4-diamine\", \"symbol\":\"1\", \"chemical formula\":\"\"}, \"processes\":[{\"synthesis method\": \"ball milling\", \"material\":\"p-Phenylenediamine and 4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde\",')"]], "include_properties": ["ball_milling", "chemical_synthesis"], "intermediate_step": {"text-synthesis-type": "['chemical_synthesis']", "text-synthesis-struct": "```JSON\n[{\"meta\":{\"name\":\"Bis(pyridin-4-ylmethylene)benzene-1,4-diamine\", \"symbol\":\"1\", \"chemical formula\":\"\"}, \"processes\":[{\"synthesis method\": \"ball milling\", \"material\":\"p-Phenylenediamine and 4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde\","}}, {"idx": 18, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Schiff Bases 1\u20138 (green) Prepared\nfrom Three Aldehyde (orange)\nand Five Amine (gray) Precursors</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr5\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"sc-2018-032042_0005.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Schiff Bases 1-8 (green) Prepared from Three Aldehyde (orange) and Five Amine (gray) Precursors   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 21, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Molecular structures\nof compounds <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>8</bold> in their crystal\nstructures.
