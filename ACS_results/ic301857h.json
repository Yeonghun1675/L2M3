On the other hand, the sorption isotherms of benzene and cyclohexane\nvapors by <bold>1a</bold> at room temperature show typical type I\nshape with saturated sorption amounts of 178 and 86 mg/g, respectively\n(Figure S14 in the ), which are lower\nthan the sorption amounts of <bold>1</bold> in corresponding solvents\n(261 and 199 mg/g).</p>", "clean_text": "The exact solvent content of 1' is difficult to estimate because of the departure of DMF at fairly low temperature. We tried another way to estimate the water content by measuring the water absorption isotherms of desolvated 1 followed by TGA on the same batch of crystals. The desolvated phase of 1 was placed on an electronic analytical balance having a precision of 10-6 g and allowed to adsorb water in air under a humidity of 60% at 27 \u00b0C (Figure S4 in the ). The adsorption takes place rapidly in the first 20 min to a plateau corresponding to 1\u22c53H2O and then slowly approaches saturation with an amount of 171 mg of H2O adsorbed per 1 g of compound. The adsorption at saturation is equivalent to 4.5 molecules of water per formula unit, that is, 1\u22c54.5H2O. This is in good agreement with the measurement of TGA (Figure S5 in the ).\n\nTo examine the thermal stability of the porous 4-fold-interpenetrated diamond network, TGA and PXRD measurements were carried out as a function of the temperature. The TGA curve (Figure S7 in the ) of 1\u22c52DMF shows that the solvent DMF molecules can be removed at 220 \u00b0C to give the empty microporous 1. The PXRD patterns of 1\u22c52DMF were recorded in the range of 25-500 \u00b0C under a N2 atmosphere (Figure S8 in the ). It is clear that the diffraction profiles below 320 \u00b0C are almost the same, indicating that the microporous framework is stable up to this temperature and the crystal retains the framework structure after removal of the guest DMF molecules. It can be concluded that 1 has excellent thermal stability in the class of MOFs under a dry environment. \n\nThe CO2 gas sorption isotherms for 1 at 195 K show a typical type I behavior characterized by a plateau reaching a saturated adsorptive capacity of 133 cm3/g at low relative pressure (Figure ). This early uptake indicates the presence of permanent microporosity in 1, and a Langmuir surface area of 770 m2/g was obtained by fitting the sorption curve (Figure S10 in the ). This value is uncompetitive with those reported for high-surface-area 3D PCPs, but it is comparable to those reported for MOFs with 1D channels and outstanding among the high-fold interpenetration MOFs. However, being different from CO2 gas sorption isotherms, the desolvated sample has nearly no N2 sorption at all, similar to some MOFks with large pores but exhibiting no sorption of nitrogen at 77 K (Figure S11 in the ). \n\nIn contrast, although 1a also shows a type I CO2 sorption curve at 195 K (Figure ), the saturated adsorptive capacity is lowered to 44 cm3/g, which corresponds to a Langmuir surface area of just 261 m2/g (Figure S12 in the ). Understandably, 1a has no N2 sorption as well. Obviously, both 1 and 1a exhibit selective sorption of CO2 over N2 because nearly no sorption of N2 was observed. More importantly, this undoubtedly confirms that the tight skeleton is rather stable even after the removal of guest molecules which differ from easily collapsed first-generation MOFs. However, the perturbation of water molecules induced the release of potential tension and shrinking channels, while the network connectivity is maintained. \n\nThere have been some reports of gate-opening phenomenon in flexible MOFs. Can high pressure help the recovery of the shrinking channels of 1a? So, the high-pressure H2 and CH4 gas sorption behaviors of 1 and 1a were studied. The H2 (at 77 K) and CH4 (at 298 K) uptake of 1 increased along with an increase of the pressure with a saturated uptake of about 212 cm3/g for H2 at 20 bar and about 95 cm3/g for CH4 at 35 bar (Figure ). It should be noted that the H2 uptake of 145 cm3/g at 1.0 bar for 1 is high compared to those for other MOFs with 1D channels (Table S6 in the ), which suggests strong hydrogen-framework interactions. The H2 uptake of 1a at 77 K also increased with pressure to 60 cm3/g (about 30% of that of 1) but remains unsaturated. However, there is no adsorption for 1a to CH4. So, the limited hydrogen sorption and no sorption of methane by 1a is clear evidence that the pores are poisoned by water.\n\nFurthermore, we measure the vapor sorption behavior of 1 and 1a using methanol, benzene, and cyclohexane as candidates. As shown in Figure , the sorption of 1 for methanol shows rapid increases in the low-pressure range (P/P 0 < 0.2) and then slowly approaches saturation with the amount adsorbed of 234 mg/g at P/P 0 = 0.88. The desorption curve does not retrace the adsorption isotherm, showing partly hysteresis and incomplete desorption, while the sorption of 1a for methanol shows a gradual increase with increasing P/P 0 and the amount adsorbed is 222 mg/g at P/P 0 = 0.88, which is just a little less than that of 1. However, the desorption curve of 1a is very similar to 1. On the other hand, the sorption isotherms of benzene and cyclohexane vapors by 1a at room temperature show typical type I shape with saturated sorption amounts of 178 and 86 mg/g, respectively (Figure S14 in the ), which are lower than the sorption amounts of 1 in corresponding solvents (261 and 199 mg/g).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "1", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "1"}, "gas
