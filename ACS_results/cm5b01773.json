SCXRD analysis ( Tables S1-S3) reveals that 1 crystallizes in a monoclinic system with C2/c space group. Each Cu(I) center in 1 is coordinated by N atoms of two ligands (L) and two iodide ions resulting a distorted tetrahedral geometry ( Figure S9). The measured Cu-N distance is 2.020(7) \u00c5, and Cu-I distances are 2.664(1) and 2.669(1) \u00c5, respectively. The bond angles around the Cu(I) center lies in the range of 100.70(5)-121.75(5)\u00b0. The distortion from the regular tetrahedral geometry can be described by an angular index (\u03c44), which was defined by Houser and co-workers as follows: \u03c44 = [360 - (a + b)]/141 (a and b are the two largest angles around a four-coordinate metal center). Since, in 1, the calculated \u03c44 = 0.87, the coordination geometry around the Cu(I) center can be best described as trigonal pyramidal. Besides, it exhibits a rhomboidal Cu2I2 core, which can be termed as a secondary building unit (SBU; a). The repetition of the [(CuI)2(L)2] units give rise to an extended 2D 44 (brick-like) net ( Figure S10). In the Cu2I2 core, the Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu distance is 2.596(2) \u00c5 and Cu-I-Cu and I-Cu-I bond angles are 58.24(4)\u00b0 and 121.75(5)\u00b0, respectively. Interestingly, four rhomboidal Cu2I2 units are connected through four ligands to form a [4 + 4] metallamacrocylic unit ( Figure S11), and the distances between the centroid of the Cu2I2 units connected by ligand L are in the range of 13.332-13.479 \u00c5. Further, the 2D 44 nets are interdigitated (c) with each other to form a supramolecular 3D MOF (d). The interdigitated layers are stabilized by \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions among the pyridyl rings of L and CH\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interaction between methoxy group and pyridyl ring of L (). Complex 1 also exhibits rectangular voids of dimension 7.67 \u00c5 \u00d7 9.18 \u00c5 down the c-axis ( Figure S12). Detailed study of one rectangular void reveals the presence of a 1D channel ( Figure S13) containing lattice DMF and MeCN molecules which are stabilized by weak C16-H16\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O3(2.511(1) \u00c5; H16\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O3) and nonclassical C27-H27c\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5I1-Cu1 (3.038(1) \u00c5; H27c\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5I1) H-bonding interactions (). The pyridyl and anisole rings of ligands are slipped at a distance of 4.782 \u00c5 over each other, and the anisole rings are slightly tilted to facilitate the interdigitation. Topological investigation of 1 reveals it is sql/Shubnikov tetragonal plane net topology with Schlafli symbol of {44.62} ( Figure S14). TGA ( Figure S7) shows a weight loss of ~10.6% (calcd, ~11.1%) in the temperature range of 150-180 \u00b0C due to loss of two lattice DMF and one MeCN molecule and reveals its stability up to 380 \u00b0C. The bulk phase PXRD patterns of 1 ( Figure S8) is in good agreement with the simulated one based on the SCXRD data, which indicates the phase purity of the as-synthesized product. Further, in order to ensure the stability of the desolvated framework, 1 was treated at 150 \u00b0C under vacuum for 24 h and the sample 1' shows loss of the lattice DMF and MeCN molecules in TGA (). PXRD analysis demonstrates that it retains its framework stability ( Figures S1 and S2) after loss of the lattice solvent molecules. The calculated free volume in 1' is 26.7% (total potential solvent area volume 1333.7 \u00c53 per unit cell volume 5001.9 \u00c53), obtained by PLATON analysis. The porosity was also confirmed by N2, CO2, and CH4 sorption analysis at 77, 195, 273, and 298 K ( Figures S15 and S16). It was observed that on exposure to open atmosphere complex 1 shows rapid color change from orange (b) to brown (1a) (a) in few minutes but retains its crystallinity. TGA of 1a indicates a weight loss of 11.6% (calcd, 11.9%) in the temperature range of 150-200 \u00b0C that corresponds to the loss of two DMF and one H2O molecule ( Figure S1). The overall framework structure of 1a is similar to that of 1 except replacement of one MeCN with H2O molecule ([Cu(L)(I)]2n \u22c52nDMF\u22c5nH2O; 1a) (). In addition, it has been found that the anisole ring of ligand L was tilted at an angle of 21.59\u00b0 with respect to its central pyridine ring, and the angle is slightly less (0.53\u00b0) compared to that of complex 1. The encapsulated H2O in 1a is stabilized by H-bonding interactions with lattice DMF molecule (O3\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O7 = 2.303(1) \u00c5) (a). Along the c-axis, it has been observed that a column of water molecules is sandwiched between the columns of DMF molecules ( Figure S17). The distance between the two nearest DMF molecules is 8.978 \u00c5 whereas the distance between two nearest water molecules is 8.964 \u00c5. It is worth noting that in comparison to 1, in 1a the distance between two DMF columns is widened by 2.462 \u00c5 which might be because of the intervening water columns between two DMF columns. But it is surprising that the calculated solvent accessible volume of the desolvated framework of 1a is the same as that of 1 which signifies the adaptability of the framework to all types of the guest without any structural transformation. PXRD analysis of 1a supports the framework stability even after the accumulation of one water molecule by replacing one MeCN molecule. Further, single crystals of 1 were exposed to different solvent vapors, namely, DMSO, MeOH, and MeCN at RT which lead to the exchange of lattice solvent molecules in a SCSC fashion and yield complexes, namely, 1b, 1c, and 1d (,  Tables S1 and S3) and exhibit unique colors which can be visually differentiated (). PXRD analysis reveals bulk phase purity, and elemental analysis confirms the elemental composition of the solvent exchanged complexes ( Figure S8). When single crystals of 1 were exposed to the vapor of a mixture of DMSO/MeOH/MeCN (volume ratio, 1:1:1), the framework selectively encapsulated DMSO (). Noncovalent interactions between the entrapped solvent molecules (a,c) and the polar environment of the channels within the framework as well as the appropriate size, shape, and polarity of the solvent molecules (polarity, DMSO > MeCN > DMF > MeOH) are likely to be responsible for the selective encapsulation.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 10, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Illustration of [Cu<sub>2</sub>L<sub>2</sub>] as secondary\nbuilding unit (SBU) and its extension through ligands (L).
