Fluorescence decays were recorded at three emissions wavelengths (510, 530, and 580 nm, see Table S5). For all MIL-140C_n  derivatives, the resulting decays could be satisfactorily fitted using a three-exponential model with three decay times (0.88, 3.16, and 4.79 ns). By comparison, the decays of the H2BP(OH)2DC precursor could be fitted with a three exponentials model with decay times of 0.60, 2.60, and 5.11 ns (Table S6). While these decay times cannot be directly attributed to distinct crystallographic environments for the BP(OH)2DC ligand, we can note that in all cases, the long decay time is very close to the fluorescence lifetime measured for the diester precursor BP(OH)2(COOEt)2 in dichloromethane (4.64 ns). For a given solid, the relative contributions of the three decay times to the overall fluorescence only slightly vary with the emission wavelength. This indicates that there are no excited-state processes such as excimers formation or resonance energy transfer occurring in these solids. The comparison of the three MIL-140C_n  derivatives at a given emission wavelength shows that the higher the substitution rate the shorter the average fluorescence decay time (see Table S5).
