In each case, toluene was used to decrease the solubility of complex 1 in the crystallization solvent. The single crystal of complex 1 was a colorless octahedron, complex 2 was a colorless cube, and complexes 3 and 4 were colorless rods. Single-crystal XRD for complexes 1 and 4 was performed on a Bruker APEX Duo diffractometer with graphite monochromated Mo-K\u03b1 radiation. Data for complexes 2 and 3 were collected on a Bruker X8 APEX II CCD with graphite monochromated Mo-K\u03b1 radiation. Structures of all complexes were solved by direct methods and the refinements were performed using SHELXL-97. The hydrogen atoms attached to aqua and ethanol ligands were not modeled; however, they must all be fully protonated for charge balance. In complexes 1 and 2 one acetato ligand (C15, C16, O15, O16), linking Cd6 to Cd7, was found in two orientations rotated about C16 in a 7:3 ratio. The atoms in the 30% abundant orientation were labeled as \u2018b' atoms. The aqua ligand, O22, found axial to O15 on Cd7 was also found in two orientations in a 7:3 ratio. The 30% abundant orientation was labeled O22b and is axial to O15b. The \u03bc3-O ligand in complexes 3 and 4 is disordered above and below the plane of Cd ions 2-4 and is modeled in the plane to account for this disorder. For charge balance, a hydrogen atom must also be bound to the \u03bc3-O making it a \u03bc3-OH. This hydrogen atom was not modeled in complex 3 because of the disorder of the oxygen atom. The hydrogen atoms attached to oxygen in complex 3 were located in the difference map.

However, there are no other basic sites within the crystal structure where a proton (necessary for charge balance of the framework) might be expected to lie. Close examination of ring 2 reveals that in the space above O19 there is a cage-like environment formed by three acetato ligands. It is possible that in this environment the proton could be mostly trapped between the 3 symmetry equivalent acetate ligands (O7 in particular) leaving the \u03bc<sub>3</sub>-O as a pseudo oxo ligand. The O7\u2212Cd4 distance of 2.815(3) \u00c5 indicates there is very little bonding present and a large amount of electron density available for the proton. This cage-like environment does not exist for ring 3, where the acetato ligands near the \u03bc<sub>3</sub>-OH are twisted outward to facilitate intercolumnar linking. A search of the Cambridge Structural Database reveals that a tetrahedral \u03bc<sub>3</sub>-oxo ligand bridging three cadmium ions is very rare with only a few compounds having previously been reported.
