The incident X-ray beam was focused and monochromated using Bruker Excalibur Gobel mirror optics. Crystals of the F-MOFs reported in the paper were mounted on nylon CryoLoops (Hampton Research) with Paraton-N (Hampton Research). Data were integrated using Bruker SAINT software. Data were subsequently corrected for absorption by the program SADABS. The space group determinations and tests for merohedral twinning were carried out using XPREP. In all cases, the highest possible space group was chosen. All structures were solved by direct methods and refined using the SHELXTL 97 software suite. Atoms were located from iterative examination of difference F-maps following least-squares refinements of the earlier models. Hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions and included as riding atoms with isotropic displacement parameters 1.2-1.5 times U eq of the attached C atoms. Data were collected at 298(2) K for all the F-MOFs reported in this paper. All structures were examined using the ADDSYM subroutine of PLATON  to ensure that no additional symmetry could be applied to the models. Zn-  F  MOF-4B has been solved and refined in a space group Cmc21 (see section S2 in  for the coordinates) although a solution could be obtained for space group Cmca (see section S2 in  for the coordinates). However, all our efforts to refine the structure in Cmca space group were unsuccessful. As a result, the space group Cmc21 has been chosen. High degree of mosaicity, possible pseudosymmetry, or a possible twining could be the cause of this effect. We acknowledge the fact that no suitable crystal for Zn-  F  MOF-4B with good diffraction could be obtained. The crystal structure of Cu-  F  MOF-4B, which has a similar unit cell dimension as Zn-  F  MOF-4B, could be solved and refined in Cmca space group.

The opening of the hysteresis indicates the presence of weak ferromagnetic (FM) behavior. As discussed earlier, the origin of FM behavior might be due to canted arrangement of spins introduced by spin frustration.</p>", "clean_text": "Thermal Stability and PXRD Analysis\n\nWe prepared the F-MOFs at the gram scale to allow detailed investigation of the aforementioned properties and to examine the architectural and thermal stability of reported in this paper. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) performed on as-synthesized Cu-F-MOF-4B, Zn-F-MOF-4B, and  F-MOF-4 revealed that these compounds have high thermal stability (see section S3 in , for all data and interpretations regarding guest mobility and thermal stability of these MOFs). The TGA trace for  F-MOF-4 showed a gradual weight loss step of ~20.5% (20-250 \u00b0C), corresponding to escape of all N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in the pores (3 DMF; calcd. ~14%) followed by a sharp weight loss (250-450 \u00b0C) probably due to the decomposition of the coordinated 3-picoline molecules before decomposition of the framework. The TGA analysis of Cu-F-MOF-4B show the sharp weight loss of ~17.5% (20-250 \u00b0C) corresponding to escape of all guest solvent molecules in pores followed by a plateau before a sharp weight loss (250-390 \u00b0C) probably due to the decomposition of the coordinated 3-methyl pyridine molecules. After 300 \u00b0C framework decomposes completely giving 40% residue. Also TGA traces of Zn-F-MOF-4B shows a sharp weight loss of 16.5% (185-245 \u00b0C) corresponding to the escape of all guest solvent molecules from rigid framework followed by a plateau before a sharp weight loss (235-265 \u00b0C) giving 30% residue after decomposition of the framework.\n\nMagnetic Properties of F-MOF-4 and Cu-FMOF-4B\n\nBoth  F-MOF-4 and Cu-F-MOF-4B contain the same dicopper paddlewheel SBU as joints and hfbba ligand as links between joints. However, the distance of these dicopper paddlewheel SBUs with respect to each other is different due to structural variation. As a result, we anticipated a difference in magnetic behavior of these two F-MOFs. Temperature dependence of ZFC and FC molar magnetic susceptibility (\u03c7) for  F-MOF-4 shows the overlapping of ZFC and FC on each other in the measured temperature range (Figure b). The effective magnetic moment \u03bceff vs T curve shows a sharply decreasing trend in \u03bceff with decreasing temperature probably due to an antiferromagnetic (AFM) superexchange (SE) interaction between Cu2+ ions. At 300 K, value of \u03bceff is 1.16 \u03bcB/Cu atom which is less than the theoretical calculated value for one Cu2+ ion (1.73 \u03bcB), indicating the presence of AFM interactions. The lower value of \u03bceff indicates onset of AFM ordering. This curve shows two anomalies (change of slope) around 195 and 80 K. The value of \u03c7T at 300 K is 0.67 emu mol-1 K and decreases with decreasing temperature until the lowest measured temperature. A well-defined hysteresis loop is also observed at 10 K, with a coercivity value of 55 Oe (inset of Figure b). The opening of the hysteresis indicates the presence of weak ferromagnetic (FM) behavior.
