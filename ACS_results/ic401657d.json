CO2 adsorption isotherms of all compounds show a type-I profile with a significant amount of uptake at low-pressure regions. The steep uptake at the relatively low P/P 0 (~0.04) region reveals a strong interaction of CO2 with the pore surface.

Desorption curves of compounds 1' and 3' follow the adsorption one, whereas, for compound 2', the sorption profile shows a large hysteresis retaining 24 mL g-1 of CO2 even at very low P/P 0 (0.001). This may be due to the strong interaction between the pendent pyridyl nitrogen atom and CO2 molecules, which facilitate the kinetic trapping of gas molecules inside the pore of compound 2, resulting in hysteresis and retaining of some CO2 molecules (Figure S16, ). The Langmuir surface area was calculated from CO2 adsorption profiles that turned out to be 340, 160, and 273 m2 g-1 for 1', 2', and 3', respectively.

To better understand the interactions between CO2 and the dehydrated frameworks of 1 and 3 (i.e., 1' and 3'), we have calculated the zero coverage isosteric heat of adsorption (Q st) using a virial equation (details are in the , Figures S11 and S12). As shown in Figure (4), the zero coverage isosteric heat of adsorptions were found to be 35.84 and 35.53 kJ mol-1 for 1' and 3', respectively. The calculated Q st values are comparable or even higher than some well-established CO2-capturing MOFs, entailing relatively stronger interactions between the CO2 and the pore surface of 1' and 3'. The stronger interaction between CO2 and the MOF surface is also reflected from the selectivity estimation of CO2 over N2 and CH4 employing the IAST (Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory) model (Figure ). At 273 K, for 1' and 3', the predicted adsorption selectivities of CO2 over N2 for a bimolar (15:85) mixture of CO2-N2 are 16 and 62, respectively (Figure a,b). For an equimolar (50: 50) mixture of CO2 and CH4, the values turned out to be 18 and 13 at 273 K for 1' and 3', respectively (Figure c,d). Compound 3' exhibits better CO2-N2 selectivity compared to other reported MOFs, suggesting that it may have potential applications in the separation of CO2 from a binary CO2-N2 mixture. It is very clear that all the factors, such as polar channels, high density of UMSs, and free nitrogen ends (from hanging cyanide ligands and pendent pyridyl nitrogen end), favor the inclusion of CO2 molecules into the pores, whereas other small nonpolar molecules were completely excluded. This is also supported by the high values of enthalpy of CO2 adsorption. This could also be correlated with the well-established fact that the electric field generated in the framework by UMSs and the aromatic \u03c0 cloud interacts firmly with the quadrupole moment of CO2 (-1.4 \u00d7 10-39 C m2), causing a rapid uptake at low pressure.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']"}}, {"idx": 32, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig6\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>6</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Gas adsorption isotherms of <bold>1\u2032</bold>\u2013<bold>3\u2032</bold> at 195 K are shown in (1)\u2013(3), respectively:\n(a) CO<sub>2</sub>, (b) O<sub>2</sub>, (c) CH<sub>4</sub>, (d) Ar,\nand (e) N<sub>2</sub>.

The TGA profile of compound <bold>1</bold> (Figure S5, ) indicates a weight loss\nof 3.1% at 120 \u00b0C, which corroborates the removal of two guest\nwater molecules (cal. 2.49%). The second step was observed at 210\n\u00b0C with a weight loss of 24.8%, indicating the removal of all\nguest bipy and coordinated water molecules (cal. 25.3%). The desolvated\nframework is stable up to 245 \u00b0C. Compound <bold>2</bold> does\nnot show any step in the TGA profile (Figure S6, ) and gradually losses weight with increasing\ntemperature. At \u223c150 \u00b0C, it loses all guest water molecules\n(cal. 7.63%, obs. 7.30%) and finally transforms to an unidentified\nproduct. In the case of <bold>3</bold> (Figure S7, ), a sharp decrease in weight was observed\nat 95 \u00b0C with a total loss of \u223c10% (cal. 9.97%), suggesting\nthe removal of all guest water molecules and that the dehydrated framework\nis stable up to 185 \u00b0C.</p><title>Permanent Porosity and\nGas Storage Property</title><p>All the\nthree compounds were subjected to N<sub>2</sub> adsorption at 77 K\n(Figure S10, ). Compound <bold>2</bold> shows a typical type-II profile, obtained with the final\nuptake of 35 mL g<sup>\u20131</sup>, suggesting only surface adsorption.\nHowever, in the cases of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>3</bold>, a combined\nisotherm of type I and type II was observed with a final uptake of\n53 and 47 mL g<sup>\u20131</sup>, respectively, suggesting the microporous\nnature of both the compounds. Hysteresis in the sorption profiles\nsuggests the presence of a high diffusion barrier for N<sub>2</sub> in both the compounds. Interesting results were obtained in gas\n(CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, Ar, CH<sub>4</sub>, and O<sub>2</sub>) adsorption studies of the three compounds at 195 K, which suggests\nselective capture of CO<sub>2</sub> by all the three compounds (Figure ). CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption isotherms of all compounds\nshow a type-I profile with a significant amount of uptake at low-pressure\nregions. The steep uptake at the relatively low <italic toggle=\"yes\">P/P</italic>\n<sub>0</sub> (\u223c0.04) region reveals a strong interaction of\nCO<sub>2</sub> with the pore surface. After <italic toggle=\"yes\">P/P</italic>\n<sub>0</sub> \u2248 0.05, the gradient of uptake profiles has been decreased\nand ended with a final volume uptake of 16.7 wt % (85 mL g<sup>\u20131</sup>), 8.8 wt % (45 mL g<sup>\u20131</sup>), and 16.8 wt % (88 mL g<sup>\u20131</sup>) for <bold>1\u2032</bold>, <bold>2\u2032</bold>, and <bold>3\u2032</bold>, respectively (Figure ). Desorption curves of compounds <bold>1\u2032</bold> and <bold>3\u2032</bold> follow the adsorption one, whereas, for compound <bold>2\u2032</bold>, the sorption profile shows a large hysteresis retaining\n24 mL g<sup>\u20131</sup> of CO<sub>2</sub> even at very low <italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>/<italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>\n<sub>0</sub> (0.001). This may be due\nto the strong interaction between the pendent pyridyl nitrogen atom\nand CO<sub>2</sub> molecules, which facilitate the kinetic trapping\nof gas molecules inside the pore of compound <bold>2</bold>, resulting\nin hysteresis and retaining of some CO<sub>2</sub> molecules (Figure\nS16, ). The Langmuir\nsurface area was calculated from CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption profiles\nthat turned out to be 340, 160, and 273 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> for <bold>1\u2032</bold>, <bold>2\u2032</bold>, and <bold>3\u2032</bold>, respectively. In the case of <bold>2</bold>, the smaller pore volume\nas well as the lesser void space as calculated from PLATON was also\nreflected in the lesser CO<sub>2</sub> uptake. Adsorption isotherms\nof other small molecules, such as Ar, O<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>, were also measured at 195 K with <bold>1\u2032</bold>\u2013<bold>3\u2032</bold>. They show a negligible amount of\nuptake compared to that for CO<sub>2</sub> (Figure ), suggesting high selectivity in CO<sub>2</sub> uptake. In\naddition, we have also measured the CO<sub>2</sub> uptake capacity\nfor <bold>1\u2032</bold> and <bold>3\u2032</bold> at temperatures\nof 273 and 293 K. The uptake amounts were found to be 30 and 24 mL\ng<sup>\u20131</sup> for <bold>1\u2032</bold>, whereas, for <bold>3\u2032</bold>, it adsorbs 38 and 30 mL g<sup>\u20131</sup> at\nthe respective temperatures. To better understand the interactions\nbetween CO<sub>2</sub> and the dehydrated frameworks of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>3</bold> (i.e., <bold>1\u2032</bold> and <bold>3\u2032</bold>), we have calculated the zero coverage isosteric heat of adsorption\n(<italic toggle=\"yes\">Q</italic>\n<sub>st</sub>) using a virial equation (details\nare in the , Figures\nS11 and S12). As shown in Figure (4), the\nzero coverage isosteric heat of adsorptions were found to be 35.84\nand 35.53 kJ mol<sup>\u20131</sup> for <bold>1\u2032</bold> and <bold>3\u2032</bold>, respectively. The calculated <italic toggle=\"yes\">Q</italic>\n<sub>st</sub> values are comparable or even higher than some well-established\nCO<sub>2</sub>-capturing MOFs, entailing\nrelatively stronger interactions between the CO<sub>2</sub> and the\npore surface of <bold>1\u2032</bold> and <bold>3\u2032</bold>.\nThe stronger interaction between CO<sub>2</sub> and the MOF surface\nis also reflected from the selectivity estimation of CO<sub>2</sub> over N<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> employing the IAST (Ideal\nAdsorbed Solution Theory) model (Figure ). At 273 K, for <bold>1\u2032</bold> and <bold>3\u2032</bold>, the predicted adsorption selectivities of CO<sub>2</sub> over N<sub>2</sub> for a bimolar (15:85) mixture of CO<sub>2</sub>\u2013N<sub>2</sub> are 16 and 62, respectively (Figure a,b). For an equimolar (50: 50) mixture of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>, the values turned out to be 18 and 13\nat 273 K for <bold>1\u2032</bold> and <bold>3\u2032</bold>, respectively\n(Figure c,d). Compound <bold>3\u2032</bold> exhibits better CO<sub>2</sub>\u2013N<sub>2</sub> selectivity\ncompared to other reported MOFs, suggesting\nthat it may have potential applications in the separation of CO<sub>2</sub> from a binary CO<sub>2</sub>\u2013N<sub>2</sub> mixture.\nIt is very clear that all the factors, such as polar channels, high\ndensity of UMSs, and free nitrogen ends (from hanging cyanide ligands\nand pendent pyridyl nitrogen end), favor the inclusion of CO<sub>2</sub> molecules into the pores, whereas other small nonpolar molecules\nwere completely excluded. This is also supported by the high values\nof enthalpy of CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption. This could also be correlated\nwith the well-established fact that the electric field generated in\nthe framework by UMSs and the aromatic \u03c0 cloud interacts firmly\nwith the quadrupole moment of CO<sub>2</sub> (\u22121.4 \u00d7 10<sup>\u201339</sup> C m<sup>2</sup>), causing a rapid uptake at low\npressure.</p><p>A moderate surface area with a\nrelatively polar pore surface based\non unsaturated metal sites and free nitrogen ends further motivated\nus to examine their H<sub>2</sub>-storage capacity at 77 K. Adsorption\nisotherms of <bold>1\u2032</bold>\u2013<bold>3\u2032</bold> show\ntypical type-I curves. Compounds <bold>1\u2032</bold> and <bold>3\u2032</bold> reveal a steep uptake at the low-pressure region\nwith the final adsorption amount of 0.47 wt % (52.5 mL g<sup>\u20131</sup>) and 0.7 wt % (78 mL g<sup>\u20131</sup>), respectively (Figure (1), a\u2013c). In the case of <bold>2\u2032</bold>, the uptake amount gradually increases with increasing pressure\nand the desorption curve does not follow the adsorption one showing\na small hysteresis. The final uptake value is about 24 mL g<sup>\u20131</sup>, which corresponds to 0.22 wt % (Figure (1), b). We have also measured the zero coverage isosteric heats\nof hydrogen adsorption following the virial equation based on the\nadsorption profiles measured at 77 and 87 K. At the onset of adsorption,\nthe enthalpies were calculated to be (details in the  and Figures S13\u2013S14) a value\nof 7.97 and 7.73 kJ mol<sup>\u20131</sup> (Figure (2)) for <bold>1\u2032</bold> and <bold>3\u2032</bold>, respectively, which may be attributed to the interactions of H<sub>2</sub> molecules with open Zn sites, free cyanides, and the aromatic\n\u03c0 cloud.</p><p>Furthermore, to check the stability of the dehydrated compounds\n(<bold>1\u2032</bold>\u2013<bold>3\u2032</bold>) under humid\nconditions, we have measured the water adsorption isotherm at 298\nK. All the compounds show a gradual uptake (Figures S17\u2013S19, ) of water with increasing\npressure, and the corresponding final uptake values are 130, 59, and\n103 mL g<sup>\u20131</sup> (corresponding to 6, 2, and 5 molecules/formula\nunit), respectively, for <bold>1\u2032</bold>\u2013<bold>3\u2032</bold>. Compounds <bold>1\u2032</bold>\u2013<bold>3\u2032</bold> were\nalso treated with boiling water for 12 h. The PXRD patterns (Figure e, Figures S8e and S9e, ) of the resulting compounds do not show any significant\nchange, which corresponds to the good stability of those materials\nunder hydrothermal conditions.</p>", "clean_text": "Results and Discussion\n\nStructural Description of {[Zn3(bipy)3(H2O)2][Fe(CN)6]2\u22c52(bipy)\u22c53H2O} n  (1)\n\nSingle-crystal X-ray crystallographic structure determination reveals that 1 is a neutral 3D coordination architecture of Zn(II) built of [Fe(CN)6]3- and bipy with the formula of {[Zn3(bipy)3(H2O)2][Fe(CN)6]2\u22c52(bipy)\u22c53H2O} n . Compound 1 crystallizes in the orthorhombic system in the Pbam space group. There are two crystallographically independent Zn (Zn1 and Zn2) atoms in the asymmetric unit where each octahedral Zn2 is coordinated to two CN groups from two [Fe(CN)6]3-, two bipy, and two water molecules (O1, O1c), whereas each trigonal-bipyramidal Zn1 is coordinated to three CN groups from three different [Fe(CN)6]3- and two bipy molecules (Figure a). The Zn-N and Zn-O bond distances are in the ranges of 2.983-2.220 and 2.079-2.186 \u00c5. In the 2D layer, the 12-membered Zn12Fe12(CN)4 ring is surrounded by six 18-membered Zn1Zn22Fe13(CN)12 rings and each 2D layer is connected by the bipy linker through the Zn(II) centers, forming a 3D pillared-layer framework with two kinds of channels along the c axis (Figure d). Examination with TOPOS reveals that 1 is a trinodal (4-c)3(5-c)2-periodic 3D net formed by 5-connected (5-c) Zn-nodes, (4-c) Fe-nodes. In a layer, the vertex symbol for Zn1, Zn2, and Fe1 points are represented by Schla\u0308fli symbols, {4.68.8}, {65.8}, and {4.65}, respectively. Further examination shows that 1 adopts a topology with the Schla\u0308fli symbol {4.65}2{4.68.8}2{65.8}. After removing the coordinated and guest molecules (H2O and bipy), compound 1 offers a biporous network with open channels along the crystallographic c direction (Figure e). The rectangular-shaped voids are observed along c with the diameter of 5.9 \u00d7 4.1 \u00c52 (Figure e). Upon removal of the coordinated water and guest (water, bipy) molecules, the framework shows 37.9% void space to the total volume with coordinatively unsaturated Zn(II) centers on the pore surface (Figure S1, ). The guest water molecules O1w and O2w are H-bonded (O1w\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O2w, 2.975 \u00c5) to each other, and O1w is also making a bridge between the two layers through N1 of the pendant CN group (N1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O1w, 2.918 \u00c5) (Figure c). The guest bipy molecules undergoes strong face-to-face \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions (Figure b) with two different coordinated bipy (cg\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5cg distances are in the range of 3.631-3.905 \u00c5) linkers connected to two Zn (Zn1 and Zn2) centers.

The TGA profile of compound 1 (Figure S5, ) indicates a weight loss of 3.1% at 120 \u00b0C, which corroborates the removal of two guest water molecules (cal. 2.49%). The second step was observed at 210 \u00b0C with a weight loss of 24.8%, indicating the removal of all guest bipy and coordinated water molecules (cal. 25.3%). The desolvated framework is stable up to 245 \u00b0C. Compound 2 does not show any step in the TGA profile (Figure S6, ) and gradually losses weight with increasing temperature. At ~150 \u00b0C, it loses all guest water molecules (cal. 7.63%, obs. 7.30%) and finally transforms to an unidentified product. In the case of 3 (Figure S7, ), a sharp decrease in weight was observed at 95 \u00b0C with a total loss of ~10% (cal. 9.97%), suggesting the removal of all guest water molecules and that the dehydrated framework is stable up to 185 \u00b0C.\n\nPermanent Porosity and Gas Storage Property\n\nAll the three compounds were subjected to N2 adsorption at 77 K (Figure S10, ). Compound 2 shows a typical type-II profile, obtained with the final uptake of 35 mL g-1, suggesting only surface adsorption. However, in the cases of 1 and 3, a combined isotherm of type I and type II was observed with a final uptake of 53 and 47 mL g-1, respectively, suggesting the microporous nature of both the compounds. Hysteresis in the sorption profiles suggests the presence of a high diffusion barrier for N2 in both the compounds. Interesting results were obtained in gas (CO2, N2, Ar, CH4, and O2) adsorption studies of the three compounds at 195 K, which suggests selective capture of CO2 by all the three compounds (Figure ). CO2 adsorption isotherms of all compounds show a type-I profile with a significant amount of uptake at low-pressure regions. The steep uptake at the relatively low P/P 0 (~0.04) region reveals a strong interaction of CO2 with the pore surface. After P/P 0 ~ 0.05, the gradient of uptake profiles has been decreased and ended with a final volume uptake of 16.7 wt % (85 mL g-1), 8.8 wt % (45 mL g-1), and 16.8 wt % (88 mL g-1) for 1', 2', and 3', respectively (Figure ). Desorption curves of compounds 1' and 3' follow the adsorption one, whereas, for compound 2', the sorption profile shows a large hysteresis retaining 24 mL g-1 of CO2 even at very low P/P 0 (0.001). This may be due to the strong interaction between the pendent pyridyl nitrogen atom and CO2 molecules, which facilitate the kinetic trapping of gas molecules inside the pore of compound 2, resulting in hysteresis and retaining of some CO2 molecules (Figure S16, ). The Langmuir surface area was calculated from CO2 adsorption profiles that turned out to be 340, 160, and 273 m2 g-1 for 1', 2', and 3', respectively. In the case of 2, the smaller pore volume as well as the lesser void space as calculated from PLATON was also reflected in the lesser CO2 uptake. Adsorption isotherms of other small molecules, such as Ar, O2, CH4, and N2, were also measured at 195 K with 1'-3'. They show a negligible amount of uptake compared to that for CO2 (Figure ), suggesting high selectivity in CO2 uptake. In addition, we have also measured the CO2 uptake capacity for 1' and 3' at temperatures of 273 and 293 K. The uptake amounts were found to be 30 and 24 mL g-1 for 1', whereas, for 3', it adsorbs 38 and 30 mL g-1 at the respective temperatures. To better understand the interactions between CO2 and the dehydrated frameworks of 1 and 3 (i.e., 1' and 3'), we have calculated the zero coverage isosteric heat of adsorption (Q st) using a virial equation (details are in the , Figures S11 and S12). As shown in Figure (4), the zero coverage isosteric heat of adsorptions were found to be 35.84 and 35.53 kJ mol-1 for 1' and 3', respectively. The calculated Q st values are comparable or even higher than some well-established CO2-capturing MOFs, entailing relatively stronger interactions between the CO2 and the pore surface of 1' and 3'. The stronger interaction between CO2 and the MOF surface is also reflected from the selectivity estimation of CO2 over N2 and CH4 employing the IAST (Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory) model (Figure ). At 273 K, for 1' and 3', the predicted adsorption selectivities of CO2 over N2 for a bimolar (15:85) mixture of CO2-N2 are 16 and 62, respectively (Figure a,b). For an equimolar (50: 50) mixture of CO2 and CH4, the values turned out to be 18 and 13 at 273 K for 1' and 3', respectively (Figure c,d). Compound 3' exhibits better CO2-N2 selectivity compared to other reported MOFs, suggesting that it may have potential applications in the separation of CO2 from a binary CO2-N2 mixture. It is very clear that all the factors, such as polar channels, high density of UMSs, and free nitrogen ends (from hanging cyanide ligands and pendent pyridyl nitrogen end), favor the inclusion of CO2 molecules into the pores, whereas other small nonpolar molecules were completely excluded. This is also supported by the high values of enthalpy of CO2 adsorption. This could also be correlated with the well-established fact that the electric field generated in the framework by UMSs and the aromatic \u03c0 cloud interacts firmly with the quadrupole moment of CO2 (-1.4 \u00d7 10-39 C m2), causing a rapid uptake at low pressure.\n\nA moderate surface area with a relatively polar pore surface based on unsaturated metal sites and free nitrogen ends further motivated us to examine their H2-storage capacity at 77 K. Adsorption isotherms of 1'-3' show typical type-I curves. Compounds 1' and 3' reveal a steep uptake at the low-pressure region with the final adsorption amount of 0.47 wt % (52.5 mL g-1) and 0.7 wt % (78 mL g-1), respectively (Figure (1), a-c). In the case of 2', the uptake amount gradually increases with increasing pressure and the desorption curve does not follow the adsorption one showing a small hysteresis. The final uptake value is about 24 mL g-1, which corresponds to 0.22 wt % (Figure (1), b). We have also measured the zero coverage isosteric heats of hydrogen adsorption following the virial equation based on the adsorption profiles measured at 77 and 87 K. At the onset of adsorption, the enthalpies were calculated to be (details in the  and Figures S13-S14) a value of 7.97 and 7.73 kJ mol-1 (Figure (2)) for 1' and 3', respectively, which may be attributed to the interactions of H2 molecules with open Zn sites, free cyanides, and the aromatic \u03c0 cloud.\n\nFurthermore, to check the stability of the dehydrated compounds (1'-3') under humid conditions, we have measured the water adsorption isotherm at 298 K. All the compounds show a gradual uptake (Figures S17-S19, ) of water with increasing pressure, and the corresponding final uptake values are 130, 59, and 103 mL g-1 (corresponding to 6, 2, and 5 molecules/formula unit), respectively, for 1'-3'. Compounds 1'-3' were also treated with boiling water for 12 h. The PXRD patterns (Figure e, Figures S8e and S9e, ) of the resulting compounds do not show any significant change, which corresponds to the good stability of those materials under hydrothermal conditions.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "{[Zn3(bipy)3(H2O)2][Fe(CN)6]2\u22c52(bipy)\u22c53H2O} n", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "{[Zn3(bipy)3(H2O)2][Fe(CN)6]2\u22c52(bipy)\u22c53H2O} n"},
