As shown in , the N2 sorption isotherm for UTSA-121a at 77 K shows a type IV feature with an uptake capacity of about 354 cm3 g-1. Its corresponding pore volume is 0.55 cm3 g-1, which is lower than its theoretical one of 0.91 cm3 g-1 (based on its crystal structure) owing to the insufficient filling of N2 on the undulating pore surfaces of UTSA-121 (). The accompanied two-step hysteresis might be attributed to the rotations of dynamic organic linker implied by their disorder distribution, or to the possible crystal defects implied by the mesoporous feature of sorption isotherm. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Langmuir surface areas can be calculated up to 1081 and 1447 m2 g-1 (Figure S4), respectively, which are comparable to that of SIFSIX-1-Cu (1346 m2 g-1) but higher than UTSA-48a (285 m2 g-1) in the same type MOFs.

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of UTSA-121 shows that bpb-CF3 can well substitute for the prototypal dipyridine ligand to form a non-interpenetrated pcu framework, which is highly porous (void = 65.7%) and contains three-dimensional intersecting channels with functionalized trifluoromethyl groups on the pore surface. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of the activated UTSA-121a is up to 1081 m2 g-1. Gas sorption measurements of UTSA-121a reveal high C2H2 and CO2 uptakes at room temperature. Furthermore, ideal adsorbed solution theory calculations reveal that UTSA-121a shows highly selective adsorption of C2H2 and CO2 over CH4 and N2 under ambient conditions.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nSlow diffusion of a methanol solution of bpb-CF3 into an aqueous solution of copper hexafluorosilicate hydrate at room temperature afforded purple block crystals of [Cu(bpb-CF3)2(SiF6)] (UTSA-121). X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that UTSA-121 crystallizes in tetragonal P4/mmm space group (Table S1), showing an isostructural structure with the previously reported MOF [Zn(bpb)2(SiF6)] (bpb = 1,4-bis(4-pyridyl)benzene). Each copper center is octahedrally coordinated by the four different pyridyl N atoms (from bpb-CF3 ligands) and two different F atoms (from SiF6 2- anions) ( and S1). The coordination framework in UTSA-121 is a non-interpenetrated three-dimensional (3D) pcu net composed of octahedral Cu(py)4(SiF6)2 (py = pyridyl groups) cores and 2-connected bpb-CF3 and SiF6 2- linkers. The introduced trifluoromethyl groups randomly dangling near the center of organic ligands results in an undulating pore surface. In UTSA-121, the apertures along the crystallographic a- and c-axis are 5.0 \u00c5 \u00d7 6.2 and 7.1 \u00d7 14.5 \u00c52, respectively (). The potential accessible volume is estimated to 1224 \u00c53 per unit cell (volume = 1864 \u00c53), determined by PLATON calculation, that is, 65.7% void per unit volume for UTSA-121. The phase purity of the as-synthesized sample was confirmed through powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis (Figure S3). The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of UTSA-121 revealed that it lost all guests molecules at ca. 90 \u00b0C (10% weight loss) and decomposed at ca. 200 \u00b0C (Figure S2).\n\nThe permanent porosity of UTSA-121 was examined by N2 sorption experiments at 77 K. Prior to gas sorption, methanol-exchanged UTSA-121 was degassed under high vacuum at 298 K for 24 h, resulting in the activated phase UTSA-121a. The PXRD pattern revealed that UTSA-121a can well retain the framework after solvent removal as compared with its simulated one obtained from crystallographic data (Figure S3). As shown in , the N2 sorption isotherm for UTSA-121a at 77 K shows a type IV feature with an uptake capacity of about 354 cm3 g-1. Its corresponding pore volume is 0.55 cm3 g-1, which is lower than its theoretical one of 0.91 cm3 g-1 (based on its crystal structure) owing to the insufficient filling of N2 on the undulating pore surfaces of UTSA-121 (). The accompanied two-step hysteresis might be attributed to the rotations of dynamic organic linker implied by their disorder distribution, or to the possible crystal defects implied by the mesoporous feature of sorption isotherm. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Langmuir surface areas can be calculated up to 1081 and 1447 m2 g-1 (Figure S4), respectively, which are comparable to that of SIFSIX-1-Cu (1346 m2 g-1) but higher than UTSA-48a (285 m2 g-1) in the same type MOFs. Additionally, the measured pore size distribution centered at about 8.6 \u00c5 (Figure S5) is comparable with the crystal structure of UTSA-121. Hence, the immobilization of trifluoromethyl groups does not substantially reduce the porosity of such framework.\n\nThe considerably large surface area combined with possible active sites like other SIFSIX materials enables UTSA-121a to serve as a potential candidate for important gas separation such as methane purification. Consequently, single-component gas sorption isotherms of UTSA-121a for C2H2, CO2, CH4, and N2 at 273 and 298 K have been collected to evaluate its separation capacity and selectivity. As shown in the , at 1 atm and 273 K, UTSA-121a can take up considerable amounts of C2H2 (103 cm3 g-1) and CO2 (59.4 cm3 g-1), far higher than that of CH4 (11.0 cm3 g-1) and N2 (3.9 cm3 g-1). And at 298 K, the uptake capacities for C2H2, CO2, CH4, and N2 were measured to be 71.3, 36.4, 6.3, and 2.2 cm3 g-1, respectively. Obviously, the uptake capacities of UTSA-121a for C2H2 and CO2 are higher than those of M'MOF-3, Mg(HCOO)2, UTSA-48a, and so on, although lower than some benchmark materials such as SIFSIX-1-Cu. Notably, the uptake capacity of UTSA-121a for CH4 is far lower than many MOFs, e.g., SIFSIX-2-Cu-i (10.5 cm3 g-1), SIFSIX-3-Zn (17.6 cm3 g-1), and Mg-MOF-74 (24.9 cm3 g-1), which means it can avoid the loss of methane and the capture capacity for impurity during separation process. The coverage-dependent adsorption enthalpies of UTSA-121a for C2H2 and CO2 were then calculated using the virial method (Figure S6), based on the fittings of their single-component adsorption isotherms at ambient temperatures. The adsorption heats of UTSA-121a at zero coverage for C2H2 and CO2 were calculated to be 22.6 and 21.9 kJ mol -1, respectively, which is comparable to some MOFs with open metal sites, e.g., HKUST-1 (30.4 and 25.3 kJ mol -1 for C2H2 and CO2, respectively). In contrast, the adsorption heat for CH4 is only 15.0 kJ mol -1, which can be attributed to the less polar nature of CH4 that results in a weaker interaction with the pore surface.", "data":
