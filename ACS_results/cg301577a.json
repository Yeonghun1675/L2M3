In contrast, its N2 adsorption is almost zero (0.5218 cm3 g-1) at 298 K and 0.75 atm. As shown in Figure , the selectivity of NJU-Bai6 is 60 at 298 K, which is calculated from the pure-component isotherms by dividing the mass of CO2 adsorbed at 0.15 atm and N2 adsorbed at 0.75 atm according to the equation in . As far as we know, it is the third highest record for MOF materials, indicating that NJU-Bai6 may be an excellent candidate for the postcombustion capture of CO2.\n\nThe authors declare no competing financial interest.\n\nReferences\n\nCrystal data for NJU-Bai6: C56H44Cu3N6O16, fw = 1247.59, triclinic, space group P4(2)/n, a = 21.2737(14) \u00c5, b = 21.2737(14) \u00c5, c = 30.086(2) \u00c5, \u03b1 = 90.000\u00b0, \u03b2 = 90.000\u00b0, \u03b3 = 90.000\u00b0, V = 13616.0(16) \u00c53, Z = 4, D c = 0.609 g cm-3, F 000 = 2548, Mo K\u03b1 radiation, \u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5.
