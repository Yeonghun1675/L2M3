Therefore,\nthe contribution of increased photocurrent jump mainly originated\nfrom the absorption transition of bpy cation radicals.</p>", "clean_text": "To gain further insight into the origin of the photocurrent of 1, studying the change in current was necessary. The magnitude of the relative current changes, \u0394I = (I irr - I dark)/I dark, was related to the wavelength (\u03bb) and irradiance (M) of the light source and the applied voltage (U). For different \u03bb, the differences between the light-induced current I irr and the \"dark\" current I dark were linear in U (e), such that \u0394I  M,\u03bb(U) was basically independent of U. Furthermore, at constant \u03bb, the change of \u0394I  U,\u03bb(M) has positively correlated with the irradiance M (). As shown in f, at constant U and M, the rate of increase in \u0394I  U,M (\u03bb = 300-380 nm) was faster than those of \u0394I  U,M (\u03bb = 410-490 nm) and \u0394I  U,M (\u03bb = 550-630 nm) at the initial stage of coloration. Thus, the contribution of increased conductance by the PIET process mainly originated from electron transition within the inorganic lattice, instead of that between the inorganic lattice and bpy cations. As the PIET process proceeded, the absorption bands in the 400-900 nm range assigned to bpy cation radicals became stronger (a). At last, the \u0394I  U,M (\u03bb = 550-630 nm) was close to \u0394I  U,M (\u03bb = 410-490 nm), and both \u0394I  U,M (\u03bb = 550-630 nm) and \u0394I  U,M (\u03bb = 410-490 nm) were larger than \u0394I  U,M (\u03bb = 300-380 nm) (g).
