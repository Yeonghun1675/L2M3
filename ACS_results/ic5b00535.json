To verify the extent of the click reaction, we investigated the 1H NMR spectrum of digested UiO-68-triazole-A (Figure S7 in the ). Obviously, no starting material remained, and the corresponding triazole derivative was formed. In addition, the high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrum (HR-ESI-MS) of digested UiO-68-triazole-A (Figure S8 in the ) also confirmed formation of the corresponding triazole derivative. More importantly, the positions of the PXRD peaks of UiO-68-triazole-A are similar to those of UiO-68-alkyne, signifying retention of the framework. N2 adsorption isotherms of UiO-68-triazole-A at 77 K also showed type I gas sorption isotherms, and the BET surface area was calculated to be 1851 m2 g-1 (Figures  and S16 in the ), suggesting that the porosity was maintained. The observed decreases in the surface area compared to those of UiO-68-alkyne were largely attributed to the formation of triazole groups on the pore surface.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "UiO-68-alkyne", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "topology": [{"value": "fcu", "condition": ""}], "space group": [{"value": "Fm3\u0305m", "condition": ""}], "pore diameter": [], "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "3155", "unit": "m2 g-1", "condition": ""}, {"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "1851", "unit": "m2 g-1", "condition": ""}], "peak spectrum": [{"value": "3286", "unit": "cm-1", "type": "Fourier transform infrared", "condition": ""}]}]]], "include_properties": ["topology", "space_group", "pore_diameter", "surface_area", "peak_spectrum"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['topology', 'space_group', 'pore_diameter', 'surface_area', 'peak_spectrum']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n  {\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"name\": \"UiO-68-alkyne\",\n      \"symbol\": \"\",\n      \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"topology\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"fcu\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"space group\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"Fm3\u0305m\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"pore diameter\": [],\n    \"surface area\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"BET\",\n        \"probe\": \"\",\n        \"value\": \"3155\",\n        \"unit\": \"m2 g-1\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"BET\",\n        \"probe\": \"\",\n        \"value\": \"1851\",\n        \"unit\": \"m2 g-1\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"peak spectrum\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"3286\",\n        \"unit\": \"cm-1\",\n        \"type\": \"Fourier transform infrared\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 5, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Scheme for the synthesis and PSM of UiO-68-alkyne.\nThe topology is shown in a simplified form as an octahedral cage.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2015-005358_0002.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Scheme for the synthesis and PSM of UiO-68-alkyne.
