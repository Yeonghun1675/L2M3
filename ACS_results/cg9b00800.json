The absorption spectrum of IO4 -/Cr2O7 2- displays intense absorption bands in the ranges of 200-270 and 230-310/310-400 nm (Figure S7b), showing a large overlap with the excitation band of 1, which is responsible for the quenching phenomenon.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 17, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig3\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Emission intensities of <bold>1</bold> with various anions.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr3\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cg9b00800_0003.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 3  Emission intensities of 1 with various anions.
