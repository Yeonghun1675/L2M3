If superexchange is indeed the most important factor, \u03c7m T should remain close to its limiting high-temperature value with decreasing T. This would, in turn, indicate that the thermal energy is still much larger than the strength of the exchange interaction. In the observed data, \u03c7m T began to decay quite quickly but then remained higher than predicted at very low T. This is in line with observations in previous studies. eq  yielded reasonable values for the coupling constant, A = -2.8(3) cm-1 for Pr-PCM-21 and -0.80(4) cm-1 for Nd-PCM-21, but did not give a satisfactory fit across the entire temperature range for either compound (blue fit, Figure A,B). Next, the effect of tetragonal ZFS was considered. This gave a much better result for Pr-PCM-21 [orange fit, Figure A; D = 7.2(1) K and R 2 = 0.990] and was further improved by considering the additional effect of MFT [green fit, Figure A; D = 6.8(1) K, A = -0.012(2) K, and R 2 = 0.993]. In contrast, the data for Nd-PCM-21 could not be fitted as well using ZFS [orange fit, Figure B; D = 1.7(1) K and R 2 = 0.049] and was only marginally improved using the ZFS + MFT approach [green fit, Figure A D = 0.73(7) K, A = -0.0 K, and R = 0.530].
