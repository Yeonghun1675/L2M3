The recording for crystalline cobalt hydroxochloride Co2(OH)3Cl, used as a reference (upper curve), corresponds to octahedral cobalt ions with valence state +2. The title compound (bottom curve) shows a similar spectra, confirming the octahedral surrounding of Co(II) ions, with however a more complex profile in accordance with a distortion of coordination polyhedra, and/or spin forbidden transitions. The above bands are assigned to the d-d electronic transitions of octahedral cobalt(II) ion: 500 and 550 nm for 4T1g(F) \u2192 4T1g(P), 630 nm for 4T1g(F) \u2192 4A2g(F), and 1200 nm for 4T1g(F) \u2192 4T2g(F). For an octahedral surrounding, the values 754 and 910 cm-1 are deduced for Dq and B Racah's parameter, respectively.

Such a behavior has already been reported for the related copper(II) compound with the dicarboxylate anion CO2C4H4CO2 2-, characterized by a similar basal spacing (d = 10.4 \u00c5). Indeed the interlayer exchange interaction due to the spin polarization through the bridging anion is expected to favor an antiferromagnetic order. The fact that upon cooling below 45 K a net and small moment is stabilized in the ground-state points to a competition between the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling and the single-ion anisotropy, which would be responsible for an uncompensated noncollinear magnetic structure. Although there are two kinds of octahedrally coordinated cobalt sites with different degrees of anisotropy and different orientation within the layers, a possible noncollinearity of the moments within the same layer cannot explain the observed net moment. Indeed there would still be a one to one compensation between moments of the same kind in adjacent layers.
