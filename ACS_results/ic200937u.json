However, the BET surface area of the solvent-free framework of 960 m2g-1, calculated with multipoint BET method in the range of p/p 0 = 0.03-0.1, and the specific pore volume of 0.43 cm3 g-1 (at 0.9 p/p 0) are lower as expected for elongated analogue of Zn2(1,4-bdc)2(dabco), due to the interpenetration.\n\nThe water adsorption properties of DUT-30(Zn) were studied and compared with other MOFs investigated earlier. Due to the high polarity of the water molecule, information concerning hydrophobic or hydrophilic character of the substances (as well as concerning the stability against moisture) can be achieved. DUT-30(Zn) shows a water physisorption isotherm similar to ZIF-8, a highly hydrophobic and chemically stable zeolitic imidazolate framework (Figure ). The pore volume calculated at 0.95 p/p 0 amounts to 0.30 cm3 g-1. Thus, DUT-30(Zn) is a promising hydrophobic MOF due to the larger pore size as compared to ZIF-8.\n\nThe CO2 storage capacity of Zn2(adb)2(dabco) is about 200 cm3 g-1 at -78 \u00b0C and 0.9 bar and ca. 30 cm3 g-1 at 0 \u00b0C and 0.9 bar which is comparable to other MOFs. Synchrotron in situ PXRD/adsorption experiments with CO2 at various conditions are scheduled to investigate structural dynamics of the framework.\n\nThe stability against water was also examined. The analysis of a water treated sample ( W ) shows that Zn2(adb)2(dabco) can include water molecules undergoing a structural change. The water molecules incorporated in the structure cannot be completely removed by activation at 150 \u00b0C and N2 adsorption measurement reveals the low porosity of such material (BET surface area of 40 m2 g-1 (p/p 0 = 0.1-0.3)). Thermogravimetric analysis () shows that approximately 0.5 H2O molecule per Zn2(adb)2(dabco) was still enclosed after activation. Furthermore, the residual mass is 2.2% higher than expected, accordingly the sample already contains ZnO or Zn(OH)2. Hence, a slow decomposition is proceeding during hydration.\n\nThermal stability of  K  was investigated using thermogravimetric (TG) analysis (). The TG plot of  K  illustrates that the compound starts losing solvent at temperatures slightly above ambient. At approximately 250 \u00b0C all guest molecules are removed (calcd. 23.4%). From ca. 350 \u00b0C the amine pillar ligand (dabco) disappears. At 450 \u00b0C the framework decomposes completely with elimination of the adb linker. Decarboxylation is also occurring. The calorimetric DTA curve does not exhibit any signals indicating phase transition from  K  to  T .\n\nConclusions\n\nZn2(adb)2(dabco) is a new microporous compound which shows vast structural transformation during desolvation, resolvation, and hydration, as well as during cooling or gas physisorption.
