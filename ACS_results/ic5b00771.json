In each case self-assembly results in the formation of dimeric dodecacopper supramolecular assemblies (1-5) of 3 + 3 macrocyclic ligands (H6L4 and H6L5) and 1D single-chain polymeric complex 6 as a side product in 1. Cyclodehydrative condensation (3 + 3) between DFMP/DFTBP and 1,3-DAP in the presence of Cu(BF4)2\u22c56H2O and triethylamine (TEA) results in the formation of dimeric dodecacopper assemblies (1, 3, and 5) of hexatopic macrocyclic ligands (H6L4 and H6L5) which encapsulate 6 metal centers in the macrocyclic cavity (Scheme ). In each hexacopper unit six copper(II) ions are arranged in a benzene-like hexagonal array within the macrocyclic ring, and the central hole in the macrocyclic cavity is filled by BO3 3- which is linked to all six copper(II) centers. The BO3 3- moiety present in the center of the macrocyclic cavity is presumably produced by the hexacopper(II) complex assisted hydrolysis of BF4 - anion. In our opinion this is a very unique reaction and is the first example in which BF4 - ion is hydrolyzed directly to BO3 3- in a single synthetic step by a copper complex under very mild conditions. A recent report suggests the hydrolysis of BF4 - to [BO2(OH)]2- in a polynuclear cobalt cluster. It is not easy to ascertain with certainty the identity of the central species. This could be the CO3 2- ion probably formed from CO2 present in the atmosphere as reported recently in lanthanide(III) clusters. These two species (BO3 3- and CO3 2-) are very similar in dimensions but differ from each other only in their charge. It is extremely difficult to figure out with certainty a charge difference of one unit in huge coordination clusters involving six metal centers, a hexa-anionic macrocyclic ligand, and several other charged species like BF4 -, CH3O-, CH3CO2 -, OH-, etc. In order to identify the central species with certainty, we planned to carry out the above reactions in the presence of Cu(ClO4)2\u22c56H2O and boric acid (H3BO3) in place of Cu(BF4)2\u22c56H2O (Scheme ) in degassed solvents under argon.

Compounds 1 and 3 crystallize in the monoclinic space group C2/c, and 2 crystallizes in the hexagonal space group R3\u0305, whereas 4 and 5 crystallize in the monoclinic crystal systems and space group P21/c. The overall molecular structures of these complexes and the stereochemistries at the copper centers have significant differences due to different numbers and different modes of coordination of the anionic species (CH3O-, ClO4 -, BF4 -, CH3CO2 -) and the solvent (H2O, C3H7NO, CH3OH) molecules. The macrocyclic ring encapsulates six metal centers in its cavity which are arranged in a distorted hexagonal ring. The BO3 3- species is present in the center of the macrocyclic cavity and is bonded to all six copper(II) centers through two sets of alternating bridges: three one-atom \u03bc1,1-O(BO3 3-) and three three-atom \u03bc1,3-O(BO3 3-) bridges. In all these complexes H6L4 and H6L5 act as hexanucleating, hexatopic [NO2 pockets], hexa-anionic, dodecadentate ligands utilizing their full potential which is a rare feature in itself.

Bluish green crystals of 2 for X-ray structural analysis were obtained by layering a solution of 2 in a mixture of DMF:EtOH (1:1) with diethyl ether in degassed solvents in a drybox under argon. The overall molecular structure of 2 is composed of two hexacopper halves linked together by six (\u03bc3-O)-Cu intermacrocycle bridges. The structure of the hexacopper monomeric cationic unit is shown in Figure , and that of the dimeric dodecacopper metallocluster is depicted in Figure a,b. The bond distances and angles relevant to the copper coordination spheres are given in  Table S3. Compound 2 crystallizes in the hexagonal space group R3\u0305 and contains a hexanuclear [Cu6(L4)(\u03bc6-BO3)(\u03bc-C3H7NO)3]3+ cationic core with trifold symmetry, a feature that is entirely different from those of all other complexes produced from these macrocyclic ligands. In 2, three identical symmetry related dicopper units are present in the form of a distorted hexagonal ring inside the macrocyclic cavity which has a boat-like conformation (Figure ). The coordination pattern of the macrocyclic ligand [hexanucleating, hexa-anionic, dodecadentate (N6O6)] and the presence of \u03bc6-BO3 3- as central species in 2 is exactly the same as seen in 1 and other hexanuclear copper(II) complexes (3-5) of these ligands, clearly indicating that the central species is BO3 3- and that it comes from H3BO3. In 2, the basic structural core (Figure ) in the equatorial plane is identical to that of 1. In the axial plane, the three bridging bidentate DMF (\u03bc-C3H7NO) molecules cause trifold bending of the macrocyclic ring. In 2 the macrocyclic cavity is occupied by a symmetrical BO3 3- moiety [O(4)-B(1)-O(4) = 120.01\u00b0 and B(1)-O(4) = 1.379 \u00c5] which is bonded to all six copper centers through two types of bridges: (1) three one-atom (\u03bc1,1-O(BO3 3-)) intradinuclear bridges linking copper(II) ions within three identical dinuclear units and (2) three three-atom (\u03bc1,3-O(BO3 3-)) interdinuclear bridges linking copper centers between dinuclear units. In each dinuclear unit the two copper ions are bridged through \u03bc-O (phenoxide) and \u03bc1,1-O(BO3 3-) bridges. The dinuclear units are bridged through three interdimer bridges: an \u03bc-O(alkoxide), a \u03bc1,3-O(BO3 3-), and a \u03bc1,1-O(DMF). The intradimer and interdimer copper-copper distances are 2.920 and 3.060 \u00c5, respectively, which are quite short and comparable to similar distances observed in doubly or triply bridged copper centers in other hexacopper complexes with these ligands. The bridging (\u03bc6-BO3 3-) pattern of the central species is exactly identical to one observed for 1.

A cationic core [Cu6(L4/L5)(\u03bc6-BO3)] n+ is present in the equatorial plane of these complexes, which differ in their molecular structures due to axial coordination with anionic/molecular species. In these complexes a central species (\u03bc6-BO3 3-) provides three \u03bc1,1-O and three \u03bc1,3-O bridges to six copper(II) ions which are held together by a single macrocyclic ligand in a unique fashion not previously reported in transition metal complexes. The central species (\u03bc6-BO3 3-) is produced in a single step by copper-macrocycle complex catalyzed hydrolysis of tetrafluoroborate ion (BF4 -), which in our opinion constitutes first report. The identity of central species as BO3 3- is established beyond any doubt from high-resolution/high-accuracy mass spectrometry measurements and by isolating complexes 2 and 4 by reacting Cu(ClO4)2/H6L4 and H6L5/HBO3/TEA/Ar, which have molecular structures similar to 1, 3, and 5 obtained using Cu(BF4)2. In the dimeric assemblies, hexacopper monomeric units are held together by relatively longer two (1 and 5), four (3 and 4), or six (2) axial intermetallocycle (\u03bc3-Cu-O) bridges from convex surfaces generating dodecacopper complexes. These complexes exhibit overall antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interactions between copper(II) centers within the macrocyclic cavity. A polymeric side product of 2 + 2 macrocyclic ligand (H4L2) with 1D single-chain structure (6) has been isolated and structurally characterized. We are in the process of carrying out similar reactions in the presence of other 3d transition metal ions and lanthanide (4f) metal ions.
