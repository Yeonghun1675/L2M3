Mn1 is coordinated by two oxygen atoms from two different L4- ligands [Mn1-O 2.152(4)-2.259(4) \u00c5], two \u03bc3-OH group oxygen atoms [Mn1-O 2.159(4)-2.172(3) \u00c5], and two H2O molecules [Mn1-O 2.212(4)-2.298(4) \u00c5]. Mn2 is ligated by four oxygen atoms coming from four independent L4- ligands and two \u03bc3-OH groups [Mn2-O 2.136(4)-2.208(4) \u00c5]. The MnII ions are bridged by \u03bc3-OH groups to form the repeating trimeric unit 1D [Mn3(OH)2] n  cluster with a metal sequence of \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Mn2\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03bc3-OH\u22c5\u22c5\u22c52Mn1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5 (Mn1-Mn1/Mn2-Mn1 = 3.29/3.68 \u00c5, Mn1-OH-Mn2 = 117.54\u00b0/116.18\u00b0, and Mn1-OH-Mn1 = 99.07\u00b0; a,c,d and S2b), the carboxylate groups of L4- adopt one bridging model (\u03b72\u03bc2\u03c72) with the center metal ions (Figure S1). Then these neighboring 1D chains are further linked by the L4- ligands in the \u03bc8 model to generate the 3D motif (b and S4b). It is worth noting that the shortest distances of Mn\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Mn between chains are greater than 6.40 \u00c5, and there exists no significant interchain hydrogen-bonding or \u03c0-\u03c0-stacking interactions (Figure S3). Topologically, the carboxylate carbon atoms in the metal carboxylate chain are commonly viewed as the nodes of extension. When the 1D [Mn3(OH)2] n  chains are simplified as rod-shaped SBUs, and the L4- ligands, acting as decussating linkers, are 4-connected nodes (Figure S4a), then the framework of 1 gives a binodal 4,6-connected fry topological net with the point symbol (510\u22c563\u22c578)(54\u22c562) (Figure S4b).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 12, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Coordination environment of Mn<sup>II</sup> ion in <bold>1</bold>.
