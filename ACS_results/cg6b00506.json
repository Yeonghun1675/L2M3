This conclusion is supported by the occurrence of this\nligand behavior in 23 out of 30 structures (compare panels A\u2013C\nwith D and E in ). This observation is also supported by the structures of similar\nbis\u00ad(pyrazolyl)\u00admethane systems functionalized with a central aromatic\nmoiety.

In most of the cases it is\ninvolved in \u03c0-stacking, as in the case of the porous hexamers\nand the molecular chains, or it participates into CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0\ninteractions. The presence of the \u03c0-stacking with one of the\npyrazole rings contributes to an additional ligand preorganization\nthat may relevant to the formation of isostructural hexameric species.\nA depiction of the various ligands arrangements is summarized in <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.cgd.6b00506/suppl_file/cg6b00506_si_001.pdf\">Figure S10</ext-link>. The substitution of the phenyl group\nwith a methyl one in L<sup>SMe</sup> limits either the supramolecular\ninteractions that can be exchanged by the ligand and it decreases\nsignificantly the steric hindrance.

When the steric hindrance is removed from the N<sub>2</sub> donor system as in L<sup>5,5\u2032Me</sup>, dinuclear complexes\ncan be formed because two AgL fragments can easily approach each other\n(see panel D in ). Furthermore, when a less symmetric steric hindrance occurs, as\nwith L<sup>5,3\u2032Me</sup>, and L<sup>CF3</sup>, it is more difficult\nto rationalize the structural outcome. In fact, CPs having the shape\nof helicoidal chains can be formed, as well as AgL<sub>2</sub> complexes,\neven though the synthesis was performed in the 1:1 M:L ratio (panel\nE of ).

The presence of a N<sub>2</sub>S donor\nligand and the oxygen atom of the triflate anion tend to satisfy the\nrequirement of Ag\u00ad(I). In the presence of weakly coordinating anions\nsuch as BF<sub>4</sub>\n<sup>\u2013</sup> or PF<sub>6</sub>\n<sup>\u2013</sup>, however, the metal tends to satisfy its electronic requirements\nby binding to two N<sub>2</sub> systems and providing more varied\nmolecular geometry, whose structural arrangements are driven by the\naforementioned steric effect described in points (1)\u2013(3).
