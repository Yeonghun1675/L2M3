Two-probe electrical conductivity measurement on a powder sample, contacted with gold paint, shows an ohmic behavior in the voltage of -1 to 1 V (). The conductivity (\u03c3) is 7 \u00d7 10-6 S/cm for 1\u22c52.7I2 which is higher than the 10-6 to 10-8 S/m found for the iodine-loaded single crystal of tris(o-phenylenedioxy) cyclotriphosphazene but much less than that of the single crystal of the iodine-loaded Zn analogue of 3 \u00d7 10-3 (\u03c3\u2225) and 1 \u00d7 10-4 (\u03c3\u22a5) S/cm. \n\nFor 1b\u22c5I- \u22c52H2O\u22c51.5DMSO, \u03c7m T is only 6.48 cm3 mol-1 K at 300 K (Figure ). On lowering temperature it is decreased to 5.22 cm3 mol-1 K at 30 K before reaching a maximum of 16.11 cm3 mol-1 K at 7.0 K. The Curie-Weiss fit of the high-temperature data gives a negative \u03b8 of -6(1) K and C = 6.91 cm3 mol-1 K. Both the ac susceptibilities show a peak at ca. 7 K which is independent of frequency suggesting long-range ordering. The isothermal magnetization at 2 K increases gradually with field without saturation at 5 T and shows a small hysteresis of 340 Oe and remanant magnetization of 0.334 \u03bcB (). The maximum magnetization value is 4.65 \u03bcB, which is close to that expected for two Co(II) ions of 4.6 \u03bcB. These characteristics suggest a ferromagnetic ground state, which according to the discussion above consist of parallel octahedral Co1 moments. The low Curie temperature is consistent with the weaker exchange interaction between Co1 within the squares and even weaker Co1-Co1 between squares via the oxidized diamagnetic Co2.", "data":
