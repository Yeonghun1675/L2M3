The data are independent of the field value between 70 and 300 K but dependent on field below 70 K, with a broad maximum of 33 cm3 mol-1 K, at 50 K, found in the 1 T field, becoming sharper and higher in value, 111 cm3 mol-1 K, at 5 K, in the 0.0087 T field. Such behavior is indicative of a combination of Zeeman level thermal depopulation effects combined with either magnetic coupling or magnetic order. For compound 1, a \u03c7M T of 8.22 cm3 mol-1 K, per Fe2, at 300 K was observed, which is a little lower than that predicted for the uncoupled \"two Fe site\" formulation (NBu4)4[FeIIFeIII 3(fanII-)3(fanIII-)3] (vide supra) containing 1/2[HS FeII, HS FeIII \u00d7 3 and S = 1/2 (fanIII-) \u00d7 3] of 8.62 cm3 mol-1 K, per Fe2. The 300 K \u03c7M T value observed for (NBu4)2[Fe2(dhbq)3] was 11.11 cm3 mol-1 K, significantly higher than in 1. It showed a similar plot to that of 1, in a 0.1 T field, with a sharp maximum of 150 cm3 mol-1 K at ~10 K, thus behaving, overall in a similar fashion to 1. However, it was formulated as (NBu4)2[FeIII 2(dhbqII-)(dhbqIII-)2], which would give a predicted \u03c7M T of 9.5 cm3 mol-1 K, per Fe2, at 300 K assuming zero/very weak coupling at this temperature. Likewise, an even higher \u03c7M T of 16.6 cm3 mol-1 K, per Fe2, was reported, at 300 K, for (Me2NH2)2 [FeIII 2(canII-)(canIII-)2]\u22c52H2O\u22c56DMF and ascribed to long-range strong magnetic coupling. Interestingly, it decreased to 9.37 cm3 mol-1 K, at 300 K, for the desolvated species. \n\nMagnetization isotherms were measured on 1 to help delineate the type of magnetic order (; inset). They show close to saturation behavior at 2 K, above H ~ 4 T, with M ~ 7.3 N\u03b2. This is well below the ~11 N\u03b2 expected for S = 11/2, per Fe2, using the (NBu4)4[FeIIFeIII 3(fanII-)3(fanIII-)3] formulation (see above) and a little lower than 8 N\u03b2 expected for a S = 4 ground state (S = 5/2 + 5/2-1/2-1/2 = 8/2) if antiferrimagnetic coupling was occurring in a (NBu4)2[FeIII 2(dhbqII-)(dhbqIII-)2] type formulation. Interestingly, the dhbq compound also showed M sat of 7.2 N\u03b2. The solvated chloranilate analog reached M = 8.2 N\u03b2 in H = 7 T at 1.8 K, close to the S = 4 ground state value, and showed hysteresis with a much bigger coercive field of 2630 Oe, at 1.8 K. The coercive field increased to 4650 Oe for the desolvated chloranilate.\n\nConductivity measurements have unambiguously indicated that 1 is a semiconductor; however, the conductivity at room temperature (5.5 \u00d7 10-3 S/cm) is significantly less than that found for (NBu4)2[FeIII 2(dhbq)3].

The fast-relaxing iron(III) (\u25a1) is a quadrupole doublet consistent with high-spin iron(III), and intermediate relaxation is observed as a broad singlet (\u25b3). Both of these species converts into the slow-relaxing subspectrum. Spectra are presented in Figure  , and parameters are given in Table  .
