Zn1 atom links three Pycia3-, one \u03bc3-OH, and one DMF in a distorted trigonal bipyramid coordination geometry. Zn2 also centers into a distorted trigonal bipyramid geometry by connecting one hydroxyl, three carboxylate oxygen atoms from three Pycia3-, and one nitrogen atom from one Pycia3- (Figure S1). Further linking four Zn2+ (two Zn1 and two Zn2) by two \u03bc3-OH forms a classical tetranuclear cluster [Zn4(\u03bc3-OH)2]6+ (a). The completely deprotonated Pycia3- (b), each behaving like a three-connected ligand, links three tetranuclear cluster [Zn4(\u03bc3-OH)2]6+ (Figure S2), and six Pycia3- assemble through sharing six [Zn4(\u03bc3-OH)2]6+ cluster vertexes to form a microporous octahedral cage Zn24(\u03bc3-OH)12(Pycia3-)6(DMF)6 (D max = 18.5 \u00c5) (c), in which six faces are occupied by Pycia3- and the other two by DMF molecules. Furthermore, each octahedron is linked with six neighboring octahedrons by sharing a [Zn4(\u03bc3-OH)2]6+ vertex to form an extended 3D noninterpenetrated cage-stacking framework (d). Viewing along the crystallographic c axis, one 1D channel with coordinated DMF molecules on the wall (e) can be observed. The total accessible volume is 8488.8 \u00c53 per unit cell, which is about 54% of the total crystal volume (15755 \u00c53 per unit cell) as calculated by PLATON. Topologically, regarding [Zn4(\u03bc3-OH)2]6+ tetranuclear as 6-connected nodes with vertex symbols 4.4.4.4.62.62.82.82.82.82.84.84.108.108.1016 and Pycia3- as 3-connected nodes with vertex symbols 4.4.62 transforms the framework into a new binodal net of (3,6)-connected topology with a Schla\u0308fli symbol of (42.6)2(44.62.86.103) (Figure S3).\n\nThe as-synthesized NKU-108 sample exhibits high thermal stability as well as crystal purity as demonstrated by good agreement of the experimental powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern with the simulated one (Figures S4 and S5). The activation of the NKU-108 sample for gas adsorption measurement was carried out as follows: The sample was soaked in ethanol for 72 h and then filtered and activated under high vacuum (less than 10-5 Torr) at 110 \u00b0C. The porous structure of NK-108 was characterized by N2 sorption isotherm measured at 77 K, which demonstrates a typical Type-I characteristic (a) and gives a predicted Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Langmuir surface areas of 982 and 1295 m2/g, respectively. The pore distribution analysis by the H-K (Horvath-Kawazoe) method shows a main distribution in the range of 0.8-1.5 nm (a (inset)). The CO2 and N2 adsorption isotherms of NKU-108 were measured at both 273 and 298 K (b and Figure S11), with CO2 uptakes at 1 atm of 104.23 cm3/g at 273 K and 53.85 cm3/g at 298 K. These values are much higher than that of some classical MOFs such as HKUST-1 (78.2 cm3/g, 273 K), MOF-5 (33.6 cm3/g at 273 K and 22.8 cm3/g at 298 K), ZIF-100 (32.6 cm3/g, 273 K), UIO-67 (22.9 cm3/g, 298 K), and MOF-177 (17.2 cm3/g, 298 K). The relatively high adsorption capacity of NKU-108 with respect to CO2 may be ascribed to the strong interaction of CO2 with active sites such as the free Zn(II) sites derived from the removal of coordinated solvents and the polar acylamide groups abound on the pore wall, which was supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculation (Figures S12-S13). To evaluate the interactions between CO2 molecules and framework, the CO2 isosteric enthalpy (Q st) of NKU-108 was predicted by using a viral method based on the adsorption isotherms collected at 273 and 298 K (c). The Q st value of 22.81 kJ mol-1 at zero loading is comparable to that of other complexes showing relatively high CO2 uptakes (d). \n\nLight hydrocarbons are important raw chemicals in modern industry. In recent years, the storage of the small hydrocarbons (CH4, C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6) promises new energy alternatives and has attracted increasing attention. Herein, the potential of NKU-108 for small hydrocarbons adsorption was also investigated. The adsorption isotherms of these small hydrocarbons were measured at 273 and 298 K under 1 bar (Figure S14), and the maximum uptakes at 273 and 298 K and 1 atm reach 24.95 and 14.26 cm3/g for CH4, 136.70 and 87.16 cm3/g for C2H2, 112.40 and 76.18 cm3/g for C2H4, and 110.07 and 80.53 cm3/g for C2H6, respectively. The adsorption selectivities for CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 of NKU-108 have also been evaluated (Figure S15). Notably, the PXRD pattern of the sample after gas adsorption still agrees well with the simulated one, indicating the high stability of the NKU-108 framework sufficient to survive through gas adsorption and desorption processes.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "NKU-108", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "crystal system": [{"value": "trigonal", "condition": ""}], "space group":
