The structure model shows that the uranium-centered hexagonal bipyramids are linked to each other through all of the carboxylate arms of the mellitate molecule around the hexagonal axis of its benzene ring. Each carboxylate group adopts a chelating connection mode with uranium, occupying a trans position in the hexagonal equatorial plane of the coordination polyhedron.

Four of these oxygen atoms are\nshared with carboxylate groups of the mellitate linkers. The remaining\noxygen atom (O1H), which has a shorter U\u2013O distance (\u223c2.25\n\u00c5), is bridging a lanthanide center (Ce or Nd) and corresponds\nto a \u03bc<sub>2</sub>-hydroxo group (in agreement with bond valence\nsummations, with values of 1.18 for <bold>4</bold> and 1.16 for <bold>5</bold>).

An increase of the U\ue5fbO\nbond length was usually observed up to \u223c+0.05 \u00c5 for this specific configuration. It is slightly\nhigher than that of the mixed U\ue5fbO\u2013Ln bonding in <bold>4</bold> and <bold>5</bold>.

The two cationic\ncenters are also linked through two carboxylate arms of two distinct\nmellitate molecules. To our knowledge, no such hetero metallic bonding\ninvolving 4f\u20135f elements was previously reported in the literature\nrelated to extended coordination polymers, involving O-donor ligands.\nHowever, a very recent contribution of Arnold and co-workers has shown\nsuch cation\u2013cation interaction between pentavalent uranyl and\ntrivalent samarium or yttrium elements by using N-donor macrocycle\nmolecules favoring the formation of molecular bimetallic species.

Whereas the bidentate carboxylate arms are located\nalong the (<italic toggle=\"yes\">b</italic>,<italic toggle=\"yes\">c</italic>) plane, the monodentate\ncarboxylate ones are twisted, and the remaining nonbonded carboxyl\noxygen atoms are pointed upward or downward the (<italic toggle=\"yes\">b</italic>,<italic toggle=\"yes\">c</italic>) layer. The latter are connected to a second\nuranyl moiety (U2), located on the special position <italic toggle=\"yes\">4a</italic> (inversion center). This uranium U2 is 6-fold coordinated in a square\nbipyramidal environment. Besides the two terminal uranyl oxygen atoms\nfound at 1.756(4) \u00c5 (<bold>4</bold>) and 1.763(5) \u00c5 (<bold>5</bold>) from the uranium atom U2, four other oxygen atoms are engaged\nwith the non bonded carboxylate arm of the mellitate and perpendicularly\nplaced in a square plane with U\u2013O distances of 2.365(3) and\n2.384(3) \u00c5, and 2.363(4) and 2.378(4) \u00c5, for <bold>4</bold> and <bold>5</bold>, respectively. The existence of such a 6-fold\nsurrounding for uranyl cation is the second original structural characteristic\nfor this structure. In most of the structures, uranium\u00ad(VI) is found\nin 7- or 8-fold surrounding, with either pentagonal or hexagonal plane\nperpendicularly to the double uranyl bonds. For instance, Burns reported\nsome examples of purely inorganic compounds in which such an isolated square bipyramidal surrounding occurs\nfor uranyl, but it is rarely reported in coordination complexes. This discrete (UO<sub>2</sub>)\u00adO<sub>4</sub> unit plays the role of pillar between the mixed layers\ncontaining mellitates and heterometallic dimers and ensures the three-dimensional\ncharacter of the structure (Figure ).

A series of solids Ln2(H2O)6(mel) (Ln = Ce, Nd), with a known structural type (previously reported with La, Nd, Ho), has been synthesized and consists of isolated tricapped trigonal prismastic polyhedra, LnO6(H2O)3, engaged with the octadendate mellitate anions in a three-dimensional framework. A uranyl mellitate, (UO2)3(H2O)6(mel)\u22c511.5H2O, has also been isolated and exhibits a layered structure containing 8-fold coordinated uranium atoms connected to each other through the organic linkers, to generate a 36 net. Water molecules are intercalated between the mixed organic-inorganic sheets. This compound is a new example of actinide mellitate because only neptunium-based solids have been identified so far. A third type of compounds also crystallizes under this hydrothermal condition and concerns a distinct architecture, (UO2)2Ln(OH)(H2O)3(mel)\u22c52.5H2O (Ln = Ce, Nd), involving both cations 4f and 5f. They can be obtained as pure phases with the addition of the inorganic base NaOH (molar NaOH/U = 1.2), for instance. The rare-earth atom is still 9-fold coordinated (LnO5(OH)(H2O)3), but linked to a neighboring 7-fold coordinated uranyl cation (UO2)O4(OH) via \u03bc2-hydroxo and \u03bc2-oxo bridges. The latter anion belongs to the typical short uranyl bonding. The layers generated from the connection of heterometallic dinuclear units with mellitate ligands are further linked to each other via isolated (UO2)O4 square bipyramidal motifs to form the three-dimensional structure. Indeed, these mixed uranyl-lanthanide mellitates exhibit new structural features. This is a unique case of heterometallic bonding between uranyl and lanthanide elements, which corresponds to a novel illustration of the cation-cation interaction. This type of \u03bc2-oxo bridge has been rarely reported in pure uranyl-based compounds, because the usual terminal \"yl\" oxygen is quite chemically inert for further condensation processes with other metallic centers. A second \u03bc2-hydroxo linkage is also observed between the two metals 4f and 5f, and this has not been previously reported in other coordination complexes. The rare-earth and uranyl cations are generally associated through the connection of different organic ligands, with assemblies involving covalent bondings and/or hydrogen-bond interactions. No direct U\ue5fbO-Ln bonding is reported in coordination complexes with hexavalent uranyl. Yet, a case of a molecular biheterometallic U\ue5fbO-Sm (or Y) species stabilized N-donor macrocycles recently was discovered by Arnold et al. and involved pentavalent uranium. Nevertheless, such a linkage was, for instance, described in the natural mineral Bijvoetite, for which the 8-fold coordinated uranyl polyhedra share a common \u03bc2-oxo edge with the 8-fold coordinated lanthanide polyhedra in a carbonate-based layer. The thermal degradation of the mixed Ln-U mellitates led to the formation of a mixture of basic uranium oxide (U3O8) and mixed Ln-U oxide \"(Ln,U)O2\" crystallizing with the fluorite structural type.
