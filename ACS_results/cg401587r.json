The studies were carried out under a flow of air (flow rate = 20 mL min-1) in the temperature range of 30-850 \u00b0C (heating rate = 5 \u00b0C min-1) (). Compound I shows four distinct weight loss regions in the TGA curve. The first sharp weight loss of ~15% in the temperature range 50-150 \u00b0C correspond to the loss of three DMF molecules. The second gradual weight loss of ~10.3% in the temperature range of 150-350 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of two DMF molecules. The third sharp weight loss of ~54.8% in the temperature range 350-390 \u00b0C may correspond to the destruction of the framework with the loss of SDBA2-, water, and H3O+. The fourth weight loss of ~4.1% was very broad. Compound II also shows four weight loss regions in the TGA curve. The first weight loss of ~12% in the temperature range 95-160 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of five DMF molecules. The second gradual weight loss of ~7.4% in the temperature range 160-270 \u00b0C correspond to the loss of three DMF molecules. The third weight loss of ~4.9% in the temperature range 270-390 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of water and H3O+. The fourth weight loss of 56.1% in the temperature range 390-670 \u00b0C may correspond to the final destruction of the framework with the loss of the SDBA2- ions. The final products of TGA analysis in both the compounds were found to be Mn2O3 (JCPDS: 89-4836) and Mn3O4 (JCPDS: 24-0734). The stabilities of the compounds were also investigated employing the TGA and PXRD studies to probe the changes that accompany the desolvation and resolvation of the guest melecules. To this end, the as-synthesized compounds were desolvated by heating them at 130 \u00b0C (I) and 155 \u00b0C (II) for 4 h and then resolvated by immersing in DMF/ethanol solvent mixtures at 80 \u00b0C. TGA studies on the desolvated compounds did not exhibit any initial weight losses observed during the TGA studies of the as-synthesized compounds (). The weight losses observed on the desolvated compounds were comparable (~80%), which suggests that the compounds lose only the organic ligands. TGA studies of the resolvated I and II exhibit a behavior reminiscent of the as-synthesized compounds.

To this end, the as-synthesized compounds were desolvated by heating them at 130 \u00b0C (I) and 155 \u00b0C (II) for 4 h and then resolvated by immersing in DMF/ethanol solvent mixtures at 80 \u00b0C. TGA studies on the desolvated compounds did not exhibit any initial weight losses observed during the TGA studies of the as-synthesized compounds (). The weight losses observed on the desolvated compounds were comparable (~80%), which suggests that the compounds lose only the organic ligands. TGA studies of the resolvated I and II exhibit a behavior reminiscent of the as-synthesized compounds. This study suggests that the compounds on heating at 130 \u00b0C (I) and at 155 \u00b0C (II) retain the parent crystal structure. PXRD patterns of the desolvated I and II show reasonable framework stability with partial loss of crystallinity, and the compounds appear to regain their crystallinity during the resolvation step ().\n\nTo this end, a preheated sample of I (130 \u00b0C, 4 h) and II (155 \u00b0C, 4 h) was employed and the water adsorption isotherms were measured at 298K. Both the compounds exhibited a slow but gradual uptake of water reaching a value of 160 mL/g (equivalent to 8 mol H2O/mol of I) and 200 mL/g (equivalent to 19 mol H2O/mol of II) at p/p o = 0.9 (Figure ). The water adsorption isotherm was completed over a period of 30 h. The discrepancy in the uptake values between the cyclic TGA studies and water adsorption isotherms for both the compounds could be due to the longer duration of exposure to the saturated water vapor. Both the compounds exhibited a hysteresis in the adsorption-desorption cycle, which suggest that the water molecules are strongly adsorbed in the one-dimensional channels.\n\nMagnetic Studies\n\nMagnetic studies were carried out in the temperature range 5-300K using a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design Inc., USA) (Figures , ). The studies indicate that the overall magnetic behavior is antiferromagnetic. The room temperature values of \u03c7m T per Mn3 units in I and Mn3.5 units in II were found to be 18.6 and 16.4 emu mol-1 K, respectively. These values are larger than the expected spin-only values of 13.1 and 15.3 emu mol-1 K, respectively, for the magnetically isolated high spin Mn2+ ions (S = 5/2), indicating strong magnetic interactions between the Mn2+ ions. The field-cooled (FC) and zero-field cooled (ZFC) susceptibilities did not exhibit any clear divergence even at low temperatures, indicating the absence of any long-range magnetic correlations between the Mn centers. From a fit of the magnetic susceptibility values in the high temperature region (75-300 \u00b0C) for the Curie-Weiss law, \u03b8p values of -107.1 K and -54.1 K, were obtained for I and II, respectively. The high \u03b8p values suggest that the Mn2+ ions interact antiferromagnetically. Although both the compounds have clusters of Mn2+ ions, we did not observe any signatures suggestive of a single molecule magnetic behavior in I and II. The large separation of the magnetic clusters (Mn6 and Mn7) coupled with the isotropic nature of the spins of Mn2+ ions (d5) under an octahedral field could have contributed to the observed antiferromagnetic behavior in I and II.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "Compound I", "symbol": "I", "chemical formula": "[H3O]2[Mn7(\u03bc3-OH)4(C14H8O6S)6(H2O)4](H2O)2(DMF)8"}, "decomposition
