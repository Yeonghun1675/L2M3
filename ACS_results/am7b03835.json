The guest-free framework [Co2(tzpa)(\u03bc3-OH)] (1a) was obtained by heating the MeOH-exchanged sample of 1 at 220 \u00b0C under vacuum. The removal of water ligands and DMF solvent molecules in 1a was evidenced by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with the absence of both characteristic C\ue5fbO vibration of DMF and weight loss before 300 \u00b0C (Figure S3). 1a shows a thermal plateau before 300 \u00b0C. Although the PXRD pattern of 1a is slightly amorphous, the fully restored diffraction peaks of 1a immersed in DMF corroborate the framework integrity of 1a (Figure S4).\n\nGas Sorption\n\nThe removal of water ligands in Co2+ ions produces the highly polar channels decorated by OMSs, \u03bc3-OH groups, and uncoordinated carboxylate O atoms in 1a, which inspires us to estimate the porosity by gas adsorptions of N2 and H2 at 77 K, CO2, CH4, and CO at 195 K. 1a exhibits similar type-I microporous isotherms for five gases and has the highest uptake for CO2 (154 cm3 (STP) g-1 at 100 kPa; a), from which a BET surface area of 455 m2 g-1 (Langmuir surface area 532 m2 g-1) is obtained. According to Horvath-Kawazoe model, the pore size distribution curve based on N2 adsorption isotherm at 77 K shows the main size range of 4.1-7.1 \u00c5 (Figure S5), agreeing with that of the crystal structure.\n\nAt 298 K and 100 kPa, 1a shows low CH4 uptake (15.6 cm3 (STP) g-1, 1.2 wt %) and very little CO uptake (7.9 cm3 (STP) g-1, 1.0 wt %) but a high CO2 loading of 63.8 cm3 (STP) g-1 (12.5 wt %) (b-d). This CO2 amount is moderately high compared to the highest value of 9.1% in ZIF-78 in zinc imidazolate frameworks and greatly outperforms the values reported in some Zn4O-based nanoporous MOFs (3.4-7.3 wt %). The significant CO2 uptake in 1a is attributed to the existence of accessible OMSs, \u03bc3-OH groups, and uncoordinated carboxylate O sites, which can generate strong affinity toward CO2.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "1", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "[Co2(tzpa)(\u03bc3-OH)]"}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "30 to 280", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "release of DMF guests and coordinated water molecules", "condition": ""}, {"value": "300", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "removal of water ligands and DMF solvent molecules", "condition": ""}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "", "unit": "", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "H2", "adsorbed amount": "", "unit": "", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "154", "unit": "cm3 (STP) g-1", "temperature": "195 K", "pressure": "100 kPa", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "CH4", "adsorbed amount": "15.6", "unit": "cm3 (STP) g-1", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "100 kPa", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "CO", "adsorbed amount": "7.9", "unit": "cm3 (STP) g-1", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "100 kPa", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "63.8", "unit": "cm3 (STP) g-1", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "100 kPa", "condition": ""}], "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "455", "unit": "m2 g-1", "condition": ""}, {"type": "Langmuir", "probe": "", "value": "532", "unit": "m2 g-1", "condition": ""}], "pore diameter": [{"value": "4.1-7.1", "unit": "\u00c5", "condition": "Horvath-Kawazoe model"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["decomposition_temperature", "gas_adsorption", "surface_area", "pore_diameter"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['decomposition_temperature', 'gas_adsorption', 'surface_area', 'pore_diameter']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n  {\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"name\": \"1\",\n      \"symbol\": \"1\",\n      \"chemical formula\": \"[Co2(tzpa)(\u03bc3-OH)]\"\n    },\n    \"decomposition temperature\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"30 to 280\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"release of DMF guests and coordinated water molecules\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"value\": \"300\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"removal of water ligands and DMF solvent molecules\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"gas adsorption\": [\n      {\n        \"adsorbate\": \"N2\",\n        \"adsorbed amount\": \"\",\n        \"unit\": \"\",\n        \"temperature\": \"77 K\",\n        \"pressure\": \"\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"adsorbate\": \"H2\",\n        \"adsorbed amount\": \"\",\n        \"unit\": \"\",\n        \"temperature\": \"77 K\",\n        \"pressure\": \"\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"adsorbate\": \"CO2\",\n        \"adsorbed amount\": \"154\",\n        \"unit\": \"cm3 (STP) g-1\",\n        \"temperature\": \"195 K\",\n        \"pressure\": \"100 kPa\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"adsorbate\": \"CH4\",\n        \"adsorbed amount\": \"15.6\",\n        \"unit\": \"cm3 (STP) g-1\",\n        \"temperature\": \"298 K\",\n        \"pressure\": \"100 kPa\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"adsorbate\": \"CO\",\n        \"adsorbed amount\": \"7.9\",\n        \"unit\": \"cm3 (STP) g-1\",\n        \"temperature\": \"298 K\",\n        \"pressure\": \"100 kPa\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"adsorbate\": \"CO2\",\n        \"adsorbed amount\": \"63.8\",\n        \"unit\": \"cm3 (STP) g-1\",\n        \"temperature\": \"298 K\",\n        \"pressure\": \"100 kPa\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"surface area\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"BET\",\n        \"probe\": \"\",\n        \"value\": \"455\",\n        \"unit\": \"m2 g-1\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"Langmuir\",\n        \"probe\": \"\",\n        \"value\": \"532\",\n        \"unit\": \"m2 g-1\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"pore diameter\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"4.1-7.1\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00c5\",\n        \"condition\": \"Horvath-Kawazoe model\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 27, "type": "table", "classification": null, "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Cycloaddition of CO<sub>2</sub> and Epoxide\nunder Various Reaction Conditions<xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"tbl1-fn1\"></xref>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"fx1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"am-2017-038355_0010.tif\"></graphic>\n<table-wrap-foot>\n<fn id=\"tbl1-fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>The same reaction conditions: epoxide, 20 mmol;
