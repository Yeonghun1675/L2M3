The CO2 adsorption isotherm of 1 remains unchanged following exposure to a flow of humid CO2 for 24 h (see ). CO2 on/off cycling experiment was carried out on the ASAP2020HD adsorption instrument. During this, the sample was subjected to a pressure swing from 1.18 to 0.02 bar with each the sorption-desorption cycle lasting for 40 min. As can be seen from c, the amount of CO2 adsorbed remains constant and the cycling happens smoothly. This parallels the large diffusion coefficients (D c) for CO2 within the pores of the MOF (d). The average D c of 1 over a range of CO2 loadings was found to be 6.04 \u00d7 10-9 m2 s-1, which is higher than that found in other MOFs with much larger pores such as MOF-5 (1.17 \u00d7 10-9 m2 s-1) or MOF-177 (1.17 \u00d7 10-9 m2 s-1). Most notably, the D c is more than 2 orders of magnitude higher than zeolite 13X, the currently used commercial PSA sorbent, suggesting that ultramicroporous MOFs can be well-suited for gas separations.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 13, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig4\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) PXRD pattern and (b) comparison of\nCO<sub>2</sub> adsorption\nisotherms of <bold>1</bold> to show moisture stability and scalability.\n(c) CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption\u2013desorption cycles at 30 \u00b0C.\n(d) CO<sub>2</sub> self-diffusion coefficients from kinetics measurement.\nValues for IISERP-MOF<bold>1</bold> is taken from ref <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref10\" specific-use=\"ref-style=base-text\"></xref>.
