The simulated (derived from the single crystal structure of 1 and 2, vide infra) and experimental powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were consistent (Figure S1, ), confirming that 1 and 2 can be obtained as pure phases (as also evidenced by elemental analysis and SEM; Figure S2, ). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of 1 revealed multiple weight losses in the range of 315-500 \u00b0C, corresponding to its decomposition (Figure S4; ). In 2, the TGA profile indicates a weight loss of 17.5% (from 25 to 150 \u00b0C), which we attributed to the loss of the six guest and terminal coordinated H2O molecules (calculated: 17.2%; Figure b). Decomposition of 2 starts at 300 \u00b0C, probably immediately after the loss of the remaining \u03bc-H2O molecule (essential to maintain the dinuclear cluster, vide infra) and occurs in a single step, forming CoO.\n\nThe use of the tetracarboxylate BTeC4- linkers was found to be prolific for the expansion of 2 in three dimensions, as each BTeC4- links four neighboring chains (one from each carboxylate site) (Figure c; Figure S6, ).
