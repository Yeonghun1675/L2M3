The permanent porosity of JXNU-1 was established by measuring CO2 sorption isotherms (a).

The C3H8 uptake is higher than that of the recently reported Zn-pyrazole-adenine framework (88 cm3 g-1 at 273 K). It is interesting that the C3H8 and C2H6 isotherms at 273 K exhibit an abrupt increase at P/P 0 = 0.51 and 0.47, respectively.
