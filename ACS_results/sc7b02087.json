Among all other NACs, PA shows significantly high quenching efficiency, with the quenching constant for 2' being almost double that for 1'. Experimental and mechanistic studies reveal that PET and RET, along with better interactions between PA and azo group in the linker, as evidenced through formation of a co-crystal between PA and azp co-ligand (azp-PA), are responsible for such a high fluorescence quenching in the former. The MOFs described herein truly manifest potential materials for sustainability, where excellent CO2 adsorption selectivity with multiple adsorption-desorption cycles in the presence of moisture imply their practical utility, while the extremely low limit of detection for PA allows for highly sensitive in-field detection of PA in aquatic systems.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 31, "type": "text", "classification": ["synthesis condition"], "content": "<title>Experimental Section</title><title>Synthesis of {[Zn<sub>2</sub>(<bold>\n<italic>L</italic>\n</bold>)<sub>2</sub>(<italic>bpy</italic>)]\u00b7(DMF)\u00b7(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>}<sub>\n<italic>n</italic>\n</sub> (<bold>1</bold>)</title><p>A mixture of Zn\u00ad(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\u00b76H<sub>2</sub>O\n(44 mg; 0.148 mmol), 5-amino\u00adisophthalic acid (13.4 mg; 0.074\nmmol), and 4,4\u2032-bipyridine (<italic>bpy</italic>) (11.6 mg;\n0.074 mmol) was dissolved in a DMF/H<sub>2</sub>O (3:1 v/v) in a Teflon-lined\nautoclave and heated under autogenous pressure at 90 \u00b0C for 72\nh.

Time-variable PXRD pattern of 1 up to 10 days of water vapor exposure showed no observable change in the peak positions (a), corroborating the moisture stability of this framework. However, 2 indicated broadening of peaks since tenth day followed by loss of crystallinity in day 12 (b).\n\nGiven the importance to develop porous materials for CO2 uptake, we explored the CO2 (kinetic diameter = 3.3 \u00c5) adsorption potential of the activated frameworks at different temperatures, up to 1 bar pressure. Quite in contrast to the N2 adsorption, both 1' and 2' exhibit a typical type-I isotherm, suggesting microporous nature of the frameworks. Adsorption and desorption curves display no hysteresis, and show a rapid uptake of CO2 until the full range of pressure. As depicted in a,3b, the CO2 adsorption capacities of 1' and 2' at 273 K are 2.4 and 3.6 mmol/g respectively, while those values at 298 K amounted to be 1.9 and 2.7 mmol/g, respectively (Figure S11).\n\nHowever, framework 3' shows only negligible CO2 uptake with pronounced hysteresis both at 273 K (1.1 mmol/g) and 298 K (0.7 mmol/g) (Figure S12), owing to its poor stability. The CO2 uptake values for 1' and 2' are comparable with those of recently reported frameworks, and much higher than that of pillar-layer structures with differently substituted isophthalic acid.
