Unlike diffusion-driven guest uptake by most common porous networks, our crystalline molecular flask can capture the guests through host-guest interactions (donor-acceptor stacking, H-bonding, etc.). These unique features of the crystalline flasks make possible (1) stoichiometric guest inclusion into crystals without guest disorder, (2) regio- and stereocontrolled transformations with high conversion, (3) X-ray observation of the reaction, and hence, (4) understanding the mechanistic insights of the reaction based on X-ray analysis. Further research into developing new regio- and stereocontrolled reactions in the pores, coupled with in situ crystallography, is now in progress.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 20, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Experimental procedures and physical properties of the compounds, including crystal structural data (CIF).
