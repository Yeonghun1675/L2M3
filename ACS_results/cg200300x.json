For example, the chloride environment of 1a consists of four copper centers having irregular Cu-Cl distances (Cu7-Cl 3.323 \u00c5\u0301 and Cu9-Cl 3.493 \u00c5\u0301) and very unusual Cu-Cl-Cu' angles (Figure e). The large bond distances of Cu-Cl reveal that Cu7 and Cu9 are basically not bonded to Cl1; in other word, Cl1 just acts as a bidentate linker in 1a. Interestingly, the above observed results are consistent with the idea that the coordination modes of Cl1 do not affect the whole construction of the MOFs and just strengthen the construction of the MOFs rather than acting as bridging linker. No distinctive difference between 1b and 1c was observed, indicating that 1b is stable at low temperature (~ 273 K). After exposure to air at room temperature, 1b (1c) loses two unstable guest water molecules to convert to 1d, and all the bond distances for them are in the normal range (Figure f,g). For the Br complex, we can only catch two relatively stable 2a and 2b, which may be because the above-mentioned first step for the Br complex is too quick to catch. It is obviously to see 2a losing two unstable guest water molecules to convert to 2b, and it is worth noticing that all of the above crystal data and mentioned phenomena have good repeatability.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 19, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig3\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Photos of (a) fresh crystal sample of <bold>1a</bold>, (b) crystal sample of <bold>1b</bold> (obtained from <bold>1a</bold> placed at 88 K for 5 h), (c) crystal sample of <bold>1c</bold> (obtained from <bold>1b</bold> placed at \u223c273 K for 2 weeks), and (d) crystal sample of <bold>1d</bold> (obtained from <bold>1c</bold> placed at 298 K for 1 week) and The coordination environments of Cl1 in (e) <bold>1a</bold>, (f) <bold>1b</bold> and <bold>1c</bold>, and (f) <bold>1d</bold>.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr5\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"cg-2011-00300x_0004.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 3  Photos of (a) fresh crystal sample of 1a, (b) crystal sample of 1b (obtained from 1a placed at 88 K for 5 h), (c) crystal sample of 1c (obtained from 1b placed at ~273 K for 2 weeks), and (d) crystal sample of 1d (obtained from 1c placed at 298 K for 1 week) and The coordination environments of Cl1 in (e) 1a, (f) 1b and 1c, and (f) 1d.

The result of the TGA study shows that a small quantity of weight loss between 25 and 386 \u00b0C for 1b and 2a corresponds to the loss of guest molecules. Then these two complexes decompose at a decomposition point T onset of 394 and 386 \u00b0C, respectively, indicating that they have high thermal stability, which is one desirable quality of porous metal-organic frameworks for gas storage applications. However, N2 sorption experiments for 1d and 2b showed that only surface adsorption occurred, due to the amino groups on the benzene ring projecting into the channels and suppressing the sorption of N2.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "1b", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "25 to 386", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "loss of guest molecules", "condition": ""}, {"value": "394", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "decomposition point", "condition": "T onset"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "2a", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "25 to 386", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "loss of guest molecules", "condition": ""}, {"value": "386", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "decomposition point", "condition": "T onset"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["decomposition_temperature"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['decomposition_temperature']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"\",\n            \"symbol\": \"1b\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"decomposition temperature\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"25 to 386\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"loss of guest molecules\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"394\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"decomposition point\",\n                \"condition\": \"T onset\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"\",\n            \"symbol\": \"2a\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"decomposition temperature\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"25 to 386\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"loss of guest molecules\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"386\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"decomposition point\",\n                \"condition\": \"T onset\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 6, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>The Ligands L1\u2013L4 Involved in the Reactions</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"cg-2011-00300x_0008.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  The Ligands L1-L4 Involved in the Reactions   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 13, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Possible Mechanism for the Ligand Transformation<xref rid=\"sch2-fn1\"></xref>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"cg-2011-00300x_0001.tif\"></graphic>\n<p>\n<fn id=\"sch2-fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>M<sub>1</sub>\u2013M<sub>4</sub> are proposed intermediates, and M<sub>5</sub> is the final product.</p>\n</fn>\n</p>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 2  Possible Mechanism for the Ligand Transformation      a M1-M4 are proposed intermediates, and M5 is the final product.
