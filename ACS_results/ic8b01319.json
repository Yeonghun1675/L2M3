Herein, we just describe the structure of Tb-MOF in detail. Tb-MOF is a three-dimensional (3D) anionic framework in which protonated [(CH3)2NH2]+ cations generated by DMF thermal decomposition are present as counterions. There is one TATAT6-, one and a half Tb3+, and four and a half coordinated H2O in an asymmetric unit of Tb-MOF (Figure S2). Uncoordinated solvent molecules were determined by elemental analyses and taking thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) into account (Figure S3). Each Tb3+ is nine-coordinated by six carboxyl oxygen atoms from four TATAT6- ligands and three oxygen atoms from three coordinated water molecules. The six carboxylate groups of TATAT6- ligand adopt two coordination fashions \u03bc1-\u03b70:\u03b71 and \u03bc1-\u03b71:\u03b71 connecting Tb3+. Each TATAT6- ligand connects six Tb3+ ions acting as a hexagonal molecular building block. Since the hexagonal molecular building block has three short sides and three long sides, eight TATAT6- ligands bridge 24 Tb3+ to form two sizes of truncated octahedron cages (A-cage and B-cage; ). The diameters of A-cage and B-cage are 19.8 and 21.8 \u00c5, respectively. Each A-cage connects eight adjacent B-cages via sharing the hexagonal TATAT6- ligands and connects six adjacent A-cages via sharing the square windows and vice versa (a,b), thus forming a 3D porous structure. Sharing the square windows between the same cages causes Tb-MOF to form two channels with sizes of 8.9 \u00d7 8.9 \u00c5 and 4.3 \u00d7 4.3 \u00c5 along the crystal axes (Figure S4). From the topological point of view, the Tb3+ ions and TATAT6- ligands act as four-connected and six-connected nodes, respectively. As a consequence, Tb-MOF adopts a (4,6)-connected network with the Schla\u0308fli symbol {44.62}3{46.66.83}2, which corresponds to she topology (c,d).

The four Ln-MOFs are capable of highly selective adsorption and separation of cationic dyes (methylene blue) based on cationic exchange. After soaking with ethanol, acetonitrile, and diethyl ether, the color of Tb-MOF (or Eu-MOF) changed significantly from colorless to golden, dark orange, and dark red, respectively. This allows Tb-MOF and Eu-MOF to be used to sense ethanol, acetonitrile, and diethyl ether by the naked eye. In addition, Tb-MOF exhibits excellent detection ability toward Co2+ ion.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 37, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information\nis available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b01319\">10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b01319</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Additional structure\nfigures, TGA, PXRD, IR, XPS, UV\u2013vis\nabsorption spectra, UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectra, and\nluminescence plots (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b01319/suppl_file/ic8b01319_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b01319.

The excitation spectra of Eu-MOF show broad bands of TATAT6- ligand and sharp characteristic excitation bands of Eu3+ when monitored at 619 nm. Therefore, we measured the emission spectra of Eu-MOF at different excitation wavelengths. The results show that the emission spectra of Eu-MOF contain ligand-centered emission and metal-centered emission, and the relative intensities of the two kinds of emissions vary with the excitation wavelength (Figure S34). The excitation-wavelength-dependent photoluminescence allows Eu-MOF to have color-tunable property by adjusting the wavelength of the excitation light (Figure S35).

Tb-MOF, Eu-MOF (excitation below 370 nm), and Dy-MOF exhibit strong characteristic emission peaks of Ln3+, indicating that TATAT6- ligand is an excellent antenna chromophore and sensitizes Ln3+ emission through the antenna effect (energy transfer from chromophore to Ln3+). The energy transfer from ligand to Eu3+ in Eu-MOF is incomplete at less than 370 nm excitation, which leads to the appearance of ligand-based emission. The characteristic emission bands of Eu3+ in Eu-MOF are mainly derived from the energy harvesting of Eu3+ when excited at 385 and 396 nm, while the energy absorption of TATAT6- ligand is mainly used for ligand-based emission. Gd-MOF displays a ligand-centered broad emission band with a peak at 462 nm (d), similar to the 465 nm emission peak of the free H6TATAT ligand (Figure S36). The absence of the characteristic 4f-4f emission of Gd3+ may be due to the high energy level of Gd3+ that hinders energy transfer from ligand. The absolute quantum yields of Tb-MOF (upon excitation at 341 nm), Eu-MOF (upon excitation at 396 nm), Dy-MOF (upon excitation at 341 nm), and Gd-MOF (upon excitation at 370 nm) are 32.5%, 11.0%, 2.1%, and 7.1%, respectively.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "Tb-MOF", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "peak spectrum": [{"value": "492, 548, 585, 625", "unit": "nm", "type": "emission", "condition": "room temperature"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "Eu-MOF", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "peak spectrum": [{"value": "582, 595, 619, 654, 707", "unit": "nm", "type": "emission", "condition": "room temperature"}, {"value": "619", "unit": "nm", "type": "excitation", "condition": "room temperature"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "Dy-MOF", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "peak spectrum": [{"value": "486, 578", "unit": "nm", "type": "emission", "condition": "excitation at 341 nm"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "Gd-MOF", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "peak spectrum": [{"value": "462", "unit": "nm", "type": "emission", "condition": "excitation at 370 nm"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["peak_spectrum"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['peak_spectrum']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"Tb-MOF\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"peak spectrum\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"492, 548, 585, 625\",\n                \"unit\": \"nm\",\n                \"type\": \"emission\",\n                \"condition\": \"room temperature\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"Eu-MOF\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"peak spectrum\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"582, 595, 619, 654, 707\",\n                \"unit\": \"nm\",\n                \"type\": \"emission\",\n                \"condition\": \"room temperature\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"619\",\n                \"unit\": \"nm\",\n                \"type\": \"excitation\",\n                \"condition\": \"room temperature\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"Dy-MOF\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"peak spectrum\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"486, 578\",\n                \"unit\": \"nm\",\n                \"type\": \"emission\",\n                \"condition\": \"excitation at 341 nm\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"Gd-MOF\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"peak spectrum\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"462\",\n                \"unit\": \"nm\",\n                \"type\": \"emission\",\n                \"condition\": \"excitation at 370 nm\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 16, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>A-cage (a) and B-cage (b) constructed from six-connected\nTATAT<sup>6\u2013</sup> ligands and four-connected Tb<sup>3+</sup> ions in <bold>Tb-MOF</bold>.
