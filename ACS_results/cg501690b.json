The initial plateau in the simulated isotherm corresponds\nto one nitrogen molecule in each of the pocket sites (four molecules\nper unit cell in total) and a further two molecules per unit cell\nin the channel sites. The hysteresis loop is a result of the rearrangement\nof the adsorbed molecules in the channel sites to allow a further\ntwo molecules per unit cell to be accommodated.

The program PLATON was used to calculate a 548.1 \u00c53 pore volume (34.0% of the volume).

After washing in methanol the initial mass loss occurs in one step: this corresponds to just more than 2 equiv of methanol per Co2(BDC)2(DPNDO) formula unit (expected 9.2% mass loss; observed 11.6%); alternatively the material may also contain some water as in the refined low temperature crystal structure (expected mass loss 14.4%).

The total overall mass loss at 900 \u00b0C of 78.6% matches the expected total combustion to CoO of 78.5% assuming 2 equiv of methanol. For the as-made material the initial mass loss occurs in two distinct steps, suggesting two types of adsorbed species. Given that methanol was the major solvent used and the 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (H2BDC) was present in excess, the mass losses can be assigned assuming excess acid remains associated with the as-made material: the first loss is then due to 2 equiv of methanol per Co2(BDC)2(DPNDO)[H2BDC] (expected 7.20% mass loss and observed 7.95%) followed by loss of 1 equiv of unreacted H2BDC (expected 23.06% mass loss and observed 19.41%). It is impossible to say whether the latter is absorbed in the pores or as a separate phase, although powder XRD suggests no bulk, crystalline H2BDC is present. The fact that after washing the sample the methanol is lost in one step at low temperature corroborates the conclusion that the two-step mass loss seen for the as-made material is due to more than one adsorbed species, and the H2BDC is removed by methanol washing. The methanol-washed sample of Mg2(BDC)2(DPNDO) shows similar behavior with first loss of at least 2 equiv of methanol (and/or water) (expected 10.18% for 2 methanol, observed 14.48%) followed by combustion to MgO occurring at just above 400 \u00b0C ().\n\nThe permanent porosity of both materials was confirmed by gas-adsorption measurement on the methanol-washed samples.

The standard Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis is performed for a pressure range of 0.05 < p/p 0 < 0.3. However, microporous MOFs show saturation well below the standard range. To choose the pressure range appropriate for a particular adsorbent and to avoid ambiguity when reporting the BET surface area, two consistency criteria have been proposed: (1) the pressure range should be chosen so that V a*(1 - p/p 0) is always increasing with p/p 0 and (2) the straight line fitted to the BET plot must have a positive intercept. Taking into account these two criteria, the BET surface area was calculated to be 252 m2 g-1 (p/p 0 = 0.0002-0.06) and 303 m2 g-1 (p/p 0 = 0.0002-0.07) for Co2(BDC)2(DPNDO) and Mg2(BDC)2(DPNDO), respectively. The higher measured value for the isostructural Mg material is consistent with its lower formula weight. The hysteresis observed in the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, although small, is reproducible and does not change on repeated measurements, suggesting it is a real effect and not due to structural collapse. This is supported by powder X-ray diffraction measured after the adsorption-desorption () and also simulations (see below) that replicate the hysteretic behavior.\n\nTwo adsorption sites were identified in gas adsorption simulations for Co2(BDC)2(DPNDO): one near the center of the channel and another in the pockets of space between neighboring DPNDO ligands, Figure a. There are four of these pocket sites per unit cell. In the case of nitrogen adsorption at 77 K (Figure ), a stepped isotherm with a hysteresis loop is recovered from GCMC simulations. It is clear that these simulations vastly overpredict both the saturation capacity (6.4 mmol g-1) and the BET surface area (457 m2 g-1) compared to experiment (3.4 mmol g-1 and 252 m2 g-1), a result of the different accessibilities of the pocket sites in simulation and in experiment. The initial plateau in the simulated isotherm corresponds to one nitrogen molecule in each of the pocket sites (four molecules per unit cell in total) and a further two molecules per unit cell in the channel sites. The hysteresis loop is a result of the rearrangement of the adsorbed molecules in the channel sites to allow a further two molecules per unit cell to be accommodated. If adsorption in the pocket sites is discounted in simulation (i.e., only adsorption in the channel is considered), then extremely good agreement with the experimental isotherm and the BET surface area is observed with a predicted surface area of 217 m2 g-1. These results indicate that the pocket sites are almost completely inaccessible to nitrogen at 77 K.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "Co2(BDC)2(DPNDO)", "symbol": "", "chemical formula":
