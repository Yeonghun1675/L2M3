Similar to NJU-Bai7, in the structure of NJU-Bai32, Cu-paddlewheel units are linked by isophthalic acid moieties of the organic ligand leading to the formation of two-dimensional (2D) square topological layers (sql). Then, the 2D sql nets of Cu-paddelwheel units joined by isophthalic acid moieties are further pillared by the quinolin-4-yl group giving the formation of three-dimensional (3D) porous frameworks (). However, different from the structure of NJU-Bai7, along the opposite direction of the c axis, these sql layers in NJU-Bai32 adopt the packing model of the AB stacking model, in which layer of B is turned from layer of A by a translation of 1/2 a  opposite the direction of a axis after a rotation of 180\u00b0 along c axis. Interestingly, one-dimensional zigzag channels are generated to be perpendicular to the 2D sql layers in NJU-Bai32.

To better describe the structure, NJU-Bai32 may be simplified as a (3,6)-connected network with pyr topology, calculated by TOPOS software, in which the Cu-paddlewheel units serve as 6-connected nodes and the organic ligands are simplified as 3-connected nodes. As far as we know, it is the second reported pyr topological MOF based upon bifunctional organic ligands with two carboxyl groups and one N donor after the previous publication of unstable MCF-30 by Chen's group. \n\nThe total potential solvent accessible volume in desolvated NJU-Bai32 is around 35.5% as determined by the PLATON/SOLV program, and the calculated density is 1.261 g cm-3.

As shown in Figure S3, the CO2 adsorption isotherms were measured at 195 K for NJU-Bai32, and the reversible type-I isotherm implies that this metal-organic framework is a microporous material. The estimated apparent BET surface area and Langmuir surface area of NJU-Bai32 are 751 and 842 m2 g-1, respectively.\n\nThe permanent porosity of NJU-Bai32 prompted us to investigate its selective adsorption properties of CO2 versus N2. The CO2 and N2 low-pressure (0-1 bar) sorption isotherms were collected for NJU-Bai32 at 273 and 298 K, as shown in Figures S4 and S6. Very interestingly, at 298 K, its uptake amount of CO2 is high up to 24 cm3 g-1, corresponding to ~4.7 wt % at 0.15 bar, which is substantially higher than the values of many well-known MOFs, such as ZIF-78 (3.4 wt %, at 298 K and 0.15 bar), NH2-MIL-53(Al) (3.2 wt %, at 298 K and 0.15 bar), en-Cu-BTTri (2.4 wt %, at 298 K and 0.15 bar), ZIF-8 (0.6 wt %, at 298 K and 0.15 bar), and MOF-177 (0.6 wt %, at 298 K and 0.15 bar). However, it is worthy of note that in sharp contrast to CO2, NJU-Bai32 can only adsorb a limited amount of N2 (3.6 cm3 g-1, corresponding to ~0.45 wt %) at 298 K and 0.75 bar.\n\nThe authors declare no competing financial interest.\n\nCrystal data for NJU-Bai32, [Cu(L)\u22c5DMF] n : C20H16CuN2O5, M  r  = 427.89, orthorhombic, Pbca, a = 14.3026(10) \u00c5, b = 12.0421(8) \u00c5, c = 21.6987(15) \u00c5, \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3 = 90, V = 3737.2(4) \u00c53, Z = 8, D c = 1.521 g cm-3, F 000 = 1752, T = 150(2) K, 32274 reflections collected, 4292 independent reflections (R int = 0.0516) R 1 = 0.0338, wR 2 = 0.0916 for [I > 2\u03c3(I)] and GOF = 1.015.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "NJU-Bai32", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "C20H16CuN2O5"}, "crystal system": [{"value": "orthorhombic", "condition": ""}], "space group": [{"value": "Pbca", "condition": ""}], "lattice parameters": [{"value": {"a": "14.3026", "b": "12.0421", "c": "21.6987", "alpha": "90", "beta": "90", "gamma": "90", "condition": "T = 150(2) K"}}], "topology": [{"value": "pyr", "condition": "calculated by TOPOS software"}], "porosity": [{"probe": "", "value": "35.5", "unit": "%", "condition": "determined by the PLATON/SOLV program"}], "density": [{"value": "1.521", "unit": "g/cm^3", "condition": ""}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "4.7", "unit": "wt%", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "0.15 bar", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "0.45", "unit": "wt%", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "0.75 bar", "condition": ""}], "chemical formula weight": [{"value": "427.89", "unit": "g/mol", "condition": ""}]}]]], "include_properties": ["crystal_system", "space_group", "lattice_parameters", "topology", "porosity", "density", "gas_adsorption", "chemical_formula_weight"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['crystal_system', 'space_group', 'lattice_parameters', 'topology', 'porosity', 'density', 'gas_adsorption', 'chemical_formula_weight']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n  {\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"name\": \"NJU-Bai32\",\n      \"symbol\": \"\",\n      \"chemical formula\": \"C20H16CuN2O5\"\n    },\n    \"crystal system\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"orthorhombic\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"space group\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"Pbca\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"lattice parameters\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": {\n          \"a\": \"14.3026\",\n          \"b\": \"12.0421\",\n          \"c\": \"21.6987\",\n          \"alpha\": \"90\",\n          \"beta\": \"90\",\n          \"gamma\": \"90\",\n          \"condition\": \"T = 150(2) K\"\n        }\n      }\n    ],\n    \"topology\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"pyr\",\n        \"condition\": \"calculated by TOPOS software\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"porosity\": [\n      {\n        \"probe\": \"\",\n        \"value\": \"35.5\",\n        \"unit\": \"%\",\n        \"condition\": \"determined by the PLATON/SOLV program\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"density\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"1.521\",\n        \"unit\": \"g/cm^3\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"gas adsorption\": [\n      {\n        \"adsorbate\": \"CO2\",\n        \"adsorbed amount\": \"4.7\",\n        \"unit\": \"wt%\",\n        \"temperature\": \"298 K\",\n        \"pressure\": \"0.15 bar\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"adsorbate\": \"N2\",\n        \"adsorbed amount\": \"0.45\",\n        \"unit\": \"wt%\",\n        \"temperature\": \"298 K\",\n        \"pressure\": \"0.75 bar\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"chemical formula weight\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"427.89\",\n        \"unit\": \"g/mol\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 5, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a, b) Cu-paddlewheel units linked by\nisophthalic acid moieties\nform the two-dimensional (2D) <italic>sql</italic> layers (marked\nA and B in b) which are pillared by a quinolin-4-yl group to construct\nthe three-dimensional (3D) porous frameworks.
