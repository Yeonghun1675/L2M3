The 195Pt NMR spectrum of [Pt(phpy)2] with excess Ag(ClO4) shows a signal at -1529 ppm (vs K2PtCl4 in D2O in acetone-d 6)15 and at -1928 ppm without Ag(ClO4). Similarly, in the presence of an excess of Ag(ClO4), [Pt(thpy)2] shows the 195Pt NMR signal at -1797 ppm in acetone-d 6, whereas in the absence of Ag(ClO4) the signal appears at -2204 ppm. These low-field shifts suggest the formation of a Pt\u2192Ag dative bond and are caused by the decrease in electron density of the Pt center upon coordination to Ag+.
