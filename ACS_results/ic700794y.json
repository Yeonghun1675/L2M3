All of the solvent water molecules are accommodated in a disordered fashion in the channels. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of compound 1 reveals a weight loss of 2.1% in the region of 18-80 \u00b0C, consistent with the loss of lattice water molecules from the channels of compound 1. (The crystals of compound 1 could lose some of the solvent molecules when exposed to the atmosphere.) A plateau region in the temperature range of 90-200 \u00b0C indicates that the molecular architecture of the compound is stable up to 200 \u00b0C in the absence of guests. The purity of compound 1 is confirmed by power XRD analyses, in which the experimental spectra of 1 are almost consistent with its simulated spectrum (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). As depicted in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information, the diffraction profiles after removal of water are almost the same as those of the as-synthesized compound, which supports the fact that 1 remains intact after removal of the water molecules. \n\nTo evaluate the permanent porosity of the framework of compound 1, dinitrogen sorption isotherm measurements (Figure ) were performed on a desolvated crystalline sample at 77 K. Indeed, it shows a typical type I gas sorption behavior and a dinitrogen uptake of approximately 256 cm3 (STP)/g, with a Langmuir surface area of 1172 m2/g, a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of 844 m2/g, and a pore volume of 0.39 cm3/g (the Dubinin-Radushkevitch model). To our knowledge, compound 1 is the first heterothiometallic cluster based porous solid to be characterized by gas sorption that exhibits a porosity quite comparable to that of previously reported metal-organic frameworks (MOFs; S Langmuir = 1100 m2/g for MOP-28).
