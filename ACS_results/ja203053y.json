Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated that 1 is stable up to 218 \u00b0C (). Guest-free crystals of 1 could be obtained by heating crystals of 1\u22c512H2O in air at 170 \u00b0C or under vacuum at 100 \u00b0C for ~12 h. Although the loss of the uncoordinated water is accompanied by a contraction of the cell volume from 11727 \u00c53 to 11597 \u00c53, the framework structure of 1 is essentially unchanged (). The aperture size of 1 is approximately 10.0 \u00c5 \u00d7 6.4 \u00c5. The permanent porosity of 1 was confirmed by N2 sorption measurements at 77 K (), which revealed a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 1029 m2 g-1 and a pore volume of 0.36 cm3 g-1. The stability of this robust porous MOF and the presence of relatively large intraframework voids prompted us to investigate whether the network would be able to exhibit selective adsorption of guest molecules with retention of single-crystal character.\n\nReferences\n\n(a) Crystal data for 1\u22c512H2O: orthorhombic; space group Fdd2; a = 15.571(3) \u00c5, b = 23.296(5) \u00c5, c = 32.328(7) \u00c5; V = 11727(4) \u00c53; Z = 8; D calcd = 1.156 g/cm3; \u03bc(Mo K\u03b1) = 0.708 cm-1; T = 223 K; R 1 = 0.0593 [I > 2\u03c3(I)], wR 2 = 0.1559 (all data); S = 1.088.
