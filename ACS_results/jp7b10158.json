On the other hand, for the G3-NaFSI\nsystem, \u03b4\u00ad(<sup>23</sup>Na) is already very low under dilute\nconditions and a small increase is observed in the transition from\na 2:1 to a 1:1 G3:NaFSI ratio.

To ensure that this observation was not a result of\nthe elevated measuring temperature of the G3 samples, the 10:1 sample\nwas measured both at 25 and 80 \u00b0C and the difference in \u03b4\u00ad(<sup>23</sup>Na) was only 1 ppm, which is considerably lower than the\ndifference in \u03b4\u00ad(<sup>23</sup>Na) between the G2 and G3 series.\nWhen comparing these three systems, the differences in coordination\nnumber and the sodium\u2013oxygen bond distance also have to be\nconsidered. As mentioned in the XRD section, Na<sup>+</sup> forms\nsix-coordinate complexes with monoglyme and diglyme and eight-coordinate\ncomplexes with triglyme. Due to the increased steric hindrance associated\nwith the coordination of two triglyme ligands around Na<sup>+</sup> as opposed to two smaller diglyme or three monoglyme ligands, the\naverage sodium\u2013oxygen bond distance increases from 2.39 \u00b1\n0.04 \u00c5 for a six-coordinate complex to 2.62 \u00b1 0.13 \u00c5\nfor an eight-coordinate complex. The\nlatter value is in good agreement with the average sodium\u2013oxygen\nbond distance found for [Na\u00ad(G3)<sub>2</sub>]\u00ad[FSI] (2.622 \u00b1 0.005\n\u00c5). Since the value of \u03b4\u00ad(<sup>23</sup>Na) depends on the\norbital overlap of Na<sup>+</sup> and the coordinating atoms in its\nsolvation shell, it is evident that the coordination bond distances\nalso have a significant influence. In solid state\nmagic angle spinning (MAS) NMR literature, the same relationship between\n\u03b4\u00ad(<sup>23</sup>Na) and the sodium\u2013oxygen bond distance\nis often observed and used to gain information on the sodium coordination\nenvironment in minerals and glasses. Therefore,\nit can be concluded that the low \u03b4\u00ad(<sup>23</sup>Na) value of\nthe G3-NaFSI system is caused by the larger sodium\u2013oxygen bond\ndistance in the solvated species. Furthermore, the small increase\nof \u03b4\u00ad(<sup>23</sup>Na) upon transition from a 2:1 to a 1:1 G3:NaFSI\nratio can also be explained. The XRD and Raman measurements both show\nthat FSI<sup>\u2013</sup> anions are present in the solvation shell\naround Na<sup>+</sup> in the 1:1 mixture ([Na\u00ad(G3)]\u00ad[FSI]), as opposed\nto the 2:1 mixture ([Na\u00ad(G3)<sub>2</sub>]\u00ad[FSI]), where Na<sup>+</sup> is completely solvated by G3 ligands. However, the coordination\nnumber of sodium in [Na\u00ad(G3)]\u00ad[FSI] is seven, as opposed to eight in\n[Na\u00ad(G3)<sub>2</sub>]\u00ad[FSI]. As a result, the average sodium\u2013oxygen\nbond distance in [Na\u00ad(G3)]\u00ad[FSI] (2.453 \u00b1 0.002 \u00c5) is significantly\nshorter than that in [Na\u00ad(G3)<sub>2</sub>]\u00ad[FSI] (2.622 \u00b1 0.005\n\u00c5), explaining the increase of \u03b4\u00ad(<sup>23</sup>Na). Thus, <sup>23</sup>Na NMR can also be used to reveal information about the coordination\nnumber of complexes. Another interesting trend is observed when the\nthree systems are compared: the change of \u03b4\u00ad(<sup>23</sup>Na),\ni.e., the formation of CIPs and AGGs, starts at much lower NaFSI concentrations\nfor the G1-NaFSI system than for the G2-NaFSI and G3-NaFSI systems,\nwhich is in complete accordance with the trends observed in the Raman\nspectra.</p>", "clean_text": "Since the exchange of Na+ is fast compared with the NMR time scale, all of the observed signals are weighed averages of Na+ in different solvation structures. According to Erlich et al., the 23Na chemical shift of a solvated sodium ion is directly proportional to the Gutmann donor number (DN) of the solvating ligands, where the lower the DN value is, the more upfield (negative) the shift is. The DN value is a measure for the coordinating abilities of a ligand. Therefore, \u03b4(23Na) is higher (downfield shifted) for a complex with strongly coordinating ligands (high DN) compared to a complex with weaker coordinating ligands (low DN). For the G1-NaFSI and G2-NaFSI systems, this holds true: under dilute conditions, \u03b4(23Na) does not change significantly with the concentration, since the glymes are present in a large excess and can completely solvate the sodium cations to form SSIPs. As the NaFSI concentration is increased, a strong decrease of the 23Na chemical shift over several ppm is observed as the stronger coordinating glyme ligands around the sodium cations (DN = 20 kcal mol-1 for G1) are gradually exchanged by weaker coordinating FSI- anions (DN ~ 11 kcal mol-1 for [emim][Tf2N] as a reference), resulting in the formation of CIPs and AGGs. On the other hand, for the G3-NaFSI system, \u03b4(23Na) is already very low under dilute conditions and a small increase is observed in the transition from a 2:1 to a 1:1 G3:NaFSI ratio. Also, when the three systems are compared, the following trend is observed for the 23Na chemical shifts: \u03b4[Na(G3) n ] \u226a \u03b4[Na(G2) n ] < \u03b4[Na(G1) n ], whereas the reverse trend would be expected on the basis of the respective coordinating abilities of the glymes due to the chelate effect. To ensure that this observation was not a result of the elevated measuring temperature of the G3 samples, the 10:1 sample was measured both at 25 and 80 \u00b0C and the difference in \u03b4(23Na) was only 1 ppm, which is considerably lower than the difference in \u03b4(23Na) between the G2 and G3 series. When comparing these three systems, the differences in coordination number and the sodium-oxygen bond distance also have to be considered. As mentioned in the XRD section, Na+ forms six-coordinate complexes with monoglyme and diglyme and eight-coordinate complexes with triglyme. Due to the increased steric hindrance associated with the coordination of two triglyme ligands around Na+ as opposed to two smaller diglyme or three monoglyme ligands, the average sodium-oxygen bond distance increases from 2.39 \u00b1 0.04 \u00c5 for a six-coordinate complex to 2.62 \u00b1 0.13 \u00c5 for an eight-coordinate complex. The latter value is in good agreement with the average sodium-oxygen bond distance found for [Na(G3)2][FSI] (2.622 \u00b1 0.005 \u00c5). Since the value of \u03b4(23Na) depends on the orbital overlap of Na+ and the coordinating atoms in its solvation shell, it is evident that the coordination bond distances also have a significant influence. In solid state magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR literature, the same relationship between \u03b4(23Na) and the sodium-oxygen bond distance is often observed and used to gain information on the sodium coordination environment in minerals and glasses. Therefore, it can be concluded that the low \u03b4(23Na) value of the G3-NaFSI system is caused by the larger sodium-oxygen bond distance in the solvated species. Furthermore, the small increase of \u03b4(23Na) upon transition from a 2:1 to a 1:1 G3:NaFSI ratio can also be explained. The XRD and Raman measurements both show that FSI- anions are present in the solvation shell around Na+ in the 1:1 mixture ([Na(G3)][FSI]), as opposed to the 2:1 mixture ([Na(G3)2][FSI]), where Na+ is completely solvated by G3 ligands. However, the coordination number of sodium in [Na(G3)][FSI] is seven, as opposed to eight in [Na(G3)2][FSI]. As a result, the average sodium-oxygen bond distance in [Na(G3)][FSI] (2.453 \u00b1 0.002 \u00c5) is significantly shorter than that in [Na(G3)2][FSI] (2.622 \u00b1 0.005 \u00c5), explaining the increase of \u03b4(23Na). Thus, 23Na NMR can also be used to reveal information about the coordination number of complexes. Another interesting trend is observed when the three systems are compared: the change of \u03b4(23Na), i.e., the formation of CIPs and AGGs, starts at much lower NaFSI concentrations for the G1-NaFSI system than for the G2-NaFSI and G3-NaFSI systems, which is in complete accordance with the trends observed in the Raman spectra.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 48, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>\n<sup>17</sup>O is a nucleus with a low NMR sensitivity\nbandwidth\nand a low abundance (0.038%), displaying lines over a very wide chemical\nshift range.

G2-NaFSI\nelectrolytes, an initial increase\nof conductivity is observed; then, a maximum is reached and the conductivity\nrapidly drops as the fraction of NaFSI in the solution is further\nincreased. This indicates that the increase in concentration of charge\ncarriers is initially dominant over the decrease of their mobility\ndue to the viscosity. Eventually, the increase in viscosity becomes\ntoo large and the roles are reversed, leading to the sharp decrease\nin conductivity. Although the overall trend in conductivity vs the\nglyme:NaFSI ratio is very similar for the monoglyme and diglyme electrolytes,\nsome significant differences can be observed. First, for the glyme:NaFSI\nratios 40:1\u20136:1, the conductivity of the G1-NaFSI electrolytes\nis roughly double that of the G2-NaFSI electrolytes with the same\nratio. This is a consequence of their lower viscosity on one hand\nand their higher sodium ion concentration at the same glyme:NaFSI\nratio on the other hand. The latter is a result of the lower molar\nvolume of G1 (104 cm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>\u20131</sup>) compared\nto G2 (143 cm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>\u20131</sup>). However, after\nreaching the maximum conductivity, the viscosity of the G1-NaFSI electrolytes\nincreases faster with the glyme:NaFSI ratio compared to the G2-NaFSI\nelectrolytes, resulting in a sharper drop in conductivity. Second,\nthe maximum conductivity is reached at a 4:1 glyme:NaFSI ratio for\nthe G2-NaFSI electrolytes as opposed to a 6:1 ratio for the G1-NaFSI\nelectrolytes, which corresponds to a sodium ion concentration of approximately\n1.53 and 1.43 mol dm<sup>\u20133</sup>, respectively. This cannot\nbe explained by only considering the viscosity: the G1-NaFSI electrolytes\nwith 5:1 and 4:1 ratio are significantly less viscous than their G2-NaFSI\nanalogues, yet their conductivity already decreases at this point.\nHowever, the conductivity of the G2-NaFSI analogues still increases\nat these ratios. Thus, the higher degree of CIP and AGG formation\nfor the G1-NaFSI electrolytes is the most probable cause of this behavior.\nIn conclusion, sodium ion concentration and viscosity seem to be the\ntwo most important factors that determine the conductivity of an electrolyte,\nwhile CIP and AGG formation has a smaller influence. This is particularly\nwell illustrated by comparing the 2:1 electrolytes of both solvents,\ni.e., the solvate ionic liquids [Na\u00ad(G1)<sub>2</sub>]\u00ad[FSI] and [Na\u00ad(G2)<sub>2</sub>]\u00ad[FSI].

First, for the glyme:NaFSI ratios 40:1-6:1, the conductivity of the G1-NaFSI electrolytes is roughly double that of the G2-NaFSI electrolytes with the same ratio. This is a consequence of their lower viscosity on one hand and their higher sodium ion concentration at the same glyme:NaFSI ratio on the other hand. The latter is a result of the lower molar volume of G1 (104 cm3 mol-1) compared to G2 (143 cm3 mol-1). However, after reaching the maximum conductivity, the viscosity of the G1-NaFSI electrolytes increases faster with the glyme:NaFSI ratio compared to the G2-NaFSI electrolytes, resulting in a sharper drop in conductivity. Second, the maximum conductivity is reached at a 4:1 glyme:NaFSI ratio for the G2-NaFSI electrolytes as opposed to a 6:1 ratio for the G1-NaFSI electrolytes, which corresponds to a sodium ion concentration of approximately 1.53 and 1.43 mol dm-3, respectively. This cannot be explained by only considering the viscosity: the G1-NaFSI electrolytes with 5:1 and 4:1 ratio are significantly less viscous than their G2-NaFSI analogues, yet their conductivity already decreases at this point. However, the conductivity of the G2-NaFSI analogues still increases at these ratios. Thus, the higher degree of CIP and AGG formation for the G1-NaFSI electrolytes is the most probable cause of this behavior. In conclusion, sodium ion concentration and viscosity seem to be the two most important factors that determine the conductivity of an electrolyte, while CIP and AGG formation has a smaller influence. This is particularly well illustrated by comparing the 2:1 electrolytes of both solvents, i.e., the solvate ionic liquids [Na(G1)2][FSI] and [Na(G2)2][FSI]. Despite having a significantly higher viscosity, [Na(G1)2][FSI] is equally conductive as [Na(G2)2][FSI], since its sodium ion concentration is higher as well.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 59, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<title>Electrochemical\nResults</title><p>In order to be useful as a\nbattery electrolyte, the electrochemical window of the electrolyte\nshould be wider than the operating potential window of the battery.\nTherefore, the electrochemical window of all of the solvate ionic\nliquids that were liquid at room temperature was determined by linear\nsweep voltammetry with a platinum working electrode (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b10158/suppl_file/jp7b10158_si_001.pdf\">Figure S10</ext-link>).
