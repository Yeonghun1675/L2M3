The standard simplification procedure resulted in a 4,5,6-coordinated trinodal net (4,5,6-c) with a new topology in 1 represented by the symbol 4,5,6T115 (c) and a 4,5-coordinated (4,5-c) tcs net in 2 (c). The ligands are always 4-connected, and the copper atoms are 5 and 6-coordinated nodes in these nets. It is interesting to compare the structural topologies present in 1 and 2. The tcs topology in 2 (c) is formed by the stacking of two sql layers (simple square-layers) onto each other. These layers are connected by the \u03bc2-chloride ligands (green and yellow spheres) in such a way that green squares are superimposed on the yellow ones (d). In 1, the number of sql layers are doubled (d) and further connected by another \u03bc2-chloride ligand, leading to a hitherto unknown topology for the trinodal 4,5,6-c network (c). Nevertheless, the standard structural representation is unable to unveil the clear interrelation between the two MOFs fully. A more meaningful representation can be obtained by considering the whole linear clusters as a single node or building blocks and the four connected ligands (TPVS and TPES) as another node. This arrangement results in the connection of Cu4Cl3(H2O)2 clusters with 16 TPVS ligands and Cu2Cl(H2O)2 clusters coordinated with eight TPES ligands in the structures of 1 and 2, respectively. This representation leads to a new highly coordinated binodal 4,16-c net in 1 represented by the symbol 4,16T9 and to the well-known 4,8-c binodal net of the flu topological type in 2 (Figure S10, Supporting Information). A detailed search through the CSD for linear and finite copper-halogen chains using the ToposPro revealed that the structure of 1 is the only one that contains such a long linear Cu4Cl3 copper cluster as building units that are joined by ligands into the 3D framework.
