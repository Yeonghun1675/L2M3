The shift rate of -25.2 \u00b1 1.2 cm-1/GPa itself, however, is more than three times greater than the shift rate of the R1 line of Cr3+ in ruby, the latter being -7.59 cm-1/GPa. It is due to the higher compressibility of the three-dimensional oxalate network compounds compared to ruby. As will be discussed in more detail in section , in the softer material, there is a more pronounced increase of the nephelauxetic effect with applied pressure, for which both a shortening of the Cr-O bond lengths and an increase in \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between oxalate and bipyridine ligands are responsible.
