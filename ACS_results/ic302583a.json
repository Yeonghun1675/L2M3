Gas adsorption studies of N2, H2 on the actived 1 at 77 K reveal a Langmuir surface area of 1707 m2 g-1, a BET surface area of 1555 m2 g-1, a total pore volume of 0.62 cm3 g-1, and a H2 uptake of 1.49 wt % at 1 bar and 3.05 wt % at 16 bar. CO2, CH4, and N2 adsorption studies at 195, 273, 285, and 298 K and also  ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) calculations demonstrate that 1 has high selectivites of CO2 over CH4 and N2. The resulting framework represents a MOF with the highest gas uptakes and gas selectivities (CO2 over CH4 and N2) constructed by flexible ligands.\n\nCompound 1 possesses three types of 1D square channels with dimension of about 9.3 \u00c5 along the crystallographic a, b, and c axes, which are interconnected with each other (Figure S5, ). The potential free volume of 1 is 65.1% as calculated by PLATON (1.8 \u00c5 probe radius) after removal of guest solvent molecules, and the pore volume is 0.87 cm3 g-1. The permanent porosity of the actived sample was confirmed by the N2 sorption experiment at 77 K. As shown in Figure , the fully activated sample reveals a reversible typical type-I behavior as expected for microporous materials, which is coincidental with the crystal structure. Derived from  N2 adsorption, the Langmuir surface area of 1 is 1707 m2 g-1, corresponding to a BET surface area of 1555 m2 g-1. The BET surface area is among the highest MOFs constructed by flexible ligands (Figure ). A pore distribution analysis by  density functional theory (DFT) shows that there is a narrow distribution of micropores at around 6.7 and 9.3 \u00c5, corresponding to the diameters of cage A and cage B, albeit those values are smaller than that derived from the single-crystal structure. The pore volume estimated by t-plot analysis is 0.62 cm3 g-1, which is also a little smaller than the value (0.87 cm3 g-1) calculated from the structure. The results can be explained that the disorder counterions (CH3)2NH2 + occupy in the channels, decreasing the void of the channels.\n\nThe high porosity and surface area of 1 prompted us to evaluate its hydrogen adsorption performances. The low-pressure hydrogen sorption isotherm of the desolvated sample at 77 K reveals reversible hydrogen adsorption as presented in Figure . The excess gravimetric hydrogen uptake capacity of 1 reaches 1.49 wt % at 1 bar, comparable to MOF-5, MOF-74, and CUK-1, and is among the highest for MOFs with flexible ligands (Figure a). The sample exhibits an increasing hydrogen uptake accompanied with the increasing  pressure and  excess gravimetric value reaching 3.05 wt % at 77 K and 16 bar, which is comparable to that of MIL-53(Cr) (3.1 wt %) under the same measurement conditions. At 77 K, the maximum excess hydrogen uptake value is 3.21 wt % at around 30 bar, corresponding to the total hydrogen uptake is 4.26 wt % (Figure ). To evaluate the heats of adsorption (Q st) for H2 in compound 1, H2 adsorption isotherms were also measured at 87 K. Adsorption data were fitted using the virial-type expression, and the heats of adsorption were calculated using virial coefficients. As shown in Figure , the initial hydrogen adsorption enthalpy is 6.15 kJ mol-1. With the increase in H2 coverage, Q st of 1 decreases steadily.\n\nTo further investigate the gas sorption properties of 1, CO2, CH4, and N2 adsorption measurements have also been carried out, and the results are shown in Figure  and summarized in Table . At 195 K and 1 bar, compound 1 adsorbs CO2 up to 370.2 cm3 g-1, CH4 up to 202.5 cm3 g-1, and N2 up to 43.2 cm3 g-1. At 273 K and 1 bar, the adsorption capacity for CO2 is 99.7  and 22.5 cm3 g-1 for CH4 but for N2 only 2.5 cm3 g-1. With the increase of temperature to 298 K, the adsorption capacity for CO2 is 56.2 cm3 g-1 but for CH4 13.2 cm3 g-1.  CO2 uptake is among the highest MOFs built by flexible linkers (Figure b). Heat of adsorption measurements (Figure d) show that compound 1 has an initial affinity of about 21.14 kJ mol-1 for CO2 and 17.45 kJ mol-1 for CH4. The results demonstrate that compound 1 has the ability to selectively adsorb CO2 over CH4 and N2 (Figures  and a). To further explore the potential properties toward CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 gas separation,  adsorption selectivities were calculated via  ideal adsorption solution theory (IAST) based upon  experimental CO2, CH4, and N2 isotherms, and the results are presented in Figure b. The adsorption selectivity is defined as S i/j  = (q 1/q 2)/(p 1/p 2), where q  i  is the amount of i adsorbed and p  i  is the partial pressure of i in the mixture. At 1 bar, the predicted CO2/CH4 selectivity is 6.40 at 273 K and 5.60 at 298 K (Figure b) from equimolar gas-phase mixtures, which is comparable to the high selectivities of CO2 over CH4 in reported compounds ZIF-100 and HKUST-1. Remarkably, compound 1 shows exceptionally high CO2/N2 selectivity at 273 K and 1.0 bar (S = 250.0, CO2 and N2 mixtures in a 15:85 molar ratio), which indicates that this material may be a promising adsorbent in the process of CO2/N2 separation required for postcombustion CO2 capture application.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe  synthesized a highly porous polyhedral MOF (In2X)(Me2NH2)2(DMF)9(H2O)5 based on flexible tetrakis[(3,5-dicarboxyphenyl)oxamethyl]methane.
