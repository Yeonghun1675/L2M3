It is impossible to reproduce this data using the spin Hamiltonian  for each site of the dimer, as the strange sigmoidal shape of the magnetization data is directly indicative of antiferromagnetic interactions. Thus, we begin by modeling the magnetic data using the spin Hamiltonian , which takes into account an isotropic interaction between the two CoII ions. Using the same initial minimal model as previously with E fixed to zero, we fit the magnetic data to find two minima: D = -19.9 cm-1, g = 2.38, J = -0.319 cm-1, and D = 26.8 cm-1, g = 2.41, J = -0.559 cm-1. EPR spectra for 9 at X- and Q-band show only one broad resonance at each frequency (). Of the two parameter sets determined from the magnetic data, only the D < 0 set is in agreement with the EPR data. Further refinement of these parameters gives D = -19.6 cm-1, g = 2.38, J = -0.319 cm-1 with frequency-space Lorentzian line widths of \u03b7(X-band) = 6 GHz and \u03b7(Q-band) = 12 GHz. Given the lack of fine structure in the EPR spectra, it is not possible to further refine the model to estimate the rhombicity of the local ZFS tensors. Ab initio CASSCF-SO calculations on single sites of 9 again lend support to our conclusions, predicting D = -12.3 cm-1, E = 2.6 cm-1, and g = 2.34; furthermore the trend of D for 9 being greater than for 7 is also verified. 2      H\u0302   2   =   \u2211   i = 1   2    [ D  (     S\u0302   i , z     2   -   1   3       S\u0302   i     2   )   + [ E  (     S\u0302   i , +     2   +     S\u0302   i , -     2   )  + g   S\u0302   i   \u22c5 B ] - 2 J   S\u0302   1   \u22c5   S\u0302   2      ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 56, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig10\" position=\"float\">\n<label>10</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Experimental\n(black circles) and fitted (purple line) \u03c7<sub>M</sub>\n<italic>T</italic> for <bold>9</bold> in a 0.5 T field.

The 10 compounds derived from this systematic study reveal a large structural variety depending on synthetic parameters (ratio, temperature, and salt) and flexible ligand selection (various conformations in each ligand dependent on temperature). Tuning of these parameters allows for a greater control and manipulation of the system toward compounds with desired characteristics, resulting in a range of 0D dimers to 1D and 2D CPs with various metal geometries. A temperature-induced single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation of compound 3 to 4 is additionally reported. The magnetic properties of a selection of representative compounds are subject to large changes with only minor structural variations, suggesting that tetrahedral CoII nodes in CPs or MOFs could function as sensitive reporters of small changes in the local environment. Our future efforts will be dedicated to (i) further exploiting such systems to synthesize 3D porous CP/MOFs, (ii) investigating catalytic properties of these compounds, and (iii) employing different metals to fully explore the coordination potential of the ligands.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 64, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at\nDOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.cgd.7b00200\">10.1021/acs.cgd.7b00200</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Tables of crystal\ndata and structure refinement for <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>10</bold>; \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking distances and angles and part of\nthe supramolecular architecture of compounds <bold>1</bold>, <bold>3</bold>, <bold>4</bold>, and <bold>8</bold>; intramolecular and\nintermolecular \u03c0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interactions in compound <bold>8</bold>; experimental and fitted reduced magnetization for <bold>7</bold> and <bold>9</bold>; simulated \u03c7<sub>M</sub>\n<italic>T</italic> in an 0.5 T field for <italic>J</italic> &gt; 0 and <italic>J</italic> &lt; 0 using the <italic>S</italic> = 1/2 model used to\nsimulate the EPR spectra of compound <bold>4</bold>; powder XRD pattern\nof compounds <bold>7</bold>, <bold>8</bold>, <bold>9</bold>; ESI-MS\ngraphs for compounds <bold>4</bold> and <bold>10</bold>; TGA graphs\nand analysis for compounds <bold>1</bold>, <bold>5</bold>, and <bold>7</bold> (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.cgd.7b00200/suppl_file/cg7b00200_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.cgd.7b00200.
