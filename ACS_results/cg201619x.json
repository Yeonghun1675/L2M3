The Co-O(H)-Co angles range between 122.0\u00b0 and 96.7\u00b0, resulting in competing antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions. The temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility for complex 1 is shown in Figure a. The \u03c7T value for four Co(II) at 300 K is 8.04 emu K mol-1 Oe1-, which is higher than the spin-only value of 7.5 emu K mol-1 Oe1- for four Co (II) ions with spin value 3/2 and Lande\u0301 g value of 2. This could be due to a possible orbital contribution. Upon cooling, the \u03c7T value remains almost constant down to ~120 K. Below 120 K, the \u03c7T value decreases gradually to reach a minimum of 5.42 emu K mol-1 Oe1- (at ~26 K) and then increases to a peak of 38.8 emu K mol-1 Oe1- at 12 K followed by a drop to 9.07 emu K mol-1 Oe1- at 2 K. The first decrease of \u03c7T until 26 K could be due to the antiferromagnetic interaction of the Co (II) ions, and sharp increase between 26 and 12 K could be due to the presence of ferri/ferromagnetic interaction between Co(II) ions through oxygen atom of the p-cbia3-. This type of \u03c7T behavior is characteristic of a spin-canted system or reminiscent of a ferrimagnet. Fitting of data above 80 K with the Curie-Weiss law gives the Curie constant C = 0.12 emu K mol-1 Oe1- and Weiss constant \u03b8 = -67 K. The large negative Weiss constant value indicates the presence of antiferromagnetic coupling between the Co(II) ions, although the spin-orbit coupling and anisotropy can also contribute to this value.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "{[Co4(OH)2(p-cbia)2(bpmp)-(H2O)3]\u22c52H2O} n"}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "350", "unit": "\u00b0C",
