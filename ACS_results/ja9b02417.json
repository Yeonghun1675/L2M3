In order to obtain crystals suitable for SCXRD and for the convenience of subsequent analysis, we used only FeCl3 and H2bdc-NH2 with/without tpy to successfully synthesize large crystals of Fe-MIL-88B-tpy/Fe-MIL-88B. As expected, the unit-cell parameters of Fe-MIL-88B-tpy and Fe-MIL-88B are almost identical to those obtained from capsular-MOF and FeNi-MIL-88B with small differences of the axes (<0.3%), respectively, manifesting that they are isostructural MOFs (Tables S1 and S4). Careful structural analysis of Fe-MIL-88B-tpy supports that, besides the 6-connected acs networks similar to that of Fe-MIL-88B, each tpy ligand coordinates with the three Fe(III) ions by its three pyridyl ends, giving a rigid framework (g,h and S19). In particular, the electron-density distribution of tpy can be clearly observed in the X-ray difference Fourier maps (i,j and S20). In other words, when tpy is ignored, capsular-MOF actually has an isoreticular backbone with FeNi-MIL-88B. It should be noted that the capsular structure cannot be constructed via similar treatment of Fe-MIL-88B with tpy (Figures S21 and S22). Coupled with the fact that introduction of additional size-matching ligands into MOFs can drastically enhance the structural stabilities, a dissolution-regrowth mechanism for capsular-MOF is naturally proposed. That is, in hot DMF, crystal faces of parent FeNi-MIL-88B crystals first undergo severe surface etches by the hot solution and tpy is anchored on the uncoordinated Fe(III)/Ni(II) sites of the parent crystal surface. Then the inner core of the crystal is simultaneously dissolved to release Fe3+, Ni2+, and bdc-NH2 2- into the solution. Considering the identical orientations of crystal faces calculated from relevant single-crystal structures (Figure S23), these released ions will diffuse out of the crystal through these openings and then directly participate in constructing the new structure with tpy on the parent crystal surface. After that, the outer layer continues to grow with dissolution of the inner core, finally generating well-defined capsular nanocrystals with openings on the wall (Figure S24).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 9, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>Within this context, this\ncapsular-MOF with openings on the wall\ntherefore attracts considerable interests because of its great promising\napplication in storage.

Actually, FeNiP/NCH can serve as one of the best ORR electrocatalysts among various metal phosphides, being comparable with other reported bi-/trifunctional catalysts (Table S12). Considering the prominent catalytic activities of FeNiP/NCH for OER and ORR, a homemade Zn-air battery is assembled to further evaluate the performance under real operation conditions (e). Entertainingly, this battery can work stably with an open-circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.48 V for more than 25 h (1.38 V for Pt/C) (Figure S69). Besides this, discharge polarization curve and peak power density of single battery clearly manifest that the FeNiP/NCH catalyst exhibits an extraordinary high power density (250 mW cm-2) that surpasses 131 mW cm-2 of Pt/C-based battery and most of other recently reported state-of-the art electrode materials (f and Table S13). The charge/discharge potentials of the Zn-air battery based on FeNiP/NCH were 1.89 and 1.23 V with a small voltage gap of 0.66 V when cycling at 5 mA cm-2, far better than the charge/discharge potentials of Pt/C (g). More significantly, it displays remarkable stability with no obvious voltage gap change over 2100 cycles during 500 h when operating at different current densities. Obviously, FeNiP/NCH performs far better than Pt/C including not only the peak power density of discharge but also the durability of operation. More impressively, two primary Zn-air batteries based on FeNiP/NCH connected in series can provide a working voltage of more than 2.95 V, which is expectedly sufficient to power the above water electrolyzer assembled by FeNiP/NCH (Figure S70).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 21, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, a new single-crystal\ncapsular-MOF with openings on\nthe wall is carefully designed at the molecular level and constructed\nfrom a rare crystal-structure transformation from a well-known three-dimensional\nMOF for the first time.

Considering the electrocatalytic activities of FeNiP/NCH for HER and OER with excellent stabilities, an electrolyzer was assembled using FeNiP/NCH as both cathode and anode for overall water splitting. As revealed in LSV (b and S59), FeNiP/NCH exhibits outstanding splitting performance with a small cell voltage of 1.59 and 1.91 V to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm-2, respectively, superior to those of many reported non-noble-metal electrocatalysts (Table S12). In addition, the water electrolyzer durability was well confirmed by carrying out the reaction at different current densities from 10 to 100 mA cm-2 for over 40 h (c and S60), proving the prominent stability of FeNiP/NCH catalyst for overall water splitting.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-derived carbon composites", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "142", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}, {"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "118", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}, {"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "79", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}], "pore volume": [{"probe": "", "value": "0.549", "unit": "cm3/g", "condition": ""}, {"probe": "", "value": "0.367", "unit": "cm3/g", "condition": ""}, {"probe": "", "value": "0.226", "unit": "cm3/g", "condition": ""}], "etc": [{"property name": "Electrical conductivity", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "Dielectric constant", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "Electrical resistance", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}]}]]], "include_properties": ["surface_area", "pore_volume", "etc"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['surface_area', 'pore_volume', 'etc']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"MOF-derived carbon composites\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"surface area\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"BET\",\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"142\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"type\": \"BET\",\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"118\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"type\": \"BET\",\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"79\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"pore volume\": [\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"0.549\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"0.367\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"0.226\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"etc\": [\n            {\n                \"property name\": \"Electrical conductivity\",\n                \"value\": \"\",\n                \"unit\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"property name\": \"Dielectric constant\",\n                \"value\": \"\",\n                \"unit\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"property name\": \"Electrical resistance\",\n                \"value\": \"\",\n                \"unit\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 6, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a)\nSchematic illustration for the formation of capsular-MOF from\nFeNi-MIL-88B.
