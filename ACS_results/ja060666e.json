Given the openness of the structures, their stability and porosity were examined. Thermogravimetric analyses of 2 showed a steady mass loss to 105 \u00b0C corresponding to loss of both free and coordinated water molecules (13.29% obsd, 13.42% calcd). This sample was then stable to 320 \u00b0C. Powder X-ray diffraction measurements after dehydration showed the solid to be amorphous. Interestingly, single crystals of 2 allowed to dry still extinguished polarized light but would no longer diffract X-rays. The reversibility of the dehydration was examined by placing a sample of 2 on the TGA and heating to dehydration. This was followed by cooling and the introduction of water vapor. In 1 h, the dry sample resorbed 95% of the lost water and, notably, the solid regained order. This process was completely reversible as shown in Figure . If left for longer periods (days), even in the ambient atmosphere, dehydrated single crystals of 2 rehydrated such that the single crystal could be recollected with virtually identical cell parameters to the nascent solid. It was important to note that the amorphous nature of the dehydrated solid did not require a complete collapse of the network to a dense phase. Indeed, given the 3-fold chelated building block, contraction to a dense phase seemed quite unlikely. The porosity of 2 was further examined by gas sorption measurements. Upon outgassing for 5 h at 200 \u00b0C, a CO2 sorption isotherm, run at 273 K, confirmed a porous solid was indeed retained (Figure ). A Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) analysis gave a surface area of 718 m2/g, an average pore width of 6.2 \u00c5, and a micropore volume of 0.25 mL/g. The observed rapid onset of CO2 sorption at very low pressures is characteristic of the presence of micropores in the solid. Thus, despite the formation of an amorphous solid upon dehydration, the dry phase of 2 possessed a high degree of porosity. Figure  also shows considerable hysteresis in the desorption curve. The observed value for the energy of adsorption for CO2 of 21.0 kJ/mol is consistent with a physisorption process. A N2 sorption isotherm, run at 77 K, with identical outgas conditions to the CO2 analysis yielded a strikingly smaller surface area (15 m2/gm). Similar behavior has been reported by Pan et al. for the Ln-based MOF, Er(1,4-phenylenediacetate), which shows pronounced CO2 sorption but nonporous behavior toward N2 and Ar.

To further examine this, the CO2 sorption experiment was repeated at -42 \u00b0C using a dry ice/acetonitrile bath and gave a DR surface area of 210 m2/g. This result affirms that 2 has permanent pores accessible to CO2. This result also does affirm that there is activation of the solid by CO2 sorption as was inferred by the observed hysteresis on desorption. However, it would appear unlikely that the sorption of CO2 is due exclusively to activation of the solid. This result is not that surprising given that, using the building block approach, collapse to a completely dense solid is difficult.

Ligand L sensitized\nall the lanthanide ions with the exception of Gd<sup>3+</sup>. Studying the series of Ln complexes allowed the\ndetermination of the triplet state energy of L which is itself a new ligand for sensitization purposes. The\nluminescent properties of the lanthanide building blocks were retained in the porous network solid. From\nthe luminescence data, it was possible to attribute the spongelike properties of the network to the Ba<sup>2+</sup>\ncoordination sphere rather than the Ln<sup>3+</sup> center. Networks were characterized by X-ray crystallography,\nPXRD, DSC/TGA, water vapor and gas sorption, and luminescence spectroscopy.\n</p><p>\n<bold>Porosity.</bold> Given the openness of the structures, their stability\nand porosity were examined. Thermogravimetric analyses of <bold>2</bold>\nshowed a steady mass loss to 105 \u00b0C corresponding to loss of\nboth free and coordinated water molecules (13.29% obsd,\n13.42% calcd). This sample was then stable to 320 \u00b0C. Powder\nX-ray diffraction measurements after dehydration showed the\nsolid to be amorphous. Interestingly, single crystals of <bold>2</bold> allowed\nto dry still extinguished polarized light but would no longer\ndiffract X-rays. The reversibility of the dehydration was\nexamined by placing a sample of <bold>2</bold> on the TGA and heating to\ndehydration. This was followed by cooling and the introduction\nof water vapor. In 1 h, the dry sample resorbed 95% of the lost\nwater and, notably, the solid regained order. This process was\ncompletely reversible as shown in Figure . If left for longer\nperiods (days), even in the ambient atmosphere, dehydrated\nsingle crystals of <bold>2</bold> rehydrated such that the single crystal could\nbe recollected with virtually identical cell parameters to the\nnascent solid. It was important to note that the amorphous\nnature of the dehydrated solid did not require a complete\ncollapse of the network to a dense phase. Indeed, given the\n3-fold chelated building block, contraction to a dense phase\nseemed quite unlikely. The porosity of <bold>2</bold> was further examined\nby gas sorption measurements. Upon outgassing for 5 h at 200\n\u00b0C, a CO<sub>2</sub> sorption isotherm, run at 273 K, confirmed a porous\nsolid was indeed retained (Figure ). A Dubinin\u2212Radushkevich\n(DR) analysis gave a surface area of 718 m<sup>2</sup>/g, an average pore\nwidth of 6.2 \u00c5, and a micropore volume of 0.25 mL/g. The\nobserved rapid onset of CO<sub>2</sub> sorption at very low pressures is\ncharacteristic of the presence of micropores in the solid. Thus,\ndespite the formation of an amorphous solid upon dehydration,\nthe dry phase of <bold>2</bold> possessed a high degree of porosity. Figure\n also shows considerable hysteresis in the desorption curve.\nThe observed value for the energy of adsorption for CO<sub>2</sub> of\n21.0 kJ/mol is consistent with a physisorption process. A N<sub>2</sub>\nsorption isotherm, run at 77 K, with identical outgas conditions\nto the CO<sub>2</sub> analysis yielded a strikingly smaller surface area\n(15 m<sup>2</sup>/gm). Similar behavior has been reported by Pan et al.\nfor the Ln-based MOF, Er(1,4-phenylenediacetate), which\nshows pronounced CO<sub>2</sub> sorption but nonporous behavior toward\nN<sub>2</sub> and Ar. The authors attribute this observation to a combination of stronger affinity of the CO<sub>2</sub> for the host solid and also\na critical difference in kinetic diameters of the different sorbates\nrelative to the pores in the host. In our case, the DR analysis\nclearly indicates the pore size in the solid (6.4 \u00c5) is of sufficient\nsize to permit both CO<sub>2</sub> (3.30 \u00c5) and N<sub>2</sub> (3.64 \u00c5) access to the\nstructure. To further examine this, the CO<sub>2</sub> sorption experiment\nwas repeated at \u221242 \u00b0C using a dry ice/acetonitrile bath and\ngave a DR surface area of 210 m<sup>2</sup>/g. This result affirms that<bold> 2</bold>\nhas permanent pores accessible to CO<sub>2</sub>. This result also does\naffirm that there is activation of the solid by CO<sub>2</sub> sorption as\nwas inferred by the observed hysteresis on desorption. However,\nit would appear unlikely that the sorption of CO<sub>2</sub> is due\nexclusively to activation of the solid. This result is not that\nsurprising given that, using the building block approach, collapse\nto a completely dense solid is difficult. As will be discussed in\nthe luminescence section, the Ln center largely retains its nascent\ngeometry.\n\n\n</p><p>The 2,2\u2018-dipyridyl core used in the formation of complexes\n<bold>1</bold>\n<bold>\u2212</bold>\n<bold>5</bold> absorbs strongly in the UV region and is an attractive ligand\nfor sensitizing Eu, Dy, Sm, and Tb via the antenna effect. The\nligand, L, is fluorescent at room temperature and exhibits a broad\nemission band over the blue-green region of the visible spectrum\nwith a maximum appearing at 473 nm. The excitation spectrum\nshows two main peaks, 325 nm and 395 nm, with the lower\nenergy transition being the most intense. The triplet state of L\nwas determined from the 77 K phosphorescence spectrum\nobtained from the complexation with Gd, compound <bold>3</bold>, (Figure\n\n). The phosphorescence from the Gd chelate is justified by\nthe absence of any ionic resonance levels below the triplet state\nof the chelate. The triplet state energy levels were determined\nfrom the shortest-wavelength phosphorescence bands, which\nwere assumed to be the 0\u22120 transitions. As can be seen from\nFigure , three transitions, with the shortest occurring at 416\nnm (24\u2009038 cm<sup>-1</sup>), are observed. Thus, as shown in Figure ,\nthe triplet state of L lies above the emitting states of all the\nmetals investigated excluding Gd.

These units were then cross-linked into a network solid by addition of BaCl2 to form mixed-metal networks of formula {Ba2(H2O)4[LnL3(H2O)2](H2O) n Cl}\u221e, Ln = Sm3+ (1), Eu3+ (2), Gd3+ (3), Tb3+ (4), Dy3+ (5). The networks were isostructural and contained open channels which readily absorbed and desorbed water accompanied by a spongelike shrinkage and expansion of the host. CO2 sorption measurements confirmed microporosity giving a DR surface area of 718 m2/gm and an average pore size of 6.4 \u00c5. Ligand L sensitized all the lanthanide ions with the exception of Gd3+. Studying the series of Ln complexes allowed the determination of the triplet state energy of L which is itself a new ligand for sensitization purposes. The luminescent properties of the lanthanide building blocks were retained in the porous network solid. From the luminescence data, it was possible to attribute the spongelike properties of the network to the Ba2+ coordination sphere rather than the Ln3+ center. Networks were characterized by X-ray crystallography, PXRD, DSC/TGA, water vapor and gas sorption, and luminescence spectroscopy. \n\n Porosity. Given the openness of the structures, their stability and porosity were examined. Thermogravimetric analyses of 2 showed a steady mass loss to 105 \u00b0C corresponding to loss of both free and coordinated water molecules (13.29% obsd, 13.42% calcd). This sample was then stable to 320 \u00b0C. Powder X-ray diffraction measurements after dehydration showed the solid to be amorphous. Interestingly, single crystals of 2 allowed to dry still extinguished polarized light but would no longer diffract X-rays. The reversibility of the dehydration was examined by placing a sample of 2 on the TGA and heating to dehydration. This was followed by cooling and the introduction of water vapor. In 1 h, the dry sample resorbed 95% of the lost water and, notably, the solid regained order. This process was completely reversible as shown in Figure . If left for longer periods (days), even in the ambient atmosphere, dehydrated single crystals of 2 rehydrated such that the single crystal could be recollected with virtually identical cell parameters to the nascent solid. It was important to note that the amorphous nature of the dehydrated solid did not require a complete collapse of the network to a dense phase. Indeed, given the 3-fold chelated building block, contraction to a dense phase seemed quite unlikely. The porosity of 2 was further examined by gas sorption measurements. Upon outgassing for 5 h at 200 \u00b0C, a CO2 sorption isotherm, run at 273 K, confirmed a porous solid was indeed retained (Figure ). A Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) analysis gave a surface area of 718 m2/g, an average pore width of 6.2 \u00c5, and a micropore volume of 0.25 mL/g. The observed rapid onset of CO2 sorption at very low pressures is characteristic of the presence of micropores in the solid. Thus, despite the formation of an amorphous solid upon dehydration, the dry phase of 2 possessed a high degree of porosity. Figure  also shows considerable hysteresis in the desorption curve. The observed value for the energy of adsorption for CO2 of 21.0 kJ/mol is consistent with a physisorption process. A N2 sorption isotherm, run at 77 K, with identical outgas conditions to the CO2 analysis yielded a strikingly smaller surface area (15 m2/gm). Similar behavior has been reported by Pan et al. for the Ln-based MOF, Er(1,4-phenylenediacetate), which shows pronounced CO2 sorption but nonporous behavior toward N2 and Ar. The authors attribute this observation to a combination of stronger affinity of the CO2 for the host solid and also a critical difference in kinetic diameters of the different sorbates relative to the pores in the host. In our case, the DR analysis clearly indicates the pore size in the solid (6.4 \u00c5) is of sufficient size to permit both CO2 (3.30 \u00c5) and N2 (3.64 \u00c5) access to the structure. To further examine this, the CO2 sorption experiment was repeated at -42 \u00b0C using a dry ice/acetonitrile bath and gave a DR surface area of 210 m2/g. This result affirms that 2 has permanent pores accessible to CO2. This result also does affirm that there is activation of the solid by CO2 sorption as was inferred by the observed hysteresis on desorption. However, it would appear unlikely that the sorption of CO2 is due exclusively to activation of the solid. This result is not that surprising given that, using the building block approach, collapse to a completely dense solid is difficult. As will be discussed in the luminescence section, the Ln center largely retains its nascent geometry.   \n\nThe 2,2\u2018-dipyridyl core used in the formation of complexes 1 - 5 absorbs strongly in the UV region and is an attractive ligand for sensitizing Eu, Dy, Sm, and Tb via the antenna effect. The ligand, L, is fluorescent at room temperature and exhibits a broad emission band over the blue-green region of the visible spectrum with a maximum appearing at 473 nm. The excitation spectrum shows two main peaks, 325 nm and 395 nm, with the lower energy transition being the most intense. The triplet state of L was determined from the 77 K phosphorescence spectrum obtained from the complexation with Gd, compound 3, (Figure  ). The phosphorescence from the Gd chelate is justified by the absence of any ionic resonance levels below the triplet state of the chelate. The triplet state energy levels were determined from the shortest-wavelength phosphorescence bands, which were assumed to be the 0-0 transitions. As can be seen from Figure , three transitions, with the shortest occurring at 416 nm (24038 cm-1), are observed. Thus, as shown in Figure , the triplet state of L lies above the emitting states of all the metals investigated excluding Gd. As a result, L is capable of sensitizing the trivalent ions Sm, 1; Eu, 2; Tb, 4; and Dy, 5, with particularly strong emissions observed from complexes 2 and 4.   \n\n Structural Transformations and the Nature of the Dehydrated State. Structural dynamics in MOFs are increasingly observed. More detailed information on the nature of the dehydrated state was sought because it was amorphous but, at the same time, retained porosity and underwent ready rehydration to its nascent form. To relate the observed surface area to the single crystal structure, Connolly surfaces43 were calculated for compound 2 in two scenarios, first with the noncoordinated water molecules occupying the channels removed and then with both free and coordinated water molecules removed. In the former case, a surface area of 695 m2/gm was obtained, and in  the latter case, a surface area of 963 m2/gm was modeled. In the Ba sulfonate solids we have prepared, we have observed typically that, upon loss of coordinated water from the Ba coordination sphere, the solid shifts structure to optimally arrange the remaining sulfonate O donor atoms about the metal ion. Thus, it was not expected that 2, less the water molecules, would retain exactly the framework observed in the single crystal structure. More likely the framework would contract to fill the void space created. This structural shift was observed to occur, but nonetheless, the dehydrated solid still retained a high degree of porosity as evidenced by the measured surface area of 718 m2/gm. Based on the calculated Connolly surfaces, this value is less than that expected by retention of the parent framework in an unaltered form. Qualitatively, for purposes of envisioning the degree of porosity, the extent of the structural contraction results in pores roughly equivalent to those expected for loss of only the noncoordinated water molecules in 2. \n\n Conclusions. We have reported a series of isostructural lanthanide-containing metal-organic frameworks which demonstrate permanent microporosity but also incorporate predictable photophysical properties. Key to both the porosity and the fluorescence is the use of a stepwise assembly approach. The pores in 1 - 5 form due to the use of a chelated Ln coordination complex as a \"clusterlike\" node in a net. Dehydration resulted in a contraction, but not collapse, of the frameworks, to an amorphous material. Reversible rehydration to the nascent solid was readily observed. Furthermore, a DR surface area of 718  m2/g for the dehydrated form of compound 2 was measured by CO2 sorption, the rigid building block enabling the formation of this porous material. Beyond serving as a structural tool, the Ln building block complex represented a predictable phosphor. Owing to this stepwise approach, the photophysical properties of the networks paralleled those of the respective building block with strong emissions observed for the Eu and Tb analogues, 2 and 4. Luminescence spectroscopy was also employed as a diagnostic tool to gain additional insight to the nature of the amorphous microporous state. These results serve to illustrate the potential of a stepwise assembly approach to MOFs both with regard to sustaining porous structures and for purposes of incorporating predictable physical properties. From a more general perspective, the coupling of permanent porosity and luminescence in a material has interesting prospects for the development of (gas) sensor materials.
