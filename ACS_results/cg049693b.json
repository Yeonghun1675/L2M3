Two L  2   and two Cd(II) ions form a 40-membered metallomacrocyclic ring with Cd\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cd distances of ca. 9.49 \u00c5. Overlapping of the Cd2 L  2   2 rings with Cd(II) as the nodes forms an infinite nonpenetrating loop-chain (Figure ). Compared to the double-bridged chain formed from flexible 4,4\u2018-bispyridyl ligands and a M(NO3)2 system, no aromatic molecule templates here lead to the alternative tetrakis-pyridyl framework. It is noteworthy that in the 3D framework (Figure S, Supporting Information) of 2 constructed by C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bonds (as listed in Table 1S, Supporting Information) among the 1D loop chains, channels as shown in Figure S (Supporting Information) are formed and EtOH molecules are enclathrated within. The enclathration is not the result of hetero recognition, but intermolecular C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bonds of guest molecules during the self-recognition.
