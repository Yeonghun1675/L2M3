It should be noted that the deviation of the hexacoordinate Co2 ions from ideal O h symmetry in 2 (CShM value = 1.08) is smaller than that in 1 (CShM value = 1.39) (), suggesting the slight movement of the coordinated atoms around Co2 during the structural transformation from 1 to 2. Additionally, the O3W-H3WB\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O1WA hydrogen bond is obviously shortened from 3.492 \u00c5 for 1 to 3.288 \u00c5 for 2 ( and Table S4), as well as the Co2-O3W bond (1: Co2-O3W = 2.151 \u00c5; 2: Co2-O3W = 2.137 \u00c5) (Table S3). Such shortening (\u0394d = 0.20 \u00c5) of the O3W-H3WB\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O1WA hydrogen bond from 1 to 2 is more obvious than the changes (|\u0394d| = 0.04-0.07 \u00c5) of other hydrogen bonds (), indicating the coordinated O3W becomes more stable in 2 and thus higher temperature is necessary to remove the remaining O3W, whilst 3 has the trend of transformation to 2 due to the unsaturated coordination numbers (n = 5) of Co2 ions, which are more distorted from D 3h coordination geometry (CShM value = 1.88) in comparison to the Co3 center in 2 (CShM value = 1.50) ().
