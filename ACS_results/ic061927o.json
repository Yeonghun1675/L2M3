In the present work, only 2c can be successfully synthesized directly from CuCN. In situ generation of CuCN by slow decomposiition of CuSCN may favor the assembly of the supramolecular networks. Therefore, the strategy of in situ yielding of CuCN from CuSCN may be important for the synthesis of these compounds.
