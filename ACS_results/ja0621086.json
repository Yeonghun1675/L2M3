Because the resolution is better, the MQMAS results provide the most meaningful values for the second-order quadrupolar powder parameters. Table  summarizes data of quadrupolar patterns fits from 3QMAS experiments as well as results of MAS spectrum fits. Because of the highly contrasted NMR parameters, the structural NMR assignment of the aluminum sites can easily be done. It is based on a prior knowledge of the structural description. The signal, which has the smallest quadrupole-coupling constant, is assigned to Al4 site. Indeed, this aluminum is only partially attached to the framework, and due to its flexibility within the structure, the corresponding quadrupolar interaction would be consequently reduced. The signal with the largest quadrupole-coupling constant, which indicates the highest distortion of the Al complexes, is assigned to Al1 site of the trimeric cluster. These aluminum atoms have fewer regular Al-O distance distributions than the other Al sites due to the presence of Al-\u03bc 3-O bonds. Moreover, the coordination of water molecules to these trimeric cluster aluminums  contributes to more disorder within their local environments. The most intense signal is attributed to the Al2 site since this aluminum is the most abundant crystallographic site. Finally, the Al3 site would present a relatively moderate quadrupole coupling constant as it is sitting on a special crystallographic position. According to these signal attributions, line integrals agree with the crystallographic stoichiometry of Al12O(OH)18(H2O)3(Al2(OH)4)[btc]6\u22c524H2O. In the chemical formula of MIL-96, 14 aluminums are associated to four different sites: Al1:A2:Al3:Al4, respecting the ratio 3:6:3:2, respectively. The corresponding ratio determined by simulation of the NMR spectrum was as follows: 3.2:6.3:3.1:1.4, very close to the expected values. Nevertheless, the amount of the Al4 appears somewhat underestimated, presumably due to the fact that the stoichiometry of this site within the structure varies from a sample to sample. Indeed, its relative NMR signal intensity changed significantly for different samples. Since XRD and NMR analyses have been done on two samples from different batches, the stoichiometry of Al4 site could be different.

Its low intensity is due to the lack of efficiency of the excitation/reconversion of the triple-quantum coherences for this large QCC. Its quadrupolar parameters were estimated from an additional MQMAS experiment optimized for higher QCC, degrading consequently the low QCC sites (see Supporting Information) and from the MAS simulation (see Figure ).
