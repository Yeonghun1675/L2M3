The same initial reactants in different solvent medium can tune the structural diversities of coordination assemblies. Compound 1 was synthesized by using a mixture of three solvents (acetonitrile/ammonia-water/deionized water ~ 12:4:1), while 2 was obtained without acetonitrile in the reaction system (ammonia-water/deionized water ~ 1:1), and 3 was prepared during the reaction medium of acetonitrile and water (ca. 2:1) in the presence of chloride. The synthesis of 2 indicates that the ammonia-water as basic medium plays an important role in the formation of the final metallomacrocyclic structure, and water molecules can be used to coordinate to central copper(II) ions to prevent its further extension and act as hydrogen bonding linkers to form supramolecular architecture simultaneously.

The \u03c7m T value of 1 is 0.445 cm3 mol-1 K at 300 K, slightly larger than that expected for an uncoupled Cu(II) ion with g = 2.0 (0.375 cm3 mol-1 K), thus supporting the presence of antiferromagnetic interactions between Cu(II) ions. The \u03c7m T curve exhibits a continuous decrease upon cooling down to a value very close to zero. For 2, The \u03c7m T data shows a behavior characteristic of very weak coupled Cu(II) systems, comparable to isolated mononuclear species containing such a metal center. This way, the magnetic susceptibility value at 300 K is 0.344 cm3 mol-1 K, being slightly less than the spin-only value (0.375 cm3 mol-1 K) of one isolated Cu(II) ion. Between 25 and 300 K for 1, 80 and 300 K for 2, the \u03c7-1 versus T curves can be well fit by the Curie-Weiss law, leading to the following parameters: for 1, C = 0.466 cm3 mol-1 K, \u03b8 = -33.137 K; for 2, C = 0.374 cm3 mol-1 K, \u03b8 = -62.482 K (). The negative \u03b8 values indicate antiferromagnetic coupling dominating these systems. However, the \u03c7m T value of 3 is 0.75 cm3 mol-1 K at 300 K, which is appreciably lower than the theoretical value of 0.936 cm3 mol-1 K for two and a half uncoupled S = 1/2 spins. There is not a plateau at room temperature owing to the presence of both intra- and intercluster antiferromagnetic coupling. It is noteworthy that the \u03c7m T values of 3 continuously decrease upon cooling and reach to the minimum value (0.289 cm3 mol-1 K) at 8 K and then increase to 0.382 cm3 mol-1 K at 2 K, which exhibits weak ferromagnetic behavior at low temperature for 3. Between 140 and 290 K, the \u03c7-1 versus T data can be well fit by the Curie-Weiss law with C = 1.00 cm3 mol-1 K, \u03b8 = -135.056 K ().

With regard to 3, the first weight loss of 3.27% from room temperature to 125 \u00b0C corresponds to removal of a water molecule (calculated 3.26%), and then the 3D framework loses weight from 125 to 264 \u00b0C (observed 6.60%, calculated 6.56%) revealing evacuation of one coordinated water and half a HCl composed by half a hydrogen cation and half a chloride per formula unit. Then, the decomposition of the btca ligand, with the framework collapse, occurs upon heating subsequently. After 3 was outgased, with heating at 140 and 280 \u00b0C under vacuum, respectively, the PXRD patterns were similar to the simulated pattern of 3 (Figure ), which suggests that the desolvated framework keeps its crystalline state.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "200", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "stable", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "2", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "177", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "removal of five waters", "condition": "low stability after the release of water molecules"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "3", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "125", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "removal of a water molecule", "condition": ""}, {"value": "125 to 264", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "evacuation of one coordinated water and half a HCl", "condition": ""}, {"value": "140 and 280", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "desolvated framework keeps its crystalline state", "condition": "under vacuum"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["decomposition_temperature"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['decomposition_temperature']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n  {\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"name\": \"\",\n      \"symbol\": \"1\",\n      \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"decomposition temperature\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"200\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"stable\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"name\": \"\",\n      \"symbol\": \"2\",\n      \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"decomposition temperature\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"177\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"removal of five waters\",\n        \"condition\": \"low stability after the release of water molecules\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"name\": \"\",\n      \"symbol\": \"3\",\n      \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"decomposition temperature\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"125\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"removal of a water molecule\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"value\": \"125 to 264\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"evacuation of one coordinated water and half a HCl\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"value\": \"140 and 280\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"desolvated framework keeps its crystalline state\",\n        \"condition\": \"under vacuum\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 6, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Syntheses of Complexes <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>3</bold>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"ic-2011-01571n_0008.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Syntheses of Complexes 1-3    ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 16, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Coordination environment of Cu<sup>2+</sup> ion in <bold>1</bold>.
