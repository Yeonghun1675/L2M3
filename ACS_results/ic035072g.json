Because of the unusually long M-M separations between the layers along the c-axis (>12 \u00c5), the dipole-dipole interactions between the adjacent layers should be considerably weak, suggesting a low-dimensional behavior. The alternating-current (ac) magnetic susceptibility of 1 measured at different frequencies (shown in Figure a) is strongly frequency-dependent below 5-6 K, precluding a three-dimensional ordering. The magnetic relaxation obeys the Arrhenius law (\u03c4 = \u03c40 exp(\u0394/k B T)), suggesting a thermally activated mechanism. The best Arrhenius fitting gives \u03c40 = 3.4 \u00d7 10-10 s and \u0394/k B = 50.5(5) K. At a fixed temperature 3.76 K around the cusp of out of phase \u03c7\u2018\u2018, a semicircle Cole-Cole diagram is obtained (\u03c7\u2018\u2018 vs \u03c7\u2018), as shown in Figure b. This can be fitted by a generalized Debye model with \u03b1 = 0.3, indicating a distribution of relaxation time.
