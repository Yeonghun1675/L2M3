In this new compound, the 3D porous frameworks and the (H2O)26 water shells in compound 2 were well maintained except that the H(H2O)28 + was substituted by a new ionic water cluster, K(H2O)27 + (Figure , right). Generally speaking, a restricted cavity can be filled with an ion surrounded by the maximum of water molecules, the first hydrated shell, which largely depends on the size of the ion and the second hydrated shell confined by the cavity. A K+ ion is not able to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, but it can be coordinated by water molecules. Since the hydration energy of K+ (322 kJ/mol) is several times higher than the energy of hydrogen bonding between water molecules, the K+ ion tends to locate in the interior of the water cluster so as to form K-O(water) coordination bonds as much as possible. Borrowing the off-centered structures of the ionic water clusters predicted by computational investigations, especially for the case of Cs(H2O)27 +  consisting of a H2O-Cs+ ion center core and a (H2O)26 water shell, the potassium ion water cluster in compound 3 was determined as a clathrate structure made up of a water shell (H2O)26 and a H2O-K+ ionic center core by X-ray diffractions and relevant spectroscopic studies shown above.
