In high concentrations, uremic retention solutes are referred to as uremic toxins since they can become toxic to many physiological systems, causing issues like organ failure. In one example, p-cresol, one of the well-studied uremic toxins, synthesized by enteric bacteria disrupts a wide variety of biological activities, including endothelial dysfunction and the suppression of respiratory burst action in the blood.

We soaked single crystals of NU-1000 in potassium p-cresyl sulfate solution and attempted SCXRD analysis (Table S2). However, the aromatic region of p-cresyl sulfate is too diffuse and disordered to extract positions (Figures S4). Guided by the SCXRD data, the stable structure of p-cresyl sulfate was extracted using density functional theory (DFT, see ). As displayed in , p-cresyl sulfate is sited in two different locations at approximately the same occupancy within NU-1000. In both cases, the average O-O distances from the hydroxyl/water group on Zr6-node to the sulfate moiety of p-cresyl sulfate in the triangular pore and the hexagonal mesopore were determined to be 2.37 \u00c5, a distance indicative of hydrogen bonding (c and S5). The p-cresyl sulfate in the large hexagonal mesopore (Site 1) is perpendicular to the pyrene region and interacts with the phenyl substituent of pyrene linker at a distance reasonable for \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction (4.24 \u00c5). In contrast to Site 1, p-cresyl sulfate in the triangle small pore (Site 2) lies parallel to the pyrene region (c) and interacts with two neighboring pyrene linkers (5.20 \u00c5) (Figure S5c).

These results indicate that not only electrostatic interactions and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions are factors in uremic toxin adsorption, but also maximizing these interactions through careful topology design can be important to capture p-cresyl sulfate. Specifically, the high p-cresyl sulfate uptake by NU-1000 is caused by highly hydrophobic adsorption sites sandwiched by two pyrene linkers and the nearby hydroxyl group on the Zr6 nodes capable of hydrogen bonding with the ionic functional groups of the adsorbates, all of which are carefully positioned (geometric parameters for \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions are summarized in Table S3 and S4). Consequently, the UiO-type MOFs and MOF-808 with insufficient \u03c0-conjugated system and/or hydroxyl groups on Zr6 nodes offered low p-cresyl sulfate uptake. Although NU-1200 has large pore sizes allowing for rapid diffusion, steric repulsion can exist between p-cresyl sulfate and the methyl group on the linker, preventing adsorption in NU-1200. To understand how the structure of MOF linker affects uptake, we compared NU-1000, NU-1010, and PCN-608-OH. The three MOFs have the same (4,8)-connected network with csq net and similar porosity, but only NU-1000 exhibited high removal efficiency. NU-1010 has smaller \u03c0-conjugated linkers, and its uptake efficiency is only 29% since the \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions of p-cresyl with biphenyl at Site 2 are weaker than those with pyrene. Moreover, the linker in PCN-608-OH is structurally similar to the linker in NU-1010 except the 4,4'-positions of the biphenyl are substituted with a hydroxyl group. As a result, the uptake decreased to 4.6% likely owing to the steric hindrance caused by the hydroxyl groups (Figure S9).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 9, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig3\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) The crystal structure of NU-1000 viewed down the <italic>c</italic>-axis and (b) an orthogonal view prior to <italic>p</italic>-cresyl\nsulfate exposure (each adsorption site is depicted by a colored oval).\n(c) Optimized geometry of <italic>p</italic>-cresyl sulfate-pyrene\nand Zr<sub>6</sub> node domains after <italic>p</italic>-cresyl sulfate\nadsorption.

Under our conditions, we measured a comparable average of 82 \u00b1 5% of p-cresyl sulfate adsorbed on HSA at the initial concentration (Ci) range of 0.01 to 0.1 mM (Figure S18). We investigated the removal of p-cresyl sulfate from HSA by NU-1000. First, to understand the adsorption behavior of p-cresyl sulfate on HSA, adsorption isotherms were constructed (b). We used the Freundlich model to fit for p-cresyl sulfate adsorption on HSA at 310 K. From the Freundlich parameters (Table S6), NU-1000 displayed higher gravimetric uptake of p-cresyl sulfate on HSA and larger adsorption constant, K F, than that of HSA. We also calculated molar uptake on each adsorbent (Figure S19). Additionally, NU-1000 maintains p-cresyl sulfate affinity in the presence of competing salt ions in aqueous solution of 0.2 M NaCl (Figure S20). With these results in mind, we hypothesized that the removal efficiency of p-cresyl sulfate from HSA could be estimated by comparing the predicted uptakes given by Freundlich parameters before the competitive adsorption in the presence of salt. From the derived Freundlich parameters, the predicted uptake for each adsorbent, Q e, can be described by .       Q   e    ( mg    g   - 1   )  =   K   F   \u00d7   C   1 / n      1 where C is the residual concentration of p-cresyl sulfate, and 1/n is the degree of nonlinearity (Table S6).

In , dotted line shows the predicted removal fraction of p-cresyl sulfate on each adsorbent. Herein, M HSA = 50 mg, M NU-1000 = 2.5, 10, 20, 30 mg, and C = 0.001 to 0.1 mM.
