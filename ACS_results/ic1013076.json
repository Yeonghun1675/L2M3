The variety of magnetic properties which arises from different M<sup>III</sup>/M<sup>II</sup> pairs does not affect the very high SHG efficiency. In view of this tunability of the magnetic properties and of the particular structural arrangement, we extended our investigation to the Co<sup>II</sup> members of this new class of hybrid mixed oxalates. The aim was to obtain a hybrid material with both high second order NLO properties and possibly Single Chain Magnet (SCM) ones.

More promising results were obtained with the Ni<sup>II</sup> derivatives, with improved intrachain exchange interactions.

It is indeed well-known that, to obtain slow relaxation of the magnetization at low temperature, beyond a good isolation between adjacent magnetic chains, the second necessary property is a strong anisotropy of at least one magnetic center. In this respect both Co<sup>II</sup> and Ln<sup>III</sup> containing systems, with the large magnetic anisotropy imposed by these metal centers, are currently actively being investigated to obtain new SCM systems. Following this expectation recently a dysprosium-radical derivative has been shown to behave as a SCM at low temperature while keeping the features of a second order NLO active material.
