Then, triethylamine (~1 mmol) was added quickly to the reaction mixture under stirring. The reaction was continued at room temperature (RT) in the dark overnight. The next day, the sample was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min; the white precipitate of the complex was washed at least five times with MeOH and then stored under vacuum for further use.\n\nSynthesis and Crystallization of 0-D NC \n\nIn a glass vial, ~0.3 mmol of [Ag-S t Bu] n  and ~0.2 mmol of AgCF3COO were mixed in 5 mL of CH3CN and stirred for ~5 min. Then, 4 mL of a soluble DMF solution of PPh4Cl (~0.04 mmol) was immediately added to the reaction mixture with stirring, and the reaction was continued for ~2 h at RT. After filtration, the filtrate was allowed to evaporate slowly at room temperature in the dark under ambient conditions. After 9-12 days, colorless crystals were obtained. The average yield of 0-D NC was 47.8% (based on Ag).\n\nSynthesis and Crystallization of a 1-D NCF and 2-D NCF Mixture\n\nIn a glass vial, ~0.34 mmol of [Ag-S t Bu] n , ~0.26 mmol of AgCF3COO, and ~0.38 mmol of bpy were mixed together in 5 mL of CH3CN with stirring for ~5 min. Then, 4 mL of a soluble DMF solution of PPh4Cl (~0.06 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture, and the reaction was continued under stirring for ~2 h at room temperature. The filtrate was then allowed to evaporate slowly at RT in the dark under ambient conditions. Large reddish crystals of 1-D NCF in addition to small 2-D NCF crystals were obtained after 1 week of crystallization. The average yield of 1-D NCF was 35.6% (based on Ag).\n\nSynthesis and Crystallization of 2-D NCF \n\nIn a glass vial, 0.3 mmol of [Ag-S t Bu] n , 0.2 mmol of AgCF3COO, and 0.3 mmol of bpy were mixed together in 5 mL of CH3CN with stirring for ~5 min. Then, 4 mL of a soluble DMF solution of PPh4Cl (0.04 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture, and the reaction was continued under stirring for ~2 h at room temperature. The filtrate was then allowed to evaporate slowly at RT in the dark under ambient conditions. Colorless rodlike crystals were obtained after 1 week of crystallization. The average yield of 2-D NCF was 55.6% (based on Ag).", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "[Ag-S t Bu] n Complex", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "processes": [{"synthesis method": "chemical
