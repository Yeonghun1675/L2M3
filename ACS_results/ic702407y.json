For compound 1, the weight loss of 1.44% (calcd 1.36%) below 190 \u00b0C was attributed to the release of the crystal water molecules. According to the differential thermal analysis curve, the anhydrous compound began to decompose at 345 \u00b0C. In the range of 345-650 \u00b0C, the weight loss of 15.16% was assigned to the decomposition of bipy ligands and POMs. The whole weight loss (16.60%) is in good agreement with the calculated value (16.55%). The anhydrous compound, 2, was stable up to 350 \u00b0C. Upon further heating, weight loss was caused by the decomposition of bipy ligands and POMs (exptl,19.29%; calcd,19.12%). The TG curves of 3 and 4 showed a multistep weight loss: the first weight losses of 0.78% for 3 (calcd 0.75%) and 0.59% for 4 (calcd 0.54%) below 160 \u00b0C were assigned to the removal of H2O, and the second continuous weight losses of 12.08% for 3 (calcd 11.94%) and 15.93% for 4 (calcd 16.33%) at ca. 340-630 \u00b0C may be ascribed to the decomposition of 4,4'-bipy ligands and POMs, respectively.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']"}}, {"idx": 41, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Electrochemical Properties</title><p>POMs have been exploited extensively in the electrocatalytic reductions by a chemically modified electrode (CME), because of the ability to undergo reversible multielectron redox processes.
