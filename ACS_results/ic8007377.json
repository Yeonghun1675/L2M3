This may be attributed to the smaller channel aperture after dehydration compared to the kinetic diameters of N2 and CO2. We have also measured the sorption properties with MeOH (4.0 \u00c5) and H2O (2.65 \u00c5) vapor at 298 K, which is shown in  and , respectively. Framework 1' shows a type II sorption profile with MeOH and about 0.18 molecule of MeOH included per formula unit. This is also consistent with the different PXRD patterns with MeOH compared to those of 1' (). On the other hand, framework 3' does not uptake any MeOH, which is also supported by the PXRD patterns similar to those of the dehydrated sample (). The H2O sorption profile of 1' (Figure ) reveals a gradual uptake up to P/P 0 = 0.36 and then a steep uptake up to P/P 0 = 0.54 with a small step at P/P 0 = 0.44.

Both of the profiles were analyzed by the Dubinin-Radushkevich equation, and the values of \u03b2E 0 are 9.68 (1') and 6.92 (3') kJ/mol, which reflect the adsorbate-adsorbent affinity, indicating that 1' is rather more hydrophilic than 3'.
