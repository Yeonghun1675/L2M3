The asymmetric unit of JLU-Liu14 is made up of two independent copper atoms, two ligand molecules, and one iodine ion. The copper atoms exhibit two different coordination modes; Cu1 atom is 1+ and displays tetrahedral [CuN2I2] geometry with two N atoms from two individual 4-PmBC ligands and two iodine ions (Figure S3a, ). Two Cu(I) atoms are coordinated together by two iodine anions to afford a bimetallic Cu2I2 dimer unit with the Cu(I)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu(I) distance about 2.601 \u00c5, which can be simplified into a 4-connected node (Figure ). The Cu2 atom is 2+ and displays square pyramidal [CuNO4] geometry with one N atom and four O atoms from five distinct 4-PmBC ligands (Figure S3b, ). Two Cu (II) atoms are bridged by four carboxylate groups in a bridging bidentate fashion to give a classical Cu2(CO2)4 paddle-wheel unit with the Cu (II)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu (II) distance about 2.631 \u00c5, in which the axial positions are occupied by two pyrimidinyl N-donors from another two different 4-PmBC ligands, and the copper paddle-wheel unit can be simplified into a 6-connected node (Figure ). The Cu1-N bond distance is in the range of 2.063-2.072 \u00c5. The Cu1-I bond distance is in the range of 2.6193-2.6514 \u00c5. The Cu2-O and Cu2-N bond distances are in the range of 1.954-1.973 and 2.687 \u00c5, respectively. The different oxidation states of Cu ions are confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Figure S4, ). In the structure of JLU-Liu14, the 4-PmBC ligand adopts two types of coordination modes, possessing similar dihedral angles between two aromatic rings and different distorted angles between the aromatic rings and carboxyl (Figure S5, ), which can be simplified into a 3-connected and 2-connected nodes, respectively (Figure ). Thus, the 3D framework of JLU-Liu14 can be described as a novel (3,4,6)-connected net referring to the RCSR database (Figure S6a, ), which exhibit two distinct tiles: [56.92] and [518.92] (Figure S7, ).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 11, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Ligand, Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub> dimer unit, and Cu<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub> paddle-wheel unit can be viewed as 2,3,4,6-connected nodes.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cg-2014-01730q_0002.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Ligand, Cu2I2 dimer unit, and Cu2(CO2)4 paddle-wheel unit can be viewed as 2,3,4,6-connected nodes.
