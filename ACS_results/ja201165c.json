In total, 2 TBA molecules were located in I, 2 in II, 4 in III, and 8 in IV per unit cell. The strength of TBA-framework interactions may be differentiated by (i) the short-range interactions between the TBA molecule and oxygen atoms of the POMOFs through HTBA\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Otrim or HTBA\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5OPOM interactions, and (ii) the amplitude of the stabilization energy, \u0394E(TBAi). Distinctions also arise from the type of POMs it interacts with, that is, POM-1 and/or POM-2. TBA in I seems to play a distinctive role by templating 4-membered rings of interconnected POMs, with a stabilization energy of -55.5 kcal mol-1 per TBA, by far the highest of the four sites. These TBA have interactions with the two subnetworks of POMs, with frequent HTBA\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O(POM,trim) contacts at typical distances of 2.6-2.9 \u00c5. By contrast, TBA in II and III molecules interacts less strongly with the POMOF framework, with stabilization energies of -44 and -37.4 kcal mol-1 per TBA, respectively. The weakest stabilization energy emanates from the 8 TBA molecules in IV (-34.8 kcal mol-1 per TBA). They tend to aggregate as dimers within the \u03b5(trim)  4/3  structure. These computational results indeed suggest that TBA molecules may play a key structure directing role or a space filling role depending on their location in the channels (). In parallel, the absence of crystallization of \u03b5(trim)  4/3  or of any other crystallized form in the absence of TBA is one strong supportive observation of its structure directing role.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 38, "type": "table", "classification": null, "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl3\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Host\u2013Guest van der Waals Interaction Energy in kcal mol<sup>\u20131</sup> unit cell<sup>\u20131</sup> (Normalized per TBA Molecule) and Structural Features of the Four Different Template Sites in the <bold>\u03b5(trim)</bold>\n<sub>\n<bold>4/3</bold>\n</sub> Structure</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"6\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\"/\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col6\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\"></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\u0394<italic toggle=\"yes\">E</italic>(TBA<sub>i</sub>)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">N</italic>(H-bond)/<italic toggle=\"yes\">d</italic>(\u00c5)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">POM subnetwork</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">form</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">N</italic>(TBA<sub>i</sub>)/uc</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>site I</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u201355.5</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>20/2.6\u20132.9</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>POM-2,1 (4-rings)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>monomer</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>site II</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u201343.9</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>4/2.9</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>POM-2</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>monomer</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>site III</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u201337.4</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>12/2.7\u20133</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>POM-2</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>monomer</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>4</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>site IV</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u201334.8</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>9/2.65\u20133</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>POM-2,1 (channels)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>dimer</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>8</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 39, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig6\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>6</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Positions of TBA molecules obtained from simulations within the <bold>ofp</bold>-like <bold>\u03b5(trim)</bold>\n<sub>\n<bold>4/3</bold>\n</sub> crystal structure.
