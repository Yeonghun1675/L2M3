It is not surprising, therefore, that the \u03bceff(T) dependence, as well as the character of variation of the Cu-N and Cu-ONO bond lengths for \u03b1-Cu(hfac)2L\u22c50.5C5H12 (Figure ), are similar to those for Cu(hfac)2L\u22c50.5C7H16 (Figure ). For \u03b2-Cu(hfac)2L\u22c50.5C5H12 and Cu(hfac)2L\u22c50.5Et2O, the Cu-ONO distances are the largest among the solvates and change only insignificantly with a decrease in the temperature (Figure ), while the Cu-N distances decrease considerably. Because the CuO6 units, involving the >N-\u22c5O-CuII-O\u22c5-N< exchange clusters, do not undergo any pronounced changes in structure, the \u03bceff(T) curve for these compounds does not show any magnetic anomalies (Figure ).
