Upon removal of solvent molecules, MOFs in the MIL-88 series assume a state where their pores are closed and cannot be probed using gas sorption experiments. In contrast, the rigidity of interpenetrated MIL-126(Fe) allows it to be activated without a significant change in pore size, enabling these materials to adsorb nitrogen gas (reported surface areas of 1690-1750 m2 g-1). As expected, 1 had a much lower nitrogen uptake than 1-AA, indicating that the unmodulated sample adopts the low porosity closed conformation characteristic of noninterpenetrated MIL-88D. Interestingly, the isotherm for 1-AA exhibits Type IV mesoporosity, suggestive of a defective material, with S BET = 879 m2 g-1.\n\nFormic Acid (FA)\n\nHighly crystalline material corresponding to MIL-126(Fe) could be obtained with one or more equivalents of FA, with an increasing amount of modulator giving a similar reduction in yield as seen with AA. The N2 uptake also increases with the addition of more modulator, but in contrast to AA, samples prepared with FA do not exhibit significant mesoporosity, indicating that the degree of defectivity in these samples is lower. Additionally, the approximate linker/cluster ratios based on TGA are generally close to the ideal value, which suggests that these samples contain approximately three linkers per cluster and are not significantly defective. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms show that the highest uptake is obtained with 1-FA (15 equiv), with a corresponding S BET = 1871 m2 g-1 slightly higher than the previously reported value of 1750 m2 g-1 but still lower than the value of 2550 m2 g-1 predicted for an ideal material. SEM imaging shows that 1-FA (20 equiv) has a distinctly different morphology which consists of spherical arrangements of smaller fused sheets rather than the more block-like crystals apparent in the other samples. The lower uptake could be a direct result of this morphology, which may reduce the pore continuity, making some of the pores inaccessible to nitrogen diffusion. Aside from this sample, the rest consist mostly of well-defined and regular single crystals, which increase in size from around 10 to 40 \u03bcm as the modulator concentration is increased, with 1-FA (30 equiv) giving perfectly faceted single crystals but in very low yield. As with AA modulation, some additional rod-like crystals can be seen in the samples prepared with 1-10 equiv of FA, again suggesting some noninterpenetrated MIL-88D(Fe) is present at lower modulator concentrations.\n\nTrifluoroacetic Acid (TFA)\n\nThe low pK a of TFA (0.23 compared to 4.76 for AA) was expected to lead to more defective samples, as has been reported for UiO-66. PXRD indicates that the interpenetrated MOF can be prepared with addition of 0.5-5 equiv of TFA, but SEM revealed a significant proportion of hexagonal rods corresponding to MIL-88D(Fe) in all samples. Furthermore, the porosities are relatively low, with a maximum S BET = 612 m2 g-1 for 1-TFA (5 equiv), suggesting TFA is a poor modulator for this system.\n\nThe unmodulated sample has a relatively high nitrogen uptake, with a corresponding S BET = 637 m2 g-1, but use of a modulator greatly enhances the porosity. The combination of FeCl2 and 1 equiv of AA yielded 1'-AA (1 equiv) with S BET = 2416 m2 g-1, the highest value obtained in this study and close to the predicted maximum of 2550 m2 g-1 for a pristine MIL-126(Fe) sample. No significant hysteresis is present, even when 20 equiv of AA is used, suggesting little or no defect induction. SEM imaging of the samples (c-f) shows that they are of a much higher quality than the corresponding equivalents using FeCl3. The unmodulated samples 1' and 1'-AA (20 equiv) consist of intergrown crystallites possessing distinctive crystalline faces, while 1'-AA (1 equiv) and 1'-HCl (1 equiv) consist of single crystals typical of MIL-126(Fe) as well as arrangements of intergrown crystallites. The decrease in porosity and sample quality when the concentration of AA is increased from 1 to 20 equiv suggests that, compared to analogous synthesis using FeCl3, synthesis with FeCl2 requires much less modulator for optimal porosity and crystallinity.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "Chromium(III) Terephthalate"}, "surface area": [{"type": "BET",
