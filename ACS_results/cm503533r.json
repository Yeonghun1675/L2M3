The \"as-synthesized\" MOF trans-[Sm(HL)(DMA)2]\u22c5DMA\u22c52H2O was fully activated at 393 K under vacuum to give a new single-crystal form cis-[Sm(HL)(DMA)2]. The activated cis-[Sm(HL)(DMA)2] material underwent structural transformation during the adsorption of CO2 and CH2Cl2. The CO2 and CH2Cl2 isotherms provide comprehensive experimental evidence for the connection between the structural changes and the observed stepwise and hysteretic sorption features. A detailed characterization of the structures of trans-[Sm(HL)(DMA)2]\u22c5DMA\u22c52H2O and cis-[Sm(HL)(DMA)2] indicate that the mechanism involves coordinated DMA molecules acting as molecular gates by switching from cis to trans coordination around the Sm to open the framework, thereby providing additional adsorption capacity. The endothermic structural transformation for adsorption of carbon dioxide is driven by the enthalpy of adsorption and entropic effects. Kinetic studies indicate that the mechanism involves CO2 diffusion along the pores developed as the structural change progresses. The adsorption induced structural transformation of cis-[Sm(HL)(DMA)2] and hysteretic desorption behavior allows for the capture of CO2 at high pressure but storage and transport at lower pressure. Adsorption of CH4, H2, O2, and N2 do not result in the structural transformation of cis-[Sm(HL)(DMA)2]. This gives rise to exceptional adsorption selectivity of cis-[Sm(HL)(DMA)2] for CO2 over other permanent gases (CH4, H2, O2, and N2) at high pressure and ambient temperature.

Thus, guest removal leads to the structural transformation of trans-[Sm(HL)(DMA)2]\u22c5DMA\u22c52H2O, in which the framework undergoes a marked change of coordination geometry for Sm3+ centers, which shrinks both the void and unit cell volumes, while maintaining the overall framework connectivity.\n\nIn contrast to the adsorption isotherms observed for CH4, H2, O2, and N2, the adsorption isotherm for CO2 at 273 K exhibits a gradual step starting at a pressure of ~5 bar with surface excess uptake of ~>0.67 mmol g-1 (Figure a). The maximum CO2 surface excess capacity for cis-[Sm(HL)(DMA)2] was 3.81 mmol g-1 at 273 K and 20 bar (p/p 0 = 0.57), equivalent to ~3.2 CO2 molecules per formula unit (FU).\n\nCH2Cl2 Vapor Sorption Properties\n\nThe CH2Cl2 sorption experiments were performed to further explore the unique structural transformation and sorption characteristics (Figure d). Similarly, the CH2Cl2 sorption isotherm at 293 K also shows an adsorption step and a broad hysteretic loop. At p/p 0 = 0.04 (CH2Cl2 uptake capacity of ~0.22 mmol g-1), the onset of gate opening is shown by the upward isotherm curvature. Differences in the amounts adsorbed to initiate structural transformation may be explained by the difference in molecular volume of CO2 and CH2Cl2 sorbates. Adsorption increases very steeply for p/p 0 = 0.04 to 0.17. In this relative pressure range, cis-[Sm(HL)(DMA)2] undergoes a continuous structural framework transformation. The adsorption behavior can be explained by the host-guest and guest-guest interactions and the resulting expansion of the framework and pore volume upon adsorption of CH2Cl2 guest molecules. At p/p 0 = 1.00, the CH2Cl2 uptake capacity was ~2.95 mmol g-1, which corresponds to a total pore volume of 0.19 cm3 g-1 assuming a CH2Cl2 density of 1.33 g cm-3. This vapor adsorption total pore volume is in agreement with the PLATON pore volume of 0.19 cm3 g-1 obtained for trans-[Sm(HL)(DMA)2]\u22c5CH2Cl2 (173 K). The PLATON pore volume for trans-[Sm(HL)(DMA)2]\u22c5DMA\u22c52H2O was similar (0.21 cm3 g-1). The structural transformation was reversible with hysteretic adsorption isotherm behavior.
