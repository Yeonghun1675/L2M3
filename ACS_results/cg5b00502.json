Compound 2 showed very low uptake of N2 at 77 K in the pressure range P = 0-0.8 P 0, consistent with poor micropore adsorption, which was expected due to the very narrow channels within the material. Additional N2 adsorption in the pressure range P = 0.8-0.99 P 0 we ascribe to interparticle condensation, or the filling of mesoporous features which may arise from crystal defects and the cracking of the individual crystallites on solvent exchange and high temperature evacuation (). N2 adsorption measurements at 273 K show that the material displays low uptake (<2 cm3(STP)/g) across the entire pressure range (0-1 atm) under these conditions. CO2 adsorption experiments were carried out at 273 K, which showed a maximum uptake at 1 atm of approximately 35 cm3(STP)/g (1.6 mmol/g), corresponding to approximately 6.5 wt % uptake (Figure ), and giving a calculated micropore surface area (Dubinin-Radushkevich) of 370 m2/g. When compared with the very low uptake of N2 at the same temperature and pressure range, an excellent selectivity for CO2/N2 under these conditions is apparent (Figure ). Repeating the CO2 adsorption experiment at 298 and 308 K allowed the calculation of the adsorption enthalpy as a function of loading using a virial model. Fitting all data points from the three experiments gives a zero-loading enthalpy of adsorption of approximately -33 kJ/mol, with a continuous decrease across the measured range of loadings to a value of -28.5 kJ/mol at the maximum measured uptake. These values are consistent with physisorption interactions typical of unfunctionalized MOF pores containing polarized aromatic groups lining the pore walls, and do not suggest involvement of the metal ions.
