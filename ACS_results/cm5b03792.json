Similar to SBMOF-1, after removal of the native\nsolvent water, SBMOF-2 does not saturate with the water vapor from\nthe atmosphere as evident for thermogravimetric and diffraction experiments.\n</p>", "clean_text": "SBMOF-1 is a porous metal organic framework, with moderate surface area of 145 m2/g and calculated porosity of 16% (PLATON). After removal of solvent water, SBMOF-1 does not adsorb water from the air and remains crystalline after exposure to 75% relative humidity for at least 2 months of storage (Figure S1). Structurally, SBMOF-1 is composed of Ca metal centers, coordinated by oxygen atoms in octahedral configuration and v-shaped sdb organic linkers, forming diamond-shaped 1-D channels along the b direction (). After removal of solvent water, the framework of SBMOF-1 undergoes a structural rearrangement involving the rotation of the sdb linker. Our previous study showed that SBMOF-1 is selective toward CO2 over N2 and the selectivity arises from the geometry of the pores, where the CO2 molecule interacts with two phenyl rings at a time through a quadrupole-\u03c0 interaction. \n\nSBMOF-2 is a novel material that we recently reported, which shows high Xe/Kr selectivity of about 10 at 298 K and the surface area of 195 m2/g, stable in both air and humidity (Figure S2). Structurally it is based on isolated CaO6 octahedra, connected by a half-deprotonated tcpb linkers into a three-dimensional framework, with diamond-shaped channels running along a (). SBMOF-2 has a permanent porosity of 25.6% (PLATON) and contains two types of crystallographically different channels (types I and II). The channels have walls built with phenyl rings, and additionally the channels of the type II contain polar -OH groups. Both the phenyl rings and oxygen atoms serve as strong adsorption sites for C2H n  molecules. Similar to SBMOF-1, after removal of the native solvent water, SBMOF-2 does not saturate with the water vapor from the atmosphere as evident for thermogravimetric and diffraction experiments.
