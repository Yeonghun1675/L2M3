Thus, 1440 mg (6.82 mmol) 5-nitroisophthalic acid, 3.4 mL of Al3+ solution (6.80 mmol), 4 mL of DMF, and 12.6 mL of H2O were filled into a 100 mL glass reactor with screw cap. The mixture was heated at 120 \u00b0C for 12 h, and the product was worked up in the same way as the other compounds. Elemental anal.: C 38.1%, H 2.5%, N 6.8%. Calcd values based on the deduced sum formula [Al(OH)(O2C-C6H4NO2-CO2)]\u22c50.41 DMF: C 39.1%, H 2.4, N 7.0%.\n\nThe NH2-functionalized CAU-10-NH2 (5) was synthesized by dosing 1200 mg (6.63 mmol) of 5-aminoisophthalic acid, 3.3 mL of Al3+-solution (6.6 mmol), 4 mL of DMF, and 12.7 mL of H2O into a 100 mL glass reactor with screw cap. The mixture was heated at 120 \u00b0C for 12 h, and the resulting pale pink solid was filtered off. The reaction product was redipersed in water by sonication for 30 min, filtered off again and dried for one hour at 200 \u00b0C in air. Elemental anal.: C 42.8%, H 2.9%, N 6.4%. Calcd values based on the deduced sum formula [Al(OH)(O2C-C6H4NH2-CO2)]: C 42.8%, H 2.9, N 6.4%. Although the analysis matches the chemical formula, NMR experiments indicate that the NH2 group is partially formylated during the synthesis (see the , paragraph XI).\n\nThe OH-functionalized CAU-10-OH (6) was synthesized by dosing 1000 mg (5.49 mmol) of 5-hydroxyisophthalic acid, 2.8 mL of Al3+-solution (5.6 mmol), 4 mL of DMF and 13.2 mL of H2O into a 100 mL glass reactor with screw cap. The mixture was heated at 120 \u00b0C for 12 h, and the resulting white solid was filtered off. The reaction product was redipersed in water by sonication for 30 min, filtered off again and dried for 1 h at 200 \u00b0C in air. Elemental anal.: C 41.3%, H 4.5%.
