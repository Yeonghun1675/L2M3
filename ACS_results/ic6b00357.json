As was previously reported, 1 shows two quasi-reversible redox processes at 0.923 V and -0.037 V (vs SCE), which are attributed to the Py2TTA 0/+1 and FeII/FeIII process, respectively. Similar behavior is observed for [Fe(Py2TTA)Br2], with two quasi-reversible redox processes visible within a similar range (0.915 and 0.056 V vs SCE, ). On the basis of this study, it appears halide exchange leads to an anodic shift in the FeII/FeIII redox potential (by 93 mV), while the Py2TTA 0/+1 process remains relatively constant (i.e., 8 mV cathodic shift). Furthermore, both 1 and 2 are susceptible to metal-assisted ligand oxidation in solution, as observed by the additional redox process occurring at 0.272 V and 0.366 V, respectively.

Furthermore, these Fe-Py2TTA complexes with F-, Cl-, and Br- anions were explored to probe the effect of halide substitution (i.e., size, electronegativity, etc.) on the supramolecular packing arrangement and to examine their influence on the subsequent physical properties. Comparison of the electrochemical and optical spectroscopy, structural analysis, and magnetic studies reveal numerous similarities between the chlorido (1) and bromido (2) derivatives. More specifically, [Fe(Py2TTA)Cl2] and [Fe(Py2TTA)Br2] crystallize as discrete five-coordinate iron centered complexes with intermediate coordination geometries between trigonal bipyramidal and square base pyramid. As may be expected due to their structural similarities, electrochemical, optical, and magnetic studies reveal the physical properties of 1 and 2 are quite comparable. Conversely, replacing the halogen with fluoride anions results in a completely different structure, which is likely due to oxidation of the ligand and the formation of a 1D coordination polymer of Fe metal ions held together through a single bridging fluoride ion. This discrepancy may be attributed to the size and electronegativity of F- (cf. Cl- and Br-), thereby affording a six-coordinate iron centered complex with an octahedral coordination environment. As a consequence, the spectroscopic and magnetic behavior of 3 is distinctly different to 1 and 2. Complexes 1 and 2 exhibit paramagnetic behavior typical for mononuclear S = 5/2 complexes in weak intermolecular antiferromagnetic interactions, whereas complex 3 demonstrates significant exchange couplings within the chain and weak interchain interactions, which stabilize a canted antiferromagnetic ordered state below 4.2 K.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 39, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>On the\nbasis of the studies described here, it is clear the counterion\nhas a significant impact on the coordination environment and packing\narrangement in the solid-state of the resulting coordination complex\nor polymer.
