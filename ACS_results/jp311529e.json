The determination of structural dynamics of Ca(BDC)(DMF)(H<sub>2</sub>O) upon external stimuli not only enabled us to propose the\nmechanisms of transformations but also enabled us to elucidate the\nreason for such behavior. Even though Ca(BDC)(DMF)(H<sub>2</sub>O),\nlike MIL-53, possesses the 4<sup>4</sup> net topology, it does not\nshow any breathing effect upon heating or hydration. Instead, it undergoes\nsignificant crystal-to-crystal transformations leading to the new\nnonporous phases. The reason for the different behavior of Ca(BDC)(DMF)(H<sub>2</sub>O) lies in the tendency to change the carboxylate-to-Ca<sup>2+</sup> coordination mode when the coordination number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is changed. As it was shown by Williams et al., chelating\u2013bridging coordination mode\nof COO<sup>\u2013</sup> groups preferentially occurs when Ca<sup>2+</sup> is in environment with higher coordination number (7 to\n9), whereas the monodentate\u2013bridging mode is found in octahedral\ngeometry. In the Ca-BDC(RT) structure, Ca<sup>2+</sup> occurs in eight-fold\ncoordination and COO<sup>\u2013</sup> are indeed bidentately coordinated\nto Ca cations in chelating\u2013bridging mode. Heating to 400 \u00b0C\nremoves the coordinated water and DMF molecules, and consequently\nthe coordination number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in Ca-BDC(400) is reduced\nto 6. In such an environment, COO<sup>\u2013</sup> groups tend to\ncoordinate to Ca<sup>2+</sup> in monodentate\u2013bridging mode,\nwhich causes the rotation of terephthalate ligand for \u223c90\u00b0\nand recoordination in monodentate fashion connecting two neighboring\nedge-sharing CaO<sub>6</sub> chains. However, because of its ionic\nradius (106 pm), Ca<sup>2+</sup> prefers a higher coordination number\nthan 6. Thus in MOFs, Ca cations in octahedral environment have a\nhigh tendency for additional ligand bonding (typically water molecules).\nIndeed, Ca-BDC(400) is stable only at elevated temperatures, in inert\natmosphere, or in vacuum.

The determination of structural dynamics of Ca(BDC)(DMF)(H2O) upon external stimuli not only enabled us to propose the mechanisms of transformations but also enabled us to elucidate the reason for such behavior. Even though Ca(BDC)(DMF)(H2O), like MIL-53, possesses the 44 net topology, it does not show any breathing effect upon heating or hydration. Instead, it undergoes significant crystal-to-crystal transformations leading to the new nonporous phases. The reason for the different behavior of Ca(BDC)(DMF)(H2O) lies in the tendency to change the carboxylate-to-Ca2+ coordination mode when the coordination number of Ca2+ is changed. As it was shown by Williams et al., chelating-bridging coordination mode of COO- groups preferentially occurs when Ca2+ is in environment with higher coordination number (7 to 9), whereas the monodentate-bridging mode is found in octahedral geometry. In the Ca-BDC(RT) structure, Ca2+ occurs in eight-fold coordination and COO- are indeed bidentately coordinated to Ca cations in chelating-bridging mode. Heating to 400 \u00b0C removes the coordinated water and DMF molecules, and consequently the coordination number of Ca2+ in Ca-BDC(400) is reduced to 6. In such an environment, COO- groups tend to coordinate to Ca2+ in monodentate-bridging mode, which causes the rotation of terephthalate ligand for ~90\u00b0 and recoordination in monodentate fashion connecting two neighboring edge-sharing CaO6 chains. However, because of its ionic radius (106 pm), Ca2+ prefers a higher coordination number than 6. Thus in MOFs, Ca cations in octahedral environment have a high tendency for additional ligand bonding (typically water molecules). Indeed, Ca-BDC(400) is stable only at elevated temperatures, in inert atmosphere, or in vacuum. In humid environment, Ca2+ will coordinate to an additional three water molecules and transform to Ca(BDC)(H2O)3. Nine-fold coordination of Ca2+ favors the carboxylate-to-Ca2+ coordination in the bridging-chelating mode, and thus Ca-BDC(400) \u2192 Ca(BDC)(H2O)3 transformation undergoes a reversible pathway to the one observed in the Ca-BDC(RT) \u2192 Ca-BDC(400) transformation.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 46, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The explanation of structural transformations\nby specific carboxylate-to-Ca<sup>2+</sup> interactions can be projected\nalso to other Ca-MOF systems.\nSuch transformations are most probably the reason for the lack of\nporosity of those systems.
