Differing from the structures\nof previous Cu metal node based isostructural materials, like SIFSIX-2-Cu-i, GeFSIX-2-Cu-i (also\ntermed as ZU-33), and TIFSIX-2-Cu-i, the\nrotation behavior of pyridines was observed in ZU-66 with Zn metal\nnode, and the pyridines here were served as the \u201cmolecular\nrotors\u201d (A and B). Notably, it was the first time\nto observe the pyridine rotary behavior in the 4,4\u2032-bipyridineacetylene\nbased anion pillared materials. Because of the Jahn\u2013Teller\neffect, the coordination geometry of Cu<sup>2+</sup> was inclined\nto the elongated octahedron, and thus the longer Cu\u2013F bond\ndistance (2.28 \u00c5) than Zn\u2013F (2.11 \u00c5) along the <italic toggle=\"yes\">c</italic> axis (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b04916/suppl_file/sc8b04916_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S6A and S6B</ext-link>).\nThe short bond length would enhance the interaction between the anion\nand the organic linker, therefore the special rotary behavior within\nZU-66 (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b04916/suppl_file/sc8b04916_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S6C</ext-link>). Here ZrF<sub>6</sub>\n<sup>2\u2013</sup> was adopted as the pillared anion: the large\nionic radius of Zr<sup>4+</sup> relative to Si<sup>4+</sup>, Ti<sup>4+</sup>, Ge<sup>4+</sup> would prompt the delocalization of the\ncharge, affording the more negative F atoms and enhance the interaction\nbetween the anion and the pyridine, which may also contribute to the\nrotation behavior (A,B). The orderly aligned molecular rotors within ZU-66 were\nable to control the size of accessible channel for the guest molecules,\ngiving the robust framework with dynamics. The channel size was varied\nfrom 3.55 to 5.01 \u00c5 accompanying with the different degrees of\nrotary behavior of \u201cmolecular rotors\u201d (C). Because such a behavior\nwas affected by external stimuli, it offered us the opportunities\nto set a suitable aperture for the corresponding guest molecule under\nthe specific given condition. Excitingly, the initial aperture size\nrevealed by the crystal analysis was 3.55 \u00c5, a tailored pore\nsize for the separation of CO<sub>2</sub> (3.3 \u00c5) from other\nmolecules, like CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> (3.8 and 3.65 \u00c5).\nIf the embedded \u201cmolecular rotors\u201d were fixed, ZU-66\nwas able to afford a perfect molecular sieving for CO<sub>2</sub> from\nCH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>, and offered us a great promise for\nefficient selective separation of CO<sub>2</sub> from CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> mixtures.</p><p>The single component\nadsorption isotherms for ZU-66 toward CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> varied from 273 K-313 K\nwere collected (A and <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b04916/suppl_file/sc8b04916_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">S7\u2013S9</ext-link>). As shown in A, ZU-66 exhibited\nreally high CO<sub>2</sub> capacity, up to 4.56 mmol g<sup>\u20131</sup> (298 K, 1 bar) and negligible CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> uptake,\nonly 0.21 mmol g<sup>\u20131</sup> and 0.08 mmol g<sup>\u20131</sup>, a near-perfect CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> separation performance. The CH<sub>4</sub> uptake\nwas only half that on GeFSIX-2-Cu-i (0.41 mmol g<sup>\u20131</sup>) and SIFSIX-2-Cu-i (0.49 mmol g<sup>\u20131</sup>), the series\nof Cu metal node based isostructural materials (B). Because the gas threshold pressure would\nbe delayed with the increasing temperature, it was assumed that molecular\nrotor within ZU-66 under such conditions was temporarily fixed, acting\nas a filter for molecules with large size, like CH<sub>4</sub> (3.8\n\u00c5), N<sub>2</sub> (3.65 \u00c5), but allowing the entry of CO<sub>2</sub> (3.3 \u00c5) under 298 K and 1 bar. And the stepwise adsorption behavior of CH<sub>4</sub> under 273\nK on ZU-66 further verified our assumption. The low temperature and\nhigh pressure prompted the twist of the molecular rotor, breaking\nthe transitional structure of ZU-66 under ambient condition (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b04916/suppl_file/sc8b04916_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figure S10</ext-link>) and thus the sudden increase of CH<sub>4</sub> adsorption, from 0.2 to 0.6 mmol g<sup>\u20131</sup> (C). Further, ZU-66*\nwith collapsed channel was created with only 16 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> surface area and almost negligible CO<sub>2</sub> uptake (0.4 mmol g<sup>\u20131</sup>) (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b04916/suppl_file/sc8b04916_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Figures S11 and S12</ext-link>). Consistent with our prediction, the gate opening\nbehavior of CH<sub>4</sub> adsorption was not observed on it as well\nas the materials without \u201cmolecular rotors\u201d, like GeFSIX-2-Cu-i\nand SIFSIX-2-Cu-i (C), which further indicated that the sudden increasing CH<sub>4</sub> capacity was attributed to the twist of the molecular rotors\nand the subsequent open channels. The CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> uptake ratio of ZU-66 was up to 22, surpassing the most previous\nreported materials SIFSIX-3-Zn (3.23), HKUST (5.27), ZU-33 (11.2), UTSA-20\n(4.85), and was even close to the values\nof several molecular sieve materials like [Cd<sub>2</sub>L\u00ad(H<sub>2</sub>O)]<sub>2</sub>\u00b75H<sub>2</sub>O (36.4), Qc-5-Cu-sql-\u03b2 (36), but higher\nCO<sub>2</sub> uptake (4.56 vs 2.05 mmol g<sup>\u20131</sup> [Cd<sub>2</sub>L\u00ad(H<sub>2</sub>O)]<sub>2</sub>\u00b75H<sub>2</sub>O vs 2.16\nmmol g<sup>\u20131</sup>, Qc-5-Cu-sql-\u03b2) (F). The CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> (57) uptake ratio even exceeded that of [Cd<sub>2</sub>L\u00ad(H<sub>2</sub>O)]<sub>2</sub>\u00b75H<sub>2</sub>O (43.1), only second to\nthat of Qc-5-Cu-sql-\u03b2 (166), thanks to its high CO<sub>2</sub> capacity (F). ZU-66 exhibited both high selectivity and high CO<sub>2</sub> capacity, showing great potential for CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> separation.</p>", "clean_text": "The CO2 sequestration is extremely urgent due to the growing greenhouse effect and the subsequent serious environmental crisis.

Such a behavior endowed ZU-66 with high separation selectivity for both CO2/CH4 (136) and CO2/N2 (355) and high CO2 capacity (4.56 mmol g-1, 298 K, 1 bar). The actual breakthrough experiment further verified its great potential in both CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 separation. The specific adsorption behavior within ZU-66 was further revealed through the modeling calculation.\n\nHerein, we envisioned that anion-pillared ultramicroporous materials with embedded molecular rotors would provide opportunities for further fine-tuning of aperture size, enhancing the separation selectivity of CO2 containing mixed gas. A novel anion pillared material ZrFSIX-2-Zn-i (also termed as ZU-66; ZrFSIX = hexafluorozirconium, 2 = 4,4'-bipyridylacetylene, i = interpenetrated) built with molecular rotors was designed, affording a size-selective channel (3.55 \u00c5) for CO2 (3.3 \u00c5) from CH4 (3.8 \u00c5) and N2 (3.65 \u00c5) under the ambient condition. The ZU-66 exhibited exceptionally high CO2/CH4 (136) and CO2/N2 (355) separation selectivity, while retaining the high CO2 capacity (4.56 mmol g-1). The breakthrough experiment of mixed CO2/CH4 (50/50) and CO2/N2 (15/85) further verified its excellent separation performance. The adsorption behavior of CO2 within ZU-66 was revealed by the modeling studies.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nFree peripheral aromatic rings with rigid alkyne/alkene centers are suitable for engineering molecular rotors, and 4,4'-bipyridineacetylene here is utilized as the building block. The reaction of 4,4'-bipyridylacetylene and ZnZrF6 afforded the sample of ZU-66. ZU-66 exhibited a prototypal primitive-cubic net with doubly interpenetrated polymorph, giving the maximum square channel of 5.01 \u00c5 (, Table S1). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and framework density of the activated ZU-66 were 177 m2 g-1 and 1.54 g cm-3 with aperture size close to 4 \u00c5 (Figures S1-S3). The changed structure of ZU-66 after exposure to air could be recovered via the methanol immersion (Figure S4). Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that ZU-66 was stable under 423 K (Figure S5). Differing from the structures of previous Cu metal node based isostructural materials, like SIFSIX-2-Cu-i, GeFSIX-2-Cu-i (also termed as ZU-33), and TIFSIX-2-Cu-i, the rotation behavior of pyridines was observed in ZU-66 with Zn metal node, and the pyridines here were served as the \"molecular rotors\" (A and B). Notably, it was the first time to observe the pyridine rotary behavior in the 4,4'-bipyridineacetylene based anion pillared materials. Because of the Jahn-Teller effect, the coordination geometry of Cu2+ was inclined to the elongated octahedron, and thus the longer Cu-F bond distance (2.28 \u00c5) than Zn-F (2.11 \u00c5) along the c axis (Figure S6A and S6B). The short bond length would enhance the interaction between the anion and the organic linker, therefore the special rotary behavior within ZU-66 (Figure S6C). Here ZrF6 2- was adopted as the pillared anion: the large ionic radius of Zr4+ relative to Si4+, Ti4+, Ge4+ would prompt the delocalization of the charge, affording the more negative F atoms and enhance the interaction between the anion and the pyridine, which may also contribute to the rotation behavior (A,B). The orderly aligned molecular rotors within ZU-66 were able to control the size of accessible channel for the guest molecules, giving the robust framework with dynamics. The channel size was varied from 3.55 to 5.01 \u00c5 accompanying with the different degrees of rotary behavior of \"molecular rotors\" (C). Because such a behavior was affected by external stimuli, it offered us the opportunities to set a suitable aperture for the corresponding guest molecule under the specific given condition. Excitingly, the initial aperture size revealed by the crystal analysis was 3.55 \u00c5, a tailored pore size for the separation of CO2 (3.3 \u00c5) from other molecules, like CH4 and N2 (3.8 and 3.65 \u00c5). If the embedded \"molecular rotors\" were fixed, ZU-66 was able to afford a perfect molecular sieving for CO2 from CH4 and N2, and offered us a great promise for efficient selective separation of CO2 from CO2/CH4, CO2/N2 mixtures.\n\nThe single component adsorption isotherms for ZU-66 toward CO2, CH4 and N2 varied from 273 K-313 K were collected (A and S7-S9). As shown in A, ZU-66 exhibited really high CO2 capacity, up to 4.56 mmol g-1 (298 K, 1 bar) and negligible CH4 and N2 uptake, only 0.21 mmol g-1 and 0.08 mmol g-1, a near-perfect CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 separation performance. The CH4 uptake was only half that on GeFSIX-2-Cu-i (0.41 mmol g-1) and SIFSIX-2-Cu-i (0.49 mmol g-1), the series of Cu metal node based isostructural materials (B). Because the gas threshold pressure would be delayed with the increasing temperature, it was assumed that molecular rotor within ZU-66 under such conditions was temporarily fixed, acting as a filter for molecules with large size, like CH4 (3.8 \u00c5), N2 (3.65 \u00c5), but allowing the entry of CO2 (3.3 \u00c5) under 298 K and 1 bar. And the stepwise adsorption behavior of CH4 under 273 K on ZU-66 further verified our assumption. The low temperature and high pressure prompted the twist of the molecular rotor, breaking the transitional structure of ZU-66 under ambient condition (Figure S10) and thus the sudden increase of CH4 adsorption, from 0.2 to 0.6 mmol g-1 (C). Further, ZU-66* with collapsed channel was created with only 16 m2 g-1 surface area and almost negligible CO2 uptake (0.4 mmol g-1) (Figures S11 and S12). Consistent with our prediction, the gate opening behavior of CH4 adsorption was not observed on it as well as the materials without \"molecular rotors\", like GeFSIX-2-Cu-i and SIFSIX-2-Cu-i (C), which further indicated that the sudden increasing CH4 capacity was attributed to the twist of the molecular rotors and the subsequent open channels. The CO2/CH4 uptake ratio of ZU-66 was up to 22, surpassing the most previous reported materials SIFSIX-3-Zn (3.23), HKUST (5.27), ZU-33 (11.2), UTSA-20 (4.85), and was even close to the values of several molecular sieve materials like [Cd2L(H2O)]2\u22c55H2O (36.4), Qc-5-Cu-sql-\u03b2 (36), but higher CO2 uptake (4.56 vs 2.05 mmol g-1 [Cd2L(H2O)]2\u22c55H2O vs 2.16 mmol g-1, Qc-5-Cu-sql-\u03b2) (F). The CO2/N2 (57) uptake ratio even exceeded that of [Cd2L(H2O)]2\u22c55H2O (43.1), only second to that of Qc-5-Cu-sql-\u03b2 (166), thanks to its high CO2 capacity (F). ZU-66 exhibited both high selectivity and high CO2 capacity, showing great potential for CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 separation.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "ZU-66", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "ZrFSIX-2-Zn-i"}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "4.56", "unit": "mmol g-1", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "1 bar", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "CH4", "adsorbed amount": "0.21", "unit": "mmol g-1", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "0.08", "unit": "mmol g-1", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": ""}], "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "177", "unit": "m2 g-1", "condition": ""}], "density": [{"value": "1.54", "unit": "g cm-3", "condition": ""}], "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "423", "unit": "K", "type": "stability", "condition": ""}], "crystal system": [], "space group": []}]]], "include_properties": ["gas_adsorption", "surface_area", "density", "decomposition_temperature", "crystal_system", "space_group"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['gas_adsorption', 'surface_area', 'density', 'decomposition_temperature', 'crystal_system', 'space_group']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"ZU-66\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"ZrFSIX-2-Zn-i\"\n        },\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"CO2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"4.56\",\n                \"unit\": \"mmol g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"298 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"1 bar\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"CH4\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"0.21\",\n                \"unit\": \"mmol g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"\",\n                \"pressure\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"N2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"0.08\",\n                \"unit\": \"mmol g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"\",\n                \"pressure\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"surface area\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"BET\",\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"177\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2 g-1\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"density\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"1.54\",\n                \"unit\": \"g cm-3\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"decomposition temperature\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"423\",\n                \"unit\": \"K\",\n                \"type\": \"stability\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"crystal system\": [],\n        \"space group\": []\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 8, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Schematic structure\nof ZU-66.
