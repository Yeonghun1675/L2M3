The shape of the P vs E loops (e,f) is slightly pinched at high fields, but very different from the cigar-like shape characteristic of lossy dielectrics. The pinched hysteresis can be attributed to defects in the material causing hardening, apparent internal fields and/or domain-wall pinning as well as to potential contribution of leakage current inducing a small extra \"false\" polarization. Current vs field plots at different temperatures () show an ohmic behavior for 2 with resistivity of about 6 \u00d7 107 \u03a9\u22c5cm at 103 K, which decreases when temperature increases () corresponding to an insulator-like behavior. Moreover, although the polarization amplitude increases when the temperature decreases, the conductivity decreases (and the resistivity increases) excluding significant contribution leakage current to the polarization enhancement. Accordingly, leakage current, if any, should be negligible compared to polarization effects and the ferroelectric behavior of 2 is beyond reasonable doubt.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 16, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>Because the polar state\ntransition is associated with a structural\nphase one, a plausible explanation lies in a reorientation of the\npolar cations, most-likely associated with the thermodynamics of the\nH-bonded crystallization water molecules near the melting point of\nthe H-bond network.
