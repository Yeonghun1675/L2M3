The emission spectrum of 1 shows a peak at 406 nm when excited at 308 nm. The hypsochromic shift of the excitation in 1 (from 334 to 308 nm) could possibly be explained by a change of the n orbital energy level on oxygen atoms due to the coordination of Ca2+ and the hydrogen bonding to the carboxylate oxo groups. The \u03c0* orbitals, however, might be slightly affected due to the twisting of the btc ligand away from the coplanar form (the dihedral angles between the carboxylate groups and the benzene aromatic ring: ca. 12.53\u00b0, 7.83\u00b0, 3.3\u00b0, 15.9\u00b0 for C(5), C(6), C(11), C(12), respectively).
