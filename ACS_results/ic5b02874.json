Upon increasing the sorption temperatures from 195 to 273 to 298 K, the CO2 pressures corresponding to a vertical uptake increased from 0.18 to 7.8 to 15.0 bar, respectively. At high temperatures, the kinetic energies of the gas molecules become large enough to surpass the intermolecular potential energy (i.e., the potential energy between the gas molecules and framework).
