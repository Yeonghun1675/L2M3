For the synthesis, a 0.02 M Bi3+ and a 0.3 M (NH4)2C2O4\u22c5H2O solution were mixed dropwise (0.2 mL each time) together under continuous stirring. The fully automated synthesis setup was placed in a thermostatic controlled box, kept at 25 \u00b0C. The synthesis yielded a white precipitate, which was subsequently filtered with a Millipore filter (0.2 \u03bcm). The as-obtained powder was dried in the thermostatic controlled box and finally lightly ground in a mortar.
