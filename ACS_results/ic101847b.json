As a result, we have explored the reactivity of lithium piperidide (LiNC5H10) with UCl4. Thus, reaction of UCl4 with 6 equiv of LiNC5H10 in Et2O/DME generates a deep blue-green solution, from which the pentacoordinate U(IV) complex [Li(DME)][U(NC5H10)5] (4) can be isolated as blue-green crystals in 62% yield (Scheme ). Addition of 5 equiv of LiNC5H10 to UCl4 also provides 4 in comparable yields, while addition of only 4 equiv of LiNC5H10 to UCl4 generates an intractable mixture. Complex 4 is insoluble in non-polar solvents such as hexane but is very soluble in aromatic and ethereal solvents. The 1H NMR spectrum of 4 in C6D6 exhibits an extremely broad resonance at 6.24 ppm, which we have assigned to the protons of the piperidide ring. Its 7Li{1H} NMR spectrum displays a single resonance at 81.2 ppm.\n\nAttempts to oxidize 4 with I2 or AgOTf only produce complex reaction mixtures. However, clean transformation of 4 into a U(V) amide can be achieved by oxidation with 0.5 equiv of I2, followed by addition of 1 equiv of LiNC5H10 (Scheme ). This generates a deep red solution from which the six-coordinate homoleptic U(V) amide [Li(DME)3][U(NC5H10)6] (5) can be isolated in 53% yield. The 1H NMR spectrum of 5 in C6D6 exhibits two overlapping resonances at 2.48 ppm and 2.56 ppm assignable to the \u03b2- and \u03b3-protons of the piperidide ligand, respectively. A third broad resonance, corresponding to the \u03b1-protons, appears at 11.59 ppm. Consistent with its formulation, the 7Li{1H} NMR spectrum of 5 contains a single resonance at 13.5 ppm.\n\nLiNH t Bu\n\nTo a solution of tert-butylamine (3.0 mL, 28.4 mmol) in hexanes (30 mL) was added n-BuLi (1.6 M in hexanes, 17.0 mL, 27.2 mmol) dropwise via syringe.

The reaction mixture immediately turned blue-green concomitant with the precipitation of a white powder. The mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for 30 min, whereupon the solvent was removed in vacuo affording a blue-green powder. The solid was dissolved in Et2O (12 mL), and the solution was filtered through a Celite column (2 cm \u00d7 0.5 cm) supported on glass wool. The volume of the filtrate was reduced in vacuo, and the solution cooled to -25 \u00b0C for 24 h, resulting in the deposition of blue-green crystals.

The reaction mixture was stirred for 5 min, whereupon a solution of LiNC5H10 (0.040 mg, 0.44 mmol) in Et2O (8 mL) was added dropwise, causing the solution to turn deep red. The reaction mixture was then stirred for an additional 5 min, after which the solvent was removed in vacuo, affording a dark red solid.
