To 40 mL of a n-butanol solution of imidazole (1.17 g, 17 mmol), solid nickel(II) acetate (500 mg, 2.83 mmol) was added (Ni/Him ca. 1:6). Heating the resulting deep-blue solution at reflux (ca. 120 \u00b0C) for 2 h resulted in the slow precipitation of a yellow solid. After cooling at RT, the solid was filtered, washed with butanol (2 \u00d7 20 mL) and acetone (3 \u00d7 30 mL), and then dried in a vacuum. Anal. Calcd for C6H6N4 Ni: C, 37.31; H, 3.11; N, 29.01. Found: C, 38.15; H, 3.50; N, 27.15. Yield: 46%. Similar results were obtained on starting from NiCl2 of Ni(NO3)2. \n\n Synthesis of the  \u03b1 -Phase. This preparation exactly matches that of the amorphous material described above, except water replaces butanol as the solvent and the reflux temperature is 100 \u00b0C. After cooling at RT, the solid was filtered, washed with water (2 \u00d7 20 mL) and acetone (3 \u00d7 30 mL), and then dried in a vacuum. Anal. Calcd for C6H6N4Ni: C, 37.31; H, 3.11; N, 29.01. Found: C, 37.47; H, 3.23; N, 28.95. Yield: 45%. Highly crystalline material, from which the sample studied by single-crystal X-ray diffraction was chosen, was obtained hydrothermally from the reaction of 0.25 g of Ni(OH)2, 3.00 g of imidazole, and 5.1 g of H2O at 180 \u00b0C in a 23-mL Teflon-lined autoclave. After the reaction proceeded for 3 days, the autoclave was cooled in air and the products were recovered by filtration and rinsed briefly with water. Yellow, elongated cubes of \u03b1-Ni(im)2 were present, along with recrystallized imidazole. Reactions carried out with less imidazole, or at 150 \u00b0C, produced similar results, although unreacted Ni(OH)2 was often present. \n\n Synthesis of the  \u03b2 -phase. To 50 mL of an aqueous solution of nickel(II) acetate (500 mg, 2.83 mmol), solid imidazole was added (1.17 g, 17 mmol; Ni/Him ca. 1:6). To the resulting deep-blue solution, aqueous NH3 (36% w/w, 3 mL) was then introduced. After the solution was allowed to stand for about 30 min, a yellow precipitate appeared over the course of 5 h, after which the rection was complete. Note that typically while stirring, mixtures of amorphous and polycrystalline materials are obtained.
