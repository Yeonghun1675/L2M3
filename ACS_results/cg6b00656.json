In 2, the first weight loss (27.1%) in 30-153 \u00b0C corresponded to the loss of guest H2O and DMF molecules (cal. 27.5%); then there was a pseudo plateau in 153-350 \u00b0C and thereafter a continuous weight lost up to 850 \u00b0C. 2 is less stable than 1 in the range of 150-350 \u00b0C possibly due to the slow collapse of the framework after the removal of coordinated H2O molecules during heating. 3 lost its guest solvent molecules (4.2% in weight) at 30-145 \u00b0C which are lower than temperatures in the cases of 1 and 2 possibly due to its solvent molecules having low boiling points. After experiencing a quasi-plateau in 96-380 \u00b0C, 3 went through a complete structural decomposition during the subsequent heating.\n\nInterestingly, 3 was revealed to be able of absorbing water after its desolvated form was exposed to air at room temperature for 1 h.

In the first cycle, 3 lost its 2.6% weight which corresponded to the loss of one H2O molecule (cal. 2.35%). ~3.6% weight loses were observed in the subsequent three cycles, indicating that 3's desolvated form can reversibly and repeatedly absorb 1.5 H2O molecules (cal. 3.49%) from air. All these results indicate 3's framework is stable up to 145 \u00b0C and holds less solvent molecules than 1 and 2.\n\nPhotoluminescent Sensing of NAC Dispersions and Vapors\n\nThe solid-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of H5L, 1, 2, and 3 (\u03bbex = 360 nm) were collected at room temperature (Figure S12). An intense emission peak at 470 nm observed in the PL spectrum of H5L should correspond to a linker-localized n \u2192 \u03c0* or \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* transition. In contrast, 1, 2, and 3 exhibit obvious blue shifts with strong peaks at 436, 440, and 462 nm respectively possibly due to the Zn2+-L5- coordination which can increase the ligand conformational rigidity and reduce nonradioactive decay. Their different emission blue shifts may be attributed to the different configurations of ligands and coordination modes of the metal ions (Figure S5). The emission decay lifetimes of 1-3 are 1.8580, 1.7593, and 1.8311 \u03bcs, respectively. Here guest molecules induced the reversible structural transformation between 1 and 3 accompanied by the emission peak shift, which has been rarely reported in dynamic frameworks. Their PL spectra in solvents (DMF for 1 and 2, acetonitrile for 3) where they remained stable were measured (Figure S13). Strong emissions at 434 nm for 1, 430 nm for 2, and 455 nm for 3 are close to those of their solid-state samples.
