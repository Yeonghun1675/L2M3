In this route, the Mn1a-O3-Mn2 bond angle is 110.37(9)\u00b0. Regarding the Mn1 and Mn2 centers, the two carboxylate bridges provide longer magnetic pathways through three atoms. Mn1-O2-Mn2 bridged by one oxygen atom provides a more efficient path. The relevant bond distances are 2.303(2) \u00c5 for Mn1-O2 and 2.119(2) \u00c5 for Mn2-O2, and the bond angle of Mn1-O2-Mn2 is 117.82(10)\u00b0. The metric parameters of the Mn1-O2-Mn2 route are similar to the corresponding counterparts in the Mn1a-O3-Mn2 linkage. Thus, these two magnetic routes are considered effective pathways for magnetic coupling.

The ADSC Quantum-210 ADX program (Ver. 1.92) was used for data collection, while HKL3000 (Ver. 0.98.699) was used for cell refinement, reduction, and absorption correction. The structure was solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares analysis using anisotropic thermal parameters for non-hydrogen atoms with the SHELXTL program. The lattice solvent molecules in 1 were significantly disordered and could not be modeled properly; thus the program SQUEEZE, a part of the PLATON crystallographic software package, was used to calculate the solvent disorder area and remove its contribution to the overall intensity data. All hydrogen atoms, except for those bound to water molecules, were calculated at idealized positions and refined with the riding model. Crystal data for 1: empirical formula = C31H49Mn4NO22, M r = 1007.47, monoclinic, space group C2/c, a = 21.180(4) \u00c5, b = 11.551(2) \u00c5, c = 19.602(4) \u00c5, \u03b2 = 106.06(3)\u00b0, V = 4608.4(16) \u00c53, Z = 4, D calc = 1.452 g cm-3, \u03bc = 1.146 mm-1, 21520 reflections collected, 6287 unique (R int = 0.0514), R 1 = 0.0648, wR 2 = 0.1752 [I > 2\u03c3(I)].

These data can be obtained free of charge from The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif.\n\nMagnetic Properties\n\nThe magnetic data for 1 were collected as a function of the temperature at H dc = 1000 Oe (a). The \u03c7m T value per MnII ion was 4.27 cm3 K mol-1 at 300 K, which is somewhat lower than the value (4.38 cm3 K mol-1) calculated using the parameters S = 5/2 and g = 2. As the temperature decreased, the \u03c7m T product underwent a slow downturn and then rapidly declined to 0.39 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical
