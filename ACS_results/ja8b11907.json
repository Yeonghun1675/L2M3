Static luminescence quenching is generally associated with the formation of ground-state complexes upon addition of the quencher, whereas dynamic interactions are associated with diffusion-controlled quenching in which collisions between quenchers and excited fluorophores result in deactivation of the excited states. Combined static and dynamic quenching is often observed in fluorophore-quencher systems containing two populations of fluorophores, one of which is less accessible to quenchers than the other. This is a characteristic feature of systems in which the quencher has limited access to some of the active sites buried in the fluorophore. In the case of SION-105, the introduction of F- results in a B\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5F interaction that prevents emissive de-excitation, accounting for static quenching, while increasing the concentration of F- promotes more interactions with the B active sites (protected by duryl groups of the ligand), resulting in the quadratic dependence described by , 1         I   0     I   =  ( 1 +   K   S V    [ F ]  )   ( 1 +   K   a    [ F ]  )     where I 0 is the emission intensity from SION-105 in the absence of F-, I is the intensity in the presence of F-, K SV is the SV constant describing the dynamic quenching efficiency, and K a is the association constant describing the efficiency of B\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5F interactions.

Aside from existing portable electrochemical devices, which require frequent calibration and careful handling to extend their shelf life, the colorimetric sensing solutions that exist suffer from interference that may require complicated or hazardous sample preparation steps. These methods are thus restricted to use in laboratories by skilled technicians, and a rapid, reliable method for untrained users in need of frequent sampling is needed. To address this, we designed and constructed a miniaturized fluorimeter device as a portable prototype for water sampling with SION-105 (). The compact (10 cm \u00d7 10 cm \u00d7 12 cm) device consists of a cuvette holder mounted internally with three 360 nm UV LEDs (LED Engin LZ4-04UV00), a 590 nm long-pass filter, and a sensitive photodiode integrated with an operational amplifier (Burr-Brown OPT 301). The holder is fitted with an anodized aluminum lid and a safety switch to ensure that the UV LEDs can turn on only when the lid is placed over the holder. The device is powered by a 12 V source and consists of an OLED display connected to a microcontroller (Arduino UNO) coupled to a voltage divider circuit.
