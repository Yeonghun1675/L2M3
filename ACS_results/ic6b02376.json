Upon cooling, \u03c7M T decreased slowly to 4.33 cm3 mol-1 K at 75 K, and then it increased rapidly to the maximum value of 13.98 cm3 mol-1 K at 16 K. Upon further lowering of the temperature, \u03c7M T decreased sharply to 3.14 cm3 mol-1 K at 2 K, caused by either zero-field splitting or the contribution from antiferromagnetic coupling interactions between NiII trimeric units.
