The packing of the layers generate two types of channels with a difference in size like CP-1. These channels are occupied by solvents and free sulfate anions. Platon calculation reveals that it contains 34% solvent accessible voids in the crystal lattice.\n\nThermochromic Properties\n\nThermochromism is the ability of a material to change its color in a reversible manner in response to heating and cooling cycles. This color change is accompanied by the dehydration and hydration cycle of the material with respect to temperature. Interestingly, the pale-yellow crystals of 1 are heated in an oil bath at 100-120 \u00b0C by placing them in RB; the crystals are found to change the color gradually from pale-yellow to dark yellow (1TC) with the breaking of single crystals to polycrystalline material (a).

Further, the immersion of dark yellow apo-host materials (1TC and 2TC) in water found to regain the original color of the parent CPs, indicating the reversible nature of hydration.\n\nThe luminescence measurements also indicate that the heated samples have different properties from the parent samples. The emission maximum of 1 with an excitation wavelength of 350 nm was found to be 412 nm which is shifted to 514 nm upon heating (for 1TC). The large difference in emission wavelengths (102 nm) indicates that removal of the solvent from 1 created a new phase 1TC (a), which may contain better \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions between the 2D layers. Similar observation was also found in the case of CP-2. The emission maxima of 2 and 2TC (Zn-complex) are found to be 415 and 527 nm, respectively (Figure S5). These observations suggest that reversible crystal-polycrystalline phase transformation occurs upon dehydration and rehydration, accompanied by under UV or naked eye color change.

The materials are activated by immersing them in acetone for few days and then evacuating the solvents by in situ heating at 120 \u00b0C for 2 h.

The profile shows gradual uptake (150 cc/g) up to P/P 0 = 0.6 and then rapid uptake (280 cc/g) up to P/P 0 = 0.8. From P/P 0 = 0.8 to 0.95, the uptake increases gradually to 300 cc/g, for CP-1, which corresponds to 13 mmol/g of water adsorption (a). The CP-2 is also found to follow a similar water sorption profile with lower uptake (200 cc/g) value than 1 (b). The stronger affinity, stepwise adsorption, and high uptake of water could be due to the hydrophilic nature of the pores, effective pore size, and adsorption sites. The large gap between adsorption and desorption profiles could be due to strong interaction between the framework and the absorbed water molecules inside the crystal lattice.\n\nDye Adsorption Studies\n\nThe groundwater is contaminated by dyes which are released by many industries, such as plastics, textile, rubber, paint, pharmaceuticals, etc. Therefore, the effective removal of toxic dyes from polluted water is a major concern in the recent days. MOFs or PCPs are regarded as promising candidates for selective adsorption of dyes given their nature of frameworks, channels, and active metal sites. The cationic nature of the framework prompted us to study the dye adsorption property of these complexes. Dye sorption experiment was carried out by the immersion of freshly prepared crystals of 1 and 2 (50 mg) in aqueous solutions of CR dye in 10-4 molar concentration. The adsorption of CR dye by these complexes was monitored by UV-vis spectroscopy at different time intervals (a). It was found that CR could be efficiently adsorbed by 1 and 2 in a short period of time with a color change of crystals from pale yellow to red. In the first 5 min, the CPs 1 and 2 could adsorb 65% and 59% of the dye, respectively. The adsorption of 98% and 92% of dye was observed for complexes 1 and 2 in 20 and 40 min, respectively. This observed sorption of CR by CPs 1 and 2 could be attributed to the exchange of uncoordinated sulfate ions by CR. Further, the dye adsorbed 1 was found to have a lower band gap (1.85 eV) value compared to that of 1 (3.10 eV) (b).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "CP-2", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "space
