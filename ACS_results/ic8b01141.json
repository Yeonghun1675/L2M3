Water cannot serve as donor to viologen for its high ionization energy, but it imposes a high impact on ET by interacting with the donor and acceptor. The water molecules in 1 interact with viologen through Nv\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Ow (3.39-3.83 \u00c5) and Hv\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Ow (2.29-2.33 \u00c5) and also with carboxylate through O-Hw\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Ocarboxylate bonds. The solvation interactions reduce the donor/acceptor strength of carboxylate/viologen and stabilize the V2+\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5COO- state more than V\u22c5+\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5COO\u22c5, so water brings in an additional barrier for ET. The nonphotochromic nature of 1 suggests that photoexcitation, which works on individual chromophores, cannot overcome the impeding effects. However, the effects can be overcome by compression, which works on the whole framework and proactively reduces D-A contacts. This explains the occurrence of piezochromism. On the other hand, the occurrence of ET upon dehydration can be due to withdrawal of the impeding effects and perhaps also because the D-A contacts can be closer after dehydration. Water reuptake rebuilds the solvation interactions in favor of the nonradical state, so back-ET occurs.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 15, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>To probe the magnetic effects of the hydro- and piezochromic ET processes,\ntemperature-dependent magnetic measurements were performed with <bold>1</bold>, <bold>1-D-G</bold>, and <bold>1-P-G</bold> ().
