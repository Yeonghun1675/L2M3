From the magnetic viewpoint, the former pathway usually transmits a ferromagnetic MnII-CrIII coupling while the latter transfers an antiferromagnetic MnII-CrIII interaction. Considering that the former is much stronger than the latter, the oxalate-bridged layer can be thought of as weakly antiferromagnetically coupled chains. Therefore, a mean-field approach (see the Supporting Information) can be used with the model shown in the inset of Figure . The best fit to the magnetic susceptibilities of 2 in the whole temperature range gave the parameters J = 2.47(1) cm-1, g = g Mn = g Cr = g Co = 2.03(1), and zJ\u2018 = -0.35(1) cm-1.
