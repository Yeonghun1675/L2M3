An asymmetric unit of <bold>2</bold> contains two cadmium centers, two BTC, two coordinated H<sub>2</sub>O, two guest HCHA, two guest EtOH, and two guest H<sub>2</sub>O. As shown in Figure a, two Cd(II) centers adopt the same coordination form, and each center and its counterpart via symmetry transformation are coordinated by six different carboxylate groups to construct a dinuclear octahedral SBU, respectively. In addition, two crystallographical independent BTC ligands also adopt the same coordination form and coordinate to three octahedral SBUs by their three carboxylate groups, respectively. These octahedral SBUs are further extended by BTC ligands into a 3D network with quadrangular channel dimensions of ca. 8.1 \u00d7 10.9 \u00c5 (measured between opposite atoms) viewed along the [101] direction (Figure b). In this structure, the vacancies of each asymmetric unit are filled with two guest H<sub>2</sub>O, two guest EtOH, and two guest HCHA, which connect to the framework via hydrogen bonds (Figure c). The TGA curve for <bold>2</bold> shows that the weight loss of 12.73% during the first step between 30 and 115 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of two guest EtOH and two guest H<sub>2</sub>O of each asymmetric unit (calculated 12.77%), and the weight loss of 23.48% during the second step between 270 and 320 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of two guest HCHA and two coordination H<sub>2</sub>O of each asymmetric unit (calculated 23.55%). Decomposition of <bold>2</bold> starts at 350 \u00b0C. The XRD patterns of the as-synthesized and the corresponding calcinated product of polymer <bold>2</bold> are similar, although the intensities of the latter become weak and the widths of some peaks show certain differences. This indicates that the porous network of <bold>2</bold> is basically retained after the removal of the guest molecules and terminal H<sub>2</sub>O molecules. After guest molecules are removed, the effective free volume of <bold>2</bold> is calculated by PLATON analysis as 56.2% (0.31 mL/g) of the crystal volume (2087.2 \u00c5<sup>3</sup> out of the 3716.1 \u00c5<sup>3</sup> unit cell volume).</p><title>Crystal Structure of [Cd<sub>5</sub>(BTC)<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>]\u00b74(HTEA)\u00b72(H<sub>3</sub>O) (<bold>3</bold>)</title><p>X-ray crystallography shows that <bold>3</bold> crystallizes in a tetragonal system, space group <italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>42<sub>1</sub>2 (No. 90). The asymmetric unit of <bold>3</bold> contains one and a quarter cadmium centers, one BTC, one coordination chlorine ion, one guest HTEA, and half a guest H<sub>3</sub>O. As shown in Figure a, one Cd(II) center is coordinated by four different carboxylate groups to construct a tetrahedral SBU, and another Cd(II) center and its counterpart via symmetry transformation are also linked by four carboxylate groups from four distinct BTC ligands into a square \u201cpaddle-wheel\u201d SBU, and each of them completes its coordination geometries with an axial chlorine ion opposite to the Cd\u2013Cd vector. Clearly, BTC coordinates to two tetrahedral SBUs and one square SBU by its three carboxylate groups. The tetrahedral SBUs and square SBUs are interconnected through BTC ligands to generate a 3D infinite network with square channel dimensions of ca. 11.5 \u00d7 11.5 \u00c5 (measured between opposite atoms) viewed along the [001] direction (Figure b). As shown in Figure c, the vacancies are filled with half a guest H<sub>3</sub>O and one guest HTEA of each asymmetric unit, which connect to the framework via hydrogen bonds. Its TGA curve reveals that the weight loss of 2.01% during the first step between 30 and 85 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of half a guest H<sub>3</sub>O of each asymmetric unit (calculated 1.92%), and the weight loss of 20.59% during the second step between 240 and 290 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of one guest HTEA of each asymmetric unit (calculated 20.66%).

XRD patterns of the as-synthesized and corresponding calcinated product of <bold>3</bold> indicate that the porous network of <bold>3</bold> is still maintained after the calcination, although the intensities show some differences. After guest molecules are removed, its effective free volume is estimated by PLATON analysis as 64.5% (0.50 mL/g) of the crystal volume (3309.9 \u00c5<sup>3</sup> out of the 5134.5 \u00c5<sup>3</sup> unit cell volume).</p><title>Crystal Structure of [Cd<sub>3</sub>(BTC)<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)]\u00b7(HTEA)\u00b72(H<sub>3</sub>O) (<bold>4</bold>)</title><p>The X-ray structural analysis reveals that <bold>4</bold> crystallizes in the monoclinic system, space group <italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>2<sub>1</sub>/<italic toggle=\"yes\">c</italic> (No. 14). In an asymmetric unit of <bold>4</bold>, there are three cadmium centers, three BTC, one coordination H<sub>2</sub>O, one guest HTEA, and two guest H<sub>3</sub>O. As shown in Figure a, three crystallographical independent Cd(II) centers and their counterparts produced by their symmetry transformation construct three kinds of SBUs: square \u201cpaddle-wheel\u201d SBU, tetrahedral SBU, and octahedral SBU, respectively. Otherwise, three crystallographical independent BTC ligands coordinate to one octahedral SBU and two tetrahedral SBUs (named as BTC-a), one square SBU and two octahedral SBUs (named as BTC-b), and one square SBU and two tetrahedral SBUs (named as BTC-c) by their three carboxylate groups, respectively. These octahedral, tetrahedral, and square SBUs are connected to each other through BTC ligands to yield a intricate 3D architecture with two elliptical channels dimensions of ca. 3.2 \u00d7 8.4 \u00c5 and 8.4 \u00d7 9.6 \u00c5 (measured between opposite atoms) viewed along the [100] direction (Figure b). The vacancies are filled with two guest H<sub>3</sub>O and one guest HTEA of each asymmetric unit. However, interestingly, only the space of small channels is full of guest HTEA which connect to the framework via hydrogen bonds, while the space of its large channels is kept void (Figure c). The TGA curve of <bold>4</bold> exhibits that the weight loss of 3.43% during the first step between 30 and 115 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of two guest H<sub>3</sub>O of each asymmetric unit (calculated 3.41%), and the weight loss of 10.62% during the second step between 255 and 300 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of one guest HTEA and one coordinated H<sub>2</sub>O of each asymmetric unit (calculated 10.76%).

XRD patterns of the as-synthesized and corresponding calcinated product of <bold>4</bold> are similar, indicating that the porous framework of <bold>4</bold> is still maintained after the calcination. After those guest H<sub>3</sub>O and HTEA molecules are removed, the effective free volume of <bold>4</bold> is evaluated by PLATON analysis as 64.1% (0.57 mL/g) of the crystal volume (4244.0 \u00c5<sup>3</sup> out of the 6619.0 \u00c5<sup>3</sup> unit cell volume).</p><title>Crystal Structure of [Zn(BTC)(H<sub>2</sub>O)]\u00b7(HTPA)\u00b7(H<sub>2</sub>O) (<bold>5</bold>)</title><p>Single-crystal X-ray analysis of <bold>5</bold> reveals that it crystallizes in the monoclinic system, space group <italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>2<sub>1</sub>/<italic toggle=\"yes\">c</italic> (No. 14). The asymmetric unit of <bold>5</bold> comprises one zinc center, one BTC, one coordinated H<sub>2</sub>O, one guest HTPA, and one guest H<sub>2</sub>O. As shown in Figure a, the Zn(II) center is coordinated by four oxygen atoms from three different carboxylate groups and one terminal H<sub>2</sub>O to construct a triangular SBU, and BTC ligand coordinates to three triangular SBUs by its three carboxylate groups. These triangular SBUs are further extended by BTC ligands, thereby producing a 2D framework with elliptical channel dimensions of ca. 9.9 \u00d7 10.6 \u00c5 (measured between opposite atoms) viewed along the [101] direction (Figure b). In this structure the space between two layers is full of guest H<sub>2</sub>O and guest HTPA, and the vacancies of each asymmetric unit are filled with one guest H<sub>2</sub>O and one guest HTPA, which connect to the framework via hydrogen bonds (Figure c). The TGA curve for <bold>5</bold> shows that the weight loss of 4.02% during the first step between 30 and 112 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of one guest H<sub>2</sub>O of each asymmetric unit (calculated 3.98%), and the weight loss of 35.73% during the second step between 255 and 310 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of one guest HTPA and one coordinated H<sub>2</sub>O of each asymmetric unit (calculated 35.84%).

An asymmetric unit of <bold>6</bold> includes one cadmium center, one BTC, one guest HTPA, and one guest H<sub>2</sub>O. As shown in Figure a, the Cd(II) center and other Cd(II) center generated by its symmetry transformation are coordinated to six different carboxylate groups to construct a octahedral SBU. Clearly, the BTC ligand coordinates to three octahedral SBUs by their three carboxylate groups. Extension of the coordination geometry around these octahedral SBUs and BTC ligands will therefore give a 3D infinite framework with quadrangular channel dimensions of ca. 9.2 \u00d7 9.8 \u00c5 (measured between opposite atoms) viewed along the [100] direction (Figure b). The vacancies of each asymmetric unit are filled with one guest H<sub>2</sub>O and one guest HTPA, which connect to the framework via hydrogen bonds (Figure c). TGA of <bold>6</bold> shows that the weight loss of 3.79% during the first step between 30 and 110 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of one guest H<sub>2</sub>O of each asymmetric unit (calculated 3.74%), and the weight loss of 29.86% during the second step between 290 and 360 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of one guest HTPA of each asymmetric unit (calculated 29.94%).

An asymmetric unit of 1 contains half a cadmium center, one HBTC, one guest HDETA, and two guest H2O. As shown in Figure a, the Cd(II) center is coordinated by four different carboxylate groups to construct a tetrahedral secondary building unit (SBU), and HBTC ligand coordinates to two tetrahedral SBUs by two of its carboxylate groups and keeps the third carboxylate group uncoordinated. The tetrahedral SBUs are interconnected through BTC ligands, thereby generating a 2D extended network with quadrangular channel dimensions of ca. 10.1 \u00d7 10.1 \u00c5 (measured between opposite atoms) viewed along the [001] direction (Figure b). As shown in Figure c, the space between two layers is full of guest H2O and guest HDETA, and the vacancies of each asymmetric unit are filled with two guest H2O and one guest HDETA, which hold the framework together via hydrogen bonds. The TGA curve for 1 shows that the weight loss of 8.79% during the first step between 30 and 85 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of two guest H2O of each asymmetric unit (calculated 8.91%), and the weight loss of 25.61% during the second step between 200 and 315 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of one guest HDETA of each asymmetric unit (calculated 25.75%). However, further heating will lead to the collapse of its framework.\n\nCrystal Structure of [Cd2(BTC)2(H2O)2]\u22c52(HCHA)\u22c52(EtOH)\u22c52(H2O) (2)\n\nThe X-ray structural analysis shows that 2 crystallizes in a monoclinic system, space group P21/c (No. 14). An asymmetric unit of 2 contains two cadmium centers, two BTC, two coordinated H2O, two guest HCHA, two guest EtOH, and two guest H2O. As shown in Figure a, two Cd(II) centers adopt the same coordination form, and each center and its counterpart via symmetry transformation are coordinated by six different carboxylate groups to construct a dinuclear octahedral SBU, respectively. In addition, two crystallographical independent BTC ligands also adopt the same coordination form and coordinate to three octahedral SBUs by their three carboxylate groups, respectively. These octahedral SBUs are further extended by BTC ligands into a 3D network with quadrangular channel dimensions of ca. 8.1 \u00d7 10.9 \u00c5 (measured between opposite atoms) viewed along the [101] direction (Figure b). In this structure, the vacancies of each asymmetric unit are filled with two guest H2O, two guest EtOH, and two guest HCHA, which connect to the framework via hydrogen bonds (Figure c). The TGA curve for 2 shows that the weight loss of 12.73% during the first step between 30 and 115 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of two guest EtOH and two guest H2O of each asymmetric unit (calculated 12.77%), and the weight loss of 23.48% during the second step between 270 and 320 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of two guest HCHA and two coordination H2O of each asymmetric unit (calculated 23.55%). Decomposition of 2 starts at 350 \u00b0C. The XRD patterns of the as-synthesized and the corresponding calcinated product of polymer 2 are similar, although the intensities of the latter become weak and the widths of some peaks show certain differences. This indicates that the porous network of 2 is basically retained after the removal of the guest molecules and terminal H2O molecules. After guest molecules are removed, the effective free volume of 2 is calculated by PLATON analysis as 56.2% (0.31 mL/g) of the crystal volume (2087.2 \u00c53 out of the 3716.1 \u00c53 unit cell volume).\n\nCrystal Structure of [Cd5(BTC)4Cl4]\u22c54(HTEA)\u22c52(H3O) (3)\n\nX-ray crystallography shows that 3 crystallizes in a tetragonal system, space group P4212 (No. 90). The asymmetric unit of 3 contains one and a quarter cadmium centers, one BTC, one coordination chlorine ion, one guest HTEA, and half a guest H3O. As shown in Figure a, one Cd(II) center is coordinated by four different carboxylate groups to construct a tetrahedral SBU, and another Cd(II) center and its counterpart via symmetry transformation are also linked by four carboxylate groups from four distinct BTC ligands into a square \"paddle-wheel\" SBU, and each of them completes its coordination geometries with an axial chlorine ion opposite to the Cd-Cd vector. Clearly, BTC coordinates to two tetrahedral SBUs and one square SBU by its three carboxylate groups. The tetrahedral SBUs and square SBUs are interconnected through BTC ligands to generate a 3D infinite network with square channel dimensions of ca. 11.5 \u00d7 11.5 \u00c5 (measured between opposite atoms) viewed along the [001] direction (Figure b). As shown in Figure c, the vacancies are filled with half a guest H3O and one guest HTEA of each asymmetric unit, which connect to the framework via hydrogen bonds. Its TGA curve reveals that the weight loss of 2.01% during the first step between 30 and 85 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of half a guest H3O of each asymmetric unit (calculated 1.92%), and the weight loss of 20.59% during the second step between 240 and 290 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of one guest HTEA of each asymmetric unit (calculated 20.66%). Decomposition of 3 starts at 350 \u00b0C. XRD patterns of the as-synthesized and corresponding calcinated product of 3 indicate that the porous network of 3 is still maintained after the calcination, although the intensities show some differences. After guest molecules are removed, its effective free volume is estimated by PLATON analysis as 64.5% (0.50 mL/g) of the crystal volume (3309.9 \u00c53 out of the 5134.5 \u00c53 unit cell volume).\n\nCrystal Structure of [Cd3(BTC)3(H2O)]\u22c5(HTEA)\u22c52(H3O) (4)\n\nThe X-ray structural analysis reveals that 4 crystallizes in the monoclinic system, space group P21/c (No. 14). In an asymmetric unit of 4, there are three cadmium centers, three BTC, one coordination H2O, one guest HTEA, and two guest H3O. As shown in Figure a, three crystallographical independent Cd(II) centers and their counterparts produced by their symmetry transformation construct three kinds of SBUs: square \"paddle-wheel\" SBU, tetrahedral SBU, and octahedral SBU, respectively. Otherwise, three crystallographical independent BTC ligands coordinate to one octahedral SBU and two tetrahedral SBUs (named as BTC-a), one square SBU and two octahedral SBUs (named as BTC-b), and one square SBU and two tetrahedral SBUs (named as BTC-c) by their three carboxylate groups, respectively. These octahedral, tetrahedral, and square SBUs are connected to each other through BTC ligands to yield a intricate 3D architecture with two elliptical channels dimensions of ca. 3.2 \u00d7 8.4 \u00c5 and 8.4 \u00d7 9.6 \u00c5 (measured between opposite atoms) viewed along the [100] direction (Figure b). The vacancies are filled with two guest H3O and one guest HTEA of each asymmetric unit. However, interestingly, only the space of small channels is full of guest HTEA which connect to the framework via hydrogen bonds, while the space of its large channels is kept void (Figure c). The TGA curve of 4 exhibits that the weight loss of 3.43% during the first step between 30 and 115 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of two guest H3O of each asymmetric unit (calculated 3.41%), and the weight loss of 10.62% during the second step between 255 and 300 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of one guest HTEA and one coordinated H2O of each asymmetric unit (calculated 10.76%). Decomposition of 4 starts at 350 \u00b0C. XRD patterns of the as-synthesized and corresponding calcinated product of 4 are similar, indicating that the porous framework of 4 is still maintained after the calcination. After those guest H3O and HTEA molecules are removed, the effective free volume of 4 is evaluated by PLATON analysis as 64.1% (0.57 mL/g) of the crystal volume (4244.0 \u00c53 out of the 6619.0 \u00c53 unit cell volume).\n\nCrystal Structure of [Zn(BTC)(H2O)]\u22c5(HTPA)\u22c5(H2O) (5)\n\nSingle-crystal X-ray analysis of 5 reveals that it crystallizes in the monoclinic system, space group P21/c (No. 14). The asymmetric unit of 5 comprises one zinc center, one BTC, one coordinated H2O, one guest HTPA, and one guest H2O. As shown in Figure a, the Zn(II) center is coordinated by four oxygen atoms from three different carboxylate groups and one terminal H2O to construct a triangular SBU, and BTC ligand coordinates to three triangular SBUs by its three carboxylate groups. These triangular SBUs are further extended by BTC ligands, thereby producing a 2D framework with elliptical channel dimensions of ca. 9.9 \u00d7 10.6 \u00c5 (measured between opposite atoms) viewed along the [101] direction (Figure b). In this structure the space between two layers is full of guest H2O and guest HTPA, and the vacancies of each asymmetric unit are filled with one guest H2O and one guest HTPA, which connect to the framework via hydrogen bonds (Figure c). The TGA curve for 5 shows that the weight loss of 4.02% during the first step between 30 and 112 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of one guest H2O of each asymmetric unit (calculated 3.98%), and the weight loss of 35.73% during the second step between 255 and 310 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of one guest HTPA and one coordinated H2O of each asymmetric unit (calculated 35.84%). However, similar to 1, further heating leads to collapse of the framework of 5.\n\nCrystal Structure of [Cd(BTC)]\u22c5(HTPA)\u22c5(H2O) (6)\n\nThe structural analysis of 6 reveals that it crystallizes in the monoclinic system, space group P21/c (No. 14). An asymmetric unit of 6 includes one cadmium center, one BTC, one guest HTPA, and one guest H2O. As shown in Figure a, the Cd(II) center and other Cd(II) center generated by its symmetry transformation are coordinated to six different carboxylate groups to construct a octahedral SBU. Clearly, the BTC ligand coordinates to three octahedral SBUs by their three carboxylate groups. Extension of the coordination geometry around these octahedral SBUs and BTC ligands will therefore give a 3D infinite framework with quadrangular channel dimensions of ca. 9.2 \u00d7 9.8 \u00c5 (measured between opposite atoms) viewed along the [100] direction (Figure b). The vacancies of each asymmetric unit are filled with one guest H2O and one guest HTPA, which connect to the framework via hydrogen bonds (Figure c). TGA of 6 shows that the weight loss of 3.79% during the first step between 30 and 110 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of one guest H2O of each asymmetric unit (calculated 3.74%), and the weight loss of 29.86% during the second step between 290 and 360 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of one guest HTPA of each asymmetric unit (calculated 29.94%). Decomposition of 6 starts at 430 \u00b0C. Although the intensities become weak and the widths of some peaks appear different, XRD pattern of the calcinated product of 6 are very similar to 6, which explains that the porous architecture of 6 is still retained after removal of its guest molecules. After removing those guest molecules, the effective free volume of 6 is calculated by PLATON analysis as 59.2% (0.36 mL/g) of the crystal volume (1151.9 \u00c53 out of the 1944.3 \u00c53 unit cell
