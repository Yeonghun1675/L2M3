This approach has proven to be a powerful tool in the prediction and interpretation of magnetic properties of a large variety of magnetic systems, as well as for revealing and tracing magneto-structural correlations. The broken symmetry treatment results in a solution that is an eigenstate of S z  (with eigenvalue S min) but not of S2, which can be written as a weighted average of the energies of the pure spin multiplets. In order to analyze the results, the approximate projection method introduced by Yamaguchi and co-workers to account for the spin contamination was employed in the approximate spin projected scheme. The hybrid B3LYP method, as implemented in Gaussian 03, was used in all calculations. The exact Hartree-Fock-type exchange was mixed with Becke's expression for the exchange functional, and the Lang-Yong-Parr correlation functional was used. The Gaussian implemented 6-31G(d) basis set has been employed throughout this work. In order to reproduce as close as possible the chemical surrounding for the computed superexchange coupling for every adjacent pair of metal centers, the additional metal centers coordinated to the bridging ligands were replaced by zinc(II) atoms without any further change in the coordination bond distances. The coordination sphere of every metal center is completed by the original ligand molecules/anions except for uracil-propionate that was replaced by acetate anions. The results are summarized in Table .

Considering the structural features, the experimental data were least-square fitted with a numerical expression proposed for an antiferromagnetic copper(II) uniform chain that leads to J (triplet-singlet gap) = -0.2 cm-1, g = 2.14, and R = 1.7 \u00d7 10-6, R being the agreement factor defined as \u2211 i [(\u03c7M T)obs(i) - (\u03c7M T)calc(i)]2/\u03a3 i [(\u03c7M T)obs(i)]2. This almost negligible antiferromagnetic coupling can be understood in terms of the nature of the orbital involved in the superexchange interactions, together with the arrangement of the bridging ligand. The unpaired electron of the copper(II) ion is essentially described by a magnetic orbital built from the d x 2 -y 2  metallic orbital and located mainly in the basal plane. The carboxylato, with a basal (short, 1.945(2) \u00c5)-axial (long, 2.624(2) \u00c5) bridging mode leads to an almost nil overlap between the two metal-centered magnetic orbitals, resulting in a weak anti- or ferromagnetic (when the overlap is zero, accidental orthogonality) coupling. \n\nVariable temperature susceptibility measurements of compounds 3 and 4 (Figure ) reveal, despite their structural similarity, a different magnetic behavior. The \u03c7m T value per copper(II) atom for compound 3 at room temperature is 0.430 cm3 K mol-1. This value remains almost constant until 120 K and shows a sharp decrease upon cooling to reach a value of 0.012 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K. The thermal evolution of the magnetic susceptibility shows the presence of a rounded maximum around 43 K. This behavior is indicative of dominant moderate antiferromagnetic interactions between the Cu(II) atoms. Compound 4 presents a \u03c7m T value at room temperature of 0.092 cm3 K mol-1 which is well below the expected value for a copper(II) metal center. This value slowly decreases upon cooling down to 15 K, and then it drops to a value of 0.009 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K. The magnetic susceptibility curve shows a sharp maximum at 5 K. The low \u03c7m T value at room temperature and its slow decrease upon cooling suggests the presence of very strong antiferromagnetic coupling between some but not all the copper(II) centers. In fact, from the maximum in the \u03c7m curve at 5 K it can be inferred that the remaining copper(II) atoms present only weak antiferromagnetic interactions.\n\nElectrical Conductivity Studies\n\nTwo probe direct current (dc) electrical conductivity measurements at 300 K were performed in six single crystals of compound 2, four of compound 3, and in two pressed pellets of compound 4 (due to the impossibility to obtain suitable crystals for these measurements). The conductivity values at 300 K were obtained applying voltages from +10 to -10 V. For complexes 2-4, the room temperature dc conductivity values are 1.0 \u00d7 10-9, 6.8 \u00d7 10-6, and 7.7 \u00d7 10-8 S\u22c5cm-1, respectively, suggesting a semiconductor behavior in all cases. For compounds 2 and 3, we have also performed dc electrical measurements with the four contacts method in the temperature range 300-400 K in order to confirm the semiconducting behavior and determine the activation energy. These measurements show activation energies of ca. 1.3 eV for both complexes (). As expected, at 400 K the conductivity is higher with values of 1 \u00d7 10-6 and 5 \u00d7 10-7 S cm-1 in complexes 2 and 3, respectively. Note that the crystals used for the conductivity measurements at high temperatures present some microfractures after the thermal cycles under a vacuum, indicative of a degradation of the quality of the single crystals that justify the fact that in compound 3 the conductivity in the cooling scan is lower than in the heating scan () and also that the conductivity at 400 K in some crystals is lower than at 300 K in other crystals. Note also that the conductivity of compound 4 should be higher than the reported value since the measurements in pressed pellets usually yield conductivity values two or more orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding measurements on single crystals.
