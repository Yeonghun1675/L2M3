This work presents almost all the functions of the N-donor ancillary ligands in the construction of uranyl CPs: acting as organic base to adjust pH, coordinating to the metal center, involving in the formation of the intermolecular weak interaction, keeping the charge balance after protonation, acting as guest molecule to fill in the void space of the UOF, and acting as template agent. Introducing the organic base ancillary ligands into the reaction system is an effective way to synthesize novel uranyl compounds. In addition, according to the DFT calculations, obvious metal-ligand bonding orbitals have been found in the MOs of the uranyl compounds 1-3, which are mainly attributed to U 5f, 6d, 7s and O, N 2p orbital interactions. Besides, there is no uranium-uranium bonding interaction in compound 2.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 45, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information is available free of\ncharge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications\nwebsite</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.cgd.6b00429\">10.1021/acs.cgd.6b00429</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Typical figures\nincluding EDS, IR spectrum, TGA curves, and PXRD (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.cgd.6b00429/suppl_file/cg6b00429_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p><p>Typical figures\nincluding EDS, IR spectrum, TGA curves, and PXRD (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.cgd.6b00429/suppl_file/cg6b00429_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p><p>CCDC <ext-link ext-link-type=\"ccdc\" xlink:href=\"1438789\">1438789</ext-link>\u2013<ext-link ext-link-type=\"ccdc\" xlink:href=\"1438792\">1438792</ext-link> contains the supplementary crystallographic data\nfor this paper.
