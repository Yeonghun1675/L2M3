Unfortunately, the fluorinated complex [Ir(dFppy)2(1)][PF6] could not be obtained following this synthetic route. Indeed, this strategy afforded a mixture of fluorinated Iridium complexes, as evidenced by 19F NMR spectroscopy. The mixture could not be purified by standard methods. The desired Ir complex rac-[Ir(dFppy)2(1)][PF6] was successfully obtained using another strategy based on Pd-catalyzed Sonogashira coupling reactions using Ir(III) complexes as substrates. It should be noted that such an approach has been previously developed for Pd-catalyzed Suzuki coupling reactions in which cationic tris-bidentate or bis-tridentate cyclometalated Iridium(III) complexes were used as substrates. This route requires the synthesis of 5,5'-dibromo-2,2'-bipyridine (2). The latter was prepared in 69% yield by a Stille coupling reaction using 5-bromo-2-iodopyridine ( top). Using a slightly modified reported procedure, the dibromo Ir complex rac-[Ir(dFppy)2(2)][PF6] was obtained in 60% yield as a 1/1 mixture of both enantiomers upon reaction of the dichloro-bridged dimer rac-[Ir(dFppy)2(\u03bc-Cl)]2  with the dibromo 2,2'-bipyridine ligand 2 in a mixture of CH2Cl2 and CH3OH followed by precipitation with an aqueous KPF6 solution ( top). Finally, a Pd-catalyzed Sonogashira coupling reaction between rac-[Ir(dFppy)2(2)][PF6] and 4-ethynylpyridine afforded the desired complex rac-[Ir(dFppy)2(1)][PF6] as a mixture of enantiomers in 46% yield. In addition to classical characterizations (see ), rac-[Ir(dFppy)2(1)][PF6] was also structurally studied in the crystalline phase by X-ray diffraction on a single crystal (see  for crystallographic data). Crystals of rac-[Ir(dFppy)2(1)][PF6] were obtained by vapor diffusion of Et2O into a CH3CN solution of the Ir complex (). Owing to the disorder of solvent molecules, the structure was solved using the SQUEEZE command. rac-[Ir(dFppy)2(1)][PF6] crystallizes in the triclinic system with P-1 as the space group, and it exhibits similar geometrical parameters as those reported for iridium(III) complexes containing two dFppy ligands and one unsubstituted bpy or 5,5'-substituted bpy ligand (average bond lengths and angles: Ir-Cppy 2.011 \u00c5; Ir-Nppy 2.041 \u00c5; Ir-Nbpy 2.136 \u00c5; Nppy-Ir-Nppy 171.71\u00b0; Nppy-Ir-Cppy 80.65\u00b0; Nbpy-Ir-Nbpy 76.81\u00b0). Within the crystal, two crystallographically nonequivalent Ir complexes are present (b and c). Both Ir centers adopt a slightly distorted octahedral coordination geometry with the expected trans-arrangement of the N donor atoms and cis-arrangement of the C atoms of the cyclometalated ligand. The bipyridyl moiety is almost planar, and the ethynyl junctions between the central bipyridyl and terminal pyridyl groups are almost linear (C-C-C angles in the 174.37-180.00\u00b0 range). The terminal pyridyl units are almost coplanar to the central bpy unit (dihedral angles ranging from -11.84\u00b0 to 4.92\u00b0). Both \u0394 and \u039b enantiomers are present in the lattice (a), leading thus to an achiral space group. The length of the metallatecton, i.e. the distance between the two N atoms of the terminal pyridyl units, is ca. 20.6 \u00c5. \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between two substituted bpy ligands belonging to two neighboring \u0394 (or \u039b) enantiomers are observed (shortest C-C distances of 3.55 and 3.59 \u00c5 for the two types of Ir complexes; b and c respectively).

When compared to [Ir(dFppy)2(bpyH2)]+, a bathochromic shift is observed for rac-[Ir(dFppy)2(1)][PF6]. This may be attributed to delocalization of the bipyridine \u03c0 system, stabilizing its LUMO. This is supported by similar behavior in solution reported for ppy-cyclometalated Ir complexes bearing 2,2'-bipyridine ligand substituted in positions 5 and 5' with aryl rings or oligo(arylene ethynylene) units. It should also be noted that, in solution, the emission lifetimes are similar for rac-[Ir(dFppy)2(1)]+ (\u03c4 = 1.97 and 0.49 \u03bcs in degassed and aerated THF, respectively; \u03c4 = 1.52 and 0.36 \u03bcs in degassed and aerated CH3CN, respectively) and for [Ir(dFppy)2(bpyH2)]+ (\u03c4 = 1.50 \u03bcs, degassed CH3CN). Finally, at room temperature, the complex rac-[Ir(dFppy)2(1)][PF6] exhibits in degassed THF and in the solid state quantum yields (QY) of 19% and 2%, respectively. As described above for rac-[Ir(dFppy)2(1)][PF6], the presence of \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions () may account for the low solid-state QY.
