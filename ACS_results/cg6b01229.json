As shown here, lithium cubane clusters\ncan serve as a promising platform for building novel frameworks with\ntunable structures and properties. The responsiveness in the organization\nof clusters to synthetic parameters is particularly worth noting as\nit suggests the potential rich structural variety. Instead of the\ncommonly observed interpenetration effect based on the same cluster\norientation and connectivity, the lithium-ligand coassembly process\nresponds to the elongation of ditopic bifunctional organic linker\nby maintaining the same cluster type and connectivity and yet adopting\ntwo complementary orientations, leading to a self-penetrating framework.\nOn the other hand, in response to the relative concentrations of metal\nions and ligands, cubane clusters self-polymerize into an unprecedented\n1D lithium cubane chain which contributes to thermal stability.

As shown here, lithium cubane clusters can serve as a promising platform for building novel frameworks with tunable structures and properties. The responsiveness in the organization of clusters to synthetic parameters is particularly worth noting as it suggests the potential rich structural variety. Instead of the commonly observed interpenetration effect based on the same cluster orientation and connectivity, the lithium-ligand coassembly process responds to the elongation of ditopic bifunctional organic linker by maintaining the same cluster type and connectivity and yet adopting two complementary orientations, leading to a self-penetrating framework. On the other hand, in response to the relative concentrations of metal ions and ligands, cubane clusters self-polymerize into an unprecedented 1D lithium cubane chain which contributes to thermal stability. These features contribute to relatively high uptakes of H2 and CO2 observed here compared to other known Li-MOFs.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 29, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting\nInformation\nis available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.cgd.6b01229\">10.1021/acs.cgd.6b01229</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Experimental details,\nTGA and PXRD patterns, additional\nfigures (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.cgd.6b01229/suppl_file/cg6b01229_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p><p>Experimental details,\nTGA and PXRD patterns, additional\nfigures (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.cgd.6b01229/suppl_file/cg6b01229_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p><p>CCDC <ext-link ext-link-type=\"ccdc\" xlink:href=\"1497079\">1497079</ext-link>\u2013<ext-link ext-link-type=\"ccdc\" xlink:href=\"1497080\">1497080</ext-link> contains the supplementary crystallographic data\nfor this paper.
