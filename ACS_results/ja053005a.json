Threading of L2 through the cavity of L4Pd(CH3CN) via the substitution of the coordinated acetonitrile was attempted by simple mixing of the two in dichloromethane at room temperature (Scheme , vi). While mass spectrometry confirmed the ligand exchange, the 1H NMR spectrum of the crude product was unexpectedly complex. Closer inspection of the thin layer chromatograph of the reaction mixture revealed two products with very similar R  f  values in a ratio of approximately 2:3. Despite their proximity, these proved amenable to separation by preparative thin-layer chromatography on silica gel-coated plates (CH2Cl2:MeOH, 98.5:1.5 as eluent).  The isolated complexes gave indistinguishable fragmentation patterns by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, the molecular mass ion suggesting they were both isomers of L4PdL2.

Each atropisomer was shown to be a true intermediate to a different topological product, meaning that, in this reaction, the choice of solvent can determine whether the [2]catenate is formed or its noninterlocked isomer. It is remarkable to see how topology and connectivity can be selected so exquisitely\ue5f8in three different forms\ue5f8using just one set of organic building blocks and a metal atom with a two-dimensional coordination geometry.
