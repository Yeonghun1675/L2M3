The resulting gray suspension was heated at 120 \u00b0C for 7 h in the closed flask to give a colorless solution, which was cooled without stirring to 40 \u00b0C overnight. Colorless crystals separated from the solution. The liquid components were removed by syringe, and the remaining colorless crystals were washed twice with hexane (10 mL) and dried in vacuo (10 mbar) for 3 h to give 5 (1.5 g, 5.44 mmol) in 92% yield. \n\nRedistribution of 5 in Benzene-d 6/THF solution\n\nIn an NMR tube, 0.15 g of 5 (0.54 mmol) was dissolved in 3 mL of a benzene-d 6/THF (1:1) solution. The measured NMR data were tentatively assigned to the formation of the redistribution products bis(3-dimethylgallylphenyl\u22c5THF)methylgallium\u22c5THF (13) and trimethylgallium\u22c5THF (14). 1H NMR (benzene-d 6) [\u03b4/ppm] 13: -0.06 (s, 12H, GaMe2), 0.14 (s, 3H, GaMe), 1.48 br (THF), 3.51 br (THF), 7.42 (m, 2H, aryl), 7.74 (m, 4H, aryl), 8.22 (s, 2H, aryl). 14: -0.28 (s, 9H, GaMe3), 1.48 br (THF), 3.51 br (THF). Evaporation of all volatiles led to an insoluble solid residue.\n\nSolid-State Decomposition of 5 and Its Regeneration\n\nTwo Schlenk flasks, A and B, were connected by a bent ground-glass joint. Flask A was charged with compound 5 (2.10 g, 7.61 mmol), and the system was evacuated (0.1 mbar). Flask B was then cooled with liquid nitrogen. Flask A was heated at 120 \u00b0C for a period of 30 min. Thereafter, an amorphous insoluble solid remained in flask A. Compound 5 liberated 0.79 g (7.02 mmol) of trimethylgallium, which was collected in flask B and characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy [(benzene-d 6) \u03b4 = -0.28 ppm (s, GaMe3)].\n\nThe amorphous solid (1.31 g) was combined in a thick-walled Schlenk flask with trimethylgallium (15.00 g, 135.9 mmol). The mixture was heated at 120 \u00b0C for 5 h to give a colorless solution, which was cooled without stirring to 40 \u00b0C overnight. Colorless crystals of 5 separated from the solution. The crystals were isolated (1.85 g) and characterized by X-ray diffraction (space group determination).\n\n1,3-Bis(dimethylgallyl)-5-n-butylbenzene (6)\n\nTrimethylgallium (5.39 g, 46.92 mmol) was added to 1,3-bis(chloromercurio)-5-n-butylbenzene (4) (1.18 g, 1.96 mmol) in a thick-walled Schlenk flask. The resulting colorless suspension was heated at 120 \u00b0C for 4 h in the closed flask to afford a colorless solution. All volatile components were removed at reduced pressure (10 mbar). To the remaining colorless amorphous solid was added trimethylgallium (1.0 mL) to give a colorless suspension, which was again heated at 70 \u00b0C for 2 h to a give a colorless solution. The solution was maintained at 40 \u00b0C without stirring overnight to give 6 as colorless crystals. The liquid components were removed by syringe, and the remaining crystals were washed with cold hexane (5 mL) at -80 \u00b0C and dried in vacuo (10 mbar) for 3 h to give 6 (0.63 g, 1.8 mmol) in 92% yield. \n\n1,4-Bis(dimethylgallyl)benzene (9)\n\nTrimethylgallium (16.62 g, 144.7 mmol) was added to 8 (3.31 g, 6.03 mmol) in a thick-walled Schlenk flask. The resulting colorless suspension was heated at 140 \u00b0C for 5 h in the closed flask to give a colorless solution. The solution was maintained at 40 \u00b0C without stirring for 3 days. Colorless crystals of 9 separated from the solution. The liquid components were removed with syringe, and the remaining crystals were washed with cold hexane (5 mL) and dried in vacuo (10 mbar) for 3 h to give 9 (1.42 g, 5.15 mmol) in 86% yield. \n\n1,3,5-Tris(dimethylgallyl)benzene (12)\n\nTrimethylgallium (7.40 g, 64.4 mmol) was added to 1,3,5-tris(chloromercurio)benzene (11) (1.19 g, 1.61 mmol) in a thick-walled Schlenk flask. The resulting gray suspension was heated at 100 \u00b0C for 7 h in the closed flask to give a colorless solution. The solution was maintained at 40 \u00b0C without stirring overnight. Colorless crystals of 12 separated from the solution. The liquid components were removed by syringe, and the remaining crystals were washed twice with hexane (10 mL) and dried at reduced pressure (10 mbar) for 3 h to give 12 (0.56 g, 1.5 mmol) in 93% yield.
