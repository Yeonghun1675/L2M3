The as-synthesized compounds do not show any proton conductivity under anhydrous conditions at 25 \u00b0C. However, after 24 h of humidification both compounds start showing proton conductivity, which reveals the role of the H2O molecule as a proton carrier. The proton conductivities of compounds 1 and 2 were determined from the semicircles in the high-frequency regions of Nyquist plots, which correspond to both bulk and grain boundary resistance, and the tail in the low-frequency region is due to blocking effects at the electrode-electrolyte interface. Compound 1 shows proton conductivity of 5.23 \u00d7 10-10 S cm-1 at 25 \u00b0C and 95% RH (Figure S17, ), and the conductivity value increases with increasing temperature (Figure S18, ) and reaches a maximum value of 2.55 \u00d7 10-7 S cm-1 at 80 \u00b0C and 95% RH, which is quite close to the value for the previously reported MIL-53 series flexible MOFs (3.6 \u00d7 10-7 S cm-1) under similar conditions (Figure ). Compound 2 shows proton conductivity of 1.33 \u00d7 10-7 S cm-1 at 25 \u00b0C and 95% RH (Figure S19, ), and the value increases with an increase in temperature (Figure S20, ) and saturates with a value of 4.39 \u00d7 10-4 S cm-1 (at 80 \u00b0C and 95% RH) (Figure ). To the best of our knowledge, compound 2 shows the highest proton conductivity to date among the reported carboxylate-based 1D CPs (at 80 \u00b0C, 95% RH). However, the value is lower than that of phosphonate-based MOFs reported (2.1 \u00d7 10-2 S cm-1 at 90% RH and 85 \u00b0C) by Shimizu et al. It is worth mentioning that, in both compounds, the proton conductivity increases with an increase in temperature. To probe and gain more insight into the proton conduction mechanism, we calculated the activation energies for proton conduction of compounds 1 and 2 from the Arrhenius equation. As determined from least-squares fits of the slopes of Arrhenius plots, the activation energies of compounds 1 and 2 were 0.96 and 0.84 eV, respectively (Figure ) and from these values it is concluded that the observed proton conductivities follow the Vehicle mechanism.

The results show that compound 1 exhibits less conductivity in the low-temperature regions (Figure S45, ) and the corresponding values are slightly increased with increasing temperature (7.96 \u00d7 10-10 S cm-1 at 80 \u00b0C) (Figures S46 and S47, ), whereas compound 2 shows almost negligible conductivity in the low- and high-temperature regions. From this observation we anticipate that under anhydrous conditions only lattice water molecules play an important role in proton conduction. The much smaller conductivity value in the case of compound 2 could be due to the smaller number of lattice water molecules (two H2O molecules) in comparison to compound 1 (five H2O molecules).", "data": [["(SyntaxError('invalid syntax', ('<unknown>', 1, 114, '[{\"meta\":{\"name\":\"\", \"symbol\":\"1\", \"chemical formula\":\"[Zn(C10H2O8)0.5(C10S2N2H8)]\u22c55H2O\"}}, \"proton_conductivity\": [{\"value\":\"2.55 \u00d7 10-7\",\"unit\":\"S/cm\",\"temperature\": \"80 \u00b0C\", \"RH\":\"95\", \"Ea\": \"\", \"guest\":\"\"}], \"etc\": [{\"property name\": \"conductivity under anhydrous conditions\", \"value\":\"7.96 \u00d7 10-10\", \"unit\": \"S/cm\", \"condition\": \"80 \u00b0C\"}]}, {\"meta\":{\"name\":\"\", \"symbol\":\"2\", \"chemical formula\":\"[Zn(C10H2O8)0.5(C10S2N2H8)]\u22c52H2O\"}}, \"proton_conductivity\": [{\"value\":\"4.39 \u00d7 10-4\",\"unit\":\"S/cm\",\"temperature\": \"80 \u00b0C\", \"RH\":\"95\", \"Ea\": \"\", \"guest\":\"\"}], \"etc\": [{\"property name\": \"conductivity under anhydrous conditions\", \"value\":\"negligible\", \"unit\": \"S/cm\", \"condition\": \"low- and high-temperature regions\"}]}]')), '[{\"meta\":{\"name\":\"\", \"symbol\":\"1\", \"chemical formula\":\"[Zn(C10H2O8)0.5(C10S2N2H8)]\u22c55H2O\"}}, \"proton_conductivity\": [{\"value\":\"2.55 \u00d7 10-7\",\"unit\":\"S/cm\",\"temperature\": \"80 \u00b0C\", \"RH\":\"95\", \"Ea\": \"\", \"guest\":\"\"}], \"etc\": [{\"property name\": \"conductivity under anhydrous conditions\", \"value\":\"7.96 \u00d7 10-10\", \"unit\": \"S/cm\", \"condition\": \"80 \u00b0C\"}]}, {\"meta\":{\"name\":\"\", \"symbol\":\"2\", \"chemical formula\":\"[Zn(C10H2O8)0.5(C10S2N2H8)]\u22c52H2O\"}}, \"proton_conductivity\": [{\"value\":\"4.39 \u00d7 10-4\",\"unit\":\"S/cm\",\"temperature\": \"80 \u00b0C\", \"RH\":\"95\", \"Ea\": \"\", \"guest\":\"\"}], \"etc\": [{\"property name\": \"conductivity under anhydrous conditions\", \"value\":\"negligible\", \"unit\": \"S/cm\", \"condition\": \"low- and high-temperature regions\"}]}]')"]], "include_properties": ["proton_conductivity", "etc"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['proton_conductivity', 'etc']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[{\"meta\":{\"name\":\"\", \"symbol\":\"1\", \"chemical formula\":\"[Zn(C10H2O8)0.5(C10S2N2H8)]\u22c55H2O\"}}, \"proton_conductivity\": [{\"value\":\"2.55 \u00d7 10-7\",\"unit\":\"S/cm\",\"temperature\": \"80 \u00b0C\", \"RH\":\"95\", \"Ea\": \"\", \"guest\":\"\"}], \"etc\": [{\"property name\": \"conductivity under anhydrous conditions\", \"value\":\"7.96 \u00d7 10-10\", \"unit\": \"S/cm\", \"condition\": \"80 \u00b0C\"}]}, {\"meta\":{\"name\":\"\", \"symbol\":\"2\", \"chemical formula\":\"[Zn(C10H2O8)0.5(C10S2N2H8)]\u22c52H2O\"}}, \"proton_conductivity\": [{\"value\":\"4.39 \u00d7 10-4\",\"unit\":\"S/cm\",\"temperature\": \"80 \u00b0C\", \"RH\":\"95\", \"Ea\": \"\", \"guest\":\"\"}], \"etc\": [{\"property name\": \"conductivity under anhydrous conditions\", \"value\":\"negligible\", \"unit\": \"S/cm\", \"condition\": \"low- and high-temperature regions\"}]}]\n```"}}, {"idx": 9, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>2D layered structure\nof compound <bold>1</bold> (top) and its hydrogen-bonding network\namong the lattice water molecules (bottom).
