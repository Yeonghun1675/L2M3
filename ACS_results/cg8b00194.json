Two main locations of CO2 molecules, CO2-I and CO2-II, were found existing in the pores of 1. CO2-I is close to the trinuclear cluster, with a vertical molecular axis to the plane of cluster (a). Interestingly, due to the planar geometry of the cluster, three electronegative atoms, including one uncoordinated tetrazolate N atom, one F atom, and one carboxylate O atom, exactly chelate with one electropositive C atom of CO2-I, which is very similar to the situation where one metal ion is chelated by three pyridyl rings in metal-terpyridine complexes. Consequently, CO2-I is fixed firmly by the cluster through strong C\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O, C\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5F, and C\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5N interactions, wherein the C\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O (3.302 \u00c5), C\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5F (2.902 \u00c5), and C\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5N (3.205 \u00c5) distances are comparable with the sum of van der Waals radii of the corresponding two atoms (C 1.70 \u00c5; N 1.55 \u00c5; O 1.52 \u00c5; F 1.47 \u00c5). Notably, the molecular axis of CO2-I is parallel to bpy ligands running along the b axis, as a result two O atoms of CO2-I are further anchored by C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O (H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O = 2.543-3.095 \u00c5) hydrogen bonds with the pyridyl -CH edge groups in two subnets. In contrast to CO2-I, CO2-II is observed in the vicinity of organic fragments of ligands in two subnets. For CO2-II, the C atom situates at the top of one pyridyl ring of bpy and forms C\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions with the C\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0centroid distance of 3.450 \u00c5 (b). Two O atoms in CO2-II have the similar environments; both of them are attracted by two electropositive C atoms of phenyl and pyridyl groups from tzba and bpy, respectively, wherein the C\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O separations vary from 3.037 to 3.286 \u00c5. In addition, one O atom in CO2-II also contacts with one carboxylate C atom (C\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O = 3.204 \u00c5).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 28, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig7\" position=\"float\">\n<label>7</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Two different locations\nof CO<sub>2</sub> molecules in <bold>1</bold> with the multiple adsorption\nsites.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr7\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cg-2018-00194b_0007.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 7  Two different locations of CO2 molecules in 1 with the multiple adsorption sites.
