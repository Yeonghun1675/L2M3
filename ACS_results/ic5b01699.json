Unit cell determination at -133 \u00b0C indicated that the crystal had lost its single crystallinity and suggested that the unit cell was approximately 4 times larger than the higher temperature unit cell. The reversibility of the phase change on warming was not investigated. Attempts to detwin the low-temperature structure or model the disorder in the high-temperature structure were unsuccessful. The best model was obtained by refining against data collected on a single crystal measuring 0.10 \u00d7 0.10 \u00d7 0.05 mm3 at 0.0 \u00b0C. The structure was solved by intrinsic phasing, and all non-hydrogen atoms could be anisotropically refined by full-matrix least-squares refinement against F 2. The unresolved disorder leads to large thermal parameters and deviating carbon-carbon bond distances in the cation as well as difference map peaks and holes around the metal center. However, it is clear from the comparison of the structure with the more well-behaved [C2mim]2[UO2(NO3)2N(CN)2)2] structure that the atom positions have been correctly assigned. Additionally, the structure contained three outlying reflections with I obs/I calc > 10\u03c3. Removing these reflections from the refinement seemed to negatively affect the positions of the atoms in the disordered cation, so they were ultimately kept in the refinement. The deviation may actually reflect inaccuracy in I calc due to the unresolved disorder rather than errors in the measured intensity of these reflections.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 26, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The structure\nof [(C<sub>2</sub>CN)\u00ad(C<sub>4</sub>CN)\u00adIm]<sub>2<italic toggle=\"yes\">n</italic>\n</sub>[{(UO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>(O)<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub>(N\u00ad(CN)<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>}<sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">n</italic>\n</sub>] was determined\nfrom SCXRD data collected on a crystal measuring 0.07 \u00d7 0.04\n\u00d7 0.03 mm<sup>3</sup> at \u2212100 \u00b0C ().
