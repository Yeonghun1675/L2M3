An analogous geometry was also found in the uranyl-manganese heterometallic complex with C132-, while a molecular complex with a terminal Mn(phen)2 group bound to a chelating carboxylate is present in the complex with C82-. In the whole series of Cn 2- complexes obtained up to now, Mn(II) (and in one case Co(II) as well) is notable for its tendency to exchange one of the three bipy/phen ligands generally found with Fe(II) or Ni(II) cations for two carboxylate donors. One C72- anion in 3 is bis-chelating and connects two uranium atoms, and the other is bound to one uranium and two manganese ions in chelating/bridging bidentate fashion. Both of them display quite irregular conformations, with different sequences of anti and gauche (or intermediate) values for the O-C-C-C and C-C-C-C torsion angles. As a result of this connectivity, a 2D assembly parallel to (1 0 2\u0305) is formed, with the point (Schla\u0308fli) symbol {103} if only uranium atoms are considered as nodes (the manganese dimer being a simple link). These layers are planar, but they can be seen as formed of two heterometallic layers and they have a substantial thickness of ~14 \u00c5 (between the outermost phen atoms). No contact indicative of \u03c0-stacking interactions is found, as a result of the layers being packed in bump-to-hollow fashion with no close approach of the protruding phen groups, but two CH(aliphatic)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 ones are present [H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5centroid distances 2.81 and 2.86 \u00c5, C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5centroid angle 135\u00b0 for both]. As in complexes 1 and 2, several CH(aromatic)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O short contacts (down to 2.39 \u00c5) may indicate weak hydrogen bonding involving both oxo and carboxylate acceptors.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 24, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig3\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Top: View of complex <bold>3</bold>.

In principle, all aliphatic \u03b1,\u03c9-dicarboxylates should be capable of chelation through the separate carboxylate units. Recent work has, however, shown that the solid state coordination mode of such dicarboxylates in anionic uranyl ion complexes can be strongly influenced by the choice of countercation, with what might be considered an approach to chelation resulting in the formation of capsular, binuclear helicate species rather than extended polymers. In the present work, we have thus explored further the influence of the countercation upon the coordination mode in crystalline uranyl ion complexes of the relatively short 1,7-heptanedioate (pimelate) ligand. This is a ligand of a size intermediate between those where chelation is known and those where chelation would be considered entropically highly inhibited. The structure of 1 is unusual in that while the pimelate ligands act as bridging bidentate species to link uranyl centers in a 1D array, this leads only to very limited association into a tetranuclear species. Bidentate binding of nitrate serves to truncate any lateral or linear extensions of this oligomer. The higher ratio of C72-:uranium in 2 is reflected in the presence of infinite zigzag polymer strands of pimelate-bridged uranyl units, nitrate chelation here serving only to block lateral extension of the strands into a 2D sheet. The form, charge and size of the counterions here differ from those of the cations in 1, and the Ag(bipy)2 columns present in 2 appear as an interesting structure-directing species. Thus, the different forms of the uranyl-pimelate aggregates can be regarded as determined by the different forms of the associated cations. The structure of complex 3 provides an example of a 2D assembly where the pimelate ligands serve to bridge both uranyl and manganese centers. Complex 4 has a lattice in which highly convoluted 2D nets are polycatenated to form a 3D lattice, this entanglement being reinforced by NH\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O(carboxylate) bonding. This family of Cn 2- ligands has already given two other examples of polycatenation, and it thus appears that these long thread-like ditopic ligands are particularly suited to the formation of such topologies through formation of large rings. The 3D lattice of complex 5 provides another example of a system where the pimelate carboxylate groups are not involved exclusively in coordination to U(VI). Here, this appears to be a consequence of the specific hydrogen bonding capacities of [Co(en)3]3+ in that the cation forms a rather familiar hydrogen-bond chelate of one uncoordinated carboxylate unit; it is also involved in hydrogen bonding to several uranyl oxo centers, thus playing a substantial role in the lattice assembly. Such structural diversity resulting from changes in the structure-directing species is quite remarkable and appears to be a consequence of the extreme flexibility of the Cn 2- ligands, which allows the two carboxylate groups to take virtually all possible relative orientations, with a separation which is itself highly adjustable.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 36, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>CCDC <ext-link ext-link-type=\"ccdc\" xlink:href=\"1450127\">1450127</ext-link>\u2013<ext-link ext-link-type=\"ccdc\" xlink:href=\"1450131\">1450131</ext-link> contain the supplementary crystallographic data\nfor this paper.
