The asymmetric unit contains one L ligand, three Zn atoms, one DMSO and one H2O, where L and two of Zn atoms have a half occupancy factor. There are two types of Zn2 clusters, both of which are similarly coordinated by DMSO or H2O molecules as axial groups, and four carboxylates from four bridging L ligands in a classical paddle-wheel mode, acting as a planar 4-connected node; the L connects to eight Zn2 clusters. Such connectivity leads to a (4,8)-connected scu network with two types of cages (Figures  and  and ). Each large cage with size of 1.2 nm is surrounded by eight small cages of 0.8 nm, which contributes to the free porosity of 65.5%. \n\nThe appropriate pore size (10-12 \u00c5) and permanent porosity of 1\u22c5DMSO demonstrated by N2 sorption studies (BET surface area: 870 m2/g) make it suitable as a host for encapsulating Alq3 molecules (the size of 8-9 \u00c5). The crystalline 1\u22c5DMSO was introduced into the 5.0 mmol/L Alq3 DMF solution. The colorless crystals gradually turn to yellow after 48 h (). TGA curves () and the Inductive Coupled Plasma (ICP) analysis () results show that 15.8 wt % Alq3 was loaded in 1\u22c5DMSO and each large cage in 1\u22c5DMSO can accommodate about one Alq3 molecule (). The pure Alq3 in DMF show its characteristic fluorescence emission at 525 nm. Upon introduction of 1\u22c5DMSO, the peak shifts to lower wavelength along with the increasing MOF amount (Figure a). Similarly, in the presence of fixed MOF amount, Alq3 with less concentration gives larger blue shift (Figure b). More importantly, as displayed in Figure c, the excited-state lifetime of Alq3 chromophore in the Alq3@MOF composite is efficiently prolonged compare to the pure Alq3. In the solutions with the same Alq3 concentration, the fluorescence lifetime is nearly linear to MOF amount introduced in our examined range (Figure d). As compared to Alq3 in solution, the geometrical distortion of Alq3 at excited state becomes smaller upon absorption into MOF, which results in the blue shift of its emission spectrum, the decrease in nonradiative rate due to vibration and or rotation, and thus the increase in its lifetime.
