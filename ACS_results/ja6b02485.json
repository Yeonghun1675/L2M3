Metalation of the ligand 4,5-bis(pyridine-2-carboxamido)-1,2-catechol (N,OLH4) with MnIII affords the chain compound Mn(N,OL)(DMSO). Structural and spectroscopic analysis of this compound show the presence of MnII centers bridged by N,OL2- ligands, resulting partially from a spontaneous ligand-to-metal electron transfer. Upon soaking in a solution of the reductant Cp2Co, Mn(N,OL)(DMSO) undergoes a ligand-centered solid-state reduction to [Mn(N,OL)]-, as revealed by a suite of techniques, including Raman and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The ligand-based reduction engenders a dramatic modulation of the physical properties of the chain compound. An electrochromic response, evidenced by a color change from dark green to dark purple is accompanied by a nearly 40-fold increase in magnetic coupling strength, from J = -0.38(1) to -15.6(2) cm-1, and a 10,000-fold increase in electronic conductivity, from \u03c3 = 2.33(1) \u00d7 10-12 S/cm (E a = 0.64(1) eV) to 8.61(1) \u00d7 10-8 S/cm (E a = 0.39(1) eV).

Taken together, these results highlight the ability of benzoquinoid ligands to facilitate solid-state ligand-based redox reactions in nonporous coordination solids, giving rise to reversible switching of optical properties, magnetic exchange interactions, and electronic conductivity.\n\nElectronic Conductivity\n\nTo probe and compare the electronic communication in the chain compounds, electronic conductivity measurements were carried out on pressed pellets of 1 and 1  red  using two-probe dc current-voltage techniques (see ). For 1, a conductivity of \u03c3 = 2.33(1) \u00d7 10-12 S/cm was observed at ambient temperature. This value falls in the range of those previously obtained for pressed pellets of MnII metal-organic solids. In contrast, 1  red  exhibits a conductivity that is 4 orders of magnitude higher, with an ambient temperature value \u03c3 = 8.61(1) \u00d7 10-8 S/cm. Note that pressed pellet measurements are influenced by interparticle and interchain contact resistance and represent an average value over all crystallographic orientations. In general, single-crystal conductivity values of low-dimensional materials can be 2-3 orders of magnitude higher. Although a single-crystal measurement of 1 was prohibited due to the small crystallite size and its fragility upon drying, the enhancement upon reduction is likely to be similar in magnitude for single crystals as is observed here for pressed pellets.\n\nSummary and Outlook\n\nThe foregoing results demonstrate that incorporation of a benzoquinoid ligand into a chain compound can give rise to a material exhibiting solid-state redox switching of optical, magnetic, and electronic properties. The dark green solid MnII(N,OL2-) undergoes a reversible one-electron reduction to afford a dark purple solid that contains [MnII(N,OL3-\u22c5)]-. Associated with this ligand-centered reduction is a nearly 40-fold enhancement in magnetic exchange coupling strength, from J = -0.38(1) to -15.6(2) cm-1, and a corresponding 104-fold enhancement of electronic conductivity, from \u03c3 = 2.33(1) \u00d7 10-12 to 8.61(1) \u00d7 10-8 S/cm. In addition, the reduction led to a lowering of the thermal activation energy for electron conduction from E a = 0.64(1) to 0.39(1) eV.
