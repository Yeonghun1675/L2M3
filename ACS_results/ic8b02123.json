Insulin can specifically bind with FAM-P through hydrogen bonds, which had a quenching effect in the fluorescence spectrum. Further it is noted that the zeta potentials of MOF2, P, and insulin were -0.883, -2.09, and 0.421 mV, respectively. After MOF2 was mixed with insulin and FAM-P, the zeta potential was -3.68 mV, implying that MOF2 has electrostatic interactions with insulin and FAM-P in the detection process (). (4) FAM-P can be observed to be wrapped outside of the nanoparticles through TEM (transmission electron microscope) images. These images indicate that FAM-P may combine with 2 through the electrostatic interactions on the surface of 2 (). (5) As shown in , FT-IR spectra displayed characteristic absorption bands around 3400 cm-1 for the DMF acylamino group in MOF2. When Al3+ was added into the reaction system containing MOF2, FAM-P, and insulin, the characteristic absorption bands gradually became red-shifted, absorption intensity became stronger, the result should have been attributed to the N-H and O-H bond lengths becoming longer because the acylamino group's vbrational dipole distance became larger. Therefore, hydrogen-bond interactions can occur in MOF2's surface, FAM-P, and Al3+, which will result in a further quenching effect in the detection process of Al3+. These results somewhat resembled the recent report utilizing MIL-101 nanoparticles as a fluorescence DNA platform, which led to a further quenching effect. El-Safty's previous work also indicated that Al3+ can lead to a further, stronger hydrogen-bond interaction with insulin.

Most peak positions in simulated and experimental patterns are consistent with each other. The intensity dissimilarities may be correlated with the preferred orientation of crystalline powder samples (). The thermogravimetric decay analysis (TGA) curve of MOFs 1-5 also has been recorded (Figure S1). The weight losses of MOFs 1-5 material ranging from 30 to 200 \u00b0C are 14.66 wt %, 23 wt %, 19.01 wt %, 17.03 wt %, and 18.9 wt %, respectively, which should be attributed to the weight loss for coordination water, free DMF, and coordination DMF molecules. These results can be in good agreement with the calculated values (14.86 wt %, 22.6 wt %, 20.7 wt %, 17.8 wt %, 18.1 wt %, respectively).\n\n MOF1 (29.78 mg ground samples) has been investigated by variable temperature (2-300 K) magnetic susceptibility, with an applied DC field of 1000 Oe. For MOF1 at 300 K, the \u03c7M T value was 12.84 cm3 K mol-1 (Figure S2a). The observed \u03c7M T value is slightly lower than the expected theotetrical value (\u03c7M T = 14.17 cm3 K mol-1), which may be ascribed to the combined effect of magnetic anisotropy, intermolecular antiferromagnetic interaction, dipolar interaction, etc. When the temperature decreases, the \u03c7M T value gradually decreases to 10.75 cm3K mol-1 at 20 K, and then decreases to a value of 9.33 cm3 K mol-1 at 2.0 K. These features indicate the presence of weak antiferro-magnetic interactions between neighboring Dy(III) ions. According to the Curie-Weiss law \u03c7M = C/(T - \u03b8), the linear fit gave values of C = 12.85 cm3 K mol-1 and \u03b8 = -3.98 K, where C and \u03b8 are the Curie constant and the Weiss temperature, respectively.\n\nVariable temperature (2-300 K) magnetic susceptibility experiments were also determined on the polycrystalline samples of MOF2. The \u03c7M T values at room temperature are slightly larger than the theoretical \u03c7M T values (7.88 cm3 K mol-1). When the temperature decreases, the \u03c7M T value gradually decreases to 7.79 cm3 mol-1 K at 20 K and then sharply decreases to 7.11 cm3 mol-1 K at 2.0 K (Figure S2b). This phenomenon also can be correlated with the large unquenched orbital angular momentum of Gd3+. According to the Curie-Weiss law, \u03c7M = C/(T - \u03b8), gave values of C = 8.38 cm3 K mol-1 and \u03b8 = -1.95 K, where C and \u03b8 are the Curie constant and the Weiss temperature, respectively. The \u03b8 value also represents the presence of weak antiferro-magnetic interaction between GdIII ions. There were weak magnetic interactions in multinuclear MOFs 1 and 2, which should be attributed to the shielding effects of the outer 5d and 6s shells to the inner contracted 4f orbitals.\n\nThe as-synthesized PXRD patterns of RhB@MOF1 and as-simulated theoretical PXRD ones were in good agreement, indicating that the structure of the framework remains unchanged when RhB is introduced into the coordination framework 1. Thermogravimetric decay analysis (TGA) curves of MOF1 and RhB@MOF1 are also recorded (c). The weight loss of material MOF1 ranging from 30 to 200 \u00b0C is 14.66 wt %, which should be attributed to coordinated water and DMF's evaporation. The result can be good agreement with the calculated value (14.86 wt %). However, for the thermal cure of RhB@MOF1, the weight loss of RhB@MOF1 in the range of 30 to 200 \u00b0C is slightly lower than that of MOF1; the result may be ascribed to DMF and water molecules being partially replaced by RhB in RhB@MOF1.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF1", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "30 to 200", "unit": "\u00b0C",
