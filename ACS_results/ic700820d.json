The purity of 1 was independently confirmed by elemental analysis and similarities between simulated and experimental powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD; Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curve of 1 (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information) reveals that the gradual weight loss of 5.4% from 30 to 125 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of five lattice and four coordinated water molecules (calcd 6.3%).
