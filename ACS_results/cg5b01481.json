The TGA curve of 1 exhibits an initial weight loss of 16.1% from 35 to 150 \u00b0C, corresponding to the release of trapped molecules in pores (calcd 16.6%), followed by a relatively steady plateau until 450 \u00b0C, beyond which the framework of 1 starts to decompose. The crystalline phase purity of 1 was confirmed by comparing experimental PXRD patterns with the simulated one from single-crystal data. As shown in a, although some diffraction peaks become weaker along with the increase of acidity, the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of 1 remain almost intact upon immersion in aqueous HCl solutions with different pH values from 0.2 to 7 for 5 days, suggesting that no phase transition or framework collapse occurs upon treatments in acidic aqueous solution. However, complex 1 is unstable in basic solutions. To further evaluate the chemical stability of 1 in strong acid solution, as-synthesized samples were soaked in aqueous HCl solution at pH = 1 for different times. Strikingly, the results, as shown in b, indicated that 1 has good acid resistance even after 30 days. Due to the chelating effect of trepyridyl moieties in L2- ligands and the absence of solvent coordination sites on Zn(II), the coordination bonds, as well as the whole framework of 1, become highly resistant to the attack of water and even acid. However, in basic aqueous solutions the strong coordinating ability of hydroxyl ions gradually results in the collapse of framework.\n\nGas Adsorption Studies of Desolvated 1a and Microporous Carbon C1000 \n\nThe as-synthesized crystals were heated at 120 \u00b0C for 24 h under high vacuum to obtain the desolvated sample 1a, and the rigid framework of 1a has been verified by the PXRD pattern (Figure S6). The porosity of desolvated 1a and microporous carbon C1000 has been examined by nitrogen and CO2 absorption experiments. As shown in a, the N2 adsorption of 1a at 77 K shows a reversible type-I adsorption behavior characteristic of microporous material. Based on the N2 isotherm, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Langmuir surface area of 1a are calculated to be 523.6 and 774.7 m2g-1, respectively. Analysis with density functional theory (DFT) from the N2 sorption curve indicates that the size of micropores mainly concentrated around 0.8 nm, which is in accordance with the crystallographic data when van der Waals contact is considered.\n\nThe CO2 sorption isotherms of 1a, measured at 273 and 298 K under ambient pressure, also display type-I adsorption behavior without any hysteresis (b). At 1 bar, 1a shows a relatively high CO2 uptakes of 81.8 cm3g-1 (16.1 wt %) at 273 K and 59.2 cm3g-1 (11.6 wt %) at 298 K. These values can be well compared to those reported for many MOFs structures under similar conditions. It is well documented that open metal sites in MOFs are very beneficial for enhancing the adsorption capacities of gases. It should be noted that 1a does not have any open metal sites. The noncoordination furan rings, which are located on the wall of pores of 1a and can be as functional group with electron rich property, may play a certain degree of contribution to its relatively high CO2 uptake. \n\nThe typical type-I isotherm of N2 sorption at 77 K for C1000 also exhibits a steep increase in the very low P/P 0 range, suggesting microporsity of the obtained carbon material (a). The BET and Langmuir surface areas of C1000 are calculated to be 362.4 and 505.1 m2 g-1, respectively, slightly lower than those of desolvated 1a. Microporous carbon C1000 still exhibits a certain degree of CO2 adsorption capacity, with uptake of 64.8 cm3 g-1 (12.7 wt %) at 273 K and 1 bar. However, a slight hysteresis is observed, in contrast to the completely reversible adsorption for 1a (b). The hysteresis sorption behavior of C1000 may be attributed to the residual N atoms in the carbon material, which derive from N-doped ligand L2- and have a relatively strong interaction with absorbed CO2. Recently, Bai et al. used Co-MOFs as precursors to prepare multiwalled carbon nanotubes with a high BET surface area (400-500 m2 g-1) by direct pyrolysis of MOFs particles, in which the Co-MOFs can provide both carbon sources and metal catalysts for the formation of carbon nanotubes during the carbonization. Compared with the metal doped carbon nanotubes, the metal-free C1000 has a lower BET surface area, while its CO2 adsorption capacity (2.9 mol kg-1) doubled that of CN-1 (1.4 mol kg-1) at 1 bar.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "ZnL\u22c55H2O", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "450", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "decomposition point", "condition": "under N2 stream"}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "81.8", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "temperature": "273 K", "pressure": "1 bar", "condition": "for desolvated 1a"}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "59.2", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "1 bar", "condition": "for desolvated 1a"}], "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "N2", "value": "523.6", "unit": "m2g-1", "condition": "for desolvated 1a at 77 K"}, {"type": "Langmuir", "probe": "N2", "value": "774.7", "unit": "m2g-1", "condition": "for desolvated 1a at 77 K"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "porous carbon C1000", "symbol": "C1000", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "64.8", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "temperature": "273 K", "pressure": "1 bar", "condition": ""}], "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "N2", "value": "362.4", "unit": "m2 g-1", "condition": "at 77 K"}, {"type": "Langmuir", "probe": "N2", "value": "505.1", "unit": "m2 g-1", "condition": "at 77 K"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["gas_adsorption", "decomposition_temperature", "surface_area"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['gas_adsorption', 'decomposition_temperature', 'surface_area']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"ZnL\u22c55H2O\",\n            \"symbol\": \"1\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"decomposition temperature\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"450\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"decomposition point\",\n                \"condition\": \"under N2 stream\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"CO2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"81.8\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"273 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"1 bar\",\n                \"condition\": \"for desolvated 1a\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"CO2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"59.2\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"298 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"1 bar\",\n                \"condition\": \"for desolvated 1a\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"surface area\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"BET\",\n                \"probe\": \"N2\",\n                \"value\": \"523.6\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2g-1\",\n                \"condition\": \"for desolvated 1a at 77 K\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"type\": \"Langmuir\",\n                \"probe\": \"N2\",\n                \"value\": \"774.7\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2g-1\",\n                \"condition\": \"for desolvated 1a at 77 K\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"porous carbon C1000\",\n            \"symbol\": \"C1000\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"CO2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"64.8\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"273 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"1 bar\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"surface area\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"BET\",\n                \"probe\": \"N2\",\n                \"value\": \"362.4\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2 g-1\",\n                \"condition\": \"at 77 K\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"type\": \"Langmuir\",\n                \"probe\": \"N2\",\n                \"value\": \"505.1\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2 g-1\",\n                \"condition\": \"at 77 K\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 7, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Structure\nof L<sup>2\u2013</sup>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cg-2015-01481t_0005.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Structure of L2-    ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 13, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Crystal structure\nof <bold>1</bold>.
