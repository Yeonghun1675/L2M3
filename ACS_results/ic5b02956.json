The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares against F 2 of all data using SHELX-97. All the atoms were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters except for hydrogen atoms. Elemental analyses for C, H, and N were carried out using a PerkinElmer series II CHNS/O Analyzer 2400 (). TG-DTA measurements were performed on powder samples using a SII EXSTAR TGA operating under dry nitrogen with heating from 293 to 773 K at a rate of 5 K/min. Infrared spectra were recorded on a JASCO FT/IR-660 PLUS by transmission through KBr pellets in the range 400-4000 cm-1. X-band (~9 GHz) EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker ELEXSYS E500 in the field range from 2400 to 4400 Oe (). The measurements of magnetization were carried out using Quantum Design MPMS-5S and MPMS-2 SQUID magnetometers. The magnetic field can be varied from -5 to 5 T and the temperature in the range 2-300 K. The alternate current (ac) susceptibility measurements were carried out in the frequency range of 1-1500 Hz with an oscillating magnetic field of 3 Oe by use of a Quantum Design MPMS-7XL SQUID magnetometer. The magnetization measurements for D 1-SG (10.42 mg) and L 1-FI (2.41 mg) in 5 Oe under a hydrostatic pressure up to 8.6 kbar were carried out using a piston-cylinder-type Cu-Be cell. The superconducting critical temperature of a piece of Sn (99.9999%) was used to monitor the pressure in the low temperature regime.

The negative Weiss constant indicates a considerable antiferromagnetic interaction. The Curie constant is slightly less than the theoretical value of 14.125 cm3 K mol-1 assuming g = 2 for MnII and MnIII.\n\nThe isothermal magnetization at 2 K increases with a continuous curvature to 11.2 \u03bcB at 50 kOe, which is close to that for antiparallel alignment of the moments of three MnII and one MnIII (15-2 = 13 \u03bcB).

The susceptibility obeys the Curie-Weiss law in the range from 150 to 300 K with a Weiss temperature \u03b8 = -17.1(9) K. The negative Weiss constant indicates antiferromagnetic interaction. The Curie constant of 14.81 cm3 K mol-1 is very close to the theoretical value of 15.00 cm3 K mol-1 (g = 2). The ZFC-FC magnetizations in 5 Oe confirm the long-range ordering at T C = 35 K.

No magnetic hysteresis can be observed because the two high spin MnII and CrIII ions are magnetically isotropic. Unlike 1, no other magnetic phase has been found for 2.
