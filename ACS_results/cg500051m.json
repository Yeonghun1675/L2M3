Ag(NO3) (3.26 g, 19.18 mmol) dissolved in water (40 mL) was added to the reaction solution, resulting in the formation of a light orange precipitate, which was filtered from the reaction solution and washed with ethanol and diethyl ether (1.70 g). The solvent was removed from the filtrate under reduced pressure until the volume was approximately 20 mL, and the solution was stored at 4 \u00b0C, yielding the first crop of crystals. The aforementioned light orange precipitate was suspended in water (300 mL) and heated under reflux for six hours. The remaining suspension was then filtered off and discarded, while the filtrate was stored at 4 \u00b0C to yield a second crop of crystals. Both crops of crystals were collected, combined together, washed with ethanol and diethyl ether, and dried under vacuum for one hour.

Found: C, 45.74; H, 6.68; N, 30.58.\n\nAg(ccnom) (5) (ccnom = carbamoylcyanonitromethanide): NaCl (1.06 g, 18.14 mmol) was added to Ag(ccnm) (4.35 g, 19.78 mmol) suspended in methanol (50 mL). Water (50 mL) was added to the reaction solution, which was then covered from light and vigorously stirred for one hour, resulting in the formation of a white precipitate of AgCl. The AgCl and remaining unreacted Ag(ccnm) were filtered from the reaction solution, leaving a yellow filtrate. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure, leaving Na(ccnm) as a light yellow solid (2.25 g, 92%). This product was dissolved in acetic acid (40 mL) and water (20 mL). (NH4)2[Ce(NO3)6] (18.23 g, 33.25 mmol) dissolved in water (100 mL) was slowly added to the reaction solution, causing the light yellow solution to change to a deep red color. The solution was stirred for one hour, during which time the color of the solution changed to light orange. Ag(NO3) (3.26 g, 19.18 mmol) dissolved in water (40 mL) was added to the reaction solution, resulting in the formation of a light orange precipitate, which was filtered from the reaction solution and washed with ethanol and diethyl ether (1.70 g). The solvent was removed from the filtrate under reduced pressure until the volume was approximately 20 mL, and the solution was stored at 4 \u00b0C, yielding the first crop of crystals. The aforementioned light orange precipitate was suspended in water (300 mL) and heated under reflux for six hours. The remaining suspension was then filtered off and discarded, while the filtrate was stored at 4 \u00b0C to yield a second crop of crystals. Both crops of crystals were collected, combined together, washed with ethanol and diethyl ether, and dried under vacuum for one hour.

Found: C, 15.49; H, 1.00; N, 17.80.\n\n(Me4N)(ccnom) (6): Ag (ccnom) (5) (285 mg, 1.207 mmol) was suspended in methanol (7 mL) and sonicated for several minutes to break the crystals down to a fine powder. (Me4N)Cl (132 mg, 1.204 mmol) was added to the reaction solution, resulting in the formation of a light white precipitate of AgCl. The reaction solution was covered from light and stirred for one hour, resulting in further precipitation of AgCl from the solution. The AgCl was filtered from the reaction solution. Under reduced pressure, the volume of the filtrate was reduced to 3 mL. Diethyl ether (1 mL) was added to the solution, which was then stored at -18 \u00b0C, with a large crystal forming from the solution within 24 h. This very lightly orange-colored crystal of (Me4N)(ccnom) was filtered from the reaction solution, washed with cold ethanol and diethyl ether, and dried under vacuum for one hour (75 mg, 31%). As the material is hygroscopic, a sample was submitted for elemental analysis in a sealed ampule under an atmosphere of nitrogen.
