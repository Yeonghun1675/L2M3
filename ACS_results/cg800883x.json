The TG curve for compound <bold>3</bold> clearly shows two steps in the weight loss. The first step is at ca. 60 \u00b0C with a weight loss of 6.10%, which correspond to two molecules of water (theoretical 5.9%). A final plateau is reached at ca. 85 \u00b0C with a weight loss of 6.04%. The total weight loss of 12.14% corresponds to the loss of four water molecules (theoretical value is 11.75%).
