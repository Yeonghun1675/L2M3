The well-fitted small \u03b1 value of less than 0.34 at the slow relaxation region indicates a distribution of relaxation times. The relaxation II can be attributed to the SCM dynamics of the WVMnIII skeleton because the anisotropic 1D magnetic trait is defined by the combination of not only the effect of single-ion anisotropy from the Jahn-Teller ion but also an intrachain magnetic coupling contribution. The peak shift in the ac signals was taken into account with a quantity of \u03c6 = \u0394T p/[T p\u0394(log f)]. The \u03c6 value amounts to 0.28, which is in the range of superparamagnets. Using the Arrhenius equation of \u03c4 = \u03c40 exp(\u0394\u03c4/kT), where \u03c4 is equal to 1/2\u03c0f and \u0394\u03c4 is the activation energy, the best parameters of \u03c40 = 9.42 \u00d7 10-9 s and \u0394\u03c4/k = 19.3 cm-1 are acquired (Figure S12 in the ). As expected from the Glauber model in a 1D anisotropic system, a linear fit in the ln(\u03c7m'T) versus 1/T plot affords \u0394\u03be = 1.1 cm-1 on the basis of the magnetic expression of \u03c7T \u221d exp(\u0394\u03be/kT) where \u0394\u03be is the energy barrier to create a domain wall in the chain (Figure S13 in the ).
