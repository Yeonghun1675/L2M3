Especially, the O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bond, being a three-atom bridge in this compound, could intermediate coupling effectively. However, the origin of the spin-canted antiferromagnetic LRO is not clear given the centrosymmetric structure and, especially, the ox bridge lying at the inversion center. The spin canting could have arisen by the acentrosymmetric O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bonds, and/or the local acentrosymmetry resulted from the 1,3-propanediol ligand if its flipped CH2 group was frozen at low temperature, thus satisfying the requirement for the Dzyaloshinski-Moriya interaction. In addition, magnetic anisotropy of the Co2+ ion could also give further contribution. The very low spontaneous magnetization of LRO seemingly supported this argument and also suggested possible a hidden character of the spin canting.
