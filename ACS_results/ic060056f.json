According to the correlation between the oxidation states of TTF derivatives and the bond lengths of central C\ue5fbC bonds, it can be inferred that the ligands in 2 are neutral, suggesting that 2 is insulating. Interestingly, the resulting peculiar packing mode is reminiscent of what is usually observed for conducting radical salts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a transition-metal complex with TTF derivative ligands exhibiting an extended 1D chain structure.
