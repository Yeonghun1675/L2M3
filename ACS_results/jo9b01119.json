UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrophotometer. Diffuse reflectance spectrum was measured using a JASCO V-670 spectrometer with an integrating sphere unit (JASCO ISN-723). DFT calculations were performed using Gaussian 09 software. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded using Bruker microflex LT MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer.
