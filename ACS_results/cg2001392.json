This coordination polymer features wide coordination space at the Cu(II) axial sites derived from the planar and chelating 2,2'-bpy ligand. Thereby, its desolvated form [Cu(PF6)(bpetha)(2,2'-bpy)]\u22c5PF6} n  (2) exhibits smooth adsorption for EtOH, MeOH, and H2O vapors compared with the prototype [Cu(PF6)2(bpetha)2] n  (1) with restricted Cu(II) axial space. The temperature-dependent XRD and IR results suggest that the coordination mode of one PF6 - anion in 2 changes in association with adsorption/desorption of guest molecules, reminiscent of the behavior of 1. The H2O adsorption behavior illustrates that one of the up and down Cu(II) axial sites catches a H2O molecule and extra H2O molecules form hydrogen bonds with the coordinated H2O via their own oxygen atoms.
