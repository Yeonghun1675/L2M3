Materials with open-framework and microporous structures are promising candidates for hybrid composite materials in electro-optical and sensing applications. The strategy of attaching functional groups such as carboxylate ligands to the phosphonic acid has proven to be an effective route for the isolation of a variety of open-framework and microporous structures.
