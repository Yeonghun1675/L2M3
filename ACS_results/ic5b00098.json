The most interesting feature is that the PL intensities of the different suspensions are strongly dependent on the various anions. The analytes, such as halide ions, ClO4 -, NO3 -, OAc-, and SO4 2-, have negligible effects on the PL intensity, whereas other anions, in particular Cr2O7 2-, significantly decrease the luminescence intensity (b). The unusually selective quenching of Cr2O7 2- prompted us to apply 1 in the detection of trace Cr6+ in water. To further evaluate the sensitivity of 1 to Cr6+, we carried out measurements in the presence of varying concentrations of Cr2O7 2-. Our results indicate that the fluorescence intensity of 1 is remarkably suppressed with increasing amounts of Cr2O7 2- (b). The quenching of 1 in the presence of Cr2O7 2- is most likely due to a decrease in energy transfer between the \u03c0 and \u03c0* orbitals of 2-NH2bdc2- because of electron-transfer transitions of Cr2O7 2-. In addition, plotting the quenching efficiency I 0/I versus the Cr6+ concentration gives a straight line titration curve, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9957 at low concentrations of 0-0.25 \u03bcM. The slope of K SV was calculated to be 6555070 M-1, which is about 565 times larger than the value for functional fluorescent aramids (11600 M-1) used for Cr6+ sensing in dimethyl sulfoxide/water and 95 times larger than the value of the fluorescent carbon dot nanosensor (69000 M-1) used for recognition of Cr6+ in aqueous solutions.
