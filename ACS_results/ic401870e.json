Inspired by the recent reports that the Zn2(CO2)4 SBUs in a MOF can be substituted by the Cu2(CO2)4 ones via postsynthetic metal-ion exchange, we prepared the CuII-substituted UTSA-28-Zn and UTSA-28-Mn, namely, UTSA-28-Zn(Cu) and UTSA-28-Mn(Cu), respectively.

The total methane uptake can increase to 197.3 cm3 (STP) g-1 at 300 K and 46 bar (Figures a and S10 in the ). The total CO2 adsorption capacity is 81.1 wt % [413 cm3 (STP) g-1] at 300 K and 28 bar (Figures a and S11 in the ), which is moderately high.\n\nWe have recently paid much attention to porous MOFs for the storage and separation of small hydrocarbons because of their very important industrial applications. Accordingly, the pure-component small hydrocarbon sorption isotherms for UTSA-28a-Cu were measured. As shown in Figures b and S12 in the , all isotherms show reversible sorption behavior. Remarkably, UTSA-28a-Cu systematically takes up much more C2 hydrocarbons than C1 methane. At 296 K, UTSA-28a-Cu takes up a moderate amount of C2H2 (87.6 mg g-1), C2H4 (75.5 mg g-1), and C2H6 (89.1 mg g-1), but basically a negligible amount of CH4 (7.7 mg g-1) at 1 atm, indicating UTSA-28a-Cu as a promising material for the adsorptive separation of C2 hydrocarbons from methane at room temperature. The preferable adsorption of C2 hydrocarbons relative to C1 methane is attributed to the stronger interaction of the framework with C2 hydrocarbons because no molecule sieving effect exists in UTSA-28a-Cu because the size of the open channel is much bigger than that of gas molecules. The Henry's law selectivities for C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 over CH4 at 296 K are 9.2, 8.6, and 13.2, respectively, which are moderate compared with those of the best-performing materials FeMOF-74, CoMOF-74, and MgMOF-74. Nevertheless, the low isosteric heat of adsorption at zero coverage (16.9-25.6 kJ mol-1; Table S2 in the ), calculated by fitting experimental isotherm data at 273 and 296 K to the virial equation, indicates the low regeneration cost. The large pore volume of UTSA-28a-Cu will also secure its large separation capacities for the small hydrocarbons. In practical applications, both separation selectivity and capacity should be balanced to optimize the separation efficiency.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "UTSA-28-Cu", "symbol": "", "chemical
