The stabilization of Cu(I) bonded to olefin is due to the high concentration of bonding, thereby allowing the title phase to be air-stable. The classical (Cu-O) bonding constrains the fumarate anions to be rigidly incorporated into the lattice and thus prevents any oxygen or water molecules to insert into the copper-olefin bond. There exist many structures in which Cu(I) is bonded to ethylene, but those are typically air-sensitive organometallic compounds that are molecular in nature where the olefin ligand is linked to the Cu(I) center only by the \u03b72-bond.The molecular organometallic Cu(I)-ethylene compounds tend to be air-sensitive due to the loss of the ethylene substituent. In addition, the title phase curiously excludes water from the framework, and yet it was hydrothermally synthesized. In this case, the absence of waters of hydration appear to be due to the absence of voids and the saturation of the copper coordination by the fumarate ions. By far, most compounds obtained using this method contain water, and thus Cu2(O2CCH\ue5fbCHCO2) is a further example of using hydrothermal synthesis as an exploratory route to new phases.
