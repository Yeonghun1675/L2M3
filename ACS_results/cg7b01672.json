The successive loss corresponds to the burning of the bis-pyridine ligand (exp. 39.2%; calcd. 41.1%). The TD-XRD analysis between room temperature and 100 \u00b0C (see c) confirms the results of the TGA; i.e., the anhydrous [Ni(bpy-ene)(pc2p)] n  phase, 2b, is a crystalline phase. In addition, it is relatively stable at room temperature, as additional peaks of the pristine compound are only seen after 17 h in ambient conditions. Such behavior allowed us to readily stabilize 2b to collect high-resolution powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data at 110 \u00b0C.

This result suggests that the full dehydration does not modify drastically the crystal structure of 2, and the schematic arrangement of entities could obviously be preserved as illustrated in . More on the possible structure of 2b will be discussed below. The TGA of 3 is reported in b. There is no significant weight loss up to 90 \u00b0C. In the range 90-120 \u00b0C, the corresponding weight losses match with the removal of three water molecules (exp. 8.9%, calcd 8.7%).

The additional weight loss corresponds to the removal of the bipyridine at higher temperature. Finally, the [Ni(pc2p)] n  phase is stable up to 450 \u00b0C. A TD-XRD experiment, performed at a much lower heating rate up to 160 \u00b0C, allowed us to observe the corresponding dehydration stages at lower temperatures, as shown in d. The [Ni(H2O)(bpy-ene)(pc2p)] n  phase, 3a, is obtained as a crystalline phase between 60 and 100 \u00b0C. It transforms into the crystalline anhydrous [Ni(bpy-ene)(pc2p)] n  phase, 3b, which is observed until the end of the experiment at 160 \u00b0C. In this case ab initio indexing was not possible due to loss of crystallinity and broadening of many peaks. An additional in situ XRD experiment was performed while cooling the sample in different atmospheres, to evaluate whether 3b is stable in ambient conditions. This phase seems only sensitive to water, as it rehydrates into its monohydrate parent 3a in air, while it is stable under pure N2 (see Figure S3).
