The above evidence proved that HPU-13@Fe  3  O  4  has the potential functional ability to decontaminate Cr(VI) polluted water systems.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nStructural Description\n\n HPU-13 crystallizes in the rrigonal system with space group P3\u0305c1, which is clearly indicated by single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis. It consists of hexagonal and triangular cationic micropores with a three-dimensional crystallographically imposed molecular symmetry. As depicted in a, the ligand has a \u03bc4-bridging mode with each of the ligand's six nitrogen atoms linking with four Cu(I) ions by all of the nitrogen atoms. The two crystallographically independent Cu(I) atoms possess distorted-tetrahedral geometries. Three independent ligands bridge six Cu(I) atoms to form a closed triangular unit, which link with another triangular unit in a face-to-face direction, giving rise to a closed cage (b,c). Four adjacent triangular cages are connected together to form a hexagonal mesropore. An investigation of the crystal packing indicates that HPU-13 shows a porous structural character with two different channels: hexagonal and triangular micropores along the c axis due to the existence of the skeletons of ligands. The hexagonal cage has large dimensions of 20.947 \u00d7 20.720 \u00c52 (d,e). The triangular micropores have a pore size of 4 \u00c5 from the nitrogen atoms of HL groups. Finally, the whole structure might appear as an expansion of the MIL-68 structure (f). The effective free voids of HPU-13 are occupied as 36.0% of the crystal volume, which was calculated by PLATON analysis (1728.9 out of 4803.0 \u00c53, the unit cell volume).\n\nThermal and Water Stability Tests\n\nThe eco-friendliness and thermal and water stability of materials are requisites for applications. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) were used to inspect the thermal stability of HPU-13 (Figure S1a,b). The TGA analysis shows that HPU-13 loses weight from 70 to 102 \u00b0C, ascribed to the free CH3CH2OH and H2O molecules (calcd 19.4% H2O and 9.9% CH3CH2OH), and the framework starts to collapse at 378 \u00b0C. The PXRD of synthesized HPU-13, which is similar to the simulated result from the single-crystal data, reveals the purity of HPU-13. In addition, the PXRD patterns of a fresh sample of HPU-13 in H2O for 72 h also matches well with that of the original synthesized product, proving that this material has a good resistance to H2O. Therefore, such H2O stability makes HPU-13 more feasible in practical applications.\n\nTo further prove our presumption, the adsorption of anionic dyes from the mixed dyes was studied. From Figure S3, the absorption of MO (methyl orange) disappeared while the absorption of other cationic dyes was almost unchanged, which suggested that HPU-13@Fe  3  O  4  could selectively adsorb anionic molecules MO. The selective adsorption of MO may result from the electrostatic interaction of the anionic MO molecules and cationic framework of HPU-13@Fe  3  O  4 . In addition, we also studied the separation of different anionic dyes (MO, NGB (Naphthol Green B), and AYR (Alizarin yellow R)) from AYR&MO, AYR&NGB, and NGB&MO (Figure S4). The results indicated that the adsorption of AYR by HPU-13@Fe  3  O  4  is better than that of other anionic dyes, which may be ascribed to the smaller size of AYR molecules. PXRD confirmed that the crystalline integrity of HPU-13@Fe  3  O  4  was retained during dye adsorption (Figure S5). The overall adsorption capacities of HPU-13@Fe  3  O  4  for MO and AYR reaches up to 76.336 and 163.399 mg g-1, respectively ( and Figures S6 and S7 and Tables S5-S7). In addition, the adsorption-release cycle experiments showed that this material still has the same high removal efficiency toward AYR (Figure S8). Furthermore, PXRD patterns of HPU-13@Fe  3  O  4  after four cycles are consistent with those of HPU-13@Fe  3  O  4 , which indicates the framework integrity of HPU-13@Fe  3  O  4  is well retained (Figure S6).
