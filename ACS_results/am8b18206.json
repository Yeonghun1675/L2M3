Each In(III) ion in the structure is coordinated by four oxygen atoms from four ADBEB linkers and two hydroxyl groups, affording the [InO4(OH)2] octahedron (a and S1a). The In-O bond lengths are in the range of 2.078(4)-2.165(3) \u00c5, which are among typical values reported for In-MOFs. The In(III) ions are connected by bringing hydroxyl groups through In-OH-In bonds to from inorganic chains along the a-axis (a and S1b). Then, the inorganic chains are further connected by ADBEB linkers to construct a three-dimensional framework (b). It is notable that the ADBEB linker deviates from a planar configuration, where the anthracene moiety is approximately perpendicular to in-plane parts of ethynyl-substituted benzoic acids. Long-range stacking interaction between anthracene moieties is observed along the a-axis and the face-to-face distance is measured to be ca. 3.5 \u00c5 (a and S1c). As shown in b, 1 possesses twofold interpenetrating networks because of the large size of ADBEB molecules. The interpenetration makes ADBEB linkers in different networks intersect with each other, enclosing hydrophobic channels. The potential solvent-accessible spaces occupied by disordered guest DMF molecules is estimated to be 46.8% using the PLATON program. After guest exchange in acetone for 2 days, the N2 isotherm of activated 1 shows a BET surface area of 411.2 m2 g-1 with a void space of 0.13 cm3 g-1 (Figure S2).\n\nThe SEM image displays that 1 is a strip-shaped crystal (Figure S3). The purity of the bulk sample was studied by PXRD, where the experimental PXRD pattern fits well with the one simulated from the crystal structure, indicating the as-prepared sample is in good purity (a). PXRD patterns suggest also that 1 is stable in organic solvents of DMSO, chloroform, and methanol, as well as in aqueous solution with a pH range of 3-8 (Figure S4). The TG measurement of 1 shows a two-step weight loss (Figure S5). The first weight loss of 10.9 wt % before 250 \u00b0C corresponds to the removal of guest DMF molecules (ca. 10.9 wt %). The following sharp weight loss above 400 \u00b0C (ca. 58.1 wt %) is attributed to the decomposition of the organic linker. The bulk sample of 1 was also characterized by FTIR spectroscopy (Figure S6). The characteristic peak of ethynyl groups (-C\ue5fcC-) in the ADBEB linker is observed at ca. 2189 cm-1 on the spectrum. The intense absorptions at 1417, 1582, and 1599 cm-1 belong to vibrations of carboxylate groups in the linker. The peak at 1656 cm-1 (v C\ue5fbO) and peaks near 3000 cm-1 (v C-H) should be due to the presence of the guest DMF molecule in the structure. The broad peak at ca. 3300 cm-1 should result from the hydroxyl group (-OH) in the structure.
