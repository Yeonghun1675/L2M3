In\nfact, attempts to acquire a higher-resolution pattern were unsuccessful\nbecause of degradation of the solid beginning at timeframes as short\nas 10 min. However, transformation of the cuboctahedral MOP to a Kagome\ncoordination network was previously reported. Moulton et al. reported that dimetal tetracarboxylates\n[M<sub>2</sub>L<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>CR)<sub>4</sub>] (where M\n= transition metal and L = ligand), the copper dimer in our case,\nself-assemble using isophthalate-based linkers to form square and\ntriangular nanoscale secondary building units (nSBUs). The Cu<sub>24</sub>MOPs form enclosed cuboctahedra using these square and triangular\nnSBUs. Upon water exposure, the cuboctahedron degrades into triangular\nnSBUs, which then reconstruct into a 2D Kagome lattice, as documented by Mallick et al. for the 5-propargyloxy-decorated Cu<sub>24</sub>MOP. This\nhydrolytic conversion of MOP to a 2D Kagome MOF has also been observed\nfor at least three other Cu<sub>24</sub>MOPs as well. We propose that a bulk hydroxylated\nMOP, <bold>1</bold> (synthesized as per Abourahma et al. and crystallized as per Niu et al.;\n), converts into a hydroxylated Kagome analogue, <bold>2</bold>. Compound <bold>2</bold> is obtained as a crystalline powder having\na PXRD pattern very similar to that of the 2D Kagome MOF obtained\nby Mallick et al. () or by Mohideen et al. These compounds have alkyl ether groups at the 5 position\nof the isophthalate, and this serves to kinetically enhance the water\nresistance of the MOPs. Rietveld refinement to obtain a structure\nof <bold>2</bold> could not be performed because the sample was degrading\nand further converting during PXRD analysis. However, comparing the\nexperimental <italic>d</italic> spacings of <bold>2</bold> to those\nof the simulated Kagome lattice shows some notable\ncorrelations. The three low-angle peaks in PXRD of the known Kagome\nstructure correspond to the following Bragg planes, all of which are\nassociated with the Kagome plane: [100], 16.05 \u00c5; [110], 9.27\n\u00c5; [200], 8.02 \u00c5. The three lowest-angle peaks in <bold>2</bold>, fit to a cell with <italic>a</italic> = <italic>b</italic> = 19.6 \u00c5, correspond to <italic>d</italic> spacings of 16.97,\n9.80, and 8.49 \u00c5, respectively, showing a close relationship\nwith the experimental data (see <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b00997/suppl_file/ic9b00997_si_001.pdf\">Table S1</ext-link>). The reported analogous crystal structure has trigonal symmetry, and with uncertainty in the PXRD peaks above\n2\u03b8 = 15\u00b0 due to sample degradation, the fitting was focused\non the low-angle peaks and <italic>ab</italic> Kagome plane. This\nstrengthens the proposition that <bold>2</bold> consists of a Kagome\nnet with R = OH on the isophthalate groups. The deviation likely comes\nfrom the free hydroxyl group, which, while smaller than the propargyl\ngroups, is more likely to interact (via ligation and/or hydrogen bonding)\nwith adjacent layers and cause buckling/strain on the Kagome net.\nThe hydrolytic conversion of <bold>1</bold> to <bold>2</bold> is faster\ncompared to that of other Cu<sub>24</sub>MOPs because of the small\nhydrophilic moieties on the MOP <bold>1</bold>. TGA also confirms\nthe change in the structure, where the MOP <bold>1</bold> starts to\ndegrade after 245 \u00b0C while the corresponding 2D MOF <bold>2</bold> degrades above 275 \u00b0C.

In fact, attempts to acquire a higher-resolution pattern were unsuccessful because of degradation of the solid beginning at timeframes as short as 10 min. However, transformation of the cuboctahedral MOP to a Kagome coordination network was previously reported. Moulton et al. reported that dimetal tetracarboxylates [M2L2(O2CR)4] (where M = transition metal and L = ligand), the copper dimer in our case, self-assemble using isophthalate-based linkers to form square and triangular nanoscale secondary building units (nSBUs). The Cu24MOPs form enclosed cuboctahedra using these square and triangular nSBUs. Upon water exposure, the cuboctahedron degrades into triangular nSBUs, which then reconstruct into a 2D Kagome lattice, as documented by Mallick et al. for the 5-propargyloxy-decorated Cu24MOP. This hydrolytic conversion of MOP to a 2D Kagome MOF has also been observed for at least three other Cu24MOPs as well. We propose that a bulk hydroxylated MOP, 1 (synthesized as per Abourahma et al. and crystallized as per Niu et al.; ), converts into a hydroxylated Kagome analogue, 2. Compound 2 is obtained as a crystalline powder having a PXRD pattern very similar to that of the 2D Kagome MOF obtained by Mallick et al. () or by Mohideen et al. These compounds have alkyl ether groups at the 5 position of the isophthalate, and this serves to kinetically enhance the water resistance of the MOPs. Rietveld refinement to obtain a structure of 2 could not be performed because the sample was degrading and further converting during PXRD analysis. However, comparing the experimental d spacings of 2 to those of the simulated Kagome lattice shows some notable correlations. The three low-angle peaks in PXRD of the known Kagome structure correspond to the following Bragg planes, all of which are associated with the Kagome plane: [100], 16.05 \u00c5; [110], 9.27 \u00c5; [200], 8.02 \u00c5. The three lowest-angle peaks in 2, fit to a cell with a = b = 19.6 \u00c5, correspond to d spacings of 16.97, 9.80, and 8.49 \u00c5, respectively, showing a close relationship with the experimental data (see Table S1). The reported analogous crystal structure has trigonal symmetry, and with uncertainty in the PXRD peaks above 2\u03b8 = 15\u00b0 due to sample degradation, the fitting was focused on the low-angle peaks and ab Kagome plane. This strengthens the proposition that 2 consists of a Kagome net with R = OH on the isophthalate groups. The deviation likely comes from the free hydroxyl group, which, while smaller than the propargyl groups, is more likely to interact (via ligation and/or hydrogen bonding) with adjacent layers and cause buckling/strain on the Kagome net. The hydrolytic conversion of 1 to 2 is faster compared to that of other Cu24MOPs because of the small hydrophilic moieties on the MOP 1. TGA also confirms the change in the structure, where the MOP 1 starts to degrade after 245 \u00b0C while the corresponding 2D MOF 2 degrades above 275 \u00b0C.
