The structure has a pillared-layer framework based on a kagome\u0301-like layer with aromatic partition groups. It exhibits a high CO2 uptake of 180 mL(STP)/g at 1 bar, and 400 mL(STP)/g at 30 bar at 273 K. The uptakes of C2H2 and C2H4 reach 164 and 160 mL(STP)/g at 298 K and 1 bar, with good selectivity of C2H2 and C2H4 over CH4, both of which are among the highest levels of reported PCPs.\n\nTo check the permanent porosity of 1, we measured the nitrogen sorption isotherm at 77 K. The N2 sorption of 1 (a) exhibits a typical reversible type I isotherm with a saturated adsorption amount of 636 mL(STP)/g. The large N2 uptake also indicates that the framework was maintained upon activation. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller apparent surface area calculated from the N2 adsorption data is 2410 m2/g, which is similar to that of NOTT-101 (2316 m2/g). Accordingly, the total pore volume is 0.98 cm3/g. Analysis of the N2 adsorption data using the nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) model confirms a narrow distribution of micropores around 10.7 \u00c5, which is consistent with the maximum diameter of Cages A and B. The gas sorption property near ambient temperatures was also studied. As shown in b, c, the CO2 uptake values of 1 are 180 mL(STP)/g (8.0 mmol/g) at 273 K and 91 mL(STP)/g (3.7 mmol/g) at 298 K. The adsorbed amount at 273 K is the class of highest value among the reported Cu2+ paddlewheel based PCPs so far (see also ). High-pressure CO2 sorption isotherms shows that maximum uptake increases to exceptionally high values of 400 (44.0%) and 361 mL(STP)/g (39.3%) under 30 bar at 273 and 298 K, respectively ( and d). Although this CO2 capacity is lower than those of some PCPs with extremely high surface areas such as NU-100 (69.8%, 40 bar at 298 K), it is comparable to those of other highly porous MOFs with open metal sites such as HKUST-1 (35.9%, 15 bar at 298 K), and higher than those of many other famous PCPs with open Cu2+ sites. The coverage dependent isosteric heat of adsorption (Q st) for 1 was calculated using the adsorption isotherms collected at 273 and 298 K fitted using the virial equation (see the ). Q st of CO2 adsorption of 1 at zero surface coverage is 24 kJ/mol (e), less than that of HKUST-1 (31.2 kJ/mol), yet comparable to other Cu2+ paddlewheel large pore PCPs such as NOTT-101 (26.5 kJ/mol). \n\nThe uncoordinated metal sites and the unique cage structure with moderate pores suggest that 1 might be a promising candidate for gas separation. Thus, adsorption experiments of various hydrocarbons were also carried out. At 1 bar, compound 1 exhibits notable adsorption capacities to C2H2 (241 mL(STP)/g), C2H4 (215 mL(STP)/g), C2H6 (232 mL(STP)/g), and CH4 (31 mL(STP)/g) at 273 K, and C2H2 (164 mL(STP)/g), C2H4 (160 mL(STP)/g), C2H6 (156 mL(STP)/g), and CH4 (18 mL(STP)/g) at 298 K. The maximum uptake of C2H2 at 298 K ranges from middle to high among this kind of PCPs (e.g., HKUST-1 (201 mL(STP)/g), NOTT-102 (147 mL(STP)/g) and PCN-16 (176 mL(STP)/g)). Q st for C2 hydrocarbons at zero coverage were also calculated as follows: C2H4, 34.7 kJ/mol; C2H2, 33.5 kJ/mol; C2H6, 23.6 kJ/mol CH4, 14.8 kJ/mol (e). Both unsaturated hydrocarbons and CH4 exhibit slightly lower Q st values than those reported (e.g., 39.4 kJ/mol for C2H2 and 18.6 kJ/mol for CH4 in UTSA-50a), as seen in the Q st for CO2 and CO. In order to theoretically estimate interaction energies between the gas molecules with the Cu2+ open metal sites, we conducted density functional theory calculations. The relationship among Q st values for C2 and C1 hydrocarbons (C2H4 ~ C2H2 > C2H6 > CH4) is consistent with the theoretically calculated binding energies of them with Cu2+ open metal sites. The result further suggests that the gas molecules can interact with open metal sites at low coverage region. (). To estimate the adsorption selectivity of light hydrocarbons, we calculated the Henry's Law constants, as well as prediction using ideal solution adsorbed theory (IAST) for C2/C1 equimolar binary mixtures at 298 K (f). 1 displays a great separation ratio of C2H2/CH4 = 65.5 at 298 K determined from the Henry's Law constants. The value of 1 is higher than many other Cu2+ paddlewheel-based PCPs, and comparable to that of UTSA-50a (68.0). Considering that not all Cu2+ paddlewheel PCPs show high C2/C1 ability (), cooperation of open metal sites and size confinement in the irregularly shaped kagome\u0301-like layer structure might be much more compatible for C2H2 and C2H4 than CH4. Moreover, 1 maintains a large adsorption capacity, which may arise from pillaring of the kagome\u0301-like layer with the EDOT groups enlarging the pore volume. Thus, the combination of high selectivity and capacity suggests that 1 is a promising material for the selective adsorptive separation of C2H2 and C2H4 over CH4.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "Porous
