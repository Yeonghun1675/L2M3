Most of the [Ag(4,4'-bipy)+][X-] structures have the guest anions sandwiched between layers of \u03c0-stacked polymeric chains, where the latter contain Ag+ chelated by the nitrogens of two neutral 4,4'-bipyridine units. Here, we again see a similar layout, except four silver atoms are co-linear and arranged into two dimers [3.1347(8) \u00c5], slightly reducing the amount of \u03c0-stacking but leading to greater covalent connectivity within the layer. These sheets are further stabilized by \u03c0-stacking of the bipyridine rings [3.425(8)-3.699(8) \u00c5]. The acetates charge-balance the polymers and \u03bc-2 bridge two Ag centers of adjacent polymers (, , S4). The Ag(1) coordinated by the nitrogens of two 4,4'-bipyridine units and one oxygen from two separate CH3CO2 - units define a distorted square planar geometry. The interstitial water molecules occupy the interlayer space between the silver complex chains and form an extensive hydrogen-bonded network [1.9271(8)-2.0970(8) \u00c5]. Hydrophobic pockets exist in the region of the acetate methyl group and bipyridine rings (Figure S4). One of the pyridine moieties has been modeled with positional disorder over two sites; the disorder is a rocking of the pyridine anchored at the nitrogen and para-carbon atom. There is a second pyridine moiety that has elongated displacement parameters and is tending toward some disorder but was not further modeled as such.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 14, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Crystal data for C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>34</sub>Ag<sub>2</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub>: <italic>M</italic>\n<sub>r</sub> = 754.29;\nmonoclinic;\nspace group <italic>P</italic>2<sub>1</sub>/<italic>c</italic>; <italic>a</italic> = 11.464(3) \u00c5; <italic>b</italic> = 18.299(5) \u00c5; <italic>c</italic> = 14.010(4) \u00c5; \u03b1 = 90\u00b0; \u03b2 = 102.275(4)\u00b0;\n\u03b3 = 90\u00b0; <italic>V</italic> = 2871.8(13) \u00c5<sup>3</sup>; <italic>Z</italic> = 4; <italic>T</italic> = 120(2) K; \u03bb\u00ad(Mo\u2013K\u03b1)\n= 0.71073 \u00c5; \u03bc\u00ad(Mo\u2013K\u03b1) = 1.424 mm<sup>\u20131</sup>; <italic>d</italic>\n<sub>calc</sub> = 1.745 g\u00b7cm<sup>\u20133</sup>; 66\u202f324 reflections collected; 7211 unique (<italic>R</italic>\n<sub>int</sub> = 0.0340); giving R<sub>1</sub> = 0.0237, wR<sub>2</sub> = 0.0572 for 6102 data with [<italic>I</italic> &gt; 2\u03c3\u00ad(<italic>I</italic>)] and R<sub>1</sub> = 0.0326, wR2 = 0.0610 for all 7211\ndata.
