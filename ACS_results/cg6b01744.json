Gas sensing measurements were first performed by exposing the obtained sensor to 100 ppm diverse VOC gases (dichloromethane, trichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, acetone, methanol, ethanol and n-propanol, and n-butanol) at room temperature. Figure S12 displays that SNNU-50 sensor has the highest response to n-butanol. The sensitivity of SNNU-50 sensor versus different n-butanol concentrations at 25 \u00b0C operating temperature has been further investigated. With an increase of n-butanol concentration from 20 to 120 ppm, the sensitivity promptly increases (a). Notably, the sensitivity values and the concentration of n-butanol are of linear relation with the R 2 value of about 0.97 (b). This result indicates that SNNU-50 can be used for the quantitative detection of n-butanol vapor. c shows the response-recovery characteristics of SNNU-50 sensor to 100 ppm n-butanol.
