X-ray diffraction measurements were performed on a STOE IPDS II diffractometer operating with a Mo K\u03b1 (\u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5) X-ray tube with graphite monochromator for complex 1 and on an Xcalibur Eos diffractometer operating with a Mo K\u03b1 (\u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5) X-ray tube with graphite monochromator for complex 2. The structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS-97 and refined by full-matrix least squares on F 2 with SHELXL-97 with anisotropic displacement parameters for non-hydrogen atoms, except those with partial sof. All H atoms attached to carbon were introduced in idealized positions using the riding model with their isotropic displacement parameters fixed at 120% of the value for their riding atom. Positional parameters of the H atoms attached to coordinated water molecules were obtained from difference Fourier syntheses and verified by the geometric parameters of the corresponding hydrogen bonds. For compound 1 the structure has been refined as two component twin (twin law: -100/010/00-1) in space group Abm2. Crystallographic data for the structures have been deposited in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, deposition numbers CCDC 1557267 for 1 and CCDC 1557728 for 2. These data can be obtained free of charge from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements were carried out on a Bruker D8 Discover instrument (Cu K\u03b11 radiation, \u03bb ~ 1.5418 \u00c5) equipped with a Lynxeye 1D detector in parallel beam geometry. The samples were mounted on a quartz low-background sample holder and scanned in the range 5-50\u00b0 (2\u03b8) with a step size of 0.04\u00b0(2\u03b8) and a dwell time of 1 s/step.", "data": null,

On lowering the temperature (see  and Figure S6 in the Supporting Information) \u03c7M T decreases gradually until 150 K and then more markedly, to reach 0.36 cm3 mol-1 K at 1.8 K. While the high-temperature decrease can be traced back to progressive depopulation of the excited doublets arising from the combined effect of low-symmetry distortions and spin-orbit coupling on the 4T1g state of octahedral CoII, the low-temperature decrease strongly hints at the presence of antiferromagnetic exchange coupling interactions mediated by the phenoxido and diazine bridges. Since the ground state for four linearly arranged antiferromagnetically coupled CoII ions is diamagnetic, the nonzero value of the \u03c7M T product at 1.8 K can be attributed to the presence of a paramagnetic impurity, which is indeed clearly evidenced by both the \u03c7M vs T curve and the isothermal M vs H curve measured at low temperature (Figures S7-S9 in the Supporting Information). The latter could be fit by assuming a Brillouin contribution for a species with an effective S eff = 1/2 (due to the impurity) and the temperature-independent paramagnetism contribution due to the four CoII centers of the cluster, which accounts for the high-field linear increase of the isothermal magnetization curves. The best-fit parameters provided g iso(impurity) = 4.29 \u00b1 0.07%IMP = 0.136 \u00b1 0.002 and \u03c7TIP = (5.3 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10-2 cm3 mol-1. These parameters strongly suggest that the paramagnetic impurity is due to a monomeric CoII-containing species, possibly due to some cluster fragmentation occurring during the synthetic procedure.

An excess of cobalt(II) ions leads to chains constructed from {CoII 4} helicates and single CoII ions, the helicate acting as a metalloligand toward both sodium and cobalt ions. This interesting topology of [{CoII 4}Co] n  allowed us to emphasize the slow relaxation of the magnetization for the single CoII ions, which, at low temperatures, are the sole paramagnetic centers, the tetranuclear helicates being characterized by a diamagnetic ground state. The relaxation process apparently follows Orbach's mechanism even if conclusive proof about the actual relaxation process would require a detailed spectroscopic and theoretical investigation of the system, which is beyond the scope of this paper. This chemistry can be expanded using other paramagnetic assembling cations.
