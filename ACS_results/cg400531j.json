The coordination environment of central metal ions of complex 7 is similar to that of complex 6, except the coordinated water of two adjacent thulium ions are replaced by DMF molecules. The thulium atoms are connected by carboxylate groups alternatively to form the rod-shaped SBU. Because of the coordinated DMF molecules pointing toward the channels, the size of the parallelogram channels are squeezed into two types: large channels with 10.9 \u00d7 10.8 \u00c5\u0301 along edge and 16.6 \u00d7 12.6 \u00c5\u0301 along the diagonal with free DMF molecules occupied, and a smaller one with the 10.9 \u00d7 10.7 \u00c5\u0301 along the edge and 10.8 \u00d7 17.6 \u00c5\u0301 along the diagonal with the coordinated DMF occupied (Figures  and). Complex 7 possesses less solvent occupation of crystal volume than that of 6 (42.7 vs 50.7%), calculated with PLATON.\n\nGas-Adsorption Properties\n\nOn the basis of the calculation with PLATON, the solvent-accessible volume for complexes 5, 6, 7, and 8 are 38.9%, 50.7%, 42.7%, and 25.8%, respectively. In order to check the permanent porosity of these porous materials, gas-adsorption tests for complexes 5-8 were conducted in different conditions.\n\nGas adsorption results of 5 are shown in Figure . Before gas-adsorption measurement, the sample was soaked in methanol for 24 h, and then vacuum-dried at 120 \u00b0C for 5 h. However, the N2 and Ar (kinetic diameter: 3.64 \u00c5 for N2 and 3.54 \u00c5 for Ar) sorption isotherm did not indicate any appreciable amount of adsorption, presumably due to the limited pore size. However, the activated 5 can adsorb a moderate amount of CO2 (51 cm3 g-1) and H2 (56 cm3 g-1, 0.49 wt %), with type-I behaviors. Derived from the CO2 adsorption data, complex 5 has a Langmiur surface area of 141 m2/g. Considering the kinetic diameters of 2.89 \u00c5 for H2, 3.3 \u00c5 for CO2, and 3.54 \u00c5 for Ar, it can be speculated that the pore opening of activated 5 should fall into the range from 3.3 to 3.54 \u00c5, which only allows CO2 and H2 to enter the channels.\n\nThe gas-adsorption behaviors of the activated 6, which had been vacuum-dried at 120 \u00b0C after being soaked in methanol for several hours, reveal that complex 6 can retain its framework after the removal of the solvates. Complex 6 can adsorb a moderate amount of N2 (69 cm3 g-1), Ar (59.4 cm3 g-1), O2 (93 cm3 g-1), and H2 (56.6 cm3 g-1, 0.5 wt %) at 77 K, and CO2 (66 cm3 g-1) at 195 K, with type-I behaviors and a Langmiur surface area of 219 m2/g based on the N2 adsorption data (Figures a and ). The lower gas-adsorption amounts may derive from the existence of large and straight channels without any cages or polyhedra in the structure. \n\nComplex 7 was activated at 220 \u00b0C and tested for N2 and H2 at 77 K. Complex 7 could absorb a moderate amount of N2 (59.8 cm3 g-1), H2 (68.0 cm3 g-1, 0.6 wt %) with type-I behaviors and a Langmiur surface area of 254 m2/g based on the N2 adsorption data (Figure b). The H2 sorption of 7 is slightly higher than that of 6, which may be the result of the removal of solvates from the large channels. The N2 isotherm of 7 displayed a significant hysteresis between sorption and desorption curves, compared to others. Compared to 6, the slight decrease of N2 sorption mount of 7 further indicates that the solvent-accessible volume has a significant influence on the gas adsorption. The N2 sorption mount of complexes 6 and 7 are obvious more than that of 5, presumably due to the following reason: large steric hindrance groups limit the range of the pore size and reduce the solvent-accessible volume.\n\nComplex 8 was activated at 100 \u00b0C under a vacuum for 10 h. Dinitrogen-adsorption test showed that complex 8 could absorb a moderate amount of N2 (187.11 cm3 g-1) with type-I behavior and has a Langmiur surface area of 755.24 m2/g derived from the N2 adsorption data (Figure ).
