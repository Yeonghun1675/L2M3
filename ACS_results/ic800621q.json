In compound I, Mn(1) is surrounded by one triply coordinated (with two different Mn2+ ions and one K+ ion) and one bidentate (with two different Mn2+ ions) carboxylate groups, one \u03bc3-OH group, two \u03bc2-H2O molecules, and one terminal H2O molecule, so the charge at this site is thus [(-1 \u00d7 1/3) + (-1 \u00d7 1/2)]COO - + [-1 \u00d7 1/3]OH - + [2]Cd = 5/6. The Mn(2) atom is surrounded by one monodentate, one bidentate (with two different Mn2+ ions), and one triply coordinated (with two different Mn2+ ions and one K+ ion) carboxylate groups, two \u03bc3-OH groups, and one terminal water molecule. Therefore, the charge at this site is 1/2-. The K atom is surrounded by one triply coordinated carboxylate group (with two Mn2+ ions and one K+ ion), two \u03bc2-H2O water molecules, and two terminal water molecules. So, the charge of the K site is 2/3. The total charge on the two Mn atoms and the one K atom is 1+, which is compensated for by the presence of the free COO- of the OBA unit. Similar calculations can be performed on the compounds 2-6, which reveals that the charge on the Mn site is zero (all of the five compounds have only one crystallographically independent Mn2+ ion). Out of the five compounds, compounds 2-5 have a ratio of Mn and COO- of 1:2, which suggests that the transformation from one structure to the other may not alter the charge on the Mn site. Thus, the structural changes can be brought about by the replacement of a few neutral ligand molecules such as H2O and imidazole or by a change in the coordination number/mode of the carboxylate group. The change in the coordination number/mode of the carboxylate groups has been observed earlier in obtaining related cobalt succinate structures. This type of rationalizing permits the presence of the intermediate phases at moderate temperature as well as the presence of a mixture of phases, when the total charges at the Mn site are similar, as has been the case for the four structures (2-5) isolated during the study. In addition, this also indicates that the phases may have comparable energy. Compound 6 also has a charge of zero at the Mn site with a ratio of Mn:COO- = 1:1, which requires the presence of an OH- group attached to the Mn site to maintain charge equilibrium. This situation gives rise to a -Mn-(OH)-Mn-(OH)-Mn- type of linkage that resembles the layers commonly encountered in layered double hydroxides.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 39, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>The charge distribution calculations on the three manganese trimellitate phases, <bold>7</bold>\u2212<bold>9</bold>, reveal that the compounds <bold>7</bold> and <bold>8</bold> have zero charge at the Mn site whereas <bold>9</bold> has two different charges, Mn(1) = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>12</sub> and Mn(2) = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub>\u2212.
