Besides, [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2\u22c56H2O (bpy = 2',2-bipyridine) as an auxiliary photosensitizer (PS) was added into the reaction system for increasing visible-light absorption. Because of the matched LUMO positions between the PS and MOF-based catalysts (Figures S15-S17), photogenerated electrons were allowed to migrate from the PS to the MOFs. On the basis of the different optical and electrochemical properties of these isomorphic MOFs, their differences in the performance of CO2RR can be demonstrated through a series of photocatalytic experiments. As shown in a, increasing the generation of CO (22.3 \u03bcmol, i.e., 371.6 \u03bcmol g-1 h-1) rather than H2 (0.5 \u03bcmol, i.e., 8.3 \u03bcmol g-1 h-1) were observed when reducing CO2 with MOF-Ni as a photocatalyst under visible-light irradiation (\u03bb \u2265 420 nm) (b). By contrast, MOF-Co displayed a dramatic increase in the production of CO (22.8 \u03bcmol, i.e., 1140.0 \u03bcmol g-1 h-1) and H2 (25.3 \u03bcmol, i.e., 1265.0 \u03bcmol g-1 h-1), while only 1.7 \u03bcmol (i.e., 68.0 \u03bcmol g-1 h-1) of CO and 5.8 \u03bcmol (i.e., 232.0 \u03bcmol g-1 h-1) of H2 was shown by MOF-Cu in the same reaction system. The TONs of these photocatalytic systems are summarized in Table S3. Remarkably, the MOF-Ni exhibits a higher selectivity of CO over H2 (97.7%) than MOF-Co (47.4%) and MOF-Cu (22.6%). Furthermore, among the reported heterogeneous MOF-based catalysts used in the photocatalytic CO2RR, one that exhibited such a high selectivity toward CO have been rarely seen.
