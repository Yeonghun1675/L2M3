The maximum Q st for H2 is ~13 kJ/mol at low pressure. As the H2 loading increases to ~0.7 wt %, Q st decreases to ~7 kJ/mol, and from 0.7 to 1.1 wt %, Q st increases slightly. The increase in Q st at higher loadings may be due to intersorbate interactions that are promoted in the restricted pore space.
