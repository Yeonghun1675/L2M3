The \u03c7M T value of 1 at 300 K is 3.28 cm3 mol-1 K, which is higher than the value (1.875 cm3 mol-1 K) expected for one spin-only Co(II) ion (1.875 cm3 mol-1 K, S = 3/2, g = 2) because of the strong spin-orbit coupling. Upon lowering the temperature, the \u03c7M T first decreases to 2.46 cm3 mol-1 K at 24 K, which is caused by spin-orbit coupling or antiferromagnetic interactions. Upon further lowering the temperature, the \u03c7M T increases suddenly to a maximum of 3.41 cm3 mol-1 K at 7.58 K. The increase of \u03c7M T at 7-18 K might be attributed to the canted magnetic structure of the Co2+ chain. The second decrease of \u03c7M T is due to the interchain antiferromagnetic interactions. The fitting results of the \u03c7M T by the Fisher 1D model from 80 to 300 K reveal that J = -8.30 cm-1 and g = 2.71 (). The negative J reveals interchain antiferromagnetic interactions between Co(II) ions. Due to the anisotropy of Co(II) in 1, the M vs H curve displays that the magnetization increases to 2.26 N\u03b2 without achieving saturation at 7 kOe (Figure b). Further analysis of the alternating-current (ac) susceptibility of 1 displays that the in-phase (\u03c7') and out-of-phase (\u03c7\") susceptibilities under zero dc fields show peaks at low temperature (). The frequency shift parameter \u03c6 of 1 is 0.07 (\u03c6 = (\u0394T p/T p)/\u0394(log \u03bd)), which is typical for spin-glass behavior (0.01 < \u03c6 < 0.08).

The direct-current (dc) magnetic susceptibility of 1 was measured at 2-300 K at a dc field of 1000 Oe (Figure a). The \u03c7M T value of 1 at 300 K is 3.28 cm3 mol-1 K, which is higher than the value (1.875 cm3 mol-1 K) expected for one spin-only Co(II) ion (1.875 cm3 mol-1 K, S = 3/2, g = 2) because of the strong spin-orbit coupling. Upon lowering the temperature, the \u03c7M T first decreases to 2.46 cm3 mol-1 K at 24 K, which is caused by spin-orbit coupling or antiferromagnetic interactions. Upon further lowering the temperature, the \u03c7M T increases suddenly to a maximum of 3.41 cm3 mol-1 K at 7.58 K. The increase of \u03c7M T at 7-18 K might be attributed to the canted magnetic structure of the Co2+ chain. The second decrease of \u03c7M T is due to the interchain antiferromagnetic interactions. The fitting results of the \u03c7M T by the Fisher 1D model from 80 to 300 K reveal that J = -8.30 cm-1 and g = 2.71 (). The negative J reveals interchain antiferromagnetic interactions between Co(II) ions. Due to the anisotropy of Co(II) in 1, the M vs H curve displays that the magnetization increases to 2.26 N\u03b2 without achieving saturation at 7 kOe (Figure b). Further analysis of the alternating-current (ac) susceptibility of 1 displays that the in-phase (\u03c7') and out-of-phase (\u03c7\") susceptibilities under zero dc fields show peaks at low temperature (). The frequency shift parameter \u03c6 of 1 is 0.07 (\u03c6 = (\u0394T p/T p)/\u0394(log \u03bd)), which is typical for spin-glass behavior (0.01 < \u03c6 < 0.08). The isothermal magnetization at 1.8 K shows no clear hysteresis loop ().\n\nThe \u03c7M T value of 2 is 2.89 cm3 mol-1 K at 300 K, higher than the expected value for one spin-only Co(II) ion due to the spin-orbit coupling (Figure a). By lowering the temperature, \u03c7M T values first decrease to 0.97 cm3 mol-1 K at 11.96 K, which can be attributed to the antiferromagnetic interactions and/or spin-orbit coupling. \u03c7M T increases rapidly in the range 10 to 2.8 K, which might be attributed to the spin canting and was further evidenced by the field dependence of magnetization at 2 K. The M vs H curve shows an abrupt increase to above 0.34 N\u03b2 before 1400 Oe and further reaches linearly to 0.8 N\u03b2 without saturation (Figure b). The second decrease of \u03c7M T would be attributed to the interchain antiferromagnetic interactions. Fitting the data with the Fisher 1D model in the range 75-300 K gives J = -19.67 cm-1 and g = 2.62 (). The negative J indicates antiferromagnetic interactions between Co(II) ions in the chain. The antiferromagnetic behavior of 2 can be understood on the basis of its structural feature: the exchange pathway between two adjacent Co(II) ions consists of one bidentate-bridged OH with the Co-O-Co angle of 117.26(3)\u00b0, which surpasses the range for ferromagnetic exchange pathways (90 \u00b1 14\u00b0). The ac magnetic susceptibility for 2 was measured. However, no frequency-dependent ac susceptibility was observed under zero dc field ().\n\nThe room-temperature \u03c7M T value of 3 is 14.97 cm3 mol-1 K (Figure a), which is larger than that expected for seven spin-only Co(II) ions (13.13 cm3 K mol-1). This phenomenon is very common for the Co(II) ion due to its strong spin-orbit coupling. When the temperature is lowered, \u03c7M T decreases rapidly to 4.35 cm3 mol-1 K at 2 K, which results from the spin-orbit coupling and/or antiferromagnetic interactions. The field dependence of magnetization for 3 at 2 K displays an increase of the magnetization along with the increasing fields without saturation even at 70 kOe (Figure b). To further study the magnetization dynamics of 3, ac susceptibility was measured at zero dc field. Interestingly, frequency-dependent \u03c7M\" signals were observed below 5 K, suggesting slow relaxation of the magnetization for 3. However, peaks of \u03c7M\" were not observed above 2 K (). Such phenomena may be caused by fast quantum tunneling of magnetization, which could be well suppressed by applying an external magnetic field. In this case, the field dependence of the relaxation time was measured. The optimized external field for the slowest relaxation time (\u03c4) is 1800 Oe (). Peaks were observed in \u03c7\" at low temperatures when an external dc field (1800 Oe) was applied (Figure d).

The ln(\u03c4)-1/T plot shows a deviation from linearity, which could be explained as a transition from an Orbach process at high temperature to a non-Orbach process at low temperature, such as the direct process or a Raman process. The relaxation time from 2.6 to 7 K obeys the Arrhenius law and gives \u03c40 = 2.20 \u00d7 10-8 s and \u0394\u03c4/k B = 34 K (Figure f), which lies well for single-molecule magnets (SMMs).
