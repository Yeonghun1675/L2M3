The crystalline material was allowed to air dry before being loaded into the sample cell, where it was  outgassed first at room temperature and then 85 \u00b0C for 6 h. Argon and nitrogen isotherms can be regarded as pseudo-type I isotherms (Figure a), and the apparent surface area was estimated using Langmuir and BET methods (N2: 3223 and 2847 m2/g, respectively); the total pore volume was found to be 1.01 cm3/g (N2). An interesting feature of the isotherms can be observed for pressures between 0.01 to 0.1 atm, where a second slope appears. This phenomenon is attributed to the three different cage diameters, where the largest cages approach mesoporous range; the smallest cages are first to be covered, the largest are subsequently covered at higher pressure (Figure S7). \n\nHydrogen capacity was assessed for 1, measured at 77 and 87 K at atmospheric pressures (Figure b), with up to 2.4 wt % at 77 K.
