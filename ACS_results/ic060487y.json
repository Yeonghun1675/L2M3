Linear bridging ligands such as pyrazine or 4,4\u2018-bipyridine were among the first ligands used in the specific formation of coordination polymers because they were simple, readily available, and looked to allow for more predictable formation of network structures.

This again resulted in 4-fold interpenetrated three-dimensional nets in a manner akin to 4, although the nets were seen to be significantly different. The resulting topological networks could be defined as uninodal 412.63 nets, with nodes based on the N atom of the hydrogen-bonding NO3 - anions. (Figure ) Each node was linked to six other nodes via the polymer chains. The 412.63 node topology is identical to that of the \u03b1-polonium network; however, in 5, the networks display a skew not seen in the prototypical net. Despite the large number of octahedral transition-metal complexes, there are a lot fewer coordination polymers that display true six-connected nodes, although the number of such networks has been steadily increasing. The majority of these are related to the \u03b1-polonium net, with only six having an unrelated node topology. Those related to the \u03b1-polonium net can be further divided into three major groups. The first contains those that adopt a true \u03b1-polonium type structure, where all links between nodes are the same, and also includes skewed frameworks that result in rhombohedral cavities, and the distorted \u03b1-polonium network, where there are two long links and four short between identical nodes. Among the \u03b1-polonium type structures also exists a subgroup of complexes based on metal-cyano salts, such as the Prussian-Blue-related networks. The second, and much smaller, group consists of those structures that adopt a network more akin to the NaCl net, which is isotopological with the \u03b1-polonium net but consists of two equivalent octahedral nodes. The third group is made up of those networks that may be simplified easily to \u03b1-polonium nets, but are more correctly described as nets with the boron topology of CaB6, which can be described as an \u03b1-polonium network with nodes replaced by octahedral clusters of nodes. These networks have been studied extensively by Yaghi and co-workers, in particular the stability and gas sorption ability of the architectures.

Selected IR (KBr, cm-1): 3416m (bpa), 1084s (ClO4 -), 528m (bpa). \n\n Hydrothermal Synthesis of {[Ag(bpa)](ClO  4  )}  \u221e   (4). AgClO4 (12 mg, 58 \u03bcmol) and bpa (10 mg, 58 \u03bcmol) were combined in a 5 mL Pyrex tube with H2O (2 mL). The tube was taken through 2 cycles of freeze-pump-thaw and then sealed. It was placed in a thick-walled steel blast tube, heated to 120 \u00b0C for 64 h, and then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. Colorless X-ray quality crystals were isolated from a white fluffy gel. Yield: 7.7 mg (35%). \n\n {[Ag(bpa)](NO  3  )}  \u221e   (5). AgNO3 (50 mg, 0.29 mmol) dissolved in degassed MeCN (20 mL) was added via cannula to bpa (50 mg, 0.29 mmol) dissolved in degassed MeCN-H2O (20 mL, 3:1, v/v) and stirred overnight. The white solid that precipitated was filtered and dried in vacuo. Yield: 78 mg (78%). Colorless X-ray quality crystals were grown from the slow diffusion of a MeCN/H2O solution of bpa layered with benzene and a MeCN solution of AgNO3. Anal. Calcd for C10H9N4O3Ag: C, 35.21; H, 2.66; N, 16.43. Found: C, 35.50; H, 2.69; N, 16.32. Selected IR (KBr, cm-1): 3418m (bpa), 1351s (NO3 -), 531m (bpa). \n\n Hydrothermal Synthesis of {[Ag(bpa)](NO  3  )}  \u221e   (5). AgNO3 (9.9 mg, 58 \u03bcmol) and bpa (10 mg, 58 \u03bcmol) were combined in a 5 mL Pyrex tube with H2O (2 mL). The tube was taken through 2 cycles of freeze-pump-thaw and then sealed. It was placed in a thick-walled steel blast tube, heated to 120 \u00b0C for 2 days, and then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. Colorless X-ray quality crystals were isolated from a white fluffy gel. Yield: 6.2 mg (31%).
