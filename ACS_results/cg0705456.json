However, no significant void space is present. In Cd\u2212H<sub>2</sub>TPyP-2 and Cd\u2212TPyP-3, the 2-fold interpenetration is responsible for the reduced void space even though the coordination chemistry permits the assembly of the highly open 3D topology. Without the interpenetration, Cd\u2212H<sub>2</sub>TPyP2 and Cd\u2212TPyP-3 could have void space as high as 63% and 61%, respectively. Therefore, the method for the elimination of interpenetration is essential for the design of porous materials. One strategy used by Yaghi and co-workers was to carry out the reactions under more dilute conditions.
