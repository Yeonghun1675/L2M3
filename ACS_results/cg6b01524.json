Its BET and Langmuir surface areas are estimated to be 595.5 m2\u22c5g-1 and 825.3 m2\u22c5g-1, respectively. The measured pore volume from the N2 sorption is only 0.292 cm3\u22c5g-1 at P/P 0 = 0.98.

FIR-34 is an 8-fold interpenetrating dia framework constructed from small dinuclear [Mn2(COO)4] secondary building units (SBUs), while FIR-35 based on large Mn5 SBUs is a non-interpenetrating framework with (3,8)-connected tfz-d network. Both of them have low porosity. However, the other non-interpenetrating framework (FIR-36) with large mesopores is built by rod-shaped Mn(II)-carboxylate SBUs. Gas sorption measurements for FIR-36 give a Langmuir surface area of 825.3 m2\u22c5g-1 and a H2 uptake of 134.5 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 77 K and 1 bar.\n\nThree microporous and mesoporous Mn(II)-tris((4-carboxyl)phenylduryl)amine frameworks (FIR-34 to FIR-36) have been obtained through effective interpenetration control. Different solvent systems and reaction temperatures determine the interpenetration of a MOF structure. FIR-36 with non-interpenetrating structure has Langmuir surface area of 825.3 m2\u22c5g-1 and a H2 uptake of 134.5 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 77 K and 1 bar.\n\nIn this work, by using different solvents and controlling the reaction temperature, microporous to mesoporous Mn(II)-TPA frameworks (FIR-34 to FIR-36) have been synthesized. Compound FIR-34, namely, [Mn(HTPA)(DMF)2]\u22c5(H2O) (DMF = N,N'-dimethylformamide), is an 8-fold interpenetrating dia framework constructed from dinuclear [Mn2(COO)4] secondary building units (SBUs). Compound FIR-35, namely, [Mn5(HTPA)2(TPA)2(e-urea)6]\u22c56(e-urea)\u22c52(H2O) (e-urea = ethyleneurea), is a non-interpenetrating framework based on Mn5 SBUs and is described as a (3,8)-connected tfz-d net.

FIR-36 crystallizes in monoclinic space group P21/c. The local coordination geometry around each Mn2+ center is depicted in a and S6. In the asymmetric unit, there are three independent Mn2+ ions, two TPA3- ligands, one coordinated H2O molecule, two coordinated DMI molecules, and seven MeCN and nine DMI guests (except for O atom, other atoms of coordinated DMI molecule as well as all the guests are squeezed by the PLATON program because of disorder). Mn1 ion is coordinated by five carboxylate O atoms from five TPA3- ligands and one DMI O atom, showing distorted octahedral coordination geometry. The Mn2 ion also adopts octahedral coordination geometry, but it is coordinated by five carboxylate O atoms from four different TPA3- ligands and one H2O O atom. The Mn3 ion is five-coordinated to four O atoms from four different TPA3- ligands and one DMI O atom. In FIR-36, all the ligands are complete deprotonated, and there are two kinds of coordination modes: (\u03ba1-\u03ba1)-(\u03ba1-\u03ba1)-(\u03ba1-\u03ba1)-\u03bc6 and (\u03ba1-\u03ba1)-(\u03ba1-\u03ba2-\u03bc2)-(\u03ba1-\u03ba2-\u03bc3)-\u03bc7 (Figure S7). Interestingly, three independent Mn centers are bridged by the carboxylate groups from TPA3- ligands to form a linear Mn3 cluster. Each Mn3 cluster is further linked by one -O-C-O- bridge, giving rise to an infinite chain with the terminal DMI molecules extending outside (a). Each resulting chain is further linked by the TPA3- linkers along the b and c axis to five neighboring ones, thus generating a 3D open framework with 1D channels along the a axis (b). There are two types of channels, the pore dimensions are 8 \u00d7 20 \u00c52 and 22 \u00d7 30 \u00c52 without the coordinated solvent molecules, respectively. The void volume of FIR-36 without coordinated solvent molecules and guests is above 66.7% of the cell volume. Remarkably, FIR-36 is a non-interpenetrated framework and possesses large pores. Actually, in our previous work, the porous non-interpenetrated frameworks FIR-4 and FIR-5 are also constructed by rod-shaped metal-carboxylate SBUs. The rigidity of the rod-shaped SBUs effectively avoids interpenetration due to the intrinsic packing arrangement of such rods in the crystal structure. \n\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out in N2 atomsphere to study the thermal stability of FIR-36. As shown in Figure S8, compound FIR-36 started to lose its MeCN guests and coordinated H2O molecules at 100 \u00b0C, followed by partial loss of its DMI guest molecules between 100 and 380 \u00b0C, with the weight losses of 10.38% and 35.08% (calculated 10.41% and 35.01%), respectively. Above 380 \u00b0C, FIR-36 started to lose its coordinated DMI molecules, with the weight losses of 7.73% (calculated 7.78%). In the end, it started to lose its ligands TPA3- as a result of thermal decomposition with the final residue unknown at 650 \u00b0C. Herein, because the high boiling point guest DMI is very difficult to activate, FIR-36 was immersed into low boiling point MeCN solvent. The TGA of exchanged sample FIR-36a shows that DMI guests can be completely exchanged with MeCN, except for the coordinated DMI molecules. For gas sorption study, FIR-36a was evacuated under a dynamic vacuum at 50 \u00b0C overnight to give a desolvated solid FIR-36a-ht. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of FIR-36a-ht shows sharp diffraction peaks similar to those of FIR-36 (Figure S9), indicating that the porous framework is largely maintained. On the other hand, peaks corresponding to the relative position show an apparent shift to higher angle; this result clearly indicates shrinking or distortion of the framework, which may be attributable to the rotation of the -O-C-O- bridge in the metal-carboxylate chain, which decreases the pore size.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""},
