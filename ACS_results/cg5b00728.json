Upon inspection of the MDA isotherm parameter C, it is evident that the characteristic energy of adsorption E decreases as t e increases or, therefore, that the pore width increases as t e increases. The pore volume values shown in  were estimated using the adsorption amount at saturation q 0 (complete pore filling) and using the classical assumption that the adsorbed phase resembles that of a liquid. It should be noted that the heterogeneity parameter n also increases as t e increases, meaning that the adsorption effective surface is less heterogeneous.
