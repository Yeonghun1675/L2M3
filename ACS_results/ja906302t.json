Powder X-ray diffraction further confirmed that the frameworks do not change at the degassing temperature. The N2 adsorption/desorption studies of 1 and 4 revealed that both have reversible type-I isotherms, indicating that they are microporous (Figure a). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and Langmuir surface areas for 1 are 507.8 and 711.8 m2 g-1, respectively, and those for 4 are 206.9 and 291.8 m2 g-1, respectively. Although compound 2 showed small H2 adsorption, no significant N2 or CO2 adsorption was observed.\n\nNotably, the CO2 uptake capacity of compound 1 reached as high as 70.6 cm3 g-1 (or 82 L per L) at 1 atm and 273 K, which is comparable to some of the highest values reported to date under the same measurement conditions (Figure b). Impressively, such a high CO2 uptake capacity is achieved even when the pores are occupied with extraframework charge-balancing cations (choline in this case). One possible reason for such a high CO2 adsorption may be the increased interaction between CO2 and hydroxyl groups on the choline cations, similar to the recently reported interaction between -NH2 groups and CO2. In comparison, the CO2 adsorption isotherm of 4 at 273 K and 1 atm shows an adsorption capacity of 28.9 cm3 g-1.\n\nThe studies of H2 adsorption/desorption in 1, 2, and 4 at 77 K and 1 atm revealed that the H2 uptake capacities follow the sequence 1 > 4 > 2 (Figure c). The amounts of H2 uptake at 77 K and 1 atm are 151.1 cm3 g-1 (1.36 wt %) for 1, 129.6 cm3 g-1 (1.16 wt %) for 4, and 9.5 cm3 g-1 (0.09 wt %) for 2.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol":
