Two carboxyl groups adopt the same syn monodentate bridging fashion, but the third one bridges one Zn(II) ion in a bidentate syn-anti fashion. The tci ligand using its one \u03bc2-syn-anti and one \u03bc1-syn carboxyl group links the tetrahedral Zn(II) centers to form a one-dimensional (1D) nanotube (Figure b) along the b axis with a diameter of approximately 3.5 \u00c5 occupied by DMF molecules and dimethyl ammonium cations. The 1D nanotubes are extended along the ac plane by tci to form the resulting 3D porous framework (Figure c). PLATON calculation suggests that the resulting effective free volume, after removal of guest DMF molecules and dimethyl ammonium cations, is 47.0% of the crystal volume (1229.1 \u00c53 out of the 2612.7 \u00c53 unit cell volume).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 14, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig4\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Ball-and-stick and schematic representations of simplified 3D sheet with <bold>lon</bold> topology (c) containing 4-connected tci (a) and 4-connected Zn(II) nodes (b).</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr6\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cg-2011-01181s_0004.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 4  Ball-and-stick and schematic representations of simplified 3D sheet with lon topology (c) containing 4-connected tci (a) and 4-connected Zn(II) nodes (b).
