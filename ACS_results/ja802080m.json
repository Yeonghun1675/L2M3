Though 1c corresponds to a local energy minimum on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is noteworthy that its energy relative to 1m agrees well with the experimental value of \u0394H \u29e7 and that the transition state is likely nearby. That formation of the NbPPN metallacycle 1c rather than P2 extrusion from 1c is rate-limiting is supported by a comparison of \u0394S \u29e7 for this process with that for the reaction in which  t BuC\ue5fcP is generated from a preformed NbPCO metallacycle. In the latter reaction, \u0394S \u29e7 was found to be +2 eu, consistent with a transition state in which bond breaking is causing the formation of two molecules. Here we observed a negative, large-magnitude value for \u0394S \u29e7, consistent with a reaction for which the ordering process of metallacycle formation is rate-limiting.

This solution was stirred for 3 h at 22 \u00b0C and took on an orange hue over this time. The reaction mixture was then filtered through a bed of Celite to remove salts and concentrated to dryness in vacuo. The resulting red powder was slurried in hexane (10 mL), and the solvent was removed once more. At this point the product mixture was slurried in n-pentane and then chilled to -35 \u00b0C. The desired product was collected by filtration atop a sintered glass frit as a brick-red powder. The filtrate was concentrated, and this procedure was repeated several times using successively less solvent until the yellow imido and the desired red product could not be separated further. The several fractions of red powder were combined and dried in vacuo (205 mg). This material was >90% pure (the impurity was the imido 2) as determined by NMR spectroscopy; it was further purified by storage as an n-pentane suspension at -35 \u00b0C followed by extraction of the undesired imido to give pure (OC)5W(P3)Mo(N[ i Pr]Ar)3 as a red powder (180 mg, 0.180 mmol, 57% yield).

The resulting solution was transferred to a Teflon-stoppered sealable tube, which was subsequently heated to 65 \u00b0C for 3.5 h. The color remained dark-red over this time. When the solution was cooled, pale fibrous solids precipitated from it; hexane was added to facilitate the precipitation, and the solution was chilled to -35 \u00b0C. The solids were then collected atop a sintered glass frit and washed with hexane to yield an off-white fibrous solid, which was dried in vacuo (45 mg, 0.067 mmol, 37% yield). 31P{1H} NMR (CDCl3, 20 \u00b0C, 121 MHz): \u03b4 -185 (br s, \u0394\u03bd1/2 = 350 Hz) ppm. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 20 \u00b0C, 300 MHz): \u03b4 6.83 (s, 3H, p-Ar), 6.33 (s, 6H, o-Ar), 4.60 (septet, 3H, HC(CH3)2), 2.28 (s, 18H, Ar-CH 3), 0.92 (d, 18H, C(CH 3)2) ppm.

The reaction mixture was allowed to stir for ~1 min, and then a 22 \u00b0C solution of P\ue5fcMo(N[ i Pr]Ar)3 (220 mg, 0.36 mmol, 1.1 equiv) in Et2O (4 mL) was added. This solution was stirred for 3 h at 22 \u00b0C and took on an orange hue over this time. The reaction mixture was then filtered through a bed of Celite to remove salts and concentrated to dryness in vacuo. The resulting red powder was slurried in hexane (10 mL), and the solvent was removed once more. At this point the product mixture was slurried in n-pentane and then chilled to -35 \u00b0C. The desired product was collected by filtration atop a sintered glass frit as a brick-red powder. The filtrate was concentrated, and this procedure was repeated several times using successively less solvent until the yellow imido and the desired red product could not be separated further. The several fractions of red powder were combined and dried in vacuo (205 mg). This material was >90% pure (the impurity was the imido 2) as determined by NMR spectroscopy; it was further purified by storage as an n-pentane suspension at -35 \u00b0C followed by extraction of the undesired imido to give pure (OC)5W(P3)Mo(N[ i Pr]Ar)3 as a red powder (180 mg, 0.180 mmol, 57% yield).
