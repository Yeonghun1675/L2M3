Notably, MOG-1, MOG-2 and L were found to exhibit white-light emission, whereas an intense green emission was observed in case of MOG-3. In particular, MOG-1 was found to exhibit more than 14 times higher-intensity photoluminescence than L and the other two MOGs. The characterizations of the gel materials with various microscopic techniques reveal their nanofibrous nature with extended network structures. The crystal structure of CdCl2 complex of L indicates the formation of one-dimensional polymeric network in which the intermolecular aromatic \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions significantly contribute, within as well as between the networks, for self-assembly process and also these interactions are responsible for the observed physical properties. Further, the MOG-1 was demonstrated as an effective chemosensor for nitroaromatics and also found to exhibit selective response to electron-deficient aromatics over electron-rich aromatics.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 28, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Crystallographic table; powder XRD profiles; FESEM\nand AFM images of MOG-1, MOG-2, MOG-3; time-resolved fluorescence\ndecay; rheological data of MOG-2 and MOG-3.
