In order to isolate the opposite handedness enantiomer and to further investigate the spontaneous resolution and the chiral induction phenomenon, we performed similar reactions in the presence of various chiral inducing agents. Indeed, the JLU-Liu23M has been prepared using S-Binol or (-)-cinchonidine as a chiral inducer, which crystallizes in the P6522 space group. Similarly, the introduction of R-Binol or (+)-cinchonine resulted in the formation of JLU-Liu23P that crystallizes in the P6122 space group with the opposite handedness. The absolute configurations of bulk materials were confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies (Table S1).
