However, computational studies on relative stabilities of hybrid frameworks are very limited. For example, Bailey et al. have demonstrated that relative stabilities of layered racemic and chiral phases of zinc cyclohexane trans-1,2-dicarboxylate frameworks can be rationalized in terms of the differences in the internal intralayer energies of the component single layers and the nonbonded, interlayer interactions. Assessment of the energetic contribution of more fine structural elements such as the conformation of organic ligand linkers has proven to be more difficult. Harvey et al. studied the relative stabilities of the aluminum alkylenediphosphonate series, namely, aluminum ethylenediphosphonate, aluminum propylenediphosphonate, and aluminum butylenediphosphonate. Hypothetical computational models were generated for each compound, in which the inorganic layer was manually designed to adopt either an aligned or unaligned structure. The organic ligand in each computational model was forced to adopt a particular conformation, and as a result the organic C\u2212C and C\u2212P bonds are rather strained, as was noticed by the authors. Therefore, it is not clear if the relative stabilities of the analyzed structures can indeed be attributed to organic ligand conformation or to the bond strains, induced by the manual placement of the inorganic building blocks.

This further emphasizes the richness of lithium tartrate phase-space. Numerous examples exist of compounds with more than one crystalline phase and many have been studied in detail both experimentally and computationally.

Note that subsequent to the initial submission of this paper, we have discovered one more dilithium meso-tartrate polymorph and, from analysis of impure products, we predict the existence of at least three other phases: one solvate, one anhydrous l-tartrate compound, and one anhydrous meso-tartrate compound. This further emphasizes the richness of lithium tartrate phase-space. Numerous examples exist of compounds with more than one crystalline phase and many have been studied in detail both experimentally and computationally. In the field of inorganic-organic frameworks, however, exploration of multiphase behavior in general and polymorphism in particular is still in its infancy and this field remains almost unexplored. In the few preceding studies of hybrid framework energetics, the contributions from the ZPVE and the E vib were not considered. We stress here that ZPVE and E vib (298.15 K) can have a notable effect on the relative enthalpies of inorganic-organic framework polymorphs, and thus their contribution should be evaluated when computational data on relative stabilities is analyzed. In this study, consideration of only electronic energies would lead to the conclusion that 2 should be within the same (qualitative) relative energy range as 3-5. However, inclusion of vibrational contributions to relative energies makes phase 2 significantly less stable than 3-5. The analysis of vibrational modes in turn points toward the topological details that are responsible for the energy difference between polymorphs 2 and 3. We are currently investigating the phase behavior of the compounds, which is complex due to the low energy differences between them, and we are characterizing both experimentally and computationally their lithium mobility and suitability for use as solid electrolytes in rechargeable batteries.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 63, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>SDT of <bold>2</bold>, <bold>3</bold>, <bold>5</bold> and the impure source reactions of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>4</bold>, powder X-ray diffraction patterns for <bold>2</bold>, <bold>3</bold>, <bold>5</bold> and the impure source reaction of <bold>4</bold>, plot of total energy as a function of plane wave cutoff, plot of calculated normal-mode frequencies of <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold> and table of absolute and relative calculated values of <italic toggle=\"yes\">E</italic>, ZPVE and <italic toggle=\"yes\">E</italic>\n<sub>vib</sub>, table from Appelhans et al., updated to include \u0394(<italic toggle=\"yes\">E</italic>\n<sub>elec</sub> + ZPVE) and \u0394(<italic toggle=\"yes\">E</italic>\n<sub>elec</sub> + ZPVE + <italic toggle=\"yes\">E</italic>\n<sub>vib</sub>).
