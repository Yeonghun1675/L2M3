The ethynide moiety C1\ue5fcC2 is embraced by a butterfly-shaped Ag4 basket in a \u03bc4-\u03b71,\u03b71,\u03b71,\u03b72 mode through three Ag\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C \u03c3/\u03c0 bonds (Ag3\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C1 = 2.397(7) \u00c5, Ag1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C1 = 2.595(7) \u00c5, and Ag1B\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C1 = 2.374(7) \u00c5), a Ag\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C \u03c0 bond (Ag1B\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C2 = 2.771(9) \u00c5), and a Ag\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C \u03c3 bond (Ag2\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C1 = 2.052(7) \u00c5) (Figure a).
