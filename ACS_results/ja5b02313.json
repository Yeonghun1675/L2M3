Note that we formulate these compounds as including ethylene glycoxide groups instead of OH groups, based on the absence of the typical OH vibration band and the presence of CH2 bands in their IR spectra ( (SI), Figures S9-S11). However, we cannot completely rule out the presence of both hydroxyl and ethylene glycoxide anions in the structure. The metal content was determined with ICP and total X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) spectroscopies.
