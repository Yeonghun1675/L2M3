The phase purity of 1 is confirmed by comparing the experimental and simulated PXRD patterns obtained from single crystal data (Figure S7, Supporting Information). The structure of 1 consists of a dimeric Gd2 (M\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5M = 4.0481(11) \u00c5) secondary building unit (SBU), constructed from two syn-syn bridging carboxylates, two terminal chelating carboxylates and two chelating as well as bridging carboxylates from six different L  2-  units (a).

Channel A contains six DMF molecules, while channel B has two DMF and six water molecules (Figure S8, Supporting Information).\n\nThermal stabilities of all the compounds were examined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Figures S20-S24, Supporting Information). The TGA curve of 1a shows a gradual weight loss of ~29.57% (expected = 30.51%) due to the expulsion of guest molecules in the lattice followed by metal-bound DMF and water molecules in the temperature range 30-260 \u00b0C. Beyond that temperature, complete decomposition of the framework takes place. The TGA curve of 2 exhibits a loss of lattice water and DMF molecules in the temperature range 30-250 \u00b0C, and beyond that temperature the framework collapses due to the removal of coordinated solvent molecules. Complexes 3 and 4 are stable up to 330 \u00b0C, and their decomposition takes place beyond this temperature. TGA of 5 shows a weight loss of ~2.46% (expected, 2.5%) in the temperature range 30-90 \u00b0C due to the removal of coordinated water molecule, and the framework is stable up to 330 \u00b0C.\n\nFerroelectric Study of Complex 2 \n\nSince complex 2 crystallized in the chiral triclinic space group P1, associated with the point group C 1 (one of the 10 polar point groups; C 1, C  s , C 2, C 2v , C 4, C 4v , C 3, C 3v , C 6, C 6v ), it fulfills the essential requirement for ferroelectric behavior. To carry out ferroelectric measurements, the powdered sample was compressed and sintered into a pellet. The plot of polarization (P) against the applied electric field (E) of magnitude 3.5 kV measured at room temperature exhibited electric hysteresis loop for 2 (a). At room temperature, the remnant polarization (P r) of 2 is ca. 0.16 \u03bcC cm-2 with a coercive field (E c) of ca. 1.1 kV cm-1. The saturation spontaneous polarization (P s) of 2 is ca. 5.7 \u03bcC cm-2. The P s value of this compound is higher than a typical ferroelectric compound, KH2PO4 (KDP) (P s = 5.0 \u03bcC cm-2) but smaller compared to some chiral MOFs. It can be seen that the P-E loop at room temperature differs from the classic ferroelectric loop and conforms to a quasi-linear dielectric. Increasing the field further resulted in dielectric breakdown of the pellet. Further, we have investigated the variation of dielectric constant (\u03b5') as a function of frequency (b) at room temperature. The dielectric constant (\u03b5') of complex 2 initially decreases from 12 to 8 up to 104 Hz and subsequently remains constant (\u03b5 ~ 8) up to ~5 MHz, beyond which a dielectric relaxation is observed (b). On the other hand, 2 exhibits a dielectric loss (tan \u03b4 = 0.5) in the frequency range (103-104 Hz) which falls further (tan \u03b4 ~ 0.01) and remains constant until the highest measurement frequency. These measurements reveal that the complex 2 can be better described as a linear dielectric material with low losses resulting in almost linear dependence of polarization with an applied electric field until the breakdown voltage.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "{[Gd2(L)3\u22c5(DMF)4]\u22c5(4DMF)\u22c5(3H2O)}n"}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value":
