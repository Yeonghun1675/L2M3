The reactions were carried out by using O2-free solutions to avoid oxidation or O2 fixation by the Mn(II) and Co(II) complexes. The complexes were characterized by elemental analysis and UV-vis-NIR spectra. Both the Co(II) complexes in aqueous solutions displayed a band in the visible region (\u03bbmax = 510 nm, \u03f5 = 18 cm-1 M-1 for [Co(L1)]- and \u03bbmax = 520 nm, \u03f5 = 12 cm-1 M-1 for [Co(L2)]2-) and a broadband in the NIR region at about 1100 nm (\u03f5 = 5.5 cm-1 M-1 for [Co(L1)]- and 4.0 cm-1 M-1 for [Co(L2)]2-), as expected for a high spin Co(II) ion with an octahedral coordination geometry. A charge transfer band was also observed below 250 nm. Instead, as expected for d5 metal cations, the d-d bands of Mn(II), Fe(III), and Ru(III) were too weak to be monitored in aqueous solution, even at 5 \u00d7 10-2 M concentrations (the solubility properties of the complexes did not allow us to achieve higher concentrations). The Mn(II) and Fe(III) complexes gave intense and broad charge transfer bands below 250 and 350 nm, respectively. Finally, the [Ru(L1)] complex gave a discrete charge transfer band at 340 nm (\u03f5 = 1900 cm-1 M-1), while [Ru(L2)]- was characterized by a structured band with two maximum peaks at 304 nm (\u03f5 = 1381 cm-1 M-1) and 360 nm (\u03f5 = 530 cm-1 M-1). The thermodynamic stability of the complexes was studied in aqueous solutions by potentiometric and microcalorimetric titrations in aqueous solutions (0.1 M NMe4Cl, 25.0 \u00b0C), and the results are shown in Table .
