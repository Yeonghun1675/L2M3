Herein, we have reported on the synthesis and structural characterization of novel catenated Zn2+-pillared MOFs, named PUM210, and its fluorinated analogue, PUM210F. The two frameworks are structurally similar, although the use of the fluorinated linker F-bpba imparts peculiar features to the corresponding MOF. In fact, based on the different water adsorption isotherm profiles collected with the two MOFs, it was concluded that PUM210F is less hygroscopic than PUM210, as expected for a fluorinated MOF. Then, we have followed a transmetalation pathway in order to explore also the modification of the metal nodes: a convenient protocol provided the heterometallic Cu2+-Zn2+ derivatives Cu-PUM210 and Cu-PUM210F.

The robustness\nof the two frameworks toward water was investigated by water vapor\nadsorption isotherms and recording of the PXRD traces of the resulting\nmaterials. Before being subjected to water uptake, the crystals were\nactivated by a solvent exchange protocol using acetone and dichloromethane,\nfollowed by high vacuum at 100 \u00b0C overnight, to provide the corresponding\nevacuated phases (see DSC traces in <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.cgd.8b01062/suppl_file/cg8b01062_si_001.pdf\">Figures S10\u2013S11</ext-link>).

The reduced adsorptive\nproperties of the fluorinated networks could be assigned to a distortion\nof the 3D architecture during activation with a partial pore capacity\nreduction.

The resultant framework displays rectangular microporous channels running along crystallographic axis a (d, ~7.1 \u00d7 11.5 \u00c52 cross section, determined including the van der Waals radius of atoms). As shown in d, the carboxylate planes are linked by bpba linkers and the channels are decorated by amide moieties of bpba. After removal of the solvent electron density, a unit cell void volume of 37% was calculated. A similar architecture was found in PUM210F, consisting of a twofold catenated framework (c). The lower degree of catenation should be ascribed to the higher steric hindrance of the perfluorinated biphenyl scaffold of F-bpba, which prevents the growth of an additional net. This allows the construction of larger channels (~8.5 \u00d7 17.2 \u00c52 considering the van der Waals radius of atoms) running along the crystallographic c axis (e). This is also reflected in a higher fraction of void volumes, once compared with PUM210, which reaches 52% of the unit cell after removal of the solvent electron density and not considering the volume occupied by the disordered ligand. The different degree of polycatenation found in the two materials appears to have a relevant impact on their structural flexibility. In fact, structural analyses show in both materials high electron density residuals close to the metal centers, situated along the paddlewheel axis, which is coincident with the direction of propagation of polycatenation. These strong residues can be attributed to additional positions for the SBUs and, coherently, also for the linkers. The peculiar type of disorder agrees with the presence of highly correlated diffuse scattering in the diffraction patterns (see Supporting Information, section XI) and suggests that the network is capable of moving by slight sliding of the 2D sheets one on the other, as depicted in b for PUM210.\n\nStability\n\nThe thermal behavior of the native MOFs was estimated by thermogravimetric analysis under nitrogen flux. TGA traces were collected using gently vacuum-dried crystals and pointed out a good thermal stability for both PUM210 and PUM210F, with T dec > 340 \u00b0C (Figure S5, Supporting Information). An initial two-step slope in the TGA trace of PUM210 was observed in the range 25-250 \u00b0C, corresponding to 23% weight loss. PUM210F revealed a similar behavior with a lower weight loss, corresponding to 13%, in the same interval of temperature. The amount of thermally extruded DMF molecules agreed well with the one calculated by 1H NMR analyses performed on digested crystals (Figure S14, Supporting Information).\n\nFor applicative purposes, it is imperative that MOFs must be able to retain their 3D architecture even in the presence of moisture. For instance, the use of MOFs for post-combustion CO2 capture, one of the most promising applications of MOFs, is limited to those which are inert toward water. Once removed from DMF and left in ambient environment or soaked in water, crystals of PUM210 and PUM210F degraded rather quickly. The robustness of the two frameworks toward water was investigated by water vapor adsorption isotherms and recording of the PXRD traces of the resulting materials. Before being subjected to water uptake, the crystals were activated by a solvent exchange protocol using acetone and dichloromethane, followed by high vacuum at 100 \u00b0C overnight, to provide the corresponding evacuated phases (see DSC traces in Figures S10-S11). The PXRD traces of the activated phases indicated a substantial retention of the starting framework for PUM210, whereas for PUM210F indicated the formation of a new phase hereafter referred to as PUM210Fa. The water vapor adsorption isotherms were determined plotting the water uptake against the relative humidity (p/p\u00b0) at 25 \u00b0C (Figure S32), up to 1 bar of pressure. The curves are slightly sigmoidal and the water uptake values are plotted as a function of relative humidity (p/p\u00b0). The water sorption capacity is slightly higher for PUM210 than for PUM210Fa (5.71 and 4.48 mmol/g, respectively) and at 20% humidity the water uptake of PUM210 is about twice that shown by PUM210Fa (1.23 vs 1.99 mmol/g), confirming a more hydrophobic behavior of the fluorinated derivative.\n\nThe CO2 sorption isotherms of PUM210 and PUM210Fa collected at 195 K exhibited a type I Langmuir behavior, indicating a favorable interaction between the amidic functionalized channels and carbon dioxide molecules during the adsorption process (). As mentioned above, the structural modification observed after activation of PUM210F, decreases the cavity volume leading to a reduction of adsorbed gas and surface area in PUM210Fa. The experimental BET surface area calculated by CO2 isotherms were 491 m2/g and 206 m2/g for PUM210 and PUM210Fa, respectively. In PUM210 the CO2 maximum uptake at 195 K corresponds to 27.1 wt % (138.0 cm3/g and 6.16 mmol) while, as expected, a minor percentage of 13.9 wt % (71.2 cm3/g and 3.16 mmol) was found for PUM210Fa. The reduced adsorptive properties of the fluorinated networks could be assigned to a distortion of the 3D architecture during activation with a partial pore capacity reduction. CO2 isotherm at 195 K for Cu-PUM210Fa (a) showed a ~30 cm3/g increase in CO2 sorption capability, resulting in a surface area of 285 m2/g. This improvement is linked to the robustness of the MOF caused by the presence of Cu ions, suggesting that the substitution of Zn ions with Cu ions is successful for increasing the adsorption properties of this family of materials. Unexpectedly, the introduction of copper does not have the same effect on PUM210, since the adsorptive capacity of Cu-PUM210 drops to 71.2 cm3/g (Figure S31), likely due to partial degradation of the crystal framework during the transmetalation process, as evidenced during the attempted SCSC transformation. Under the mild conditions of 273 and 298 K the CO2 adsorption isotherms recorded up to 5 bar of PUM210 showed an uptake of 118.64 and 76.85 cm3/g, respectively, while the PUM210Fa adsorbed a minor quantity in agreement with the smaller pore capacity. The isosteric heat of adsorption at low coverage obtained using Vant' Hoff equation is similar for both compounds: 27 and 28 kJ/mol for PUM210 and PUM210Fa, respectively. These values exhibited good affinity and are comparable to Zn-MOFs with a more open structure, for example, Zn-MOF74.
