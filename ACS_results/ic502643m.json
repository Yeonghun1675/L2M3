In addition, the coordination around the Zn4O cluster by high symmetry ligands, such as H3BTB, usually leads to an average coordination space for six carboxylate groups, and thus, it is difficult to leave space for terminal molecules, even though the system contains two types of ligands. Thus, a tricarboxylate ligand with lower symmetry, such as C 2v , would be the ideal candidate, because the lower symmetry of the ligands usually results in a nonuniformity of the coordination geometry.
