The spectroscopic similarity of this band\nto that observed in I<sub>2</sub>@SBMOF-1 was due to the chemical\nsimilarity of the sorption sites. However, the decreased frequency\nof I\u2013I stretching in type-I channel of SBMOF-2 suggests a stronger\nphenyl\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I interaction than that in SBMOF-1. The broad\nbands at \u223c170 cm<sup>\u20131</sup> (compared to 180 cm<sup>\u20131</sup> in crystalline I<sub>2</sub>) were assigned to the iodine stretching at the two sorption\nsites within the type-II channel, as stronger I\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O\ncharge-transfer interaction would decrease and broaden the vibrational\nfrequency of I<sub>2</sub>. In addition,\nthe spectroscpic similarity of MOFs loaded at dry and controlled humidity\nconditions suggested the iodine speciation within these MOFs was the\nsame. This ruled out a signigicant sorption of HI at 43% RH by SBMOF-2,\nwhich was also supported by the absence of the H\u2013I stretching\nat \u223c2300 cm<sup>\u20131</sup> in the measured spectra () and suggested HI production upon unloading\nof I<sub>2</sub> from MOFs. Likewise,\nthe absence of O\u2013H stretching in the Raman spectra of SBMOF-1\nand SBMOF-2 loaded at 43% RH confirmed the preferencial adsorption\nof I<sub>2</sub> over H<sub>2</sub>O. Overall, the results of Raman\nspectroscopy were consistent with the adsorption mechanisms of I<sub>2</sub> in SBMOF-1 and SBMOF-2 inferred from single-crystal XRD and\nprovided independent spectroscopic evidence for the extraordinary\niodine adsorption capacity of SBMOF-2 at both dry and high humidity\nconditions.</p>", "clean_text": "Finally, we employed Raman spectroscopy to gain further insights into the mechanisms of I2 sorption in SBMOF-1 and SBMOF-2 (). A single, strong, and sharp Raman band centered at 210 cm-1 was observed in I2@SBMOF-1 due to its homogeneous sorption environment with one type of channel. The band assignment to I-I stretching was straightforward as the energy of this vibration was similar to that in benzene-I2 complexes (~205 cm-1). The observed intense overtones of I-I stretching were also typical of I2-bearing complexes. Interestingly, the I-I stretching in \"free\" I2 dissolved in nonpolar solvents is ~211 cm-1, suggesting that phenyl\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5I interaction was relatively weak in the lattice of SBMOF-1. In contrast, iodine sorption in type-I (phenyl) and type II (phenol) channels of SBMOF-2 produced several distinct vibrational features. The I-I stretching in the type-I channel was responsible for the sharp and strong Raman band centered at 201 cm-1. The spectroscopic similarity of this band to that observed in I2@SBMOF-1 was due to the chemical similarity of the sorption sites. However, the decreased frequency of I-I stretching in type-I channel of SBMOF-2 suggests a stronger phenyl\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5I interaction than that in SBMOF-1. The broad bands at ~170 cm-1 (compared to 180 cm-1 in crystalline I2) were assigned to the iodine stretching at the two sorption sites within the type-II channel, as stronger I\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O charge-transfer interaction would decrease and broaden the vibrational frequency of I2. In addition, the spectroscpic similarity of MOFs loaded at dry and controlled humidity conditions suggested the iodine speciation within these MOFs was the same. This ruled out a signigicant sorption of HI at 43% RH by SBMOF-2, which was also supported by the absence of the H-I stretching at ~2300 cm-1 in the measured spectra () and suggested HI production upon unloading of I2 from MOFs. Likewise, the absence of O-H stretching in the Raman spectra of SBMOF-1 and SBMOF-2 loaded at 43% RH confirmed the preferencial adsorption of I2 over H2O.
