As shown in , the dcbba ligand exhibited strong blue-green emission with the broad emission band from 400 to 500 nm when excited at 300-380 nm. Similarly, complex 1 exhibits Ln3+ ions tuned ligand-centered emission around 400-550 nm upon being excited at 300-380 nm. However, the emission intensity exhibited an obvious enhancement with the increasing excitation wavelength. On the contrary, complex 2 completely exhibits a characteristic emission of Eu3+ ions at 593, 616, 650, and 699 nm, respectively, which corresponds to the 5D0 \u2192 7F J  (J = 1-4) transitions of the Eu3+ ion upon being excited at 300-380 nm. The lifetime and quantum yield for complex 2 are \u03c4 = 1.25 ms (Ex = 368 nm) and \u03a6 = 28.36% (Figure S6b). Similarly, complex 3 exhibits four peaks at 490, 544, 582, and 621 nm corresponding to the 5D4 \u2192 7FJ (J = 6-3) transitions of the Tb3+ ion (a). The quantum yield and lifetime are 1.28 ms and 25.11%, respectively (Figure S6c). The long luminescence lifetimes and high quantum yields of complexes 2 and 3 suggest that the energy transfer between the H3dcbba ligand and lanthanide ions is effective (Table S2).", "data":
