From crystallographic studies and elemental analysis, the formula is determined as Cu6(BTTC)4(H2O)6\u22c5xS (S represents noncoordinated solvent molecules).\n\nThe PXRD profiles of complex 1 indicate that the framework preserves its crystallinity even though the guest solvents and coordinated water are removed (). To confirm the permanent porosity of compound 1, the methanol-exchanged bulk is activated under high vacuum at 393 K for 12 h to obtain the evacuated framework. The N2 adsorption for 1 at 77 K displays a completely reversible type-I adsorption behavior (Figure ), characteristic of microporous materials. On the basis of the N2 sorption isotherm, the estimated apparent Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area is ~1675 m2 g-1 (Langmuir surface ~1858 m2 g-1), and the total pore volume is determined to be 0.655 cm3 g-1 for 1. The pore size distributions calculated from the N2 isotherms using the nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) method indicates the average pore size for 1 is 1.3 nm in diameter, consistent with the crystallographic data (ca. 1.2 nm).\n\nLow-pressure H2 sorption isotherms were recorded at 77 and 87 K to evaluate its H2 adsorption performance, which were completely reversible, as shown in Figure  inset. A significant H2 uptake of 1.37 and 0.91 wt % (153 and 102 cm3 g-1) is achieved at 77 and 87 K (1 bar) for compound 1 without saturation, respectively, which is quite close to the performance of well-known compounds PCN-6' (1.37 wt %) and HKUST-1(1.44 wt %) at 77 K/1 bar. To better understand these observations, the adsorption enthalpy of H2 for activated 1 was calculated by a virial method (). At zero loading, indicative of the interaction of H2 with the most energetically favored sites in the framework, Q st was determined to be ~7.0 kJ mol-1 (Figure b), which is higher than those of \"benchmark MOFs\" with vacant metal cation sites, such as the NOTT series (5.68-6.70 kJ mol-1), SNU-21S (6.65 kJ mol-1), UMCM-150 (6.3 kJ mol-1), MIL-100 (6.3 kJ mol-1) and MIL-102 (6.0 kJ mol-1), PCN-6' (6.0 kJ mol-1) and PCN-46 (6.36 kJ mol-1), and soc-MOF (6.5 kJ mol-1). In addition, the value apparently surpasses that of the typical van der Waals-type interactions. It should be pointed out that the high enthalpy of H2 adsorption of compound 1 stems principally from the presence of the exposed metal Cu(II) sites on the pore surface. Furthermore, the high-pressure H2 sorption study was evaluated using the gravimetric measurement method up to 100 bar; at 77 K, the excess gravimetric H2 uptake capacity of 1 reaches 40 mg g-1. The value is lower than those of PCN-6' (4.2 wt %) and PCN-6 (6.7 wt %) at 50 bar but close to that of HKUST-1 (3.3 wt %) at 77 bar and is superior to the reported MOFs with vacant coordination sites, such as MIL-100 (3.28 wt %, 90 bar), Ni(dhtp)2 (1.8 wt %, 70 bar), and Sm2Zn3(oxdc)6 (1.19 wt %, 34 bar) under 77 K. \n\nThe CO2 isotherms of 1 are collected at 273 and 298 K/1 bar, both of which are fully reversible. Activated 1 takes up a maximum CO2 uptake of 73.6 cm3 g-1 (3.29 mmol g-1, 14.5%) at 273 K and 40.5 cm3 g-1 (1.81 mmol g-1, 7.95%) at 298 K, respectively (Figure ). The value is near that for the reported MOFs under the same conditions. Meanwhile, the low-pressure CH4 sorption isotherms indicate that 1 has adsorption capacities of 19.76 cm3 g-1 (0.882 mmol g-1, 1.41%) and 12.2 cm3 g-1 (0.545 mmol g-1, 0.87%) at 273 and 298 K. Comparatively, the limited N2 uptake is only 5.36 cm3 g-1 (0.24 mmol g-1, 0.67%) and 3.31 cm3 g-1 (0.15 mmol g-1, 0.41%) at 273 and 298 K/1 bar, respectively. The adsorption capacity of CO2 for 1 is 3.0 and 11.2 times the values of CH4 and N2 at 298 K/1 bar, highlighting that compound 1 is a promising material for the highly selective separation of CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 at room temperature.\n\nThen, its high-pressure adsorption was further investigated (), and the unsaturation excess CO2 uptake reaches 263.3 mg g-1 (5.98 mmol g-1) and 223.1 mg g-1 (5.07 mmol g-1) at 273 and 298 K (20 bar), respectively, which are close to the performance MSF series (MSF-1:24.1 wt %, MSF-3:21.6 wt %) and {[Cu2(TCMBT)(bpp)(\u03bc3-OH)]\u22c56H2O} n  (25.5 wt %) at 298 K/20 bar. The unsaturation excess CH4 uptake reaches 38.42 mg g-1 (2.40 mmol g-1) and 30.26 mg g-1 (1.89 mmol g-1) at 273 and 298 K (20 bar), respectively.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "complex 1", "symbol":
