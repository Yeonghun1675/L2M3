Phosphonate-based MOFs are at the epicenter of a field that is far from ripe, presenting a multitude of opportunities and challenges. Within this general framework, here, we have reported a full new family of Ln-based 3D MOFs (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, and Dy) with the ligand 2-hydroxyphosphonoacetate. The principal conclusions can be summarized as follows:  (1)  Compounds LnHPA, with the formula Ln3(H0.75O3PCHOHCOO)4\u22c5xH2O (x = 15-16) crystallize in the orthorhombic system. Two types of structures can be isolated: series I and II polymorphs. Series I compounds crystallize in a noncentrosymmetric structure (e.g., Iba2), whereas series II samples crystallize in a centrosymmetric structure (e.g., Pcan).   (2)  Synthesis pH plays a significant role on the identity of the products. For example, for the La derivative, the polymorphic phase LaHPA-I was obtained for pH values of <0.8, whereas LaHPA-II was prepared at pH values of >1.0. Syntheses at intermediate pH values led to a mixture of these phases.   (3)  For both series I and II polymorphs, the 3D frameworks result from the linkage of organic-inorganic layers by central lanthanide cations, which yield trimeric SBUs also found in several other metal-HPA hybrids. Large oval-shaped 1D channels, running along the c-axis, are formed by the spatial separation of the layers and filled with lattice water molecules.   (4)  LnHPA compounds show crystalline-to-amorphous-to-crystalline transformations, upon dehydration-rehydration processes.   (5)  LnHPA materials also show proton conductivity. For example, for LaHPA (series I), \u03c3T = 5.6 \u00d7 10-6 S cm-1 and for GdHPA (series II), \u03c3T = 3.2 \u00d7 10-4 S cm-1, both at 98% RH and T = 21 \u00b0C.   (6)  Photoluminescence results, including lifetime measurements, indicate that the dehydration-rehydration of emitting Eu centers is reversible. The Eu-bound water content can be estimated by a simple approach from the luminescence lifetimes.
