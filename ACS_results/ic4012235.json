The fact that a metamagnetic transition occurs, can be understood on the basis of the crystallographic structure (see Figure ), which consists of sets of ferromagnetic parallel chains with a weak antiferromagnetic coupling between them. It can be assumed that with increasing field the weakest antiferromagnetic interchain interaction is overcompensated, and the magnetic moments of neighbor chains reverse their orientation. This interchain interaction can be estimated by comparing the interchain exchange energy and the Zeeman energy 5  - z J '   s   2   = g   \u03bc   B   s   H   C   \u22c5   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 27, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>Substituting <italic toggle=\"yes\">H</italic>\n<sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">C</italic>\n</sub> = 175 Oe, <italic toggle=\"yes\">s</italic> = 1/2, and <italic toggle=\"yes\">g</italic> = <italic toggle=\"yes\">g</italic>\n<sub>\u2225</sub> = 8.8 a value for <italic toggle=\"yes\">zJ</italic>\u2032 of \u22120.4 K is obtained.
