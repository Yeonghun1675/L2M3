In 1a, the Mn3 SBUs align along the c axis and are mutually interconnected by L4- linkers with a short distance (7.0 \u00c5) between two nearest neighboring clusters. Insertion of Co2+ ions in the synthesis of 2 results in linkage of discrete Mn3 clusters in 1a to afford an infinite MnCo chain with a zigzag arrangement along the c axis. One octahedral Co2+ (Co1 and its symmetry equivalents) resides on an inversion center (between the positions of two neighboring Mn3 SBUs in 1a) and is bonded by four carboxylate oxygen atoms from different L4- linkers and two oxygen atoms from aquo ligands. We hypothesize that in order to connect the inserted Co2+ (Co1) and meet the constraints of octahedral geometry, the carboxylate groups coordinated to two nearby terminal Mn2+ ions (Mn2 and Mn2A) of the Mn3 SBUs in 1a must change their coordination modes with a high degree of cooperativity: the chelating carboxylate groups change to bridging mode, the chelating/bridging carboxylate groups change to \u03bc3-\u03b72:\u03b71-bridging mode, and the bridging carboxylate groups remain the same (Figure ). This would mean that the terminal octahedral Mn2+ ions of the Mn3 SBUs in 1a would become four-coordinate with tetrahedral geometry prior to displacement by the Co2+ (Co2 and Co2A) ions. This theory is based on the short Co-O bond lengths evident in 2 (four Co2-O bonds in the range 1.950-2.043 \u00c5).

The 3D framework of 1a can be viewed as discrete 2D layers interconnected by the carboxylate groups coordinated to the terminal Mn2+ cations (Mn2 and Mn2A) of the Mn3 SBUs in a chelating coordination mode. The distance between neighboring layers is 11.664 \u00c5. We hypothesize that the chelating carboxylate groups in 1a are cleaved from the terminal Mn2+ cations and that two proximal (now unbound) carboxylate groups coordinate to an inserted Ni2+ cation (Ni1). These would be located at apical positions, with ligated solvent molecules occupying the equatorial plane of the resulting octahedral geometry. In addition, each terminal Mn2+ of the Mn3 SBU (with 85% probability) in 1a is displaced by a Ni2+ ion, with two aquo ligands replacing the cleaved chelating carboxylate group to maintain an octahedral geometry. The overall result of this process would be the trimetallic NiMnNi cluster as the SBU of 3. It is noted that to accommodate the insertion of Ni2+ between the 2D layers of 1a, these layers are pushed ~5 \u00c5 further apart in 3, a feature directed by a conformational change in the L4- linker. As a result, the a axis of 3 is significantly longer than that of 1a, with an overall expansion of 33% upon SC-SC transformation. It is worth mentioning that attempts to synthesize 2 and 3 by conventional means (by combining mixed metal salts) failed, indicating that cation-insertion-induced SC-SC transformations represent a feasible method for the generation of new coordination compounds from anionic MOFs constructed with flexible ligands.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 8, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig3\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Crystallographic views of framework structures of (top) <bold>1a</bold> and (bottom) <bold>3</bold> along the <italic toggle=\"yes\">b</italic> crystal\naxis (C, gray; O, red; Mn, cyan; Ni, green).
