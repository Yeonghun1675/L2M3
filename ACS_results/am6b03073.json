The asymmetric unit contains only one-fourth of the formula unit due to different crystallographic symmetries present in this structure. The four pyridyl groups of the ligand are bonded to four \"CuCl2\" units, so Cu2 has a distorted octahedral coordination geometry with a CuCl2N4 core as opposed to the Cu1 atom occupying the center of the ligand [see the Supporting Information (SI), Figure S1a]. The pyridyl nitrogen atoms form a square node, and nitrogen atoms of the octahedral Cu2 also form another square node. These squares are nicely translated along the [1\u03051\u03050] axis, but due to streric hindrance, they were twisted by 90\u00b0 along the c-axis, as shown in the SI (Figure S1b). This connectivity yields a three-dimensional network structure (SI, Figure S1c) with the well-known cds topology. The 3D structure is non-interpenetrated due to bulky panels. The total potential solvent area volume as calculated by PLATON is 2303.5 \u00c53 without the guest solvents, which is 63.6% of the unit cell volume of 3619.7(5) \u00c53. The calculated density of the crystal without the guest solvents is 0.747 g cm-3. The refinement of as-synthesized 3D MOF (Figure S3), FT-IR spectra (Figure S4), and EPR spectra (Figure S5) are shown in the SI. The pores of 1 are filled with guest solvent molecules, which can be exchanged with MeOH. Moreover, the structure retains its crystallinity after removal of all the guest solvents, as confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction pattern (PXRD) (SI, Figure S2).\n\nThe \u03c7M -1 versus T plots of 1-3 shown in b were characterized by a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. Due to the presence of unpaired spin, 1 exhibits paramagnetic properties, with the highest magnetic moment among the three samples in the range from 2 to 400 K. The value of effective magnetic moment per molecule (\u03bceff) is 1.73 \u03bcB, a typical value of a single uncoupled copper ion (1.73 \u03bcB, g = 2). The Curie constant of 1 is 0.557 emu K mol-1 and the measured data agrees well with Curie-Weiss fitting, as illustrated in the inset of b.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "5,10,15,20-tetra-4-pyridyl-21H,23H-porphine", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "[Cu(TPyP)CuCl2]\u22c52.5TCE\u22c57H2O"}, "crystal system": [{"value": "tetragonal", "condition": ""}], "space group": [{"value": "P42212", "condition": "Z = 4"}], "topology": [{"value": "cds", "condition": "three-dimensional network structure"}], "density": [{"value": "0.747", "unit": "g/cm^3", "condition": "without the guest solvents"}], "magnetic moment": [{"value": "1.73", "unit": "\u03bcB", "temperature": "2 to 400 K", "condition": "paramagnetic properties"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["crystal_system", "space_group", "topology", "density", "magnetic_moment"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['crystal_system', 'space_group', 'topology', 'density', 'magnetic_moment']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"5,10,15,20-tetra-4-pyridyl-21H,23H-porphine\",\n            \"symbol\": \"1\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"[Cu(TPyP)CuCl2]\u22c52.5TCE\u22c57H2O\"\n        },\n        \"crystal system\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"tetragonal\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"space group\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"P42212\",\n                \"condition\": \"Z = 4\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"topology\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"cds\",\n                \"condition\": \"three-dimensional network structure\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"density\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"0.747\",\n                \"unit\": \"g/cm^3\",\n                \"condition\": \"without the guest solvents\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"magnetic moment\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"1.73\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u03bcB\",\n                \"temperature\": \"2 to 400 K\",\n                \"condition\": \"paramagnetic properties\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 6, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Schematic\nrepresentation of the preparation of the Cu\u2013porphyrin\nMOFs <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"am-2016-03073z_0006.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Schematic representation of the preparation of the Cu-porphyrin MOFs 1 and 2.
