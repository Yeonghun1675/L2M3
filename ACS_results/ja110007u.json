Thus, the change in the magnetism sensitively occurs with the N\u2212I phase transitions.</p>", "clean_text": "The change in the magnetic state accompanying the N-I phase transition is one of the most important features of this system because the variety of utilizable spins and their strong magnetic correlations even at low magnetic fields confer an advantage on such a covalently bonded system based on transition-metal complexes. This is in sharp contrast to the case of mixed stack organic systems, where the antiferromagnetic interactions between neighboring quantum spins often causes dimerization to form spin-singlet pairs. In the present system, a new strongly coupled spin set is generated in the I state (S = 3/2 for [Ru2 II,III]+ and S = 1/2 for DMDCNQI\u22c5-) from the paramagnetic N state with a sole contribution from the [Ru2 II,II] species with S = 1. It should be noted here that no structural evidence for dimerization was found, possibly due to the covalent bonding in the chains. In accordance with the stepwise N-I transitions, the magnetic susceptibility (\u03c7), which has a typical value of 3.07 \u00d7 10-3 cm3 mol-1 (\u03c7T = 0.921 cm3 K mol-1) at 300 K due to the nature of the isolated [Ru2 II,II] species, exhibited anomalies at T 1 and T 2 and ultimately increased due to a ferrimagnetic arrangement of the generated spins with a decrease in T (Figure ). No \u03c7 peak was observed down to 1.8 K even in applied fields of 3-1000 Oe (Figure S2, ), and \u03c7T did not show a minimum. Nevertheless, the saturated magnetization (M s = 1.3 \u03bcB) at 7 T in a M vs H plot at 1.8 K confirms that there is an intrachain ferrimagnetic arrangement (Figure  and Figure S3, ), indicating the presence of a strong 1-D correlation just below T 2. The M s value, which is smaller than the expected value of 2 \u03bcB with g = 2.0, was attributed to strong magnetic anisotropy of [Ru2 II,III]+ unit, which has been observed in [Ru2]2TCNQ systems (zero-field splitting parameter D ~ 60-70 cm-1 in [Ru2 II,III]+ with S = 3/2). Though the presence of large anisotropy in a 1-D system makes it difficult to evaluate accurately the magnitude of the intrachain exchange coupling, simulation of the \u03c7T vs T curve using an alternating chain model with Si  = 3/2 and S  i+1 = 1/2 in the Hamiltonian  H = - 2 J   \u2211   i = 1   N     s\u20d7   i   \u22c5   s\u20d7   i + 1     afforded a large antiferromagnetic exchange parameter (J/k B) of ca. -169 K with g rad = 2.0 (fixed) and g Ru = 1.94 in the T range of 50-190 K (solid red line in Figure ).
