The anionic [Ag6(mna)6]6- cluster binds with the Ca2+ ions through the carboxylate oxygen atoms.

This connectivity leads to a two-dimensional layer.

This bonding gives rise to a \u03bc8-\u03b72:\u03b72:\u03b71:\u03b71:\u03b71:\u03b71 binding mode (a). The three strontium atoms exhibit differences in their coordination environment. Thus, Sr(1) is coordinated by five carboxylate oxygen atoms (O1, O2, O2(#1), O4, O11) and three coordinated water molecules (O13, O14, O15) forming a distorted square antiprismatic geometry (Supporting Information, Figure S7a); Sr(2) is coordinated by one carboxylate oxygen (O10) and six coordinated water molecules (O16-O21) of which two are bridging (\u03bc2-H2O, O16, O17) forming a monocapped trigonal prismatic geometry (Supporting Information, Figure S7b); and Sr(3) binds with six carboxylate oxygen atoms (O5, O7, O8, O8(#2), O9, O10), two bridging water molecules (O16, O17) and one terminal coordinated water molecule (O22), forming a tricapped trigonal prismatic geometry (Supporting Information, Figure S7c). The observed Sr-O bond distances are in the range of 2.468(2)-2.847(2) \u00c5, (av. 2.742 \u00c5) (Table S1, Supporting Information), which are comparable to those reported before. The strontium connectivity appears to show interesting features. Thus, Sr(1) is connected via two bridging oxygen (O2), forming Sr2 dimers (Supporting Information, Figure S8a). A Sr4 tetramer is formed by the connectivity between Sr(2)-Sr(3) and Sr(3)-Sr(3) (Supporting Information, Figure S8b) through O10, O16, O17, and two O8 bridges, respectively. The Sr-Sr distances are in the range 3.993(4)-4.344(5) \u00c5. The Sr2 and Sr4 units are connected through the [Ag6(mna)6]6- cluster units give rise to a three-dimensionally extended structure (b,c). From a topological point of view, each Sr2 dimer and Sr4 tetramer unit is connected to six [Ag6(mna)6]6- metalloligand, and each metalloligand is connected with three Sr2 and three Sr4 units.
