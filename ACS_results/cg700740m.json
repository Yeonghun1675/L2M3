The slight weight loss of 1.8% for Pr-Zn above 165 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of one lattice-water molecules (calculated 1.6%). Though the removal temperature of free bpe in air is below 300 \u00b0C, the uncoordinated and coordinated bpe in MOFs of both compounds prevent from oxidation below 400 \u00b0C, implying that microporous MOFs can storage organic molecules in higher temperature. A varied-temperature PXRD of Pr-Zn was performed. The result exhibits that the departure of the guest water molecules does not lead to any phase transformation and the coordination network of Pr-Zn nearly remains the same (see the ). We further performed the following experiments: (i) dehydration: the crystal sample of Pr-Zn was heated at 200 \u00b0C until the full weight loss of water molecules and the IR peak at 3419 cm-1 disappeared, which shows that the dehydration was completed; (ii) rehydration: the dehydrated samples were exposed to water vapor for about 24 h, and then IR and TGA measurements were performed (IR appears 3419 cm-1 band, TGA weight loss is similar with the original Pr-Zn, which suggested that the rehydration had been completed. We can conclude that Pr-Zn has potential use as microporous materials.\n\nInformative magnetic susceptibility measurements of Mn-Zn have been performed on a Quantum Design MPMS-5S superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer in the 2-300 K temperature range. The diamagnetic correction was evaluated by using Pascal's constants. The room temperature \u03bceff value of 7.31 \u03bcB is slightly larger than the value of 7.25 \u03bcB, that is, the spin-only value expected for Mn1.5Zn3 units with isotropic g = 2.0. As the temperature decreases, the value of \u03bceff increases to 7.54 \u03bcB at 80 K, implying weak ferromagnetic interactions. Below this temperature it decreases to the minimum of 6.87 \u03bcB at 2 K. The Curie-Weiss fit gives a C value of 6.48 emu K mol-1 and a \u03b8 value of 0.32 K (in the temperature range 2-300 K), confirming very weak ferromagnetic interactions in Mn-Zn.
