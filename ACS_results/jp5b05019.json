We used the following procedure to determine this ratio. First of all, it is known that the EPR signal intensity I is proportional to the magnetic susceptibility \u03c7, that is, I = K\u03c7, where K is a function of the quality and the filling factors of the resonator as well as the mw power. Second, it is justified to assume that K is the same for the mononuclear and dinuclear Cu2+ centers. However, the temperature dependence of \u03c7 of these two species differs significantly. The susceptibility of mononuclear Cu2+ centers \u03c7M at relatively high temperatures obeys the Currie law  2      \u03c7   M   =     N   M     4        \u03b2   e    2      g   M    2       k   B   T     where N M and g M denote the number and effective g value of mononuclear Cu2+ centers, respectively. In contrast, in the case of Cu/Cu PW units, it is governed by the Bleaney-Bowers equation  3      \u03c7   PW   = 2   N   PW        \u03b2   e    2      g   PW    2       k   B   T     [ 3 + exp  (   - J     k   B   T   )  ]   - 1     Here, J is the exchange coupling constant (exchange Hamiltonian     H    = -JS 1 S 2), which was determined in a previous report to be -278 cm-1. N PW and g PW are the number and g value of Cu/Cu PWs, respectively. Finally, neglecting small differences between the g values for both species, one obtains the following expression for the ratio between EPR signal intensities of mononuclear and dinuclear species: 4        I   M       I   PW     =     \u03c7   M       \u03c7   PW     =   1   8   \u2061     N   M       N   PW      [ 3 + exp  (   - J     k   B   T   )  ]    Thus, if J is known, then one can estimate the ratio N M/N PW just by measuring a single spectrum. In our case, the spectrum was measured at Q-band frequency and at T = 295 K (). The higher spectrometer frequency allowed us to obtain the complete fine structure pattern of the S = 1 state of the Cu/Cu PW units. The intensities I PW and I M were determined by double integration of the simulated signals shown in c and d, respectively.
