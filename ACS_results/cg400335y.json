Na2MoO4\u22c52H2O (730 mg, 2.97 mmol) was added to the solution, and the pH was readjusted to 4.5 with HClO4 (2%). Cr(NO3)3 (120 mg, 0.50 mmol) in 10 mL of water was added to the solution, after which AgClO4 (338 mg, 1.50 mmol) was added in 15 mL of water. A yellow solid precipitated, which was filtered off twice through 2 \u03bcm porosity filter. The yellow solid (160 mg) could not be identified by powder XRD and was discarded. A rose-colored crystalline product precipitated within a week; the mother liquor was filtered off through a Bu\u0308chner funnel with suction. Yield: 430 mg (0.25 mmol, 50%).

The pH was adjusted to 4.5 and the solid was dissolved upon mild heating. AgClO4 (31 mg, 0.15 mmol) in 1.5 mL of water was added to the reaction mixture. After three weeks and several cycles of filtration, one yellow crystal was obtained of sufficient quality for a single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurement.
