Selected bond lengths and angles for compounds <bold>1</bold>, <bold>2</bold>, and <bold>3</bold> are listed in the , respectively. Compound <bold>1</bold> crystallizes in 2D layers, which consist of uranium\u2212oxygen pentagonal bipyramids and NDC spacers lying on general positions (Figure ). Each uranium atom is bound axially to two uranyl oxygen atoms at an average distance of 1.759 \u00c5 to form the linear UO<sub>2</sub>\n<sup>2+</sup>cation. Equatorially, the uranyl cation is chelated to one carboxylate group and bound to three others in a monodentate mode, with an average U\u2212O separation of 2.387 \u00c5. Two distinct NDC linkers are observed within <bold>1</bold>. One bridges two adjacent uranium\u2212oxygen pentagonal bipyramids into a pair through one carboxylate group, and connects to another through one oxygen donor in the other carboxylate group, leaving one oxygen donor unbound. The other one exhibits a chelating mode for both functional groups. The overall structure may be described as layers formed through cross-linking of uranyl\u2013NDC double chains parallel to the <italic toggle=\"yes\">a</italic> axis (Figure a). The chains consist of alternate uranium\u2212oxygen pentagonal bipyramid pairs and double bridging NDC linkers. All NDC linkers in the chains adopt a similar coordination fashion. Each double NDC linker connects two adjacent pairs, with three binding positions for each pair. The chelating NDC molecules, on the other hand, cross-link adjacent double chains into infinite layers. Consequently, within the layers, eight-membered apertures are generated by every four uranium\u2212oxygen bipyramids, two chelating NDC and two bridging NDC ligands, with dimensions of 3.1 \u00d7 6.5 \u00c5 (defined by the shortest O\u2212O contacts). In each layer, the naphthalene rings extend on the same side, and therefore, operated against the inversion center, the layers are packed face to face (the naphthalene side) and back to back (the other side) alternately. The interlayer separation is about 8.0 \u00c5 for the face to face layers and 4.8 \u00c5 for the back to back layers (between the planes defined by uranium atoms), respectively (Figure b). The apertures, on the other hand, are packed into 1D channels along the [-110] direction, in which the partially protonated 4,4\u2032-bipy species (three protons for every two 4,4\u2032-bipy molecules) are located and interact with the NDC naphthalene rings through face-to-edge \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking (Figure ). Face-to-face \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking is also found between the adjacent bridging NDC ligands within the same layer. Although different from the channels in 3D porous materials in topology, the channels in packed layered compounds sometimes are still able to be evacuated to accommodate guest molecules. However, possibly owing to the electrostatic interactions and the relative strong \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking between the 4,4\u2032-bipy species and frameworks (approximately 3.3 \u00c5 separation between the rings in contact), removal of the 4,4\u2032-bipy species from the channels in compound <bold>1</bold> was not successful.</p>", "clean_text": "Results and Discussion\n\nThe crystallographic refinement results are summarized in Table . Selected bond lengths and angles for compounds 1, 2, and 3 are listed in the , respectively. Compound 1 crystallizes in 2D layers, which consist of uranium-oxygen pentagonal bipyramids and NDC spacers lying on general positions (Figure ). Each uranium atom is bound axially to two uranyl oxygen atoms at an average distance of 1.759 \u00c5 to form the linear UO2 2+cation. Equatorially, the uranyl cation is chelated to one carboxylate group and bound to three others in a monodentate mode, with an average U-O separation of 2.387 \u00c5. Two distinct NDC linkers are observed within 1. One bridges two adjacent uranium-oxygen pentagonal bipyramids into a pair through one carboxylate group, and connects to another through one oxygen donor in the other carboxylate group, leaving one oxygen donor unbound. The other one exhibits a chelating mode for both functional groups. The overall structure may be described as layers formed through cross-linking of uranyl-NDC double chains parallel to the a axis (Figure a). The chains consist of alternate uranium-oxygen pentagonal bipyramid pairs and double bridging NDC linkers. All NDC linkers in the chains adopt a similar coordination fashion. Each double NDC linker connects two adjacent pairs, with three binding positions for each pair. The chelating NDC molecules, on the other hand, cross-link adjacent double chains into infinite layers. Consequently, within the layers, eight-membered apertures are generated by every four uranium-oxygen bipyramids, two chelating NDC and two bridging NDC ligands, with dimensions of 3.1 \u00d7 6.5 \u00c5 (defined by the shortest O-O contacts). In each layer, the naphthalene rings extend on the same side, and therefore, operated against the inversion center, the layers are packed face to face (the naphthalene side) and back to back (the other side) alternately. The interlayer separation is about 8.0 \u00c5 for the face to face layers and 4.8 \u00c5 for the back to back layers (between the planes defined by uranium atoms), respectively (Figure b). The apertures, on the other hand, are packed into 1D channels along the [-110] direction, in which the partially protonated 4,4'-bipy species (three protons for every two 4,4'-bipy molecules) are located and interact with the NDC naphthalene rings through face-to-edge \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking (Figure ). Face-to-face \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking is also found between the adjacent bridging NDC ligands within the same layer. Although different from the channels in 3D porous materials in topology, the channels in packed layered compounds sometimes are still able to be evacuated to accommodate guest molecules. However, possibly owing to the electrostatic interactions and the relative strong \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking between the 4,4'-bipy species and frameworks (approximately 3.3 \u00c5 separation between the rings in contact), removal of the 4,4'-bipy species from the channels in compound 1 was not successful.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}},

Within the hexagonal bipyramidal coordination sphere of uranium, there are two distinct types of oxygens. The terminal oxygens are bonded to the uranium atom from axial directions, with an average U\u2212O separation of 1.752 \u00c5.

Three types of oxygens are observed within the tetramer: six uranyl oxygens (average U\u2212O separation: 1.772 \u00c5), twelve carboxylate oxygens from six carboxylate groups (average U\u2212O separation: 2.462 \u00c5), and two \u03bc<sub>3</sub>-oxygens (average U\u2212O separation: 2.250 \u00c5).

However, the formation of the RhB-associated photoexcited uranyl centers is slow, and if the O2 concentration continues to rise, the amount of RhB molecules that are associated with the excited uranyl units is not sufficient to react with the O2 (and/or H2O2, O2 -, etc.) present in the system. As a result, the decrease rate of the RhB concentration monitored through UV/vis spectroscopy is not linearly proportional to, but lags behind the rise of the oxygen concentration in the reaction system.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 32, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig12\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>12</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Degradation rate of RhB versus oxygen content in the bubbling gas and the fit of the plot.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr13\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2008-00109y_0012.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 12  Degradation rate of RhB versus oxygen content in the bubbling gas and the fit of the plot.
