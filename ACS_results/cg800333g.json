The temperature dependence of \u03c7m T is shown in Figure . The \u03c7m T value at room temperature is 3.91 cm3 K mol-1 lower than the spin-only value of 4.37 cm3 K mol-1 for one high-spin MnII ions (g = 2, S = 5/2) assuming no magnetic interaction, indicating antiferromagnetic coupling of compound 1, which is confirmed by the continuous decrease of \u03c7m T value to 0.11 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K. We fitted the experimental susceptibility using the classical spin Heisenberg model for a one-dimensional chain (eq ).  1       \u03c7   chain   =   N   g   2     \u03b2   2   S ( S + 1 )   3 k T      1 + u   1 - u       where      u = coth  [    J S ( S + 1 )   k T    ]  -  [    k T   J S ( S + 1 )    ]   S = 5/2     J is the parameter of exchange interaction between two Mn(II) ions bridged by the carboxylato-oxygen atoms. On the basis of the structural information, an additional coupling parameter, zj', was added in eq  to take into account the magnetic behavior through hydrogen-bonding interaction between the Mn-carboxylate chains. The total magnetic susceptibility is  2       \u03c7   m   =     \u03c7   chain     1 - ( 2 z j \u02bc / N   g   2     \u03b2   2   )   \u03c7   chain         The least-squares fitting of magnetic susceptibilities data led to J = -1.44 cm-1, g = 1.98, zj' = -0.024 cm-1, and R = 1 \u00d7 10-4 (the agreement factor defined as R = \u03a3[(\u03c7m)obsd - (\u03c7m)calcd]2/\u03a3[(\u03c7m)obsd]2. The J value is comparable to other Mn(II) species with similar carboxylate bridges and well-confirms the antiferromagnetic coupling between Mn(II) centers. This conclusion is consistent with the crystal structure of 1, where the exchange pathways between neighboring magnetic centers involve bidentate and monodentate carboxylate bridges and the angle of Mn-O-Mn relative to monodentate carboxylate bridge is 115.99(9)\u00b0. The results presented above conclude that the combination of two carboxylate groups in Hbidc2- favor magnetic exchange of metal centers.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 13, "type": "text", "classification": ["property"], "content": "<p>Another important feature of <bold>1</bold> is the strong long-lived red luminescence.
