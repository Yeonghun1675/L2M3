We have shown in our earlier work that POM based ionic salts could be used as H2 and CO2 storage materials. The as-synthesized sample of Cu2V4O16-2D was immersed in dry chloroform at ambient temperature for 72 h, evacuated at ambient temperature for 24 h, and then evacuated at an elevated temperature (85 \u00b0C) for 48 h. The sample thus obtained was optimally evacuated, as evidenced by their well-maintained PXRD patterns and the long plateau (ambient temperature to 300 \u00b0C) in their TGA traces. The H2 adsorption isotherm exhibits type-II sorption behavior. At 760 Torr and 77 K, Cu2V4O16-2D adsorbs 0.37 wt % H2. The framework of Cu2V4O16-2D exhibits a typical type-II profile for CO2 (3.4 \u00c5) adsorption. Cu2V4O16-2D adsorbs 1.01 mmol/g of CO2 at 298 K and 1 bar pressure (Figure c).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 10, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) SEM image of the bulk material showing\nboth flower- and needle-like\nmorphologies.
