The 1D channels of the 3D networks are filled with solvent molecules. SC-SC transformation confirms the channels are retained after the removal of the solvents. The desolvated compounds exhibited fast and reversible iodine uptake with visible color change, and the uptake increased with temperature due to the channel expansion upon heating, which demonstrates that these compounds are dynamic and exhibit elastic guest accommodations. Iodine loaded crystals showed 80 times higher electrical conductivity compared to the guest free ones; even the capsuled iodine was arranged with disorder in the irregular channels.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 36, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Crystallographic data\nin CIF format, and additional plots and data for the complexes in\nPDF format.
