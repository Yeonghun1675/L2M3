In the silver(I) complexes reported here, all the coordination sites of the metals involved in the closed cages are occupied solely by the ligand. In the case of 2 these design features lead to an unusually stable, nonlabile inclusion compound. By using the potentially tridentate tris(pyrazolyl)methane units as the bonding groups, any exits from the trigonal prismatic cages are \"blocked\" (see Figure c), causing the central acetonitrile to be tightly held so that it does not exchange in solution with acetonitrile outside the cage even over a period of weeks or be driven off in the solid phase below 200 \u00b0C. This strong retention of the inclusion molecule  appears to be unique for metallacage complexes. Complex 2 also represent a rare example of the formation of a cage without requiring the template effect of a central anion. The 2D structure of the silver complex with the hexatopic ligand L2 supports the stability argument of the M3L2 trigonal prismatic cages that form with the encapsulated acetonitrile molecule and represent a new supramolecular motif, at the interface between the assembly of discrete M x L y  supermolecules and of coordination polymers. Switching from silver(I), a metal that prefers low coordination numbers, to cadmium(II), a metal that strongly prefers octahedral coordination, changes the structure from the closed caged type arrangement observed with 2 and 3 to the open cage structure of 1. These structural variations demonstrate that these semiflexible ligands provide the opportunity to adjust supramolecular architectures by changing the bonding preferences of the metal.
