Meanwhile, 84% and 76% of theoretical capacity were obtained for the rates of C/10 and C/5, respectively. b shows the capacity retention for the first 30 cycles at a rate of 10 mA g-1. It can be seen that the capacity increases slightly over the first few cycles, before stabilizing. The increase of capacity is probably a result of an electrochemical grinding effect resulting in improved electronic conductivity in the electrode. This is supported by a progressive reduction in the cell polarization as a function of cycle number as shown by load curves (Figure S2). Similar phenomena have been observed in several other electrode materials. After 25 cycles, the discharge capacity remained at 100 mA h g-1, corresponding to exchange of 1.7 Na+ ions per formula unit, with a Coulombic efficiency approaching 100%. The initial charge-discharge curve is rather smooth without obvious plateaus. After 25 cycles, well-defined processes become apparent, clearly displaying three plateaus at 2.9, 3.3, and 3.6 V, as illustrated in c. Such a phenomenon is quite common in battery materials, where although there may only be a single cation site several plateaus are observed. This can arise from a variety of reasons such as vacancy or charge ordering. Examples include LiMn2O4 and LiCoPO4. In this case it appears that the plateaus at 3.3 and 3.6 V have this origin, being approximately half the length of that at 2.9 V.

For comparison, Li migration in the Li analog, Li2Fe2(C2O4)3\u22c52H2O, was studied in the same manner, and the barrier was estimated to be 0.41 (along 1-2-3) or 1.05 (along 4-1) eV.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 26, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig7\" position=\"float\">\n<label>7</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Possible Na migration paths in Na<sub>2</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>(C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>\u00b72H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr7\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cm-2017-027649_0007.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 7  Possible Na migration paths in Na2Fe2(C2O4)3\u22c52H2O.
