In addition, the binding energy of S2p does not change (c), implying that the S atom from the free thioether bond may not be involved in the coordination interaction with Tb3+. Hence, after the posttreatment, the product emits a distinctive green luminescence that can be attributed to the N atom from free triazinyl nitrogen coordinating with Tb3+, which can significantly increase energy transfer from the L3- ligand to the trivalent Tb centers, resulting in a characteristic emission of the Tb3+ ions.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 27, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig6\" position=\"float\">\n<label>6</label>\n<caption>\n<p>XPS spectra of as-prepared Zn-MOF, Tb@Zn-MOF,\nand PO<sub>4</sub>\n<sup>3\u2013</sup>/Tb@Zn-MOF: (a) survey spectrum;\nspectra of (b) N<sub>1s</sub>, (c) S<sub>2p</sub>, and (d) Tb<sub>3d</sub>.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr6\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2018-00313h_0006.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 6  XPS spectra of as-prepared Zn-MOF, Tb@Zn-MOF, and PO4 3-/Tb@Zn-MOF: (a) survey spectrum; spectra of (b) N1s, (c) S2p, and (d) Tb3d.
