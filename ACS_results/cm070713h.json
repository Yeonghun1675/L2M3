The AF interactions between the spins (nearest interactions only) in such polygons compete with each other and cannot be completely satisfied. For an infinite lattice this geometric frustration might result in a very large number of ground states with similar energies that can exist simultaneously. Thus, the frustration of the spins tends to prevent establishment of long-range magnetic order, even at very low temperatures, and often leads to observation of novel low-temperature magnetic phenomena such as spin-glasses, spin-liquids, and spin-ice. The theoretical parameter F c = -1/(1 - p), where p is the number of spins in a cluster, has been proposed in order to rank the geometric frustration of different lattices. For example, F c is -1 for a nonfrustrated lattice and -0.5 for triangular and Kagome lattices.

For example, the interlayer distance in the jarosite compounds AFe3(SO4)2(OH)6 with Kagome lattices and f > 10 is about 6 \u00c5, it is 8 \u00c5 in the triangular lattices of AM(SO4)2 (f = 6-10), and about 13 \u00c5 in (4,4\u2018-bpy)Cu3(OH)2(MoO4)2 (f = 19.4) and Co(N3)2(bpg)(DMF)4/3 (f = 10) with complex layer structures. The interlayer magnetic exchange through dipole-dipole interactions (which increases with the magnitude of the spin) and/or through hydrogen bonding does play an undeniable role in these frustrated systems and leads to magnetic long-range ordering in all of them.
