The original mmt which owns three adjacent nitrogen donors can bridge two silver units which can be regarded as an edge of a cluster. Further coordination of metal cations to the edge may destabilize the charge balance and eventually it is a disadvantage for cluster formation. We designed a modified mmt ligand by inserting a methylene chain between two mmt ligands. Each mmt unit can bridge adjacent silver cations to form a corner of a trinuclear silver cluster and the -(CH2) n - chain support the trinuclear silver unit from the outside of the corner keeping \"L\" shape. To evaluate the best -(CH2) n - length for the cluster formation, we examined three types of chain lengths from two to four -CH2- units.
