MIL-88B(2OH) shows no significant porosity, since its lower thermal stability rules out its proper activation before its framework alteration. Noteworthy, the presence of residual molecules in the pores, associated with a partial activation, leads to a permanent porosity. For instance, after washing MIL-88B(CH<sub>3</sub>) with DMF and a calcination in air at 200 \u00b0C, a higher surface area (<italic toggle=\"yes\">S</italic>\n<sub>BET</sub> = 350 m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup>) is observed compared to the properly purified solid (washed with DMF, followed by an exchange with EtOH and then heated at 150 \u00b0C; <italic toggle=\"yes\">S</italic>\n<sub>BET</sub> = 80 m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup>) (see Figures  and S21). This is likely to be due to the presence of remaining DMF still trapped in specific pockets that blocks partially the pore contraction and thus leads to a higher pore opening. This is supported by XRPD analysis of the poorly activated sample for which the unit cell parameters are <italic toggle=\"yes\">a</italic> \u2248 11.8 \u00c5, <italic toggle=\"yes\">c</italic> \u2248 18.6 \u00c5, and <italic toggle=\"yes\">V</italic> \u2248 2400 \u00c5<sup>3</sup> (see Figure S21) vs <italic toggle=\"yes\">a</italic> \u2248 9.3 \u00c5, <italic toggle=\"yes\">c</italic> \u2248 19.1 \u00c5, and <italic toggle=\"yes\">V</italic> \u2248 1630 \u00c5<sup>3</sup> for the properly activated sample. The theoretical surface area for the well activated sample is equal to 180 m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup>, while the one of the partially activated sample, not taking into account the presence of residual guest species, varies between 200 and 450 m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup> depending on the presence or not of the coordinated water molecules on the trimers upon activation (see below for further information about coordinated water and the  for more details about the calculations). Likely, the observed experimental BET surface area corresponds to a partial removal of the coordinated water. Similarly, the same feature might occur in the case of other MIL-88 structures reported previously.

While the MIL-88B(H, Cl, Br, NH2, NO2, 2OH) solids do not exhibit any significant surface area (S BET < 30 m2\u22c5g-1), the 4F, CH3, 2CH3, 4CH3, and 2CF3 MIL-88B forms show a permanent porosity with type I isotherms, indicating a rigid behavior toward adsorption of nitrogen with BET surface area of approximately 30, 80, 60, 1220, and 330 m2\u22c5g-1, respectively. The hindrance of the monosubstituted MIL-88B is generally not enough to maintain a sufficient pore opening for gases. MIL-88B(2OH) shows no significant porosity, since its lower thermal stability rules out its proper activation before its framework alteration. Noteworthy, the presence of residual molecules in the pores, associated with a partial activation, leads to a permanent porosity. For instance, after washing MIL-88B(CH3) with DMF and a calcination in air at 200 \u00b0C, a higher surface area (S BET = 350 m2\u22c5g-1) is observed compared to the properly purified solid (washed with DMF, followed by an exchange with EtOH and then heated at 150 \u00b0C; S BET = 80 m2\u22c5g-1) (see Figures  and S21). This is likely to be due to the presence of remaining DMF still trapped in specific pockets that blocks partially the pore contraction and thus leads to a higher pore opening. This is supported by XRPD analysis of the poorly activated sample for which the unit cell parameters are a ~ 11.8 \u00c5, c ~ 18.6 \u00c5, and V ~ 2400 \u00c53 (see Figure S21) vs a ~ 9.3 \u00c5, c ~ 19.1 \u00c5, and V ~ 1630 \u00c53 for the properly activated sample. The theoretical surface area for the well activated sample is equal to 180 m2\u22c5g-1, while the one of the partially activated sample, not taking into account the presence of residual guest species, varies between 200 and 450 m2\u22c5g-1 depending on the presence or not of the coordinated water molecules on the trimers upon activation (see below for further information about coordinated water and the  for more details about the calculations). Likely, the observed experimental BET surface area corresponds to a partial removal of the coordinated water. Similarly, the same feature might occur in the case of other MIL-88 structures reported previously. One could cite the iron(III) tetrafluoroterephthalate [Fe3O(F4BDC)3(H2O)3(DMF)3.5] or MIL-88B-4F or the scandium terephthalate [Sc3O(BDC)3(H2O)3\u22c5Cl0.5(OH)0.5(DMF)4(H2O)3] or MIL-88B(Sc). Both exhibit a significant nitrogen accessible porosity with surface areas of 635 (S Langmuir) and 634 m2\u22c5g-1 (S BET), respectively, while very low surface areas are obtained for the properly activated MIL-88B-4F and MIL-88B samples.\n\nFor the 4CH3 analogue, the experimental BET surface area of the fully activated sample reaches 1216 m2\u22c5g-1, which is close to the theoretical surface
