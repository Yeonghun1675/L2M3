Diamagnetic Cu(I) and Ag(I) [M(Rpytri)2]+ complexes have both previously been reported. Despite the normative preference of Ag(I) for tetrahedral geometry over square planar, it has shown a tendency to adopt a head-to-tail square planar geometry with bispyridyl-triazoles. In contrast, previously reported four-coordinate Rpytri Cu(I) complexes have consistently demonstrated tetrahedral geometry, both crystallographically and through DFT calculations. [Cu2Pt2(L)4]6+ macrocycles have previously been reported, but only through the use of asymmetric ligands with orthogonal binding sites, in combination with cis-protecting directional bonding strategies at the Pt(II) centers. The addition of [Cu(CH3CN)4](BF4) (1 equiv) to a CH3CN solution [Pt(1b)2](BF4)2 (1 equiv) resulted in the clean formation of a single assembly. The 1H NMR spectrum exhibited a single set of peaks downfield-shifted from free 1b ([Cu(I)] from 1.5 to 8 mM) (f), and DOSY NMR spectra showed that this species was diffusing at a rate similar to the [Pd2Pt2(1b)4]4+ tetramer (, D = 2.80 \u00d7 10-10 m2 s-1) .

The formation of a single discrete architecture rather than an equilibrium mixture seems likely to be due to the tetrahedral Cu(I) \"corners\" favoring the tetramer over larger macrocycles.
