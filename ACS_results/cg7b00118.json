Among them, Cu-paddlewheel shows the best stability and are often combined with polyaromatic carboxylate linkers containing isophthalate moieties to construct permanent porous frameworks with excellent gas molecule storage capacities. For example, three new MOFs (named SDU-6, -7, -8) reported by our group have been successfully prepared from C 3-symmetric carboxylate-linkers with different functional groups (hydroxyl, methyl, and isobutyl) and Cu-paddlewheel SBUs, showing high BET surface areas of 2826, 2713, and 2516 m2 g-1, respectively, after evacuation at 80 \u00b0C overnight. Although different functional groups were incorporated in their networks, they are all constructed by packing of similar nanosized cages and show a unified rht-topology. Similar phenomena have been commonly reported that the decoration of the bridging ligands is not an effective way to produce Cu-paddlewheel based MOFs with diverse topologies and pore structures, such as NOTT-101, -105, -106, -107, -108, and PCN-14. Those MOFs all demonstrated a NbO-type network, although their linkers are decorated with different functional groups. Meanwhile, the construction of unique MOF networks based on one given ligand and Cu-paddlewheel has also been proved to be an unwise way for a thermodynamic stability framework has always been obtained. Those two habits of Cu-paddlewheel based MOFs are great obstacle for the target to get diverse topology network and pore feature.\n\nAs shown in , Cu-UPC-6 and Cu-UPC-8 all exhibit typical type-I isotherms for N2 at 77 K, suggesting the retention of stable microporous structures after the metal-ion metathesis process of crystalline samples. Cu-UPC-6 can adsorb 146 cm3 g-1 of N2 molecules under the conditions of 77 K and 1 atm, which is almost 31.4 times greater than that of UPC-6 (4.65 cm3 g-1). For UPC-8 and Cu-UPC-8, the capacities of adsorption were improved from 2.72 to 164.2 cm3 g-1, which increased about 60.4 times after the metathesis process. These results indicate that the metal-ion metathesis significantly increases the stability and preserves the porosity of the framework. The Langmuir surface area determined by the N2 isotherms, are 598.3 m2 g-1 for Cu-UPC-6 and 689.7 m2 g-1 for Cu-UPC-8, which represents 13120% and 45078% increases, compared to that of UPC-6 (langmuir: 4.56 m2 g-1) and UPC-8 (langemuir: 1.53 m2 g-1).\n\nLow-pressure H2, CO2, and CH4 uptakes of activated samples were continuously monitored using volumetric gas adsorption measurements. As shown in , the activated Cu-UPC-6 and Cu-UPC-8 exhibit classical reversible type I isotherms for CH4 and CO2. The uptakes of CO2 are 74 cm3 g-1 at 273 K and 62.7 cm3 g-1 at 295 K for Cu-UPC-8, which are much higher than those of Cu-UPC-6 (55.1 and 32.3 cm3 g-1, at 273 and 295 K). Under similar conditions at 273 and 295 K, the CH4 adsorption capacities of active Cu-UPC-8 are also higher than Cu-UPC-6. The two complexes contain the same unsaturated Cu-paddlewheel SBUs and \u03c0-electrons of organic ligand, but they possess different pore features: a cage pore for Cu-UPC-6 and a 1D connected pore for Cu-UPC-8. So the most possibe reason for the unique adsorption performance may attributed to the steric hindrance of different pores. To further analyze this effect, the isosteric adsorption enthalpies (Q st) was calculated from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. As shown in e, the Q st plots of CO2 and CH4 on Cu-UPC-6 lie in the range of 25.5-22.8 and 23.7-16.6 kJ mol-1, higher than the average values for Cu-UPC-8 of 10.2 and 8.5 kJ mol-1 (f), respectively. Though the Q st values of Cu-UPC-6 for CO2 and CH4 is about 2.5 times that of Cu-UPC-8, the adsorption capacities are inferior to Cu-UPC-8. The phenomenon may suggest that pore feature is the primary determinant of adsorption performance for the two isomer MOFs. The stronger binding strength between the Cu-UPC-8 framework and gas molecules may be attributed to their constricted pore features, which were also observed by our and other reported works that the constricted pores will possess higher Q st values. The Q st of CH4 on Cu-UPC-6 is comparable to the reported Cu-paddlewheel based cage pore MOFs, such as ZJU-199 (19 kJ mol-1) and MFM-130 (16 kJ mol-1), indicating that the framework of Cu-UPC-6 exhibits high affinity to CH4 molecules.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "SDU-6", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "2826", "unit": "m2/g",
