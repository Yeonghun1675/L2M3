Much attention has been drawn to the rational design of new network topologies, and a variety of extended frameworks has been obtained via the use of polydentate ligands, such as 4,4\u2018-bipyridine and its derivatives, bound to d-block transition metal ions. Recently, a few examples have appeared of lanthanide-based frameworks employing polydentate ligands such as sulfoxides, carboxylates, pyridones and lactams. Although the flexibility of the coordination sphere of lanthanide ions makes design difficult, this pliability or coordinative ambivalence, coupled with the tendency of lanthanides to adopt high coordination numbers, makes the f-block metal ions attractive for the discovery of new and unusual network topologies.
