In the ac layer, the interchain Fe\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Fe distance mediated by 4,4'-bpy along [001] is 11.3951(8) \u00c5, much longer than the intrachain Fe\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Fe distance of 3.8900(3) \u00c5 along [100]. Thus, the interchain interaction J' should be much smaller. Besides, one can consider the Fe-Fe interaction J\" between layers (b). Although a shorter Fe\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Fe distance of 8.0872(4) \u00c5 is found between layers (than that along [001]), the Fe3+ ions are not chemically bonded. Also, the staggered arrangement of chains induces a magnetic frustration. From these considerations, the magnetism of 1 should be well described by the S = 5/2 AFM chains.  shows the temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility for 1 measured up to 350 K. The most notable feature is a very broad maximum centered around T(\u03c7max) = 164 K. Undoubtedly, this broad maximum in the \u03c7-T curve is originated from well-developed spin-spin correlations or short-range order (SRO) along the chain. The high T(\u03c7max) assures fairly strong AFM intrachain interactions. No signature of LRO is seen down to 2 K. A slight increase of \u03c7(T) below 15 K is ascribed to a tiny amount of free paramagnetic spins (at most 0.15% of high-spin Fe3+, Figure S5), referred often as Curie tail. The system is not purely paramagnetic up to 350 K reflecting short-range spin-spin correlations. Upon temperature cooling (Figure S4), the \u03c7T starts to decrease even from 350 K, thereby reinforcing the interpretation that the AFM intrachain interaction is strong. The temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility was fitted by a Fisher classical model of \u03c7 = [Ng 2\u03bcB 2 S(S + 1)/3k B T]\u22c5[(1 + u)/(1 - u)], where g = 2, S = 5/2, u = coth[2JS(S + 1)/k B T] - k B T/2JS(S + 1), and J is defined negative for AFM coupling from the Hamiltonian H = -2J\u2211S  i  S  i+1. As shown in , the best fit to the experimental data between 50 and 350 K gave J/k B = -19.2(1) K, which is close to -16.6 K simply estimated from a relation T(\u03c7max)/(|J|/k B) = 1.12S(S + 1) + 0.10. The agreement between experimental and theoretical curves is reasonably good, particularly at high temperatures.
