There are several literature examples of metal phosphonate structures that have monodeprotonated, metal-coordinated, phosphonate groups. Careful examination of these structures reveals a consistent observation: the P-O bonds, P\ue5fbO, or P-O(-M), of the phosphoryl group are of approximately equal length and shorter than the P-O(H) bond of the protonated oxygen atom.

Dissolution of CaCO3 in the absence of additives proceeds only to 4.2% after 5 days. It was found that PBTC greatly accelerates dissolution rates of CaCO3 achieving quantitative dissolution within 9.5 min. 1,2,3,4-Butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTC) is structurally similar to PBTC in that it possesses four -COOH groups instead of three -COOH and one -PO3H2 groups for PBTC. This structural variation has a profound impact on its dissolution performance. BTC requires 30 min for CaCO3 dissolution, a ~300% increase in dissolution time. EDTA requires approximately the same time as PBTC to dissolve CaCO3. Citric acid achieved CaCO3 dissolution in 8.0 min. At the end of the CaCO3 dissolution experiment by PBTC the working solution is set aside for partial solvent evaporation, followed by crystal formation of [Ca(H3PBTC)(H2O)2\u22c52H2O]. This product was identified by FT-IR spectroscopy. Differences observed in CaCO3 dissolution rates cannot be explained solely on the basis of variations in pK a's between the different acids. Both PBTC and EDTA show comparable CaCO3 dissolution efficiencies and are doubly deprotonated at the pH regions of the dissolution experiment. BTC and citric acid, on the other hand, are monodeprotonated but exhibit dramatically different dissolution rates, with citric acid being 3.75 times faster than BTC.
