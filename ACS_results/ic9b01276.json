A 1H NMR spectrum presented in Figure S6 clearly reveals that the photoreaction produces quantitative yields of 2 with increasing grinding time. This indicates that the molecular movements of ladders were reinforced by the mechanical motion. The driving force for these large internal molecular movements is expected due to the establishment of strong molecular interactions within the crystal. Initially, each of these ladder structures contains three repeated aligned bpe ligands, which is derived from \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 stacking of the pyridyl rings that produce four \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions in total for the three aligned bpe, one between each two pyridyl rings after mechanical grinding. Moreover, adjacent ladder structures are held together by two kinds of hydrogen bonding such as O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5N and O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bonds as discussed earlier. When crystals are ground, the adjacent ladder structures likely slide to opposite directions and alignment of bpe ligands between the strands might occur.
