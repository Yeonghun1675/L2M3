This is not surprising, as the parent MOF crystals exhibited a clear compositional gradient, with internal and external areas being rich in zinc or cobalt, respectively (Figures S28A-C). Similarly, calcination of binary systems composed of zinc and calcium also resulted in formation of wurtzite oxide, and in the cases where there is a larger amount of calcium in the MOF, the presence of fluorite was also detected (Figures S18G-H and S28D-E). Calcination of the MOF formed from Zn:Mn 1:1 molar code resulted in a mixture of phases containing hetaerolite (tetragonal) and spinel (cubic) type oxides as major phases, as well as traces of other crystalline phases that could not be unambiguously identified (Figure S15F).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 23, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Ternary Zn:Mn:Co, Zn:Mn:Ca, and Mn:Co:Ca\nSystems</title><p>Alternatively,\nthe calcination of ternary multimetal MOFs including zinc, manganese,\nand cobalt resulted in the formation of spinel-type oxides.
