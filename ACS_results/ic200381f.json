On the basis of the Cu-compound, Seki et al. proposed the structure model in 2001. The tetragonal structure was later refined from single crystal XRD data of the isoreticular Zn-based compound. A Zn-based polymorph of this MOF with a trigonal framework (Kagome\u0301 net topology) was first synthesized by Chun et al. in a ternary solvent system. The polymorph formation, tetragonal phase versus trigonal phase, can be controlled using different reaction times or using anion-templating as observed in mechanochemical synthesis. While the Zn-based compounds have been studied in detail, almost no data is available on the Ni-based systems.

Slightly lower values in TG experiments are found since the content of the pores and cages can vary because of the gas flow at the beginning of the experiments. TG analysis of 1a in nitrogen, [Ni3(BTC)2(Me2NH)3]\u22c5(DMF)4(H2O)4, revealed a gradual weight loss up to 320 \u00b0C which corresponds to the removal of four H2O and three DMF molecules (obs. 26.9%, calcd 26.7%). The next significant weight loss up to 600 \u00b0C yielded elemental nickel (). The temperature-dependent XRPD measurements in a capillary () confirm the thermal stability of 1a up to 300 \u00b0C. Upon exposure to ambient conditions 1a decomposes rapidly at room temperature to form a green X-ray amorphous product (). Solvent-exchange experiments with diverse organic solvents such ethanol, dichloromethane, and acetonitrile have shown a rapid disintegration of the crystal structure which indicates the instability of compound 1a. The TG curve of [Ni6(BTC)2(HCOO)6(DMF)6] 1b shows three weight losses. The first weight loss (14.5%, calcd 14.9%) up to 250 \u00b0C could be due to the loss of three coordinated DMF molecules. Between 250 and 350 \u00b0C a loss of 24.9% (calcd 24.0%) is observed which is in accordance with the removal of the other three coordinated DMF molecules and three formate ions ().

Above 350 \u00b0C the oxidation of the organic linker molecules takes place, and NiO is formed.</p>", "clean_text": "Compound 2, [Ni3(BTB)2(2-MeIm)1.5(H2O)1.5]\u22c5(DMF)9(H2O)6.5, with the BTB linker is stable in air after the thermal activation, and its crystallinity even increases (). Unlike compound 1a, the crystal structure of 2 remains intact even after 72 h of stirring in pure dichloromethane at room temperature. Upon heating during TG analysis, compound 2 loses a considerable amount of guest molecules until the first plateau at 300 \u00b0C is reached (). The observed weight loss of 33.4% corresponds to eight H2O and seven DMF molecules (calcd 33.2%). Above 350 \u00b0C the organic units decompose and NiO is formed. The XRPD measurement of the sample treated at 250 \u00b0C confirms the stability of the framework and the structural transformation to the isomorphic subgroup with an enlarged unit cell of 3\u22c5(a, b, c).\n\nDuring the thermal decomposition of 3a, [Ni2(BDC)2(DABCO)]\u22c5(DMF)4(H2O)1.5 (), all guest molecules are liberated from the pores up to 290 \u00b0C in a two step process (obs. 36.6%, calcd 36.4%). The substantial weight loss from 290 to 800 \u00b0C can be attributed to the decomposition of two BDC and one DABCO linker molecules (obs. 48.6%, calcd 50.2%). The residual powder was determined to be NiO by XRPD. Compound 3a is also stable against moisture since after treatment with water, the crystallinity was preserved. 3a has also been found to be tolerant against solvents such as ethanol, dichloromethane, and acetonitrile in solvent exchange experiments at room temperature. TG analysis of the compound 3b, [Ni2(BDC)2(DABCO)]\u22c5(DMF)4(H2O)4, which has a polymorphic framework, two weight loss steps because of the removal of the guest molecules are observed (). The first weight loss between 40-120 \u00b0C corresponds to the removal of four H2O molecules (obs. 7.4%, calcd 7.8%), while the second weight loss (120-300 \u00b0C) can be attributed to the removal of the four DMF molecules (obs. 29.6%, calcd 31.7%). Further heating up to 800 \u00b0C led to NiO. Unlike 3a, 3b with the trigonal framework is moisture sensitive and gradual decomposition upon storage at ambient conditions is observed. This gradual decomposition of the 3b crystal structure was also observed after solvent exchange experiments. The TG analysis of 3c, [Ni(BDC)(DABCO)]\u22c5(DMF)1.5(H2O)2, shows that the guest molecules are removed in two steps up to 350 \u00b0C (obs. 29.2%, calcd 30.3%). Above 350 \u00b0C the oxidation of the organic linker molecules takes place, and NiO is formed.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "Compound 2", "symbol": "2", "chemical formula":
