The Zn bound iodine\natoms in <bold>1</bold> were disordered over three positions and refined\nby the SUMP command.

We have refined\nthe structure with truncated data (1A) because of the low resolution\nof the reflection pattern. We have also tried several lower symmetry\nspace groups; none of them gave a considerable improvement. For example,\nin the <italic>Pc</italic> space group the siloxane ring shifts away\nslightly of what would be the 2-fold axis of <italic>P</italic>2/<italic>c</italic>. There were also difference peaks in regions where one\nwould not expect them. This may be due to nonmerohedral twinning.\nHowever, on the whole, we believe the disorder of the ligand in <bold>3</bold> is intrinsic in nature owing to the flexibility of the siloxane\nring and the ethyl pyridyl side chains favoring more than one conformation\nfor the ligand without affecting the coordination geometry. This becomes\napparent when one looks at the thermal parameters, which become larger\nthe farther the atoms are to the center of the ligand and reach a\nmaximum at the siloxane ring. Because there was a large number of\ndomains, it was impossible to refine a meaningful model of the disorder.\nNevertheless, all connectivity patterns of the molecule were unambiguously\nestablished in the crystal structure of <bold>3</bold>. However, owing\nto its high <italic>R</italic>-factor (about 15%), the bond lengths\nand bond angles in it have to be treated with caution.

For 1, the data was collected on a Bruker D8 Venture diffractometer fitted with a microfocus detector at 100 K using Mo K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5). Structures were refined by full matrix least-squares against F 2 using all data (SHELX). Crystallographic data for all these compounds are listed in Tables S1 and S2, Supporting Information. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically if not stated otherwise. Hydrogen atoms were constrained in geometric positions to their parent atoms. Crystals of 1 and 2 were weakly diffracting at higher angles, and hence a 2\u03b8 = 50\u00b0 cutoff was applied. Owing to the weak diffraction data and partially opaque nature of the crystals, the C and N atoms of the pyridyl vinyl groups in 2 were refined isotropically. Only one of the two nitrate groups in 2 was located; the other nitrate group was disordered with solvate groups and hence has been removed by the squeeze routine of the Platon program. The TGA of 2 showed a 5% weight loss up to 110 \u00b0C corresponding to one molecule of water and one molecule of methanol (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The tetrasiloxane ring and one of the vinyl carbons in all four vinyl pyridyl moieties in 1 were disordered over two positions and hence were freely refined using the SAME/SADI restraints. The Zn bound iodine atoms in 1 were disordered over three positions and refined by the SUMP command. Crystals of 3 were very poor in quality, and we could just manage to solve the structure of the compound. The data were very weak and of poor quality as indicated by high R(int) and R(\u03c3) values. We have refined the structure with truncated data (1A) because of the low resolution of the reflection pattern. We have also tried several lower symmetry space groups; none of them gave a considerable improvement. For example, in the Pc space group the siloxane ring shifts away slightly of what would be the 2-fold axis of P2/c. There were also difference peaks in regions where one would not expect them. This may be due to nonmerohedral twinning. However, on the whole, we believe the disorder of the ligand in 3 is intrinsic in nature owing to the flexibility of the siloxane ring and the ethyl pyridyl side chains favoring more than one conformation for the ligand without affecting the coordination geometry. This becomes apparent when one looks at the thermal parameters, which become larger the farther the atoms are to the center of the ligand and reach a maximum at the siloxane ring. Because there was a large number of domains, it was impossible to refine a meaningful model of the disorder. Nevertheless, all connectivity patterns of the molecule were unambiguously established in the crystal structure of 3. However, owing to its high R-factor (about 15%), the bond lengths and bond angles in it have to be treated with caution.

At 298 K, the emission spectrum of 3a displays a single broad low energy (LE) emission band centered at 595 nm (\u03bbex = 375 nm). This is in agreement with the intense orange emission observed at room temperature, which can be attributed to the \"cluster-centered\" (3CC) emission consisting of a mixture of iodide to copper charge transfer (3XMCT) and metal d \u2192 s,p transitions. While at 77 K a new high energy (HE) band appears at 447 nm (\u03bbex = 375 nm), with the concomitant quenching of the 3CC-LE band (). This HE band is attributed to the iodide to ligand charge transfer and metal to ligand charge transfer (3XLCT/3MLCT) transitions.

The decay measurements in 3a at 298 and 77 K gave the lifetime (\u03c4em) values of 1.1 and 162 \u03bcS, respectively (Figures S32-S34, Supporting Information). It is interesting to note that the retention of thermochromism due to the Cu4I4 core in the cluster MOF 3 is a rare instance since such thermochromic behavior is found to be absent in several infinite frameworks based on these clusters.
