It is note that the presence of [Pb2Cl2] dinuclear units in compound 3 results in the difference of emission with that of compound 1. In this cluster, charge transfer states and states delocalized over the chlorine-bridged lead ions become important. With reference to our experimental results and the previous work on lead(II) systems, the origin of the emissions of 1, 2, 3, and 6 may be assigned to mainly derive from intraligand (IL) phosphorescent emission, while the presence of a heavy metal lead(II) facilitates intersystem crossing to successfully compete transitions in the triplet state with radiationless deactivations.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 47, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig9\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>9</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Solid-state excitation and emission spectra of complexes at room temperature: (a) <bold>1</bold>, (b) <bold>2</bold>, (c) <bold>3</bold>, (d) <bold>6</bold>.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr12\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"cg-2007-01224h_0009.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 9  Solid-state excitation and emission spectra of complexes at room temperature: (a) 1, (b) 2, (c) 3, (d) 6.
