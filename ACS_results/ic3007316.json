Its crystal structure is characterized by a novel 3D pillared open framework which contains cross-linked 1D channels filled with water and DMF. The presence of an aliphatic -(CH2)8- chain in the ligand provides a substantial framework flexibility as the structures are adapted to the guest molecule (water) content. Thus, upon evacuation of H2O and DMF molecules from the channels, thermally or under vacuum, the rehydration of the compound leads to a new crystalline phase with higher water content, MgH6ODTMP\u22c56H2O (3). These processes take place through crystalline-quasi-amorphous-crystalline transformation, where the integrity of the framework is maintained. A water adsorption study, at a fixed temperature of 308 K, showed that MgH6ODTMP\u22c5nH2O reversibly equilibrates its water content as a function of the water partial pressure. The anhydrous material is ultramicroporous, and the specific surface for CO2 adsorption is 180 m2\u22c5g-1 (273 K, 1 bar) with a maximum uptake of 1.2 mmol/g at 900 kPa. MgH6ODTMP material shows a relatively high selectivity toward CO2 adsorption in CO2/CH4 mixtures and low heat of adsorption for CO2 uptake. These findings indicate that it could be useful for natural gas upgrading. Unfortunately, its relatively low adsorption capacity makes this material inappropriate for adsorption processes and suggests that the interactions of the tested gases with the solid are not strong enough to rebuild the pillared open framework as happens with the water molecules.

Upon evacuation and subsequent rehydration, the hybrid shows high proton conductivity with \u03c3 = 1.6 \u00d7 10-3 S cm-1 at T = 292 K and ~100% relative humidity.\n\nThermal Behavior and Water Content\n\nThe TGA curve for 1 is displayed in Figure . There are three consecutive mass losses up to 563 K followed by a very small plateau. These weight losses correspond to  removal of the DMF and water (experimental 13.2%, calculated for 0.5 DMF and 2 H2O molecules, 11.8%). At higher temperatures, the organic moiety is decomposed and finally there is a significant weight loss close to 1100 K, which is likely related to P2O5 release. The final thermal decomposition crystalline products were Mg2P4O12 (PDF 01-070-1803) and Mg(PO3)2 (PDF 00-027-1273). The overall measured weight loss up to 1273 K, 65.2%, agrees fairly well with the calculated loss, 66.9%, for the following mixture: 1/2 of Mg2P4O12 and 1 of Mg(PO3)2.\n\nTG analysis curves for 2 and 3 are also shown in Figure . The TGA curve for 2 shows a water mass loss in a single step. The measured water loss, 6.1%, agrees quite well with the calculated one, 6.22%. On the other hand, the TGA curve for 3 shows a mass loss in two steps. The first one, from room temperature  to ~400 K, is associated to the weight loss of ~4 lattice waters (exp 10.1%, calcd 11.07%). The second weight loss appears between 450 and 550 K, corresponding to  loss of the remaining 2 lattice waters (exp 6.5%, calcd 5.53%). The overall measured weight loss for 3 up to 550 K, 16.6%, agrees very well with the calculated value for six water molecules, 16.60%.\n\nGas Adsorption Characterization\n\nN2, CO2, and CH4 adsorption isotherms were measured for degassed 1, MgH6ODTMP, as indicated in the . N2 adsorption was very low, giving a specific surface of 4 m2\u22c5g-1. On the other hand, the CO2 adsorption isotherm (see Figure S4, ), collected at 273 K and under pressure up to 1 bar, gave a surface area of 180 m2\u22c5g-1, deduced from the Dubinin-Radushkevich equation and an adsorption capacity of 0.8 mmol\u22c5g-1. This clearly indicates that there are severe diffusional limitations for N2 adsorption at 77 K in MgH6ODTMP material and therefore could be useful for CO2/N2 separation. Similar values have been reported for Mg-MOF-1, constructed by helical assembly of Mg2+ ions with achiral 3,5-pyridine dicarboxylates, but are considerably lower than those obtained for Mg/DOBDC (DOBDC = dioxybenzenedicarboxylate) (8 mmol\u22c5g-1 at 1 bar and 296 K), the highest adsorption capacity to date among the Mg-MOFs materials.
