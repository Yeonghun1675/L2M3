Then the resulting dehydrated phase remains stable up to 400 \u00b0C. This was confirmed by temperature-dependent X-ray powder diffraction (Figure S9). The dehydrated phase is crystalline, but up to now we have not succeeded in characterizing its crystal structure. When it is exposed to a wet atmosphere, the anhydrous compound does not rehydrate. Above 400 \u00b0C, decomposition of the ligand (dcpa)2- occurs and leads finally to erbium oxide.", "data": [[[{"value": "150", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "double endothermic weight loss", "condition": "departure of the three coordination water molecules for the first loss and the five coordination water molecules for the second loss"}, {"value": "400", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "stable", "condition": "dehydrated phase"}, {"value": "400", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "decomposition", "condition": "decomposition of the ligand (dcpa)2- occurs and leads finally to erbium oxide"}]]], "include_properties": ["decomposition_temperature"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['decomposition_temperature']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[{\"value\":\"150\", \"unit\":\"\u00b0C\", \"type\":\"double endothermic weight loss\", \"condition\":\"departure of the three coordination water molecules for the first loss and the five coordination water molecules for the second loss\"}, {\"value\":\"400\", \"unit\":\"\u00b0C\", \"type\":\"stable\", \"condition\":\"dehydrated phase\"}, {\"value\":\"400\", \"unit\":\"\u00b0C\", \"type\":\"decomposition\", \"condition\":\"decomposition of the ligand (dcpa)2- occurs and leads finally to erbium oxide\"}]\n```"}}, {"idx": 15, "type": "table", "classification": ["Crystal"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Crystal and Final Structure Refinement Data for [Er<sub>2</sub>(dcpa)<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub>\u00b73H<sub>2</sub>O]<sub>\u221e</sub>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"2\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>molecular formula</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>22</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>Er<sub>2</sub>O<sub>20</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>system</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>monoclinic</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic>a</italic> (\u00c5)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>5.9165(1)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic>b</italic> (\u00c5)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>18.2813(2)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic>c</italic> (\u00c5)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>30.8378(5)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\u03b2 (deg)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>91.4100(4)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic>V</italic> (\u00c5<sup>3</sup>)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>3334.45(9)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic>Z</italic>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>4</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>formula wt</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1177.64</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>space\u00a0group\u00a0(No.)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic>P</italic>2<sub>1</sub>/<italic>n</italic> (14)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic>D</italic>\n<sub>calc</sub> (g. cm<sup>\u20133</sup>)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.314</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\u03bc (mm<sup>\u20131</sup>)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>5.566</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic>R</italic> (%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>7.92</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic>R</italic>\n<sub>w</sub> (%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>19.95</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>GOF</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.267</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>CCDC no.</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<ext-link ext-link-type=\"ccdc\" xlink:href=\"229478\">229478</ext-link>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "Table 1.
