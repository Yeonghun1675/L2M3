The theory level of M06-2X/6-31++G(2d,2p)//M06-2X/6-31G(d,p) was chosen to study larger systems because its CO2\u22c5formamide binding energy, 20.1 kJ mol-1, was quite close to the CCSD(T) result. For dimerization energy of slipped-parallel CO2, the chosen level affords 5.1 kJ mol-1, also comparing well to that of the CCSD(T)/CBS result, 6.2 kJ mol-1. All model structures related to 1 were constructed from its crystallographic data. Model a (Figure b) consists of three (4-pyridyl)benzamide molecules, and model b (Figure c) consists of six (4-pyridyl)benzamide molecules, representing the vertical walls of the larger channel in 1.
