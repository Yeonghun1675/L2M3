The most prominent examples essentially comprise high oxidation state tungsten- and molybdenum-based alkylidyne complexes of the Schrock type bearing alkoxide (e.g., fluorinated alkoxides, silanolates, and multidentate ligands), amido or iminato ligands, among others, and combinations thereof. The synthesis of these complexes initially followed two dominant strategies: (i) The cross-metathesis of binuclear complexes of the type [(RO)3W\ue5fcW(OR)3] with alkynes (R'C\ue5fcCR') to give 2 equiv of the corresponding alkylidyne complex [R'C\ue5fcW(OR)3], and (ii) the so-called \"high-oxidation-state\" route, starting from WCl6 or MoO2Cl2 to afford, in several steps, neopentylidyne complexes such as [Me3CC\ue5fcM(dme) n (OR)3] (M = Mo, W; dme = 1,2-dimethoxyethane; n = 0, 1) via the versatile precursor mer-[Me3CC\ue5fcM(Cl)3(dme)].

As usual, the synthetic pathway began with the reaction of 2-isopropoxyphenyl lithium (generated in situ by metal-halogen exchange of 2-bromo-1-isopropoxybenzene and n-butyl lithium at -20 \u00b0C) with [Mo(CO)6] in diethyl ether to furnish the anionic benzoyl complex Li[{2-(i-PrO)C6H4}C(\ue5fbO)Mo(CO)5], Li[17], which was converted to [Me4N][17] via salt metathesis in degassed water. However, the 1H NMR spectrum (Figure S31a) revealed two sets of resonances for the isopropyl moiety and for the aromatic protons, again suggesting (cf. [Me4N][13], vide supra) the presence of two molybdenum species in solution. Accordingly, the signal duplication was also observed in the 13C{1H} NMR spectrum (Figure S31b), except for the most low-field-shifted signal at about \u03b4C = 303 ppm, which correlates with the acyl carbon atom (ArC(\ue5fbO)Mo).

The mixture immediately turned yellow, and stirring for 15 min at ambient temperature resulted in a clear orange solution. Then, n-hexane (70 mL) was added, precipitating a yellow powder that remained in suspension, and a gluey dark orange solid that stuck to the walls of the flask. The suspension was immediately filtered before the yellow powder started to settle; the yellow solid was then dried on the frit under dynamic vacuum to give 1.16 g of the title compound.

The brown mixture was allowed to warm up gradually to -20 \u00b0C (the cooling bath was not removed) during which time the color darkened slightly and evolution of gas was observed. The mixture was cooled back to -80 \u00b0C and filtered at this temperature through D.E. on a jacketed frit to separate the precipitated LiBr.

The deep brown residue was dissolved in dichloromethane (10 mL), and after addition of n-pentane (45 mL), a brown solid precipitated. The mother liquor was decanted off and the solid dried under high vacuum to give 16 as a crude product as judged by NMR spectroscopy (any attempts to recrystallize or further purify the compound resulted in additional decomposition).
