Because of the highly fragile nature of single\ncrystals, monitoring the solid-state structural changes is very difficult.\nHere we were successfully able to show the effects of guest interaction\nwith the dynamic framework by solid-state SCSC structural studies.\nMoreover, in situ smooth aqua exchange at the Cd2 center was driven\nby the THF guest molecules present inside the pores of the framework.\nThe presence of flexible points in the organic moiety provides simultaneous\ncooperative actions during changes in the coordination environment\nof the active metal site, which leads to contraction and expansion\nof channels of the dynamic framework. The functional coordination\nspace inside the framework is very sensitive to different types of\nguests either coordinating or noncoordinating in nature. Coordinating\nguests with suitable size can be easily accommodated within the pore,\nwhich interestingly interacts inside the pore, replacing (partially\nor completely) the coordinated water molecules from the Cd2 center.\nVarious effects observed by different guest molecules on the pore\ndimensions of the framework resulting in solid-state structural changes\nare represented in a schematic fashion (Scheme  and Table ). As an effect of structural\nchanges mediated by THF coordination (when crystals were kept in room\ntemperature out of the mother liquor, i.e., in dry form) to the metal\ncenter, a complete blocking of the pores was observed. Complete exchange\nof water by THF guest was not complete but partial at room temperature,\nleaving behind a framework with one coordinated water and one coordinated\nTHF molecule in the formula unit, which changed to {[Cd<sub>3</sub>(L)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)(THF)]\u00b7THF}<sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">n</italic>\n</sub> (<bold>1D</bold>) from the parent compound (<bold>1\u2283THF</bold>).

Overall the framework pattern is\nthe same in <bold>1D</bold> structure but importantly the coordination\nspace inside the framework shrank with a decrease in the total solvent-accessible\nvolume to 22.2% per unit cell. This suggests shrinking of the coordination\nvolume by almost 40% per unit cell compared to the parent compound\nwhen it changes to <bold>1D</bold>. Compound <bold>1D</bold> also\nhas free guest THF molecules inside the channels, which leads to strong\nhydrogen bonding with the coordinated water molecules (O<sub>THF</sub>---O<sub>water</sub> = 2.553 \u00c5; Figure ). After taking crystals out of the mother liquor, pore A gets completely\nblocked due to THF coordination at the metal center. This subsequently\nalso affects the dimensions of pore B, as a result of it squeezing\npore metrics. Here we showed two-way modulation of the framework porosity\nvia guest-dependent blocking/unblocking of the coordination space.\nThus, replacing the parent guest molecules with a weakly/noncoordinating\nguest, i.e., ACTN (acetone), revealed interesting results. ACTN molecules\nare easily removed from the framework with little changes in the pore\ndimensions of both pores in compound <bold>1\u2283ACTN</bold> (<bold>1\u2283THF</bold> after exchanging with ACTN).

In this case, the total potential solvent-accessible volume\nwas found to be the 31.0% per unit cell, which signifies that the\ncoordination space can be maintained with the least decrease in volume\n(14% per unit cell). The strongest guest impact was observed from\nthe rigid guest THF after coordination to the cadmium(II) center,\nand the least dimensional change was observed in the case of flexible\naliphatic straight-chain guest BuOH by the replacement of all coordinated\nwater molecules to give compound <bold>1\u2283BuOH</bold>. In the\ncase of compound <bold>1\u2283BuOH</bold>, it was observed that\nboth pores are filled with two different guest molecules; i.e., in\npore A, all of the THF guests are replaced by BuOH and then subsequently\ncoordinated to the metal center (Figure ).\nBecause guest BuOH has a long hydrophobic flexible aliphatic C4 tail,\nthe least reduction in the pore dimensions was observed with a proper\nfitting of the coordinated BuOH in pore A of <bold>1\u2283BuOH</bold>. Unexpectedly, pore B is still occupied with the parent THF guest\nmolecules. This specific replacement of guest THF in only pore A may\nbe attributed to the presence of active metal centers in pore A to\naccommodate BuOH via coordination, which is not possible in pore B,\nwhere no free or labile coordination site is present there. Also,\nthe sizes of both pores are different. Pore A (where BuOH is coordinated)\nhas a vertical pore length of 5.113 \u00c5 (excluding van der Waals\nradii), while that of channel B is 3.881 \u00c5 in <bold>1\u2283BuOH</bold>. This type of adjustment of the pore dimension for self-sorting\nof the guest molecule is unprecedented, which is possible because of the cooperative actions of the soft\ninorganic backbone and flexible ligand. Moreover, we could successfully\nstudy the single-crystal X-ray structure of the desolvated phase <bold>1H</bold> (H stands for heated) by heating <bold>1\u2283THF</bold> at 180 \u00b0C under vacuum. <bold>1H</bold> showed complete replacement\nof coordinated water by THF guest molecules, which block the free\ncoordination space, solely resulting in a nonporous material. Partial-to-complete\nexchange of water by THF may be favored by an increase in the temperature\nand the proximity of the cadmium center with free THF molecule held\nby hydrogen bonding with coordinated water molecules. Coordinated\nTHF molecules are found to be disordered in the SC-XRD structure,\nand hence its presence in the compound was also examined by <sup>1</sup>H NMR analysis by digesting the compound (<bold>1H</bold>) in a DCl/D<sub>2</sub>O mixture (Figure S19 in the , SI). This is the most squeezed structure among\nall of the phases generated from the parent compound (Figure a). In <bold>1H</bold>, the solvent-accessible void\nwas found to be 10.5% per unit cell, which suggests contraction of\nthe free coordination volume to \u223c70% compared to the parent\ncompound. Structural changes were prominently observed when the simulated\nPXRD patterns of all of the compounds were compared (Figure b). The reflection from the [100] plane remains\nalmost constant for all of the phases, and from the most porous compound <bold>1\u2283THF</bold> to the most squeezed <bold>1H</bold> compound,\na right shift of the [010] and [110] planes was observed (Figure b). Among the three guest molecules, i.e., THF,\nACTN, and BuOH, guests THF and BuOH are coordinating but have different\ndimensions. So, drastic guest-dependent differences were observed\nin their inclusion compounds. We finally focused on two compounds,\ni.e., <bold>1\u2282ACTN</bold> and <bold>1H</bold>, from which we\ngenerated two extreme phases (porous and nonporous) to show the effect\nof guests on modification of the active coordination space and their\nresulting porous behaviors. TGA of both compounds showed stability\nof the frameworks up to \u223c350 \u00b0C. To support this phenomenon,\ngas sorption studies were performed for guest-driven nonporous and\nporous forms of the parent compound. Compound <bold>1\u2283ACTN</bold> and <bold>1D</bold> were subjected to pretreatment under vacuum\nto get the guest-free forms <bold>1</bold> and <bold>1H</bold>, respectively.\nTGA of guest-free forms of these two compounds showed no weight loss\nup to 230 \u00b0C and slowly decomposed after that, supported by variable-temperature\nPXRD studies (Figure S21 and S22 in the ). Compound <bold>1\u2283ACTN</bold> can lose free guest ACTN as\nwell as coordinated water molecules to give the porous phase <bold>1</bold>, where both pores A and B are open. In the case of <bold>1H</bold>, pore A is blocked with a coordinated THF guest and simultaneously\npore B is squeezed as well, where THF acts as a blocking coordinating\nagent in pore A (Scheme ). It is worth mentioning\nthat guest-dependent two-way modulation to open and closed frameworks\nwas strongly supported by CO<sub>2</sub> sorption at 195 K. Sorption\nresults showed almost negligible uptake of \u223c1 cm<sup>3</sup>/g of CO<sub>2</sub> by <bold>1H</bold>, whereas almost 100 times\nmore uptake was achieved by compound <bold>1</bold> with 104 cm<sup>3</sup>/g uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> with a characteristic type I curve\n(Figure ). In Scheme , it is briefly explained about how pore windows of the framework\ncan be closed and opened upon guest switching inside the coordination\nspace. Compound <bold>1</bold> showed high uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> compared to other gases like N<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and\nO<sub>2</sub> at 298 K, which is due to good polarizability and a\nlarge quadrupole moment of CO<sub>2</sub> molecules, which allows\nit to interact strongly with the framework and makes it possible to\nenter into the pore. This clearly indicates that, even though the\neffective pore size of the framework (5.8 \u00c5, calculated by the\nHorvath\u2013Kawazoe size distribution curve from CO<sub>2</sub> sorption) is large enough to accommodate all of these gas molecules,\nelectronic interaction plays a role apart from size/shape insights\nfor the selective sorption of CO<sub>2</sub> over other gas molecules.</p>", "clean_text": "The use of organic tricarboxylic acid (H3 L) possessing free rotating arms as ether linkages between the rigid central benzene ring and Ar-COOH moiety facilitates the dynamic behavior of the framework (Figure ). Because of the highly fragile nature of single crystals, monitoring the solid-state structural changes is very difficult. Here we were successfully able to show the effects of guest interaction with the dynamic framework by solid-state SCSC structural studies. Moreover, in situ smooth aqua exchange at the Cd2 center was driven by the THF guest molecules present inside the pores of the framework. The presence of flexible points in the organic moiety provides simultaneous cooperative actions during changes in the coordination environment of the active metal site, which leads to contraction and expansion of channels of the dynamic framework. The functional coordination space inside the framework is very sensitive to different types of guests either coordinating or noncoordinating in nature. Coordinating guests with suitable size can be easily accommodated within the pore, which interestingly interacts inside the pore, replacing (partially or completely) the coordinated water molecules from the Cd2 center. Various effects observed by different guest molecules on the pore dimensions of the framework resulting in solid-state structural changes are represented in a schematic fashion (Scheme  and Table ). As an effect of structural changes mediated by THF coordination (when crystals were kept in room temperature out of the mother liquor, i.e., in dry form) to the metal center, a complete blocking of the pores was observed. Complete exchange of water by THF guest was not complete but partial at room temperature, leaving behind a framework with one coordinated water and one coordinated THF molecule in the formula unit, which changed to {[Cd3(L)2(H2O)(THF)]\u22c5THF} n  (1D) from the parent compound (1\u2283THF). In compound 1D, three different cadmium centers are present, where the third metal center Cd3 has coordinated THF (Cd3---O10THF = 2.310 \u00c5) in place of water, unlike the parent compound (Figure ). Overall the framework pattern is the same in 1D structure but importantly the coordination space inside the framework shrank with a decrease in the total solvent-accessible volume to 22.2% per unit cell. This suggests shrinking of the coordination volume by almost 40% per unit cell compared to the parent compound when it changes to 1D. Compound 1D also has free guest THF molecules inside the channels, which leads to strong hydrogen bonding with the coordinated water molecules (OTHF---Owater = 2.553 \u00c5; Figure ). After taking crystals out of the mother liquor, pore A gets completely blocked due to THF coordination at the metal center. This subsequently also affects the dimensions of pore B, as a result of it squeezing pore metrics. Here we showed two-way modulation of the framework porosity via guest-dependent blocking/unblocking of the coordination space. Thus, replacing the parent guest molecules with a weakly/noncoordinating guest, i.e., ACTN (acetone), revealed interesting results. ACTN molecules are easily removed from the framework with little changes in the pore dimensions of both pores in compound 1\u2283ACTN (1\u2283THF after exchanging with ACTN). Thus, 1\u2283ACTN has less susceptibility toward the dimensional changes of pores A and B. In this case, the total potential solvent-accessible volume was found to be the 31.0% per unit cell, which signifies that the coordination space can be maintained with the least decrease in volume (14% per unit cell). The strongest guest impact was observed from the rigid guest THF after coordination to the cadmium(II) center, and the least dimensional change was observed in the case of flexible aliphatic straight-chain guest BuOH by the replacement of all coordinated water molecules to give compound 1\u2283BuOH. In the case of compound 1\u2283BuOH, it was observed that both pores are filled with two different guest molecules; i.e., in pore A, all of the THF guests are replaced by BuOH and then subsequently coordinated to the metal center (Figure ). Because guest BuOH has a long hydrophobic flexible aliphatic C4 tail, the least reduction in the pore dimensions was observed with a proper fitting of the coordinated BuOH in pore A of 1\u2283BuOH. Unexpectedly, pore B is still occupied with the parent THF guest molecules. This specific replacement of guest THF in only pore A may be attributed to the presence of active metal centers in pore A to accommodate BuOH via coordination, which is not possible in pore B, where no free or labile coordination site is present there. Also, the sizes of both pores are different. Pore A (where BuOH is coordinated) has a vertical pore length of 5.113 \u00c5 (excluding van der Waals radii), while that of channel B is 3.881 \u00c5 in 1\u2283BuOH. This type of adjustment of the pore dimension for self-sorting of the guest molecule is unprecedented, which is possible because of the cooperative actions of the soft inorganic backbone and flexible ligand. Moreover, we could successfully study the single-crystal X-ray structure of the desolvated phase 1H (H stands for heated) by heating 1\u2283THF at 180 \u00b0C under vacuum. 1H showed complete replacement of coordinated water by THF guest molecules, which block the free coordination space, solely resulting in a nonporous material. Partial-to-complete exchange of water by THF may be favored by an increase in the temperature and the proximity of the cadmium center with free THF molecule held by hydrogen bonding with coordinated water molecules. Coordinated THF molecules are found to be disordered in the SC-XRD structure, and hence its presence in the compound was also examined by 1H NMR analysis by digesting the compound (1H) in a DCl/D2O mixture (Figure S19 in the , SI). This is the most squeezed structure among all of the phases generated from the parent compound (Figure a). In 1H, the solvent-accessible void was found to be 10.5% per unit cell, which suggests contraction of the free coordination volume to ~70% compared to the parent compound. Structural changes were prominently observed when the simulated PXRD patterns of all of the compounds were compared (Figure b). The reflection from the [100] plane remains almost constant for all of the phases, and from the most porous compound 1\u2283THF to the most squeezed 1H compound, a right shift of the [010] and [110] planes was observed (Figure b). Among the three guest molecules, i.e., THF, ACTN, and BuOH, guests THF and BuOH are coordinating but have different dimensions. So, drastic guest-dependent differences were observed in their inclusion compounds. We finally focused on two compounds, i.e., 1\u2282ACTN and 1H, from which we generated two extreme phases (porous and nonporous) to show the effect of guests on modification of the active coordination space and their resulting porous behaviors. TGA of both compounds showed stability of the frameworks up to ~350 \u00b0C. To support this phenomenon, gas sorption studies were performed for guest-driven nonporous and porous forms of the parent compound. Compound 1\u2283ACTN and 1D were subjected to pretreatment under vacuum to get the guest-free forms 1 and 1H, respectively. TGA of guest-free forms of these two compounds showed no weight loss up to 230 \u00b0C and slowly decomposed after that, supported by variable-temperature PXRD studies (Figure S21 and S22 in the ). Compound 1\u2283ACTN can lose free guest ACTN as well as coordinated water molecules to give the porous phase 1, where both pores A and B are open. In the case of 1H, pore A is blocked with a coordinated THF guest and simultaneously pore B is squeezed as well, where THF acts as a blocking coordinating agent in pore A (Scheme ). It is worth mentioning that guest-dependent two-way modulation to open and closed frameworks was strongly supported by CO2 sorption at 195 K. Sorption results showed almost negligible uptake of ~1 cm3/g of CO2 by 1H, whereas almost 100 times more uptake was achieved by compound 1 with 104 cm3/g uptake of CO2 with a characteristic type I curve (Figure ). In Scheme , it is briefly explained about how pore windows of the framework can be closed and opened upon guest switching inside the coordination space. Compound 1 showed high uptake of CO2 compared to other gases like N2, CH4, and O2 at 298 K, which is due to good polarizability and a large quadrupole moment of CO2 molecules, which allows it to interact strongly with the framework and makes it possible to enter into the pore. This clearly indicates that, even though the effective pore size of the framework (5.8 \u00c5, calculated by the Horvath-Kawazoe size distribution curve from CO2 sorption) is large enough to accommodate all of these gas molecules, electronic interaction plays a role apart from size/shape insights for the selective sorption of CO2 over other gas molecules.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 14, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Schematic Drawing Representing the Structural Parameter Changes in\nPore A of the Different Compounds in Table <xref rid=\"tbl1\"></xref>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr6\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2013-02058f_0006.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Schematic Drawing Representing the Structural Parameter Changes in Pore A of the Different Compounds in Table     ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 15, "type": "table", "classification": null, "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Pore Dimension Changes\nin the Form of Three Parameters for Scheme <xref rid=\"sch1\"></xref>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"4\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">compound</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\u2220\u03d5 (deg)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">X</italic> (\u00c5)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">Y</italic> (\u00c5)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<bold>1\u2283THF</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>82.92</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>11.439</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>12.924</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<bold>1\u2283BuOH</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>80.14</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>11.075</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>13.160</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<bold>1\u2283ACTN</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>76.83</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>10.616</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>13.388</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<bold>1D</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>74.81</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>10.251</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>13.588</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 16, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Part of channel\nA along the <italic toggle=\"yes\">a</italic> axis in <bold>1D</bold> showing coordinated\nTHF to Cd3 and hydrogen bonding between coordinated water and free\nTHF molecule; O21\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O4 = 2.553 \u00c5.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2013-02058f_0002.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 2  Part of channel A along the a axis in 1D showing coordinated THF to Cd3 and hydrogen bonding between coordinated water and free THF molecule; O21\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O4 = 2.553 \u00c5.
