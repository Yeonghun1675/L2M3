In fact, the interatomic distance from ONO3  to the spatially closest H is 2.264 \u00c5 in 2, which is much shorter than those in 1 (2.378 \u00c5) and 3 (2.528 \u00c5). Although the H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5ONO3  distance shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii of O and H (1.52 + 1.20 = 2.72 \u00c5) suggests that a short contact is actually present between NO3 - and C-H in these complexes, its extent in 2 seems to be stronger than those in 1 and 3. As a matter of fact, the C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5ONO3  angle in 2 (172.4\u00b0) also implies the presence of the C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bond. In contrast, such a discussion cannot be easily applied to 1 and 3 because of the narrower angles (143.9\u00b0 for 1 and 133.8\u00b0 for 3). In the molecular structure of 2, the pyrrolidone rings are forced to stack with their faces toward each other because of the trans-1,2-cyclohexylene group. As a result, this bridging moiety tends to lean over NO3 - to form the C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5ONO3  hydrogen bond.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 15, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>Although the molecular\narrangements in <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>3</bold> are similar to\neach other at a glance, several differences are also observable.
