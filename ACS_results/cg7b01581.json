Solid PTA (321 mg, 2 mmol) was added to the obtained filtrate. The resulting mixture was refluxed under dinitrogen for 15 min and then filtered off in air. The filtrate was left to evaporate for several days in air at r.t., resulting in green X-ray quality single crystals. These were collected and dried in air to furnish 3 in 10% yield, based on the copper(II) acetate. Compound 3 is soluble in H2O, sparingly soluble in warm DMSO (slow decomposition occurs), and insoluble in MeOH and MeCN. Anal.
