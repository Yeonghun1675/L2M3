Increasing the reaction temperature to remove the terminal water ligand of discrete coordination compounds [M(HNA)2(H2O)4] (H2NA = 5-hydroxynicotinic acid, M = Co for 1 and Ni for 2) led to forming three-dimensional (3D) coordination polymers [M(NA)] n  (M = Co for 3 and Ni for 4). When 1-4 were investigated as active anode materials for lithium storage at 100 mA g-1, the relatively low capacities of 455 and 411 mA h g-1 were obtained after 60 cycles with discrete 1 and 2, while that of 3 and 4 showed high capacities of 618 and 610 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles. Detailed mechanism studies by powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy showed that the structural dimensionality change induced by water molecules can greatly contribute the cyclability and rate performance for coordination compounds as anode material for lithium storage.\n\nThe influence of the water molecule on both the structural dimensionality and the lithium storage capacities of four coordination compounds was studied. When they were studied for LIBs, discrete 1 and 2 showed capacities of 455 and 411 mA h g-1 after 60 cycles, while enhanced capacities of 618 and 610 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles for 3 and 4 were obtained.\n\nThe related composition and structural difference encourage us to study how the impact of structural dimensionality can affect the storage performance of lithium ions. We performed galvanostatic cycling measurements to study the lithium-ion storage property with 1-4 as active materials. As shown in a,b and S11a,b, they were tested at 100 mA g-1 in 0.01-3 V. The initial capacities were 1528 and 1642 mA h g-1 for 1 and 2, respectively. The capacities decreased rapidly to 544 and 616 mA h g-1 in the second cycle and maintained stabilized capacities of 455 and 411 mA h g-1 in the following cycles. For 3, the discharge and charge capacities of the first cycle were 1934 and 973 mA h g-1. The capacities of the second cycle decreased to 815 and 775 mA h g-1. Interfacial lithium storage and the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer with the organic electrolyte decomposed led to the capacity loss. Another reason for the larger irreversible capacity loss for the initial cycle of 1 and 2 than that of 3 and 4 is induced by the reaction of H2O molecules with lithium ions, which is irreversible. A stabilized capacity of 618 mA h g-1 in the following cycles was achieved. For 4, it has the similar electrochemical behavior of 3. The discharge specific capacity was 1585 mA h g-1 in the first cycle, and a charge specific capacity of 801 mA h g-1 was obtained. The capacities in the second cycle decreased to 670 and 648 mA h g-1, and a capacity of 610 mA h g-1 in the following cycles was stabilized.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "1", "chemical
