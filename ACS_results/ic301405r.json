As noted by Thiel and co-workers in a recent review, supported molecular catalysts based on molybdenum frequently exhibit poor recycling stability; i.e., catalytic activity decreases between recycling runs. The causes of catalyst deactivation include chemical and structural alterations of the catalysts and leaching of active species that are weakly adsorbed/entrapped on the support. Catalyst stabilities are generally very sensitive to the preparation procedures, which are less attractive than that of 2 in that they involve the use of multicomponent reaction mixtures (critical in terms of atom efficiency), whereas 2 is prepared in a straightforward manner in aqueous media using only the precursor complex as a starting material.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 39, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Conclusions and Outlook</title><p>With the conclusion of this\nstudy, three very distinct and structurally\ndiverse molybdenum oxide/organodiamine compounds have been prepared\nby the reaction of complexes of the type [MoO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>L] with water at 100\u2013120 \u00b0C, namely, the polymeric materials\n{[MoO<sub>3</sub>(2,2\u2032-bipy)][MoO<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)]}<sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">n</italic>\n</sub> and (in this work) [Mo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>(HpypzA)] and the octanuclear complex [Mo<sub>8</sub>O<sub>22</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>(4,4\u2032-di-<italic toggle=\"yes\">tert</italic>-butyl-2,2\u2032-bipyridine)<sub>4</sub>]; these are active and\nstable epoxidation catalysts.
