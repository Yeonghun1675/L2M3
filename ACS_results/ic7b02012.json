As shown in b, the obtained UiO-68-ol NMOFs feature the same structural pattern as that of bulk single crystals on the basis of the PXRD patterns. A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image demonstrated that the generated UiO-68-ol NMOF particles were uniformly distributed (c), and their size is centered at ca. 170 nm, which is well supported by a dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurement (c). As shown in d, when a solution of UiO-68-ol NPs (1 mg) in PBS (900 \u03bcL, 0.2 M) was added to a PBS solution of NaClO (10-3 M), the system turned from colorless to yellow immediately. Considering that the pK a of HClO is 7.46, we concluded that UiO-68-ol herein responded to HClO rather than ClO-, similar to the behavior of other organic molecular fluorescence probes reported previously. After addition of VC (10-3 M), the system promptly turned back to colorless. The redox transformation on UiO-68-ol NPs is also accompanied by a drastic fluorescence change. As indicated in d,e, UiO-68-ol NPs in PBS solution showed a bright blue emission at 475 nm, whereas UiO-68-one NPs were basically nonfluorescent. After further reduction of UiO-68-one, the UiO-68-ol' NPs had a blue emission again (recovered by 82%). Therefore, UiO-68-ol NMOF exhibited the same redox-switchable phenomenon as those of H  2  L-ol and UiO-68-ol bulk crystals and the structural integrity of UiO-68-ol was well preserved during the redox process, which is well demonstrated by the PXRD patterns (b) and their TEM images (Supporting Information). In addition, the PXRD pattern further confirms that the UiO-68-ol NMOF is very stable in PBS solution (b).
