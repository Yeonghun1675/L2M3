The higher capacity may be mainly ascribed to the metal ion and ligand all taking part in lithium storage. Searching for electrode materials of lithium ion batteries from 1D metal coordination polymers is a new route.\n\nThermal Stability\n\nThe TGA curve for Zn-ODCP is shown in Figure S2. The TGA result reveals that there is a weight loss between 60 and 198 \u00b0C, corresponding to the loss of one water molecule (calcd 3.15%, found 3.60%); subsequently, the remaining substance is decomposed slowly to give final product ZnO (calcd 14.23%, found 12.12%).\n\nLuminescent Property\n\nThe solid state emission spectrum of Zn-ODCP at room temperature is shown in Figure S3. Upon excitation at 337 nm, intense fluorescence emission with maximum peak appears in the blue region 473 nm for H2mpca ligand, while under excitation at 373 nm, the strongest emission peak of H2tfbdc ligand appears at 424 nm, which is attributed to the intraligand (\u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* and/or n \u2192 \u03c0*) fluorescence emission.

The first discharging and charging capacities of the Zn-ODCP electrode are 992 mAh g-1 and 392 mAh g-1, respectively, and an initial Coulombic efficiency of 39.5% can be obtained. The irreversible capacity of 600 mAh g-1 should be ascribed to the formation of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) and the electrolyte decomposition; such phenomena of lower initial Coulombic efficiency have been observed in metal oxide nanomaterials and MOF/CP based materials.
