The result indicates that multiple coordination sites and the flexible nature of the Htrb ligand exhibit significant effects on the construction of the inorganic-organic hybrid complexes. Strikingly, compounds 1, 3, and 4 show highly photocatalytic activity for the degradation of organic pollutants MB and MO under UV light irradiation. The \u22c5OH quenching experiment using the TAB as a \u22c5OH scavenger implies that the photodegradation of catalysts 1, 3, and 4 toward MB is predominately through attack of \u22c5OH radicalsn. Remarkably, 1 and 4 show the efficient fluorescent probe for Cr3+ ions and high selectivity with strong emission quenching effects over other metal ions.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 38, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information is available free of\ncharge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications\nwebsite</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.cgd.5b01226\">10.1021/acs.cgd.5b01226</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Experimental section,\nselected bond lengths and angles, coordination modes of the Htrb ligands\nin <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>4</bold>, the proposed photodegradation\nmechanism of MB with <bold>1</bold> as catalyst under UV light irradiation,\nabsorption spectra of the MO and MB solutions during the decomposition\nreaction under UV irradiation without any catalyst, absorption spectra\nof the MB solution during the decomposition reaction in the presence\nof <bold>1</bold>/TAB and photocatalytic decomposition of MB solution\nunder UV with the use of compound <bold>1</bold> and <bold>1</bold> in the presence of TAB, emission spectra of compounds <bold>1</bold> and <bold>4</bold>, TG curve of compounds <bold>2</bold> and <bold>4</bold> (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.cgd.5b01226/suppl_file/cg5b01226_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.cgd.5b01226.
