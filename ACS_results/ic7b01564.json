Four hybrid species with 3D host-guest pairs, 2D layers, and 1D chains were obtained. Compounds 1-4 were prepared by changing the organic ligands under similar synthesis conditions. When the ptz ligand was used, compound 1 with a 3D host-guest structure, made up of a Cu-ptz coordination complex as the 3D host and an Evans-Showell-type polyoxoanion as the guest, was isolated. In 1, each rigid ptz ligand acts as a multidentate bridging ligand directly linked to Cu2+ cations to yield a 2D layer. Because of 2D layers being packed together, a 3D supramolecular channel frame is constructed, which has large enough cavities to accommodate Evans-Showell-type polyoxoanions. When the bim molecule was used in place of ptz, compound 2 with a 2D covalent layer was obtained, in which each bim molecule is a monodentate ligand coordinating to a Cu2+ cation to form [Cu(bim)2(H2O)2] subunits that are linked with the terminal O atoms of the [Co2Mo10H4O38]6- polyoxoanions. The differences of the ptz and bim ligands in coordination mode result in different hybrid structures. When a flexible dpdo ligand was used, compound 3 showing a different 2D layer was prepared, in which the dpdo ligand utilizes its O donors coordinating to Cu2+ cations to produce Cu-dpdo coordination fragments that then are linked with the [Co2Mo10H4O38]6- polyoxoanions. Compounds 2 and 3 are the first 2D inorganic-organic hybrids built up from Evans-Showell-type POMs. Considering the different coordination behaviors and ligand lengths of rigid bim and flexible dpdo molecules, both 2D structures have different topological structures, respectively showing a 4-connected 44 chiral net and a 3-connected 63 net.

From , it can be seen that many strip-type channels with dimensions of ca. 12.9 \u00c5 \u00d7 8.3 \u00c5 are generated by stacking the adjacent layers. Each channel just holds one Evans-Showell-type anion (ca. 11.8 \u00c5 \u00d7 6.7 \u00c5). In the structure, Evans-Showell-type anions are supposed as templates in the process of formation and trinuclear subunits are assembled around them by electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions, so that the 3D host-guest structure is produced (Figures S4 and S5). One kind of chiral [Co2Mo10H4O38]6- anion forms one kind of chiral channel, and the opposite-handed anion produces another kind of chiral channel, which results in an achiral host-guest architecture of 1. So far, such a host-guest structure with an Evans-Showell-type anion as the template has never been reported. Thus, compound 1 represents the first example of host-guest architecture built up from such kinds of POMs. Moreover, weak hydrogen-bonding interactions (O13\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5H-C11 = 3.125 \u00c5) between C atoms of ligands and O atoms of the [Co2Mo10H4O38]6- clusters are important to stabilize the 3D host-guest structure.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 21, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Ball\u2013stick\nview of the 1D coordination complex chain in <bold>1</bold>, showing\nthe alternately arranged trinuclear clusters.

The filtrate had no catalytic effect on the oxidation of methyl phenyl sulfide, revealing that it is a heterogeneous catalyst. The catalytic performance remains high (conversion 95.6-99%) when the isolated catalyst is reused three times. In addition, the PXRD patterns before and after the catalytic reaction are identical (Figure S18). The IR spectrum of compound 1 after reaction also retains the characteristic peaks of the compound, indicating that the structural components are stable (Figure S19).

The difference is that dpdo (0.019 g, 0.1 mmol) and CuCl2\u22c52H2O (0.068 g, 0.4 mmol) were in order dissolved in 15 mL of acetonitrile/water (3:2, v/v) in the synthesis of 3.
