By controlling the ratio of Ag to ligand, stepwise formation of the 1:2 (complex 1), 2:2 (2a-c), and 3:2 (3) (M:L) complexes can be realized, in which the carbene carbon donor shows a priority over the bpy units when coordinating with the silver(I) ion. Hence, the coordinately incomplete ligands are present in the complexes 1 and 2a-c (one or two bpy units are free), while in 3 all the coordination donors are involved in the metal coordination.

It is noteworthy that only\na few Ag<sup>I</sup>-containing coordination polymers exhibit such\ncharacteristic emissions above 600 nm. The emission intensity of the silver complexes is fairly weak in\ncomparison to that of the free ligands (Figures S8 and S9, ), which could be ascribed\nto the change of the environmental rigidity by coordination or the\nheavy atom effect of Ag.

Broad emission bands at 508, 532, and 638 nm for 2b and 488, 515, and 624 nm for 3 were observed upon excitation at 415 and 399 nm, respectively. The origin of the emission at 532 and 515 nm might be the result of metal-perturbed intraligand (IL) transitions, whereas the high-energy emission at 400-490 nm is mainly associated with intraligand \u03c0-\u03c0* transitions. The emission observed at 638 nm for 2b and 624 nm for 3 may be due to metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT), which is also consistent with the fluorescence of a simple Ag complex [Ag2L2(ClO4)2] (L = 4,5-diazospirobifluorene, a bipyridine-like ligand). Complexes 2a,c and 1 do not emit in this region but show dominating intramolecular \u03c0-\u03c0* interactions of the ligands. Hence, the luminescence properties observed for complexes 1, 2a-c, and 3 reflect a significant rearrangement of the ligand with varying ligation modes. It is noteworthy that only a few AgI-containing coordination polymers exhibit such characteristic emissions above 600 nm. The emission intensity of the silver complexes is fairly weak in comparison to that of the free ligands (Figures S8 and S9, ), which could be ascribed to the change of the environmental rigidity by coordination or the heavy atom effect of Ag. Moreover, the vast majority of AgI complexes are known to emit at low temperatures, while only a few monomeric and polymeric Ag complexes display intense photoluminescence at room temperature. \n\nAg2L2(PF6)2 (2b)\n\nYield: 58 mg, 86%.
