The methane adsorption isotherm shows type-I sorption behavior with an uptake of 2.5 wt % at 80 bar and 295 K (Figure ). After removal of the terminal bonded EtOH, the amount of hydrogen uptake (36.2 cm3 g-1) is 272% of that (13.3 cm3 g-1) before the removal of ethanol at 77 K (Figure , inset). It should be noted that very large isosteric heats of H2 adsorption were calculated at low loadings, with a value of 12.46 kJ mol-1 at zero loading (CPO-27-Ni, 13.5 kJ mol-1) ().", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "complex 1", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "60 to 175", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "removal of lattice water molecules and coordinated EtOH", "condition": "under a nitrogen flow"}, {"value": "60 to 100", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "removal of lattice water molecules", "condition": "under a nitrogen flow"}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "", "unit": "", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "", "condition": "type I sorption behavior"}, {"adsorbate": "methane", "adsorbed amount": "2.5", "unit": "wt%", "temperature": "295 K", "pressure": "80 bar", "condition": "type-I sorption behavior"}, {"adsorbate": "H2", "adsorbed amount": "36.2", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "", "condition": "after removal of the terminal bonded EtOH"}], "surface area": [{"type": "Langmuir", "probe": "", "value": "479", "unit": "m2 g-1", "condition": ""}, {"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "367", "unit": "m2 g-1", "condition": ""}], "pore diameter": [{"value": "8.74", "unit": "\u00c5", "condition": ""}], "pore volume": [{"probe": "N2", "value": "0.155", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "condition": "at P/P 0 = 0.975"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["decomposition_temperature", "gas_adsorption", "surface_area", "pore_diameter", "pore_volume"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['decomposition_temperature', 'gas_adsorption', 'surface_area', 'pore_diameter', 'pore_volume']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n  {\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"name\": \"complex 1\",\n      \"symbol\": \"\",\n      \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"decomposition temperature\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"60 to 175\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"removal of lattice water molecules and coordinated EtOH\",\n        \"condition\": \"under a nitrogen flow\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"value\": \"60 to 100\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"removal of lattice water molecules\",\n        \"condition\": \"under a nitrogen flow\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"gas adsorption\": [\n      {\n        \"adsorbate\": \"N2\",\n        \"adsorbed amount\": \"\",\n        \"unit\": \"\",\n        \"temperature\": \"77 K\",\n        \"pressure\": \"\",\n        \"condition\": \"type I sorption behavior\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"adsorbate\": \"methane\",\n        \"adsorbed amount\": \"2.5\",\n        \"unit\": \"wt%\",\n        \"temperature\": \"295 K\",\n        \"pressure\": \"80 bar\",\n        \"condition\": \"type-I sorption behavior\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"adsorbate\": \"H2\",\n        \"adsorbed amount\": \"36.2\",\n        \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n        \"temperature\": \"77 K\",\n        \"pressure\": \"\",\n        \"condition\": \"after removal of the terminal bonded EtOH\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"surface area\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"Langmuir\",\n        \"probe\": \"\",\n        \"value\": \"479\",\n        \"unit\": \"m2 g-1\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"BET\",\n        \"probe\": \"\",\n        \"value\": \"367\",\n        \"unit\": \"m2 g-1\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"pore diameter\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"8.74\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00c5\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"pore volume\": [\n      {\n        \"probe\": \"N2\",\n        \"value\": \"0.155\",\n        \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n        \"condition\": \"at P/P 0 = 0.975\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 4, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Two kinds of chiral tetrahedral SBUs.
