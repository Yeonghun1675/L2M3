PCN-26 contains two different types of cages, octahedral and cuboctahedral, to form a polyhedron-stacked three-dimensional framework with open channels in three orthogonal directions. Gas adsorption studies of N2, Ar, and H2 on an activated PCN-26 at 77 K, 1 bar, reveals a Langmuir surface area of 2545 m2/g, a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 1854 m2/g, a total pore volume of 0.84 cm3/g, and a H2 uptake capacity of 2.57 wt %. Additionally, PCN-26 exhibits a CO2/N2 selectivity of 49:1 and CO2/CH4 selectivity of 8.4:1 at 273 K. To investigate properties of gas adsorption and the adsorption sites for CO2 in activated PCN-26, theoretical simulations of the adsorption isotherms of CO2, CH4, and N2 at different temperatures were carried out. Experimental results corroborate very well with those of molecular simulations.\n\nRigid aromatic polycarboxylate ligands are a widely used family of organic ligands in the preparation of MOFs, and a large number of MOFs have been successfully constructed by using ditopic, tritopic, tetratopic or hexatopic carboxylate ligands. Octatopic carboxylate ligands, on the other hand, are very rare. This can be ascribed to the diverse ligand conformation and steric congestion of an octatopic carboxylate ligand as well as the difficulty in synthesis of such a ligand. However, such an octatopic ligand may help to produce new MOFs with improved porosity and stability. Herein, we report the synthesis of the acid of a flexible octatopic carboxylate ligand, tetrakis[(3,5-dicarboxyphenyl)-oxamethyl]methane (H8TDM, scheme ). H8TDM reacted with Cu(II) under solvothermal reaction conditions to give a new MOF, Cu4(H2O)4(TDM)\u22c5xS  (PCN-26\u22c5xS ,  S  presents noncoordinated solvent molecules, PCN = porous coordination network), in which a Cu(II) paddle-wheel secondary building unit (SBU) acts as an inorganic node. PCN-26 contains two different types of cages, octahedral and cuboctahedral, to form a polyhedron-stacked three-dimensional framework with open channels in three orthogonal directions. Gas adsorption studies of N2, Ar, and H2 on an activated PCN-26 at 77 K, 1 bar, reveals a Langmuir surface area of 2545 m2/g, a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 1854 m2/g, a total pore volume of 0.84 cm3/g, and a H2 uptake capacity of 2.57 wt %. Additionally, PCN-26 exhibits a CO2/N2 selectivity of 49:1 and CO2/CH4 selectivity of 8.4:1 at 273 K. To investigate properties of gas adsorption and the adsorption sites for CO2 in activated PCN-26, theoretical simulations of the adsorption isotherms of CO2, CH4, and N2 at different temperatures were carried out. Experimental results corroborate very well with those of molecular simulations.\n\nIn PCN-26, both [Cu2(O2CR)4] SBUs and quaternary carbon atoms of TDM8- act as four-connected nodes, while the CH2O-isophthalate moieties act as three-connected nodes, the framework is a trinodal net and adopts a new network topology with the Schla\u0308fli symbol of {311.410.57}4{32.62.72}2{36} (Figure ). Three-dimensional square channels are observed from the a, b and c axis with the sizes of 7.57 \u00d7 7.57 \u00c52, 8.13 \u00d7 8.13 \u00c52 and 7.93 \u00d7 7.93 \u00c52, respectively (Figure ). After removal of the coordinated solvent molecules, activated PCN-26 was obtained with a solvent accessible volume of 66.2% (calculated using PLATON). PXRD confirmed the phase purity of the bulk samples (PCN-26\u22c5xS), as shown in Figure S2 in the . Inside the channels of PCN-26\u22c5xS, lie crystallographically disordered solvent molecules. TGA analysis (see Figure S3 in the ) showed that as synthesized PCN-26\u22c5xS lost 38% weight because of solvent molecules, and the framework decomposed at temperatures above 290 \u00b0C.\n\nGas Sorption\n\nTo investigate the permanent porosity of PCN-26, we performed gas sorption experiments for N2, Ar, H2, CO2, and CH4. The freshly prepared PCN-26\u22c5xS crystals were fully activated to obtain PCN-26-ac sample according to the procedure reported in our previous work. A careful examination of the PXRD data of the activated samples reveals that PCN-26-ac keeps its crystallinity and framework structure upon activation (see Figure S3 in the ). The N2 sorption isotherms, as shown in Figure , reveal that PCN-26-ac exhibits typical type I sorption behavior, a characteristic of microporous materials, which is coincidental with the crystal structure. Derived from the N2 adsorption data, the Langmuir surface area of PCN-26-ac is 2385 m2/g, corresponding to a BET surface area of 1733 m2/g and a total pore volume of 0.84 cm3/g. The former is smaller than the solvent-accessible surface area estimated based on the crystal structure (2976 m2/g using a probe of 3.68 \u00c5 in diameter) using Materials Studio 5.0. Comparing with N2 sorption isotherms, the Ar sorption isotherms display a Langmuir surface area of 2545 m2/g and a BET surface area of 1854 m2/g (Figure ). The corresponding total pore volume is 0.84 cm3/g, which is consistent with that from N2 adsorption data.\n\nExcept for the N2 and H2 uptakes at low temperatures, CO2, CH4, and N2 adsorption measurements of PCN-26-ac have been carried out at 195, 273, and 298 K, respectively (Figures - ). At 195 K, PCN-26-ac adsorbs CO2 up to 490.5 cm3/g (753 Torr), CH4 238.4 cm3/g (809 Torr), and N2 68.0 cm3/g (810 Torr), respectively. The adsorption capacity for CO2 can reach 181.3 cm3/g (800 Torr) and for CH4 39.1 cm3/g (900 Torr), but for N2 only 8.76 cm3/g (810 Torr) at 273 K. With an increase of temperature to 298 K, the adsorption capacity for CO2 reaches 109.1 cm3/g (800 Torr) and for CH4 24.1 cm3/g (800 Torr), but for N2 only 8.76 cm3/g (810 Torr), as shown in Figure . The results demonstrated the guest-evacuated PCN-26-ac has the ability to selectively adsorb CO2 over CH4 and N2. To estimate the CO2/CH4, CO2/N2 adsorption selectivity, the Henry's Law selectivity at 273 and 298 K is calculated. A high CO2/N2 selectivity of 49:1 was obtained at 273 K. With an increase in the temperature at 298 K, the CO2/N2 selectivity still reaches 21:1. Meanwhile, CO2/CH4 selectivity of 8.4:1 and 6.3:1 were obtained at 273 and 298 K, respectively. The gas-adsorption selectivity of PCN-26 is higher than most of the reported values for MOF materials. \n\nReferences\n\nPCN-26: C37H28Cu4O24, M = 1110.75, 0.12 \u00d7 0.08 \u00d7 0.07 mm3, orthorhombic, space group Pbcm (No. 57), a = 12.2473(5), b = 25.914(5), c = 25.9141(9) \u00c5, V = 8224.6(4) \u00c53, Z = 4, D c = 0.897 g/cm3, F 000 = 2232, MoK\u03b1 radiation, \u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5, T = 173(2)K, 2\u03b8max = 52.8\u00b0, 35483 reflections collected, 8349 unique (R int = 0.1352).
