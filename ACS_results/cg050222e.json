Beyond this temperature, decomposition of the network was observed. \n\nThe magnetic susceptibility of 1 was measured in the 2-300 K temperature range and is shown in Figure  with \u03c7M T versus T plots. The experimental \u03c7M T value at 300 K is 4.26 emu mol-1 K, which is somewhat lower than the spin-only value (4.38 emu mol-1 K) expected for uncoupled high-spin Mn(II) ions. Upon cooling, the \u03c7M T products increase slowly at about 50 K and then increase rapidly on further cooling. These features indicate a dominant ferromagnetic interaction in 1. The oxidation state of Mn ions in 1 is +2 by the saturation magnetization at 2 K, and the results are  in good agreement with the crystal structure determination mentioned before.
