Data were collected on a Bruker X8 Kappa APEX II charge-coupled device (CCD) area-detector diffractometer (Mo K\u03b1 graphite-monochromated radiation, \u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5) controlled by the APEX-2 software package (version 2.1-RC13; 2006), and equipped with an Oxford Cryosystems Series 700 cryostream. Images were processed using the software package SAINT+ (version 7.23a; 1997-2005), and data were corrected for absorption by the multi-scan semi-empirical method implemented in SADABS (version 2.01; 1998). The structures were solved using the Patterson synthesis algorithm implemented in SHELXS-97, which allowed the immediate location of the Ln3+ metallic centres. All remaining non-hydrogen atoms were located from difference Fourier maps calculated from successive full-matrix least squares refinement cycles on F 2  using SHELXL-97. All non-hydrogen atoms were successfully refined using anisotropic displacement parameters.
