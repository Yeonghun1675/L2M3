Temperature-dependent powder X-ray diffraction (TD-PXRD) for 1 revealed that the Cd-MOF belongs to the robust family of MOFs and that it is stable up to ~300 \u00b0C. After this temperature is exceeded, the intensity of signals gradually diminishes, which is associated with breaking of coordination bonds and degradation of the material (a). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for Cd-MOF 1 shows stepwise loss of mass with a plateau in the range of 280-310 \u00b0C (b, Figure S11). The first step, before the plateau is reached, is associated with the loss of two DMF and one H2O molecules per Cd2 formula unit (found 11.9%; calcd 11.3%). The second pronounced step with a dTG minimum at ~330 \u00b0C is ascribed to breaking of coordination bonds between cadmium ions and linkers and decomposition of the framework. To get a deeper insight into the framework thermal stability, additional TG measurements were performed for the sample of 1 that had been soaked in water for 24 h (1H  2  O). This material retains its structure and reversibly exchanges DMF molecule for H2O, which was confirmed by both PXRD and IR spectroscopy (Figure S4). The first distinct step in the TGA curve for 1H  2  O, with a dTGA minimum at 93 \u00b0C, corresponds to the loss of nine water guest molecules per Cd2 cluster (found 11.2%, calcd 11.2%). The number of guest water molecules for 1H  2  O was also confirmed by elemental analysis (Table S2). The comparison of TG analyses for both samples clearly indicates weaker interactions of water molecules in the framework 1H  2  O and thus softer activation conditions required for 1H  2  O compared to the as-made MOF 1 (containing more strongly interacting DMF molecules). In general, the exchange of MOF guest molecules can be described as the simplest postsynthetic modification. In case of Cd-MOF 1 both evacuation as well as replacement of initial guests have impact on their UV-vis spectra. The as-synthesized material 1 is colorless and, after evacuation of DMF/H2O (1act) or after replacing them with water (1H  2  O), becomes yellow, which is confirmed by diffuse reflectance spectra of these samples (Figure S15).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe first highly water-stable, robust non-interpenetrated 3D mixed-linker coordination polymer with a sulfonyl-functionalized dicarboxylate linker and an acylhydrazone colinker has been obtained in solution and by mechanochemical synthetic method.
