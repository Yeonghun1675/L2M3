The corresponding reaction of MeL with [Cu(MeCN)4]PF6 initially gave a colorless oil, but green crystals were obtained in low yield when this was dissolved in an acetonitrile/ether solution. Single-crystal X-ray data show the structure to be [Cu2(MeL)2(\u03bc-OH)(\u03bc-4-MepyO)](PF6)2 (5; 4-MepyO is the 4-methyl-2-pyridyloxylato anion; Chart  and Figure ). The \u03bc-4-MeOpy and \u03bc-OH bridges give rise to an unusual dimetallic complex with inequivalent Cu(II) centers 3.404 \u00c5 apart. Cu1 is in an approximate square-based pyramidal coordination sphere with an \"N4O\" donor set, whereas Cu2 is in a distorted \"N4O2\" rhombic environment. The hydroxo bridge participates in an intramolecular hydrogen bond with N16 of a pyridyloxy arm, and its oxygen atom O14 also forms a close contact (ca. 3.03 \u00c5) with N14 of another. The formation of 5 could be envisaged to occur according to the following equation, although we have not detected hydrogen peroxide because it would be expected to react with any Cu(I) species formed.
