Intermetallic platinum and gold silver-alkyne complexes have been reported. Coordination of the silver ion with a phenyl group of 2 occurs in \u03b71 fashion and places silver atop the ortho carbon on the phenyl ligand. The Ag-C-C angles are 87.6\u00b0 and 95.9\u00b0, respectively. The silver atom is also coordinated with one of the carboxamidate ligand carbonyl oxygens. The Rh-Rh-C angles of 159.0\u00b0 and 155.0\u00b0 did not change significantly compared to the structure without the silver complex. Interestingly, apical phenyl ligands are not coplanar in this complex, and one of the phenyl groups has been rotated about 90\u00b0 around the rhodium phenyl axis. The Rh-Rh distance has not been affected by complex formation with silver and is shorter only by 0.02 \u00c5\u0301.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 33, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig12\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>12</label>\n<caption>\n<p>View of the bisphenydirhodium(III,III)\u2013silver salt adduct (<bold>12</bold>).
