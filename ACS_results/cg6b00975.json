The TG-DSC curve of pure AP is shown in Figure S15, where three peaks are observed at 247.7, 307, and 437 \u00b0C, associated with the phase transition temperature of orthorhombic AP to cubic AP, low temperature decomposition (LTD) of AP, and high temperature decomposition (HTD) of AP.

To the best of our knowledge, the catalytic performance of this in situ obtained \u03b1-Mn2O3 is by far the best. Then, a series of control tests also were carried out to understand the catalytic mechanism, such as the catalytic performance of the same mole ratio of MnSO4, H2BTO, rod-shaped and monodispersed \u03b1-Mn2O3. The DSC curves of different mixed systems are shown in c, it can be seen that the MnSO4 and H2BTO have little effect on the thermal decomposition of AP. When using as-prepared rod-shaped \u03b1-Mn2O3 or monodispersed \u03b1-Mn2O3 as the catalyst, the decomposition temperature of AP decreased to 311 \u00b0C and 293 \u00b0C, respectively, which demonstrates both the rod-shaped \u03b1-Mn2O3 and monodispersed \u03b1-Mn2O3 are able to effectively drop the decomposition temperature of AP. Moreover, the performance of the monodispersed \u03b1-Mn2O3 is better than that of rod-shaped \u03b1-Mn2O3 which should be attributed to the higher specific surface area of former. Furthermore, compared with the decomposition of AP catalyzed by in situ \u03b1-Mn2O3, these two catalysts show less effective performance owing to the reduction of the specific surface caused by the agglomeration and the nonuniform dispersion, which illustrates that the catalytic performance of \u03b1-Mn2O3 is tightly related to the dispersion extent and the specific surface area of the catalyst. In contrast, in the system of in situ generated catalyst, because the existence of AP compound 1 can rapidly burn and decompose into catalytic nanoparticles, then the particles are dispersed uniformly by the large amounts of decomposition gas liberated from the energetic organic linker of compound 1, which makes the dispersion extent of the catalyst in this process far better than that in mechanical mixing due to the assistance of the decomposition gas. So the catalytic performance of in situ synthesized catalytic species is more efficienct than as-prepared \u03b1-Mn2O3.
