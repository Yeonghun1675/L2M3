Because the chelating catecholate ligand is dianionic, complexation of the O\ue5fbVIV moiety to it balances out the remaining charges so that additional coordinated ligand, if any, must be neutral. While it is possible that one or both of the neutral acetylacetonate (Hacac) ligands remain bound to the V center after metallation, we were unable to confirm their presence (or absence) using FTIR spectroscopy (Figure S48 in the ) given the overlapping peaks in the 1500-1600 cm-1 region of the spectra of the MOFs with those expected from the C\ue5fbC bond of the conjugated \u03b1-carbonyl enol (~1526 cm-1) and C\ue5fbO (~1562 cm-1) of the acac (quoted values are for VO(acac)2). Indeed, the spectra of CatBrO MOF and the metallated V-CatBrO MOF are quite similar. However, the FTIR spectrum of a physical mixture of CatBrO MOF and VO(acac)2 (0.35 mol %, to simulate the theoretical loading of one acac per vanadyl ion in MOF) exhibits a noticeable growth in the 1526-1560 cm-1 region, relative to the adjacent 1620 cm-1 peak, that is not seen in the spectrum V-CatBrO MOF, suggesting that either Hacac is not present in V-CatBrO MOF or that FTIR is insensitive to the small amount of Hacac in the sample.
