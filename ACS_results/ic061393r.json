The interlayer spacing decreased by 3.73 \u00c5 from 1a to 1b. Such a significant (3.73 \u00c5) decrease by the partial removal of solvents of crystallization (~1720 \u00c53 reduction of the crystal volume) has never been reported for layered ionic supramolecular compounds with -1-charged small counteranions. In addition, the disposition of infinite-chain Pd\u22c5p-bpy fragments in the layer was almost retained (Pd\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Pd = 26.98 \u00c5 for 1a vs 26.71 \u00c5 for 1b). The compound 1c (1 with 4.5DMSO\u22c53.5DMF), {[(en)Pd(p-bpy)]2[\u03b1-SiW12O40]\u22c54.5DMSO\u22c53.5DMF}\u221e, was formed by the addition of small amount of water (1 mL) to the synthetic solution of 1a. The skeletal structure of 1c (Figures f-h and 2b) was the same as that of 1b and showed that two DMSO molecules bridged the infinite-chain cationic frag- ments with a hydrogen-bonding interaction (N(en)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O(DMSO) = 2.714-3.916 \u00c5) and interacted with ethylenediamine moieties. One DMF molecule was coordinated to palladium at the axial position. The disordered DMSO/DMF (0.5/0.5) molecule existed between the layers. The solvents of crystallization in 1b would occupy similar positions to those of DMSO and DMF in 1c.
