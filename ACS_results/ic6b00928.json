The Q st value for CO2 does not change appreciably with loading, indicating uniformity of the binding sites. Additionally, the Q st value for the present compound is moderately high, which is larger than those of MOFs with no open metal sites or polar functional groups (with Q st of 16-20 kJ mol-1), but it is comparable to those of MAF-25 (26.3(5) kJ mol-1) and InOF-1(29 kJ mol-1). The sorption performance of JXNU-2(Sm) for CO2 prompted us to study the sorption of several fuel molecules such as CH4, C2H6, C3H8, and C2H2. At 273 K, JXNU-2(Sm) takes up less CH4 but adsorbs some amounts of C2H6, C3H8, and C2H2. Its uptake capacity for C2H6, C3H8, and C2H2 is 38.3, 60.7, and 79.1 cm3 g-1 at 1 atm, respectively (). A hysteresis profile is observed in the isotherms of C2H2, which indicates a strong interaction between the adsorbed C2H2 molecules and the sulfonate-containing pore surface. The micropore surface is decorated with the sulfonate groups, which has a polarized environment and has a high affinity to C2H2.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']"}}, {"idx": 16, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig3\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) The N<sub>2</sub> sorption isotherm at 77 K and (b) CO<sub>2</sub> sorption isotherms\nat 273 and 293 K (solid symbols: adsorption, open symbols: desorption)\nfor <bold>JXNU-2</bold>(Sm).
