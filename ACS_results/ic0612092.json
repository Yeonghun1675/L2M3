Their \u03c7M T values decrease gradually upon cooling, reach minima at about 22 K, and then increase abruptly, indicating a ferrimagnetic-like character, which might be due to the noncompensation between the AF-coupled spins of the MnII and CrIII ions in the ladders. The further sharp decreases after the maxima at about 14 and 16 K, respectively, might be caused by the magnetic saturation and/or AF interactions between the ladders. Long-range orderings were confirmed by field-cooled magnetizations (FCMs) and ac susceptibilities at different frequencies of 277-4111 Hz in a zero dc field (Figures S5-S7 in the Supporting Information). The FCMs at 100 Oe for 2 (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information) and at 20 Oe for 3 (inset of Figure ) and the real parts of ac susceptibilities display maxima at about 3 and 9 K, respectively, while the out-of-phase component (\u03c7\u2018\u2018) remains zero, clearly indicating the occurrence of 3D AF ordering. The transition temperatures (T N) were estimated as 2.8 K (for 2) and 9 K (for 3) by the peak of \u03c7ac vs T. The maxima in \u03c7M vs T plots gradually disappear when the applied fields are increased, suggesting a metamagnetic behavior.
