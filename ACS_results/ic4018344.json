One consequence of this change in the fraction of ordered spins contributing to either magnetic Bragg reflections in the ordered phases or diffuse scattering in the paramagnetic phase is that, below 8 K, the background in the difference patterns is negative due to the reduction in magnetic diffuse scattering upon ordering; this effect can be clearly seen in Figures  and . The observation of Bragg peaks at two different temperatures is consistent with their being two different phase transitions, while the two-stage change in the magnetic contribution to the background and the rise in intensity of the 110 reflection above 5.75 K are both consistent with a different fraction of the spins being paramagnetic in each temperature region. This is different to the reported data on 1\u22c53H2O, where there was no magnetic contribution to the 110 reflection; a similar integration on those data reveals a parasitic contribution from the incommensurate phase (Figure ) with no other contribution below 6 K. This result shows both the presence of only two phases in 1 and the absence of the incommensurate phase in the dehydrated material and, consequently, that there is a significant variation in the magnetic properties of 1 and 1\u22c53H2O.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 16, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig5\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>5</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Temperature dependence of the 110 magnetic Bragg reflection for <bold>1</bold> (blue) and <bold>1</bold>\u00b73H<sub>2</sub>O (black).</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr5\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2013-018344_0005.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 5  Temperature dependence of the 110 magnetic Bragg reflection for 1 (blue) and 1\u22c53H2O (black).
