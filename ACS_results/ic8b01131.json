The products are obtained upon reacting a small molar excess of 1,4-pyrazine (Pyz) or 1,4-piperazine (Ppz) with the aforementioned precursors (with respect to a 3:1 mixing stoichiometry with M3PzF 3 or 2:1 with [Cu(MeCN)4]BF4 reactions) in benzene/toluene/dichloromethane for the solvent-mediated transformations. Solventless transformations with the same mixing stoichiometries entailed mechanical grinding as well as simply exposing the solid metal precursor to the ambient vapor pressure of the Pyz volatile solid (whereas Ppz is not volatile so its solventless reactions are investigated only via mechanical grinding).

In addition to the solvent-mediated pathway, solventless reactions involving pyrazine can be carried out by vapor diffusion upon spontaneous sublimation at room temperature (without heating solid pyrazine) onto the metal precursor, whereas all metal precursor/ligand combinations are susceptible to reactions by mechanical grinding. The reaction progress in all six products could be monitored by a color change (in the physical and/or luminescence color). Whereas all Cu(I) complexes (1-3 and 6) exhibit permanent discoloration, the Ag(I)/Pyz product 4 is luminescent, while the formation of the Ag(I)/Ppz analogue 5 can be followed by quenching of the luminescence of the benzene solvate of the Ag3PzF 3 trimer precursor upon mechanical grinding (-). The metal precursor of 6, [Cu(MeCN)4]BF4, is a nonluminescent white solid that exhibits discoloration upon reaction with pyrazine. On the other hand, the progress of Cu3PzF 3-based transformations could be monitored by both absorption and emission color changes, i.e., via permanent discoloration of the white Cu3PzF 3 solid and the complete quenching of its bright orange phosphorescence upon introduction of pyrazine. Single crystals of all six samples were obtained by crystal growth from organic solvents, and then their structures were determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis. In 1-5, the Ag(I) or Cu(I) atoms are connected to the pyrazolate, which acts as a chelating ligand.
