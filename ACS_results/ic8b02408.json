Under a pressure of 0.40 kbar, the \u03c7M T value of 2 was 2.51 cm3 K mol-1 at 300 K, which was smaller than that under 1 atm, probably because external pressures shortened the Fe-N bond lengths toward the distance favoring the LS state. Upon cooling, the \u03c7M T value decreased slowly from 300 to 125 K and then decreased abruptly to 100 K. Between 100 and 2 K, the \u03c7M T value decreased slowly to 0.25 cm3 K mol-1, which was ascribed to the contribution from the paramagnetism of the HS iron(II) ions. The \u03c7M T values in the whole temperature range indicated that the spin transition was complete and centered at 113 K in the cooling and warming modes. When the pressure was increased to 0.61 kbar, the transition temperature dramatically increased. The \u03c7M T value dropped to 0.5 cm3 K mol-1 from 300 to 200 K, remained almost constant in the range from 200 to 25 K, and then continued to decrease to 0.25 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K. Under pressures of both 0.40 and 0.61 kbar, the \u03c7M T value decreased to 0.25 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K instead of the zero calculated for LS iron(II) ions, which could be mainly attributed to the residual population of HS iron(II) ions because some iron(II) ions on the crystal surface were not fully coordinated by the bttmb ligands. As the external pressure was increased, the spin transition moved to a higher temperature more gradually because additional pressure enhanced the ligand field around the iron(II) ions and reduced the difference of the chemical environments adjacent to the iron(II) sites, which was consistent with the literature report. The external pressure increased the zero-point energy difference \u0394\u0395\u00b0 and decreased the activation energy \u0394W\u00b0; thus, the iron(II) ions in 2 favored the LS state. After removal of the external pressure, the structure and Fe-N distances as well as the relatively high \u0394\u0395\u00b0 remained and thus the color of 2 remained purple with the LS-state iron(II) ions, while heating under reduced pressure/vacuum recovered \u0394\u0395\u00b0 and \u0394W\u00b0 and the spin state of the iron(II) ions as well as the color of 2 turned back.
