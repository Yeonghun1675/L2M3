Although\nthe study of Cd\u00ad(II) selective sorbents and sensors shows that nitrogen-containing\ngroups are the best group for this purpose, the selective\nsorption of TMU-60 to Cd\u00ad(II) can be considered as a synergistic effect\nbetween the active sites and the pore size and morphology.

The TMU-60 reaches over 90% of its sorption\ncapacity in less than 10 min, which is a remarkable record among all\nof the Cd\u00ad(II) sorbent. In order to investigate the sorption mechanism\ngoverning the sorption process and to determine whether the sorption\nmechanism is controlled by a chemical or physical mechanism, conventional\nsorption kinetics models such as pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order,\nand intraparticle diffusion are used to study the experimental data.\nThe correlation coefficient of the pseudo-second-order model for Cd\u00ad(II)\nis close to 1 (<italic>R</italic>\n<sup>2</sup> = 0.9999) and exhibited\nthat the pseudo-second-order model is more consistent with experimental\ndata than the other model.

Therefore, supramolecular interactions between cadmium\nion and the free electrons of ligand nitrogens and the electrostatic\ninteraction between the cation and the dipole of nitrogen on the dihydropyrazine\nring of ligand are proposed as the dominant interactions between the\nmetal ion and the structure.

The positive \u0394<italic>S</italic> means\nthe increased randomness with Cd\u00ad(II) sorption.

The ICP results for TMU-60-Cd indicate a ratio of about 1.5 to 1 for Zn/Cd, which is consistent with the results obtained for the remaining solution and shows a value of 155 mg\u22c5g-1 sorption capacity of Cd(II) by TMU-60. Complete kinetic and thermodynamic studies were carried out on the sorption process, which confirms the second-order sorption kinetics, Langmuir isotherm, and negative \u0394G for the sorption process (). Also, the selectivity of sorption in the presence of other background metal ions such as Hg(II), Pb(II), Cd(II), Zn(II), Co(II), Cr(II), Fe(II), and Ca(II) showed that the TMU-60, even in the presence of other metal ions, remains a selective cadmium sorbent and other metals do not interfere in its selective action (). Although the study of Cd(II) selective sorbents and sensors shows that nitrogen-containing groups are the best group for this purpose, the selective sorption of TMU-60 to Cd(II) can be considered as a synergistic effect between the active sites and the pore size and morphology. The study of the pH effect on sorption capacity indicates that the highest sorption capacity is acquired in the pH of the reaction medium and the sorption process does not require pH adjustment (B). The TMU-60 reaches over 90% of its sorption capacity in less than 10 min, which is a remarkable record among all of the Cd(II) sorbent. In order to investigate the sorption mechanism governing the sorption process and to determine whether the sorption mechanism is controlled by a chemical or physical mechanism, conventional sorption kinetics models such as pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and intraparticle diffusion are used to study the experimental data. The correlation coefficient of the pseudo-second-order model for Cd(II) is close to 1 (R 2 = 0.9999) and exhibited that the pseudo-second-order model is more consistent with experimental data than the other model. Therefore, it is compatible with chemical sorption, which indicates that transfer, exchange, or sharing of electrons has taken place. Therefore, supramolecular interactions between cadmium ion and the free electrons of ligand nitrogens and the electrostatic interaction between the cation and the dipole of nitrogen on the dihydropyrazine ring of ligand are proposed as the dominant interactions between the metal ion and the structure. The thermodynamic parameters studied in the temperature range 288-323 K are presented in . The positive changes of enthalpy (\u0394H = +3.9 kJ mol-1) for Cd(II) sorption over TMU-60 confirmed that the sorption was endothermic in accord with the increasing sorption capacity associated with increasing sorption temperature. The entropy change, \u0394S, was +15.8 J\u22c5mol-1\u22c5K-1. The low positive value of \u0394S for the sorption of Cd(II) by TMU-60 indicated a little loss of order which is common during the metal ion sorption. The positive \u0394S means the increased randomness with Cd(II) sorption. That is probably because the number of desorbed water molecules is larger than that of the adsorbed Cd(II) molecules. The free energies of sorption at 15, 25, 35, and 55 \u00b0C are -4.91, -7.09, -8.43, and -9.78 kJ mol-1, respectively. The negative free energies confirmed that sorption was spontaneous under the experimental conditions. Therefore, the driving force of Cd(II) sorption (negative \u0394G) on TMU-60 is due to an entropy effect (positive \u0394S) rather than an enthalpy change (\u0394H positive). It should be noted that TMU-60, due to its considerable sorption capacity, is the fastest Cd(II) sorbent among all MOFs ().", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 10, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig2\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(A) Sorption curve of\nCd\u00ad(II) versus contact time in aqueous solution\nby TMU-60.
