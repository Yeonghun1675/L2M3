An electron count of 385 electrons per unit cell corresponds to approximately 1 molecule of chloroform, 1 molecule of acetonitrile, and 1.6 molecules of water per asymmetric unit (CCDC-744648).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "[Cu2(hfac)4(3,4'-tpcb)]\u221e", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "(C44H24Cu2F24N4O8)\u22c51.6H2O\u22c5CH3CN\u22c5CHCl3"}, "chemical formula weight": [{"value": "1509.0", "unit": "g/mol", "condition": ""}], "crystal system": [{"value": "monoclinic", "condition": ""}], "space group": [{"value": "P21/c", "condition": ""}], "lattice parameters": [{"value": {"a": "15.5534", "b": "17.9540", "c": "20.918", "alpha": "", "beta": "98.286", "gamma": "", "condition": "T = 190(1) K"}}], "density": [{"value": "1.73", "unit": "g/cm3", "condition": ""}]}]]], "include_properties": ["chemical_formula_weight", "crystal_system", "space_group", "lattice_parameters", "density"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['chemical_formula_weight', 'crystal_system', 'space_group', 'lattice_parameters', 'density']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"[Cu2(hfac)4(3,4'-tpcb)]\u221e\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"(C44H24Cu2F24N4O8)\u22c51.6H2O\u22c5CH3CN\u22c5CHCl3\"\n        },\n        \"chemical formula weight\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"1509.0\",\n                \"unit\": \"g/mol\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"crystal system\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"monoclinic\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"space group\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"P21/c\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"lattice parameters\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": {\n                    \"a\": \"15.5534\",\n                    \"b\": \"17.9540\",\n                    \"c\": \"20.918\",\n                    \"alpha\": \"\",\n                    \"beta\": \"98.286\",\n                    \"gamma\": \"\",\n                    \"condition\": \"T = 190(1) K\"\n                }\n            }\n        ],\n        \"density\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"1.73\",\n                \"unit\": \"g/cm3\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 5, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Solid-State Synthesis of <bold>3,4\u2032-tpcb</bold> and Metallogel Formation</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"ja-2010-06095w_0004.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Solid-State Synthesis of 3,4'-tpcb and Metallogel Formation   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 10, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Metallogels upon combining Cu(BF<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\u00b7H<sub>2</sub>O and <bold>3,4\u2032-tpcb</bold>: (a) acetonitrile and (b) water.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"ja-2010-06095w_0005.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Metallogels upon combining Cu(BF4)2\u22c5H2O and 3,4'-tpcb: (a) acetonitrile and (b) water.
