These results indicate that the 3D water clathrate is easily removed from the 3D MOF, which is stable up to 272 \u00b0C. They also confirm that there are not strongly hydrogen bond interactions between the 3D water clathrate and the cavity of host molecule, and that the water clathrate exhibits liquid water properties.
