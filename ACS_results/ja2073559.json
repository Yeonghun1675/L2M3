The hydroxy side chains also impacts the local bonding environments of the Pb(II) ions. First, the S and O atoms from each side chain are bonded (chelated) to a common Pb ion [distances for the 4 side chains: (O6-Pb2, 2.941; S1-Pb2, 3.261 \u00c5), (O12-Pb2, 3.116; S4-Pb2, 3.120 \u00c5), (O5-Pb1, 3.010; S2-Pb1, 3.416 \u00c5), (O11-Pb1, 2.984; S3-Pb1, 3.182 \u00c5)], whereas one of the bridging carboxyl O-Pb bonds on each Pb ions is substantially elongated (O1-Pb1, 3.376; O3-Pb2, 3.347 \u00c5; the other five O-Pb1 distances: 2.480, 2.579, 2.457, 2.636, 2.863; the other five O-Pb2: 2.497, 2.533, 2.482, 2.735, 2.583 \u00c5). Notice also that the side chain and its ortho-carboxyl neighbor are bonded to two adjacent, separate Pb ions. In comparison with the O-Pb distances (2.486, 2.551, 2.686 \u00c5) in 1, the overall carboxyl-Pb interaction in 2 appears to be significantly weakened, and the adjacent Pb ions in 2 become farther apart at 4.785 \u00c5 (i.e., the -OH serves to push the carboxyl groups away from the Pb2+). Because the photoluminescence process is closely related to the electronic interaction across the Pb2+ centers and the organic \u03c0-systems, the weakened carboxyl-Pb interaction in 2 might be related to the distinct white color of the photoluminescence of this material (as will be discussed again below).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 11, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Coordination environment\nof the Pb<sup>2+</sup> ions in <bold>2</bold> with atom labeling (a),\nand view of the 3D net of <bold>2</bold> along the <italic toggle=\"yes\">a</italic> axis (b).

Specifically, an as-made crystalline sample of 2 (about 10 mg) was loaded into an agate mortar and manually ground with the pestle for 20 min to afford a fine powder. Ethanol (1.0 mL, ABS) was then added to the mortar. Further grinding (for about 1 min) was applied until a significant portion of the alcohol has evaporated and a homogeneous slurry was achieved. A commercial 360 nm UV-LED lamp (Le Group Fox, Inc.) was then dipped into the slurry, held therein for several seconds, and then taken out for the coating to dry in air. This dip coating process can be repeated to further ensure an even and continuous coating of 2 on the lens/housing of the LED. The performance of the white light LED thus fabricated is stable for months in air and the white color quality remains consistent over a wide temperature range (e.g., -20 \u00b0C to rt).
