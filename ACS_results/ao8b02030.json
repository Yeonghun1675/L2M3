However, when the concentration of thymine increases, no new emission peaks appear, further indicating that the ground-state complex does not emit luminescence (Figure S13). Compound 1 and thymine formed a ground-state complex, reducing the concentration of compound 1, resulting in a decrease in the fluorescence intensity of the system. The luminescent quenching caused by T may be due to three actions: (1) the uncoordinated oxygen atoms in sulfosalicylic acid may form hydrogen bonds with thymine; (2) thymine has a planar structure that may form a \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction with benzene ring in sulfosalicylic acid; and (3) it is noteworthy that T has more one methyl than U, so C-H/\u03c0 plays a very important role in molecular recognition. Compared with other pyrimidine molecules, the methyl of thymine molecule may form a C-H/\u03c0 interaction with the benzene ring of 5-sulfosalicylic acid ().

The results show that the retention of the framework is up to 270 \u00b0C for 1 and 240 \u00b0C for 2 ().", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "50 to 108", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "loss of two coordinated water molecule", "condition": ""}, {"value": "333 to 631", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "decomposition", "condition": ""}, {"value": "25 to 270", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "retention of the framework", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "2", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "50 to 90", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "loss of two coordinated water molecule", "condition": ""}, {"value": "358 to 548", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "decomposition", "condition": ""}, {"value": "25 to 240", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "retention of the framework", "condition": ""}]}]]], "include_properties": ["decomposition_temperature"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['decomposition_temperature']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"\",\n            \"symbol\": \"1\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"decomposition temperature\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"50 to 108\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"loss of two coordinated water molecule\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"333 to 631\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"decomposition\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"25 to 270\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"retention of the framework\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"\",\n            \"symbol\": \"2\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"decomposition temperature\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"50 to 90\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"loss of two coordinated water molecule\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"358 to 548\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"decomposition\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"25 to 240\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"retention of the framework\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 5, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Structure unit of compound <bold>1</bold> showing the\natom labeling.\nAll H atoms are omitted for clarity.
