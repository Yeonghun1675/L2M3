According to our calculations, the most strained of these ligands is H6TCAEPEB in NU-100; its SE of 215.4 kcal/mol amounts to 2.76 kcal/mol per bond, which is still ~1.8 times lower than that in TDPEPE8-\u22821. We also found that tritopic ligands had lower per-bond SEs than either TDPEPE8-\u22821 or the ligand in NU-100 because their idealized geometries map directly onto the faces of the polyhedra in their respective networks. Notably, these calculations suggested that the strain in TDPEPE8-\u22821 is not strictly related to ligand size or functional groups but could instead be the result of the specific geometric requirements of nets with the tbo topology.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 16, "type": "table", "classification": null, "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>DFT-Calculated SEs for Selected Ligands\u2282MOFs</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"3\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\"/\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\"/\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">MOF<xref rid=\"t1fn1\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">SE/SE per\nbond (kcal/mol)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\u03ba<sub>ligand</sub>/\u03ba<sub>MOF</sub>\n<xref rid=\"t1fn3\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>Mn<sub>3</sub>[(Mn<sub>4</sub>Cl)<sub>3</sub>(TPT-3tz)<sub>8</sub>]<sub>2</sub>\n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref32\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>21.5/0.48</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u2013</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry morerows=\"2\">(Zn<sub>4</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>(BTE)<sub>4</sub>(BPDC)<sub>3</sub>\n<xref rid=\"t1fn2\"></xref> (MOF-210)<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref30\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>34.0/0.81</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u2013</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>35.0/0.83</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u2013</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>41.7/0.99</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u2013</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>Zn<sub>4</sub>O(BTE)<sub>2</sub> (MOF-180)<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref30\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>51.8/1.23</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u2013</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>Cu<sub>4</sub>(TDM)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub> (PCN-26)<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref22\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>74.8/1.25</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.5/1.7</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>Cu<sub>4</sub>(MTBD)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub> (NOTT-140)<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref21\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>75.5/0.94</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.2<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref33\"></xref>/1.5</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>Zn<sub>4</sub>O(BBC)<sub>2</sub> (MOF-200)<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref30\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>111.9/1.96</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u2013</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>Cu<sub>4</sub>(PTMT)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>\n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref38\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>113.9/1.73</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.2/1.4</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>Cu<sub>4</sub>(BTTCD)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub> (PCN-80)<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref17\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>201.0/1.99</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.3/1.1</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>Cu<sub>4</sub>(BTMPT)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>\n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref38\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>211.8/2.08</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.0/1.4</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>Cu<sub>3</sub>(TCAEPEB)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub> (NU-100)<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref19\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>215.4/2.76</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u2013</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<bold>1</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<bold>383.7/4.31</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.3/1.5</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n<table-wrap-foot>\n<fn id=\"t1fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>BTE = 4,4\u2032,4\u2033-[benzene-1,3,5-triyl-tris(ethyne-2,1-diyl)]\u00adtribenzoate;\nBPDC = biphenyl-4,4\u2032-dicarboxylate;
