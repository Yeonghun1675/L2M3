The asymmetric unit of 1 consists of three crystallographically independent Cd2+ ions, three 1,2,4-triazolates (tz), one 1,4-phenylenediacetate (PDA), one chloride ion, four coordinated water molecules, and three lattice water molecules (). The octahedral Cd(1)2+ ion is coordinated by three oxygen atoms of carboxylate groups of PDA ligands, two triazolate nitrogen atoms, and a water molecule (see Supporting Information, Figure S4a). The Cd(2)2+ ion is also octahedrally coordinated by four triazolate nitrogen atoms and two water molecules (see Supporting Information, Figure S4b), whereas Cd(3)2+ ion is octahedrally coordinated by three triazolate nitrogen atoms, two chloride ions, and a water molecule (see Supporting Information, Figure S4c). All the three triazolates have similar connectivity where each triazolate connects three Cd2+ ions (see Supporting Information, Figure S5). Out of the two carboxylate groups of PDA ligand, one has bidentate connectivity with the Cd(1)2+ ion, and other one has monodentate connectivity with the Cd(2)2+ ion (see Supporting Information, Figure S6).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 13, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Ball and stick representation of asymmetric unit of [Cd<sub>3</sub>(PDA)<sub>1</sub>\u00ad(tz)<sub>3</sub>Cl\u00ad(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>]\u00ad\u00b73H<sub>2</sub>O, <bold>1</bold>.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2018-017675_0001.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Ball and stick representation of asymmetric unit of [Cd3(PDA)1(tz)3Cl(H2O)4]\u22c53H2O, 1.
