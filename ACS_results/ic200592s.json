They all display intralayer AF interactions through carboxylate bridges in the unusual skew-skew coordination mode, but the bulk behaviors are quite different. The magnetic properties have been compared with those of previous compounds containing similar M-O-C-O-M layers. The Co(II) compound (3), like most compounds in the series, shows no 3D magnetic ordering down to 2 K. Differently, compounds 1 is the third Mn(II) compound in the series that exhibits 3D ordering above 2 K, behaving as a weak ferromagnet due to spin canting, and compound 2 is the first 3D-ordered Fe(II) compound in the series, behaving as a metamagnet related to spin canting.
