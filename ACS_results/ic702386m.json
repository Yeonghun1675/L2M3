Although no emission from the tetracyanoplatinate groups has been observed in 1, even at liquid-nitrogen temperature, the Pr/terpyridine/tetracyanoplatinate system (3) studied by us does show emission assignable to the platinum tetracyanide moiety at ~420 nm upon excitation at 380 nm. This is a significant blue shift when compared to many other systems that show a MMLCT transition, which is consistent with the relatively long and, hence, weak Pt-Pt interaction in this compound. Comparison of the emission spectra of 1 with those of 3 supports the argument presented earlier that energy transfer from the platinum tetracyanide to the Eu3+ ion in 1 efficiently quenches the emission assignable to the donor species.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 18, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>The emission from the Eu<sup>3+</sup> ion in <bold>1</bold> dominates the spectral profile, with the intensities increasing significantly as the temperature is reduced to 77 K.
