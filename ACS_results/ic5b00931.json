The organic ligands coordinate preferentially to the Mn(II) sites, and the coordination geometries and numbers have the predominant effect on whether [MnV2O6] chains (in I) or [MnV2O6] n  layers (in II, III, and IV) are formed. The optical bandgap sizes fall in the range from ~1.65 to ~1.95 eV and increase with decreasing network dimensionality. When the hybrid is heated in air or nitrogen, the loss of structural water occurs gradually for I, II, and III over several hundreds of degrees, while the structural water is lost at closer to room temperature for IV. At higher temperatures the condensed MnV2O6 phase forms after the loss of both structural water and organic ligands from each hybrid. The specific surface areas of the MnV2O6 products range from ~7 m2/g for III to ~41 m2/g for IV. The longer bridging 4,4'-bipyridine in IV helps to inhibit the collapse of the inorganic network, thus leading to the highest surface area of the MnV2O6 product. The blue-shifted bandgap size of MnV2O6 obtained from IV indicates particle sizes in the quantum confinement regime, as compared to I, II, and III with consistent bandgap sizes of ~1.7 eV. Compounds I to IV exhibit temperature-dependent visible-light photocatalytic activities for hydrogen production in 20% methanol solutions, with their activities increasing with the oxide/organic network connectivity. In contrast, the related V4O10(o-phen)2 exhibits a larger bandgap size and significantly lower hydrogen production rate. Electronic structure calculations show that the band edges are primarily derived from the half-filled Mn 3d5 in the valence band and the empty V 3d0 and ligand \u03c0* orbital contributions in the conduction band.

The loss of the organic ligands eventually occurs at higher temperatures for all four hybrid compounds (I: expt. 43.15%, calcd. 46.27%; II: expt. ~22.71%, calcd ~23.21%; III: expt. 44.30%, calcd. 43.94%; IV: expt. 36.47%, calcd. 32.10%). Notably, II had the highest thermal stability, at up to ~500 \u00b0C, which can be attributed to the more compact network formed by the shortest bridging and chelating ligand bipyrimidine. By comparison, the hybrid V4O10(o-phen)2 shows two weight-loss steps starting at ~300 \u00b0C and ~413 \u00b0C, both corresponding to the removal of a single o-phen ligand (total loss: expt. 49.27%, calcd. 49.77%).\n\nCharacterization of the post-TGA products showed that hybrids I to IV had decomposed to yield the known MnV2O6 phase, according to powder XRD. Thus, the full collapse and condensation of the inorganic network results in their common formation of a condensed manganese(II)-vanadate phase with a conservation of the Mn/V (1:2) molar ratio. The specific surface areas were also measured to investigate the impact of the different pathways of structural collapse. As shown in , the surface area of the MnV2O6 product is the lowest for III at ~7.1 m2/g, in which both the structural water and organic ligand were removed together only at higher temperatures. For I and II, wherein the loss of structural water starts at lower temperatures and gradually continues a few hundred degrees, the surface area of MnV2O6 increases to a higher value of ~15-16 m2/g. Lastly, the highest surface area is found for IV at ~41 m2/g, which exhibits a distinct step for the low-temperature loss of water. Thus, the higher surface areas are directly related to the tendency of the hybrid compound to maintain its structure with the removal of water, which is prior to the higher-temperature removal of the organic ligands. By comparison, V4O10(o-phen)2 exhibits almost no change in specific surface area, measured at 3.6 m2/g and 3.5 m2/g before and after the thermally driven removal of the o-phen ligand.", "data":
