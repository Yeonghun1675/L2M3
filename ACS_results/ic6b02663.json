To better understand the charge/discharge curve of the material, we attempted to find the global minimum structure at different Li ion intercalation stages based on the above Li binding energy analysis. The average voltages (V) for Li intercalation into Pb-MOF host structure were calculated by the following equation:  1    V = -   E  (   Li   x 2     MO   2   )  - E  (   Li   x 1     MO   2   )  -  (   x   2   -   x   1   )  E  ( Li )     (   x   2   -   x   1   )  e     and specifically as 2    V = -   E  {   Li   x 2    ( Pb - MOF )  }  - E  {   Li   x 1    ( Pb - MOF )  }  -  (   x   2   -   x   1   )  E  ( Li )     (   x   2   -   x   1   )  e     where E{Li x2(Pb-MOF)} and E{Li x1(Pb-MOF)} correspond to the energies of intercalated and initial systems, respectively. E(Li) is related to the energy that one Li atom corresponding to the potential of Li, and (x 2-x 1) refers to the number of the intercalated Li ions. Figure S10 illustrates the profiles of the calculated average voltages. Obviously, the theoretical voltage captured the trend of the experimental discharging curve. A wide voltage pseudoplateau at around 0.65 V is observed, which is close to the experimental discharge voltage (around 0.5 V), followed by a gradual decline. Indeed, most peak positions of the PXRD patterns before and after 500 charge/discharge cycles are similar to those of the as-prepared sample, indicating that the framework and structure stability are maintained after removal of the guest molecules and the cycles (Figure S2). The intensity differences and the slight changes of small peaks at 14 and 20\u00b0 2\u03b8 could be ascribed to the preferred orientation effect of the crystalline samples. Obviously, SEM images in Figure S11 reveal that no disintegration or pulverization of the electrode can be observed before and after the cycling process, which explains the good cycling stability.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 24, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig4\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Comparison of the performance of metal\u2013organic frameworks\nas LIB anodes (see refs <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref7\" specific-use=\"ref-style=base-text\"></xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref12\" specific-use=\"ref-style=base-text\"></xref>, and <named-content content-type=\"bibref-group\">\n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref44\" specific-use=\"ref-style=base-text\"></xref>\n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref45\" specific-use=\"suppress-in-print\"></xref>\n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref46\" specific-use=\"suppress-in-print\"></xref>\n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref47\" specific-use=\"suppress-in-print\"></xref>\n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref48\" specific-use=\"suppress-in-print\"></xref>\n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref49\" specific-use=\"suppress-in-print\"></xref>\u2212<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref50\" specific-use=\"ref-style=base-text\"></xref>\n</named-content>).</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr4\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2016-026638_0004.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 4  Comparison of the performance of metal-organic frameworks as LIB anodes (see refs , , and       - ).

Moreover, this electrode exhibits stable cycling behavior and good rate performance.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "Pb-MOF", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "[Pb(4,4'-ocppy)2]\u22c57H2O"}, "crystal system": [{"value": "monoclinic", "condition": ""}], "space group": [{"value": "C2/c", "condition": ""}], "porosity": [{"probe": "", "value": "40.0", "unit": "%", "condition": "after omitting the lattice water molecules"}], "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "30 and 150", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "removal of 7 lattice H2O", "condition": ""}, {"value": "300", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "decomposition of organic ligands", "condition": ""}], "surface area": [{"type": "", "probe": "", "value": "725", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}], "pore volume": [{"probe": "", "value": "0.47", "unit": "cm3/g", "condition": ""}], "density": [{"value": "1.3", "unit": "g/cm3", "condition": ""}], "etc": [{"property name": "electrical conductivity", "value": "0.072", "unit": "S/m", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "gravimetric capacity", "value": "489", "unit": "mAh/g", "condition": "after 500 cycles"}, {"property name": "volumetric capacity", "value": "605", "unit": "mAh/cm3", "condition": "due to the low density of 1.3 g cm-3"}, {"property name": "specific capacity", "value": "380", "unit": "mAh/g", "condition": "after deep cycling at a high current density of 500 mA g-1"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["crystal_system", "space_group", "porosity", "decomposition_temperature", "surface_area", "pore_volume", "density", "etc"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['crystal_system', 'space_group', 'porosity', 'decomposition_temperature', 'surface_area', 'pore_volume', 'density', 'etc']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"Pb-MOF\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"[Pb(4,4'-ocppy)2]\u22c57H2O\"\n        },\n        \"crystal system\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"monoclinic\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"space group\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"C2/c\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"porosity\": [\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"40.0\",\n                \"unit\": \"%\",\n                \"condition\": \"after omitting the lattice water molecules\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"decomposition temperature\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"30 and 150\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"removal of 7 lattice H2O\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"300\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"decomposition of organic ligands\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"surface area\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"\",\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"725\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"pore volume\": [\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"0.47\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"density\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"1.3\",\n                \"unit\": \"g/cm3\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"etc\": [\n            {\n                \"property name\": \"electrical conductivity\",\n                \"value\": \"0.072\",\n                \"unit\": \"S/m\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"property name\": \"gravimetric capacity\",\n                \"value\": \"489\",\n                \"unit\": \"mAh/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"after 500 cycles\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"property name\": \"volumetric capacity\",\n                \"value\": \"605\",\n                \"unit\": \"mAh/cm3\",\n                \"condition\": \"due to the low density of 1.3 g cm-3\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"property name\": \"specific capacity\",\n                \"value\": \"380\",\n                \"unit\": \"mAh/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"after deep cycling at a high current density of 500 mA g-1\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 13, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Coordination\ngeometry of Pb<sup>2+</sup> ion;
