The chemical formula of FJI-C2 was confirmed by SCXRD, charge-balance considerations, 1H NMR (Figure S2), TGA (Figure S3), and elemental analysis (EA). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed that FJI-C2 is a 3D anion framework, which crystallizes in the acentric group P4\u030521 c (No. 114) (Table S1). The negative charge is balanced by organic cations ([(CH3)2NH2]+) that are generated in situ upon solvent decomposition during the solvothermal synthesis. As shown in , the asymmetric unit of FJI-C2 contains three and a half independent Cd(II) (Cd1, Cd2, Cd3, and Cd4) nodes, two TDPAT6- (L1 and L2) linkers, and two water molecules. The coordination environment is depicted elaborately in the Supporting Information. The phase purity of the bulk product was confirmed by the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis (Figure S8). 1H NMR reveals that only H2O and [(CH3)2NH2]+ existed in the channel of FJI-C2. The ratio of [(CH3)2NH2]+:TDPAT is 2.5:1, which is consistent with the charge-balance calculation (calcd: 2.5:1). The TGA curve reveals a weight loss of 17.82% (calcd: 17.34%) from room temperature to 120 \u00b0C, which can be attributed to the loss of uncoordinated water. Thereafter, a weight loss of 11.62% (calcd: 12.82%) to 340 \u00b0C prior to decomposition was observed, which corresponds to the loss of [(CH3)2NH2]+ cations and coordinated water. Elemental analysis (%) calcd for {Cd3.5(TDPAT)2[(CH3)2NH2 +]5\u22c5(H2O)2}\u22c5(H2O)20: C 32.96%, H 5.07%, N 10.51%; found: C 36.95%, H 5.20%, N 11.46%.\n\nThe total accessible volume of FJI-C2 is 20201.4 \u00c53, which corresponds to 69.6% empty volume (29014.5 \u00c53) by the PLATON calculation. The accessible special surface area can reach 2315 m2/g, which was calculated by poreblazer v3.0 software. However, the N2 adsorption experiment failed to give an expected result to calculate the surface area, probably because the long-range order structures of the frameworks were lost under activation at high vacuum, which often happens in some highly porous MOFs.
