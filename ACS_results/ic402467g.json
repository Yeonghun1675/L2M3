Before the TGA test, the phase purity of all compounds was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (Figures S3-S6 of the ). The TGA curve demonstrated that compound 1 was stable up to 300 \u00b0C and then decomposed upon being heated further (Figure S7 of the ). TGA of compound 2 showed a weight loss of 19.8% in the range of 30-245 \u00b0C, implying the removal of a free DMF molecule (calcd, 19.9%) per formula unit. For 3, the first weight loss of 10.6% in the range of 25-116 \u00b0C indicated the exclusion of free water molecules and the second weight loss of 15.2% between 116 and 240 \u00b0C could be attributed to the loss of DMF molecules. For 4, the first weight loss of 4.5% in the temperature range of 28-67 \u00b0C indicated the surface absorption of moisture and the second weight loss of 16.8% between 113 and 300 \u00b0C was attributed to the loss of a free DMF molecule and a H2N(CH3)2 + ion per formula unit (calcd, 16.1%).\n\nIt is worth noting that compound 2 has excellent thermal stability. As shown in Figure S5 of the , no weight loss can be observed between 245 and 390 \u00b0C. When compound 2 was treated at 200 or 300 \u00b0C, the PXRD patterns of the treated samples were very much in agreement with the simulated pattern of 2 (Figure ). The result suggested that the desolvated framework can keep its crystalline state even at high temperatures.\n\nGas Adsorption\n\nTo evaluate the porosity of 2 and 3, gas adsorption isotherms were measured with N2.
