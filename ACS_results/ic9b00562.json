This material exhibits high solvent, pH, and thermal stability. The luminescent results imply that 1 has ability to detect aspartic acid or histidine among 14 amino acids in water, and the concentration of aspartic acid can be quantitatively determined. In addition, compound 1 can be reused at a minimum of five times, indicating the excellent recyclability of this luminescent sensor. Importantly, 1 is the first instance of a luminescent probe based on MOFs to detect two amino acids.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 31, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information is\navailable free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b00562\">10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b00562</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>X-ray crystallographic\ndata in CIF format, IR, TGA,\nspectra, PXRD, ICP (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b00562/suppl_file/ic9b00562_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b00562.
