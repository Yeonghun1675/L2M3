Remarkable catalytic activity was observed on Ce-NU-1008 with full conversion of styrene oxide in 20 h under mild conditions, making Ce6-based MOFs promising Lewis acid catalysts for CO2 cycloaddition reactions. By comparing the CO2 fixation conversions and variable-temperature DRIFTS spectra of the four M-NU-1008, the dissociation of terminal water from the metal nodes was found to correlate to activity. The proposed mechanism was further supported by the enhanced CO2 fixation performance on partially dehydrated Hf-NU-1008 compared to the as-prepared sample. By using structurally well-defined isostructural MOFs with different metal nodes, this work provides a systematic study of the Lewis acid catalyzed CO2 cycloaddition reaction and offers insight into how the node identity can affect catalysis, which will pave the way for designing Lewis acidic catalysts with improved activities.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 28, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting\nInformation is available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at\nDOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.chemmater.9b00960\">10.1021/acs.chemmater.9b00960</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Crystallographic\ndata for <bold>Hf-NU-1008</bold> (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.chemmater.9b00960/suppl_file/cm9b00960_si_001.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Materials synthesis, proton NMR spectra,\nTGA curves, temperature-programmed desorption profiles of MOF materials,\nXPS spectra of <bold>Ce-NU-1008</bold>, crystallographic data for <bold>Hf-NU-1008</bold>, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation reaction using the catalysts,\nproposed reaction mechanism for CO<sub>2</sub> cycloaddition to styrene\noxide by <bold>M-NU-1008</bold>\u00a0and PXRD patterns of materials\nafter catalysis\u00a0(<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.chemmater.9b00960/suppl_file/cm9b00960_si_002.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.9b00960.
