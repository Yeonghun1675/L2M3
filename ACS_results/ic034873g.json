This cubic framework has 74% free volume and 4 \u00d7 7 \u00c5 pores. N2 adsorption gives a type I isotherm with a surface area of 800 m2/g, which is greater than that of a typical zeolite.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, PIZA-4 has an interpenetrated structure that is illustrated in Figure . Even with this interpenetration, the framework solid is largely open with 74% free volume (calculated for a 1.4 \u00c5 probe radius using Cerius2 version 4.8) and 4 \u00d7 7 \u00c5 pores down each axis (van der Waals surface distance). In the solvated crystal, the pores are filled with disordered solvate. This large free volume was confirmed by TGA measurements on the as-synthesized solvated crystal (Table S2). A measured weight loss of 32% (up to 250 \u00b0C) is equivalent to 134 DMF and 102 chlorobenzene molecules occupying each unit cell, which corresponds to 100% of the calculated accessible free volume being occupied.  \n\nReversible type I N2 isotherms (Figure S1) at 77 K were measured for desolvated PIZA-4 solids and are consistent with microporosity (i.e., pores with diameters less than 20 \u00c5 that still exist in the evacuated state). A Langmuir surface area of 800 m2/g, calculated from the isotherm data, is greater than the 500 m2/g for a typical zeolite. The evacuated solid also reversibly resorbs 241 DMF molecules per unit cell, which corresponds to 94% of the accessible free volume calculated from the single crystal model (Table S3). These two findings indicate that the pores remain open and available for resorption of solvate.
