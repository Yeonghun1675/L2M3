At the same time, due to the presence of the free guest water molecules, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was also performed on the samples (Figure S5, ). At first glance, the TGA curves show that the two complexes seem to possess similar thermal stabilities: the first weight loss of 5.23% for 1a and 5.75% for 1b (calcd: 6.34%) correspond to the loss of all water molecules, respectively. Then the framework of 1a can remain stable to ~313 \u00b0C (~327 \u00b0C for complex 1b). Beyond this temperature, the organic components begin to decompose and the frameworks collapsed. However, further study of the DSC curves for two polymers shows the different stable behaviors: in 1a, the DSC curve shows a broad endothermic peak from ~57 to 209 \u00b0C which indicates that the water molecules were lost step by step; in fact, we could also find this information carefully from the TGA curve; in 1b, the DSC curve shows a sharp peak from ~57 to 196 \u00b0C, the major reason of which is that one water molecule (O11) has a weak interaction with Pb1 ions with the distance of 2.791(86) \u00c5; therefore, the three water molecules might be lost together.
