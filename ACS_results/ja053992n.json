The same experiment performed after activation at 300 \u00b0C gives a surface of 60 m2\u22c5g-1, confirming that the loss of crystallinity above 280 \u00b0C corresponds to the collapse of the structure.  \n\nTo conclude, we present here the first lanthanide-based MOF keeping its crystalline order upon guest removal and showing both large pores (free diameter >10 \u00c5) and a high surface area (>1000 m2\u22c5g-1) relative to nitrogen. Studies of the lability of the bound water by solid-state NMR, which is of importance for catalytic applications, as well as luminescence measurements and insertion properties are in progress and will be reported in due course.
