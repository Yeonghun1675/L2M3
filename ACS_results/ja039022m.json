group, the amino group,\nand the three imino-nitrogen atoms) with the intention of\nachieving the formation of a metal\u2212organic framework via\nmultiple bonding interactions. Unexpectedly, the ligand underwent decarboxylation to produce AmTAZ, indicating that the\ncarboxylic acid group is unstable under the solvothermal\nconditions used. Decarboxylation was also observed for the\nrelated ligand 1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxylic acid, under similar\n\nreaction conditions. As a consequence of this decarboxylation,\nthe same structure is obtained when using either AmTAZAc or\nAmTAZ as the ligand starting material. The framework [ZnF(AmTAZ)] is charge neutral because the two positive charges\non the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion are balanced by one F<sup>-</sup> anion and one\ndeprotonated AmTAZ ligand. Any of the following zinc(II)-containing salts can be used as the source of Zn<sup>2+</sup> and/or of F<sup>-</sup>\nas detailed in Scheme :\u2009 ZnF<sub>2</sub>, Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, and Zn(BF<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.\nInterestingly, the anions NO<sub>3</sub>\n<sup>-</sup> and BF<sub>4</sub>\n<sup>-</sup> do not participate in\ncoordinating the Zn<sup>2+</sup> cation, and they exert no apparent\ninfluence on the formation of the metal\u2212organic framework.

The spectrum acquired without sample spinning displayed only a broad signal around 4.4 ppm due to the large dipolar interactions between protons; however, the spectra acquired at high spin rates showed well-resolved proton signals as shown in Figure . The two peaks at 1.411 ppm (-CH3) and 3.927 ppm (-CH2) in the spectrum of the as-synthesized sample are attributed to ethanol, the intense peak at 4.428 ppm is believed to be due to water molecules, and the broad peak at 8.937 ppm is tentatively assigned to the -NH2 group of AmTAZ (a fairly broad signal around 6.19 ppm is also observed which might correspond to the proton on the 5-position of the TAZ ring). Upon heating the as-synthesized sample to 250 \u00b0C for 1 h in air, the peak assigned to water decreased dramatically and the peaks assigned to ethanol were also reduced in intensity, suggesting that most of the water and a portion of the ethanol were removed from the channels. Upon heating the sample to 350 \u00b0C for another hour, most of the ethanol was removed from the channels. Because the amino group of the AmTAZ ligand points into the channels, it is expected that some of the guest molecules may form N-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bonds, which would hinder them from leaving the channels. It is, however, surprising that the ethanol molecules are harder to remove than the water molecules. One plausible explanation for this observation is that the tubular channels do not allow tumbling of the larger ethanol molecules, thereby slowing their diffusion out of the channels relative to the smaller water molecules.
