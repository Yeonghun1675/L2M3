These signals appear at a chemical shift similar to the resonance observed for H4(L-CoCl3) in solution (67.3 ppm, Figure S5), supporting the presence of similar CoIII pincer species in the MOF. Minor signals observed in the 15-30 ppm region are consistent with the presence of a small amount of oxidized phosphine species arising from decomposition of the PNNNP pincer linkers. However, quantitative analysis of the spectrum was hampered by fast T2 relaxation that likely arises from a small amount of paramagnetic CoII species present in the sample (vide infra). The solution state 31P NMR spectrum measured for an acid-digested (CF3CO2H/C6D6, 3/1, v/v) sample of 1-CoCl3  exhibits a major signal at 67.6 ppm (~86%) and minor one at 67.2 ppm (~14%) (Figure S11). The 31P NMR spectrum of H4(L-CoCl3) shows similar speciation in the same solvent mixture, suggesting that the acid-digestion conditions induce Co-Cl solvolysis. Consequently, the acid-digested 31P NMR data do not provide direct insight into the speciation of the CoIII-PNNNP linkers present in the MOF. We surmise that the two distinct signals observed in the solid-state 31P NMR spectrum of 1-CoCl3  arise from a mixture of CoIIICl3 and CoIIICl2(X) pincer species, but the identity of the putative X ligand has not been firmly established.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 12, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig3\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Solid-state <sup>31</sup>P NMR spectra for as-synthesized <bold>1-CoCl<sub>3</sub>\n</bold> and <bold>1-CoCl<sub>3</sub>(MeOH)</bold> with magic-angle\nspinning (MAS) and total suppression of spinning sidebands (TOSS).\nSee the <xref ref-type=\"sec\" rid=\"sec4\">Experimental Section</xref> for details.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr4\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2018-03318d_0003.tif\" xlink:type=\"simple\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 3  Solid-state 31P NMR spectra for as-synthesized 1-CoCl3  and 1-CoCl3(MeOH) with magic-angle spinning (MAS) and total suppression of spinning sidebands (TOSS).

ICP-OES analysis of 1-RhCl and 1-RhCl(NEt3) provided Zr/Rh/Co ratios of 6:1.64:0.03 and 6:1.33:0.15, respectively, confirming nearly complete Rh/Co exchange based on the empirical formula previously derived for 1-CoCl3(MeOH). The solid-state 31P NMR spectra of 1-RhCl and 1-RhCl(NEt3) both display two major resonances centered at 79 and 65 ppm that can be assigned as RhI and RhIII pincer species, respectively (b). Similar to the spectra measured for 1-CoCl3(MeOH), minor signals (~23%) attributed to decomposed linker species are observed in the 15-30 ppm region. Integration of the spectrum of 1-RhCl shows a ~1:1 ratio of RhI/RhIII pincer species, while the addition of NEt3 resulted in an increase to a ~2:1 RhI/RhIII ratio for 1-RhCl(NEt3). Thus, while NEt3 appears to maintain its role as a sacrificial reductant, it is less effective in the MOF than for the homogeneous complex. Attempts to prevent the oxidation of RhI by performing the exchange reaction in the presence of increased amounts of NEt3 resulted in little change in the RhI/RhIII ratio observed by solid-state 31P NMR (Figure S32). Moreover, the use of DMF in place of DMSO resulted in Rh/Co metal exchange, but was accompanied by the formation of Rh nanoparticles (Figure S33).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 20, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch3\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<title>PSME Reactions of <bold>1-CoCl<sub>3</sub>(MeOH)</bold>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr6\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2018-03318d_0009.tif\" xlink:type=\"simple\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 3  PSME Reactions of 1-CoCl3(MeOH)    ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 21, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig4\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) XRF spectra and kinetic plot showing the rate of Rh/Co PSME in <bold>1-CoCl<sub>3</sub>(MeOH)</bold>.

All metal exchange reactions were carried out in a nitrogen-filled glovebox using solvents that were dried over CaH2 and distilled or dried via passage through columns of drying agents using a solvent purification system from Pure Process Technologies. Other solvents and reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used as received. Routine XRPD patterns for phase identification were collected using a Rigaku Miniflex 600 diffractometer with Nickel-filtered Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 1.5418 \u00c5). High-resolution synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction (SXPD) data were collected at 295 K using beamline 11-BM at the Advanced Photon Source (APS, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL) with an average wavelength of 0.412697 \u00c5. Initial structural models for 1-CoCl3  were constructed from the positions of the heavy atoms located using a charge flipping method within the PDXL2 Structure Analysis Package (Rigaku Corporation). Rietveld refinement was carried out with TOPAS-Academic. A Bruker Tracer III-SD Hand-held XRF Analyzer with a rhodium target and silicon drift detector at 40 keV voltage and 10 \u03bcA current was used to monitor metal exchange reactions. ATR-IR spectra were measured using a Nicolet IR 200 with a diamond ATR accessory. N2 (77 K, liquid nitrogen bath) and CO (303 K) adsorption isotherms were measured using a Micromeritics 3Flex Surface Characterization Analyzer. Prior to analysis, samples (100-200 mg) were heated under reduced pressure until the outgas rate was less than 2 mTorr/min. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) measurements were performed by Robertson Microlit Laboratories (Ledgewood, NJ) or the Trace Element Research Laboratory at the Ohio State University. Other elemental analyses (C, H, N, Cl) were performed by Robertson Microlit Laboratories (Ledgewood, NJ) or Atlantic Microlab (Norcross, GA). SEM and elemental mapping of metals using EDX were performed at the Center for Electron Microscopy and Analysis (CEMAS) at The Ohio State University using a Thermo Scientic Apreo LoVac Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope. The samples were prepared by dispersing MOF powders onto double-sided, conductive carbon tape that was attached to an aluminum sample holder. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were collected at 10 K using a Bruker EMXPlus Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectrometer. Samples were prepared by suspending the MOFs in THF solvent in 4 mm quartz EPR tubes. Solution-state NMR spectra were measured using either a Varian Inova or Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer (162 MHz operating frequency for 31P). For 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra, the solvent resonance was referenced as an internal standard. For 31P NMR spectra, 85% H3PO4 was used as an external standard (0 ppm). Solid-state NMR experiments were performed using a Bruker DSX-400 spectrometer at a resonance frequency of 162 MHz for 31P with a magic-angle spinning (MAS) probe in double-resonance mode. Samples were packed into 4 mm rotors with Kel-F 22 \u03bcL inserts. Experiments were carried out at spinning frequencies of 10-13.5 kHz. Typical 31P and 1H 90\u00b0 pulse-lengths were 4 and 6 \u03bcs, respectively. 31P NMR spectra were obtained after composite-pulse multiple cross-polarization from 1H, with a recycle delay of 1 s and 10 blocks of 1.1 ms 90-100% ramp cross-polarization separated by 0.5 s 1H repolarization periods. Four-pulse total suppression of sidebands (TOSS) was used to obtain spectra without spinning sidebands.
