PCN-14 consists of a dicopper paddlewheel secondary building unit and the adip ligand. In the ligand, the four carboxylate groups and the two phenyl rings of the isophthalate motifs are almost in a plane, whereas the dihedral angle between the anthracene ring and the phenyl rings is 70.4\u00b0. Every 12 adip ligands connect 6 paddlewheel SBUs to form a squashed cuboctahedral cage (Figure a), if one connects the centers of the six paddlewheels and the six anthracenyl groups (broken lines in Figure a). The anthracenyl rings in the cage are in close contact (2.6 \u00c5 between an H atom and the center of a phenyl ring from the adjacent anthracenyl group). The cuboctahedral cage has eight triangular windows and six square windows for gas molecules to access the interior surface. The cuboctahedral cage can also be viewed as four intersecting hexagons. The dimensions of the hexagons are 9.23 \u00c5 along an edge and 18.45 between two opposite corners. Extending each hexagon in the cuboctahedral cage into two-dimensional honeycombs gives rise to a three-dimensional 4-connected net (Figure ). The three-dimensional net can also be viewed as a framework consisting of cuboctahedral nanoscopic cages (Figure a). An alternative way of viewing the cage is to connect the centers of all isophthalate phenyl rings, forming a polygon with 18 vertices, 20 faces, and 30 edges. This polygon can be viewed as being formed by inserting an irregular hexagonal prism in between the two halves of a cuboctahedron (Figure b). The cage has 1150 \u00c53 of void and is approximately spherical providing efficient and accessible interior surface for gas storage.
