It should be noted that the solvent-accessible volume in the present coordination polymer is approximate 204.5 \u00c53 per unit cell volume, and the pore volume ratio is calculated to be 10.6% using the PLATON program.  \n\nThe thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) study shows that the weight loss of 90.05% (calcd: 88.14%) observed from 30 to 500 \u00b0C with a decomposition point T onset of 325.9 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of three dppe-O ligands per formula unit (Figure S1, Supporting Information), which reveals the good stability of the present microporous framework due to the abundant supermolecular interactions between and within the layers. The solid-state luminescence spectrum of 1 at ambient temperature exhibits an intense narrow band fluorescent emission at 692 nm on photoexcitation at 361 nm (Figure S2, Supporting Information), suggesting that compound 1 may be suitable as a candidate for a stable red fluorescent material due to its stability in air.
