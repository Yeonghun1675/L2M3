Hybrid SCIF-1 and SCIF-11 show similar band gaps of ~3.22 and ~3.21 eV, respectively. However, UCR-7 with an entirely inorganic framework has a larger band gap of ~3.45 eV than the above hybrid ones (a). There is no obvious PL emission for UCR-7 and neutral ligand H-IM at room temperature. However, the significant and obvious PL emission of SCIF-1 and SCIF-11 are clearly observed at emissions of 497 and 463 nm under excitations of 418 and 394 nm, respectively (b). In addition, the quantum yield of SCIF-1 and SCIF-11 were measured to be 18.26% and 20.93%, respectively (Figures S15 and S16). The single-crystal UV-vis absorption spectrum of SCIF-12 shows a band gap of ~3.34 eV (c), and its single-crystal PL emission is also observed at 446 nm under an excitation of 365 nm (d). Although UCR-7 shows no PL emission at room temperature, the PL behaviors of SCIF-1, SCIF-11, and SCIF-12 are all obviously observed.
