The chemical shifts of greatest interest are those for the carbamate carbon, which occur at ~160 ppm and are different for the two structures. (bottom) DFT-calculated 1H-13C chemical shift correlations from DFT structure, assuming correlation only between the carbamate N-H (1H) and the carbamate carbon (13C). (b) Experimental magic-angle-spinning 13C NMR (16.4 T) spectra for 13CO2-inserted Mg2(dobpdc) appended with (R,R)-dach. The gas-dosing pressures were 1050, 1047, 1027, and 1041 mbar for samples 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Spectra were obtained by cross-polarization from 1H with a contact time of 1 ms, and the sample spinning rate was 15 kHz. Two distinct resonances are visible at 163.4 and 161.6 ppm, which correspond to (R,R)-dach-S-Mg2(dobpdc) and (R,R)-dach-R-Mg2(dobpdc), respectively. The intensities of the two resonances varied for different batches of Mg2(dobpdc). Quantification of the R-Mg2(dobpdc):S-Mg2(dobpdc) ratio by solid-state NMR spectroscopy agreed well with TGA quantification on the same samples (right). (c) Experimental 2D HETCOR magic-angle-spinning NMR (16.4 T) spectra for samples 1, 2, and 3 shown in (b). The sample spinning rate was 15 kHz. A short contact time of 100 \u03bcs was used in this experiment, such that the major correlation is between the carbamate N-H hydrogens and the carbamate carbon. Distinct chemical shifts are observed for the carbamate N-H hydrogens of (R,R)-dach-S-Mg2(dobpdc) and (R,R)-dach-R-Mg2(dobpdc), in good agreement with the DFT calculations shown in (a). NMR experiments were carried out under ambient conditions without sample temperature control.
