Zn(II) is in the center of a distorted tetrahedral geometry, defined by two nitrogen atoms from two separate L1 ligands, and two oxygen atoms from two different acid ligands.

They are reasonable compared to those values in reported work. As shown in Figure a, the two carboxylate groups of L<sup>2\u2212</sup> ligand adopt the monodentate-bridging coordination mode (\u03bc<sub>1</sub>:\u03b7<sup>1</sup>) to link two zinc(II) atoms to form a 1D zigzag chain. Two <italic toggle=\"yes\">cis</italic>-L1 ligands, the dihedral angles between imidazole and phenyl are 71.791(4)\u00b0 and 86.333(4)\u00b0, join two Zn atoms to form a ring. And all the neighboring 1D chains can be connected by the L1 ligands rings to form a 2D layer (Figure b). The 2D layer can be viewed as two types of rings arranged alternately. As illustrated in Figure c, the A ring contains four L<sup>2\u2212</sup> ligands, two L1 ligands, and six Zn atoms. And the B ring is the L1 ligands ring mentioned before, which is smaller than A ring. The adjacent 2D layers can extend to a 3D supramolecular structure by the \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 interactions between neighboring imidazole rings and phenyl rings (Figure a). The L<sup>2\u2212</sup> ligands have no contributions to \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 interactions. Figure b shows that there are two types of \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 interactions existing in adjacent B rings: one is between the imidazole rings N1, N2, and C18\u2212C20 of symmetry related pairs of ligands (red and green). The planes of two rings are parallel and the interplanar distance is 4.183(2) \u00c5 with the slipping angles \u03b2 = \u03b3 = 32.6\u00b0. Another is between the phenyl rings C22\u2212C27 of symmetry related pairs of ligands (green and pink). The two planes are parallel, too. The interplanar distance is 4.525(2) \u00c5 with the slipping angles \u03b2 = \u03b3 = 40.9\u00b0.

Zn(II) is in the center of a distorted tetrahedral geometry, defined by two nitrogen atoms from two separate L1 ligands, and two oxygen atoms from two different acid ligands. The Zn-O distances are in the range of 1.968(2)-1.972(2) \u00c5, and Zn-N distances vary in the range of 2.001(3)-2.008(2) \u00c5. They are reasonable compared to those values in reported work. As shown in Figure a, the two carboxylate groups of L2- ligand adopt the monodentate-bridging coordination mode (\u03bc1:\u03b71) to link two zinc(II) atoms to form a 1D zigzag chain. Two cis-L1 ligands, the dihedral angles between imidazole and phenyl are 71.791(4)\u00b0 and 86.333(4)\u00b0, join two Zn atoms to form a ring. And all the neighboring 1D chains can be connected by the L1 ligands rings to form a 2D layer (Figure b). The 2D layer can be viewed as two types of rings arranged alternately. As illustrated in Figure c, the A ring contains four L2- ligands, two L1 ligands, and six Zn atoms. And the B ring is the L1 ligands ring mentioned before, which is smaller than A ring. The adjacent 2D layers can extend to a 3D supramolecular structure by the \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between neighboring imidazole rings and phenyl rings (Figure a). The L2- ligands have no contributions to \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions. Figure b shows that there are two types of \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions existing in adjacent B rings: one is between the imidazole rings N1, N2, and C18-C20 of symmetry related pairs of ligands (red and green). The planes of two rings are parallel and the interplanar distance is 4.183(2) \u00c5 with the slipping angles \u03b2 = \u03b3 = 32.6\u00b0.

complexes more fully in terms of thermal stability, their thermal behaviors were studied by TGA (). For complex <bold>1</bold>, a weight loss is observed from 70 to 214 \u00b0C, which is attributed to the loss of the lattice water, and the two DMF molecules, with a weight loss of 21.25% (calcd 21.24%), and then the structure is decomposed since 320 \u00b0C. For complex <bold>2</bold>, no weight loss is observed until it reaches 435 \u00b0C, at which the decomposition of the <bold>2</bold> occurred. Complex <bold>3</bold> is less stable with the weight loss of one lattice DMF molecule 4.46% (calcd 4.53%) before 309 \u00b0C, and then the framework is decomposed since 416 \u00b0C. In the case of <bold>4</bold>, a weight loss is observed from 132 \u00b0C, which is attributed to the release of the five lattice waters with a weight loss of 9.36% (calcd 9.38%), and then the network collapses at 385 \u00b0C. The TGA study of complex <bold>5</bold> shows a little weight of 1.63% (calcd 1.65%) from 254 \u00b0C, which belongs to the loss of the three lattice water, and then the framework collapses at 310 \u00b0C. To confirm whether the crystal structures are truly representative of the bulk materials, XRD experiments were carried out for <bold>1</bold>\u2212<bold>5</bold>. The XRD experimental and computer-simulated patterns of the corresponding complexes are shown in the , and they show that the bulk synthesized materials and the measured single crystals are the same.</p><title>Photoluminescent Properties</title><p>Luminescent compounds are of great interest due to their various applications in chemical sensors and photochemistry. The luminescent properties of free ligands L, L1, L2, and L3, with complexes <bold>1</bold>, <bold>2</bold>, <bold>3</bold>, <bold>4</bold>, and <bold>5</bold> have been investigated in the solid state at room temperature, as depicted in the  (Figures S1\u2212S3). Intense emissions of the free L, L1, L2, and L3 ligands were observed with wavelengths at 395 nm in L, 400 nm in L1, 425 nm in L2, and 395 nm in L3, which could be attributed to the \u03c0*\u2212\u03c0 transitions. The emission characters of complexes <bold>1</bold>, <bold>2</bold>, <bold>3</bold>, and <bold>4</bold> are similar to that of the free L, L1, L2, and L3 ligands. The emission peaks are at 395 nm in <bold>1</bold>, 385 nm in <bold>2</bold>, 415 nm in <bold>3</bold>, 390 nm in <bold>4</bold>, and 385 nm in <bold>5</bold>, among which, complexes <bold>1</bold>, <bold>2</bold>, <bold>4</bold>, <bold>5</bold> show a small blue shift compared with that of L, L1, L3 ligands. While complex <bold>3</bold> shows a small red shift compared with that of L and L2 ligands, they all probably attributed to the \u03c0*\u2212\u03c0 intraligand fluorescence due to their emission characters close to the emission bands of ligands.\n</p>", "clean_text": "Thermal Analysis and PXRD Results\n\nTo characterize the complexes more fully in terms of thermal stability, their thermal behaviors were studied by TGA (). For complex 1, a weight loss is observed from 70 to 214 \u00b0C, which is attributed to the loss of the lattice water, and the two DMF molecules, with a weight loss of 21.25% (calcd 21.24%), and then the structure is decomposed since 320 \u00b0C. For complex 2, no weight loss is observed until it reaches 435 \u00b0C, at which the decomposition of the 2 occurred. Complex 3 is less stable with the weight loss of one lattice DMF molecule 4.46% (calcd 4.53%) before 309 \u00b0C, and then the framework is decomposed since 416 \u00b0C. In the case of 4, a weight loss is observed from 132 \u00b0C, which is attributed to the release of the five lattice waters with a weight loss of 9.36% (calcd 9.38%), and then the network collapses at 385 \u00b0C. The TGA study of complex 5 shows a little weight of 1.63% (calcd 1.65%) from 254 \u00b0C, which belongs to the loss of the three lattice water, and then the framework collapses at 310 \u00b0C. To confirm whether the crystal structures are truly representative of the bulk materials, XRD experiments were carried out for 1-5. The XRD experimental and computer-simulated patterns of the corresponding complexes are shown in the , and they show that the bulk synthesized materials and the measured single crystals are the same.\n\nPhotoluminescent Properties\n\nLuminescent compounds are of great interest due to their various applications in chemical sensors and photochemistry. The luminescent properties of free ligands L, L1, L2, and L3, with complexes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 have been investigated in the solid state at room temperature, as depicted in the  (Figures S1-S3). Intense emissions of the free L, L1, L2, and L3 ligands were observed with wavelengths at 395 nm in L, 400 nm in L1, 425 nm in L2, and 395 nm in L3, which could be attributed to the \u03c0*-\u03c0 transitions. The emission characters of complexes 1, 2, 3, and 4 are similar to that of the free L, L1, L2, and L3 ligands. The emission peaks are at 395 nm in 1, 385 nm in 2, 415 nm in 3, 390 nm in 4, and 385 nm in 5, among which, complexes 1, 2, 4, 5 show a small blue shift compared with that of L, L1, L3 ligands. While complex 3 shows a small red shift compared with that of L and L2 ligands, they all probably attributed to the \u03c0*-\u03c0 intraligand fluorescence due to their emission characters close to the emission bands of ligands.
