At 298 K and 100 kPa, the CO2 loading (49.1 cm3 (STP) g-1 or 8.8 wt %) is comparable with those (6.2-9.1 wt %) in some zinc-imidazolate zeolite frameworks, whereas it exceeds the values in some Zn4O-containing MOFs with nanopores (9.0-32.0 \u00c5), such as SNU-70 (3.5 wt %), UMCM-1 (3.8 wt %), and MOF-5 (4.5 wt %), indicating the advantage of CO2 capture in small pores owing to overlap of the potential fields of pore walls.\n\nIt is worth noting that the reported gas sorption measurements in MOFs were majorly made at or below 298 K, and very few were performed at higher temperatures, which are more practical to evaluate postcombustion CO2 capture performance in realistic working temperatures of about 313-333 K. Strikingly, at 308 K and 130 kPa, the CO2 uptakes in 1a reached 40.2 cm3 (STP) g-1, but only a trace of N2 (0.8 cm3 (STP) g-1) was observed (Figure ). Especially for CO2:N2 = 50:50 and 15:85 mixtures, they show very high IAST selectivities of 58-188 and 49-148 from 0.1 to 130 kPa (Figure c,d), respectively. Most importantly, at 313 K, 1a is nonadsorptive for N2 but shows excellent CO2 loading of 30.2 cm3 (STP) g-1 at 100 kPa, which is among the best values of CO2 uptakes in MOFs at 313 K (Table S1, ), and are comparable with those in zinc-adeninate bio-MOFs-1 with multipoint sorption sites, but exceeding greatly those in MOF-5 (1.13 mmol g-1) and MOF-177 (0.80 mmol g-1).", "data": [[[{"meta":
