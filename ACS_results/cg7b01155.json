The quenching of fluorescent emission with the different compounds examined in 5 min follows the order: 2-NT > 2-NP > NB > TNP > 2,4-DNT > 3-NP > 4-NP > 1,3-DNB (Figures S11-S18); evidently, the observations were in disagreement with the vapor pressures of the chosen NACs. For example, the vapor pressure of 2,4-DNT (1.44 \u00d7 10-6 mmHg) is much lower than that of 1,3-DNB (8.82 \u00d7 10-4 mmHg), but 2,4-DNT shows the faster quenching effect. As a matter of fact, the fluorescence quenching is the comprehensive outcome, such as orbit energy level of hosts and guests, diffusion, and the preparation of film. However, the film sensor of compound 1 displays the excellent ability for the trace of the vapor NACs. 2-NP and NB show a 70% and 66% quenching effect in 3 min of exposure time, respectively. The quenching efficiencies of the sample film against 2-NT, 2-NP, and NB after 300 s reach upward of at least 85%.
