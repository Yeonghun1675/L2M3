Furthermore, looking down the a- or b-axes, these channels are interlinked by nearly square windows composed of two In(III) sites and two metalloligands (channels B) (Figure S4). As in 1, all channels integrate -PdCl2- units with the two Cl- anions being disordered over two positions (Figure S3). Contrary to 1, the framework in 2 is anionic, i.e., -1 per molecular unit.

The void volume in 2 was estimated by PLATON to be 66%.

Compared with\nour recently reported Cu-based MOF (201.8 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> at 273 K/1 bar), denoted as <bold>NbO-Pd-1</bold> (BET surface area\n1568 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup>, pore volume 0.60 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup>, and \u03c1<sub>xlt</sub> = 0.93 g\ncm<sup>\u20133</sup>) using the same organic linker, the lower gravimetric\nCO<sub>2</sub> capacity is mainly due to the significantly lower BET\nsurface area and total pore volume of <bold>1a</bold>. In terms of volumetric capacity (calculated\nusing the crystal density of <bold>1a</bold>, 1.31 g cm<sup>\u20133</sup>) which is also very important for applications, the corresponding\nvalues are 120.9, 101.1, and 86.2 cm<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>\u20133</sup> at 273, 283, and 293 K, respectively.

This MOF has an anionic framework\nthat was not yet possible to activate.</p>", "clean_text": "We recently reported the use of the palladated 4-c metallo-linker (H4 L), shown in a, that was designed to afford a copper-based nbo type MOF. This novel MOF shows a remarkable CO2 uptake (9 mmol g-1 at 273 K and 1 bar) due to the synergistic effect of Cu(II) UMS acting as Lewis acid sites and Pd(II) acting as Lewis base sites. It is evident that the use of this kind of metallo-linkers in reticular synthesis of MOFs, opens new pathways for the construction of a family of porous solids that will combine a particular topology with an additional pore functionality, originating from the presence of Pd(II) sites. To demonstrate this, we present here the first MOF with soc topology using the palladated linker H4 L based on the trimeric SBU In3(\u03bc3-\u039f)(-COO)6Cl, denoted hereafter as 1. In addition, a slight modification of the synthetic conditions resulted in a novel MOF with PtS type structure, featuring pseudotetrahedral single In(III) cations as the inorganic nodes, denoted as 2. We have successfully activated 1 and report extensive sorption studies of important gases including carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrogen. The results show that activated 1 has high CO2 uptake (92.3 cm3 g-1 at 1 bar and 273 K) with moderate isosteric heat of adsorption at zero coverage (29.8 kJ mol-1) and high CO2/CH4 (15.4, 50:50 molar mixture), CO2/N2 (131.7, 10:90 molar mixture) selectivity at 273 K and 1 bar.\n\nThe thermal stability of as-synthesized 1 was investigated by TGA. Upon heating, 1 loses weight in two steps, and the process is completed at 650 \u00b0C (Figure S14). A weight loss of 20% occurs below 210 \u00b0C, corresponding to solvent evaporation. Above 310 \u00b0C weight loss is associated with structural breakdown as the metalloligand decomposes.\n\nActivation Process\n\nAttempts to activate 1 under conventional methods, i.e., by solvent exchange and thermal evacuation under reduced pressure proved to be unsuccessful, as evidenced by N2 sorption studies at 77 K. Successful activation was achieved using a supercritical CO2 drying (SCD) methodology. The removal of all solvent molecules while maintaining structural integrity was evaluated by 1H NMR, PXRD, and TGA measurements. The PXRD pattern reveals a high crystallinity and confirms that the structure remains intact after removal of all solvent molecules (). The TGA analysis of activated 1, hereafter labeled as 1a, shows a weight loss of ca. 10% up to 200 \u00b0C attributed to the coordinated H2O molecules on the indium trimer, followed by structural breakdown after 320 \u00b0C (Figure S14). 1H NMR spectroscopy confirmed as well the absence of solvent molecules in 1a (Figure S16).\n\nGas Sorption Properties\n\nNitrogen and argon sorption isotherm of 1a recorded at 77 and 87 K respectively, revealed fully reversible type-I curves characteristic of a microporous material (Figure S17). The BET and Langmuir areas, calculated from the nitrogen isotherm in the pressure range 0.006-0.06 p/p 0 using consistency criteria, were found to be 795 m2 g-1 (Figure S18) and 851 m2 g-1, respectively. The corresponding results extracted from the Argon isotherm are fully consistent (Figures S19 and S20). The very good agreement between the experimentally determined total pore volume (0.35 cm3 g-1 at 0.99 p/p 0 from N2 isotherm) and the corresponding theoretical value calculated from the crystal structure (0.40 cm3 g-1), suggest that the material remains practically intact after activation. The non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) pore size distribution curve, calculated from the Ar adsorption isotherm using a suitable kernel (cylindrical argon-zeolite), displays a main peak centered at 5.8 \u00c5 (Figured S21 and S22). This result is in full agreement with the pore size expected from the single crystal structure.\n\nAs shown in  and S23, a high CO2 uptake is observed reaching 92.3 cm3 g-1 (4.1 mmol g-1, 18.1 wt %), 77.2 cm3 g-1 (3.4 mmol g-1, 15.2 wt %), and 65.8 cm3 g-1 (2.9 mmol g-1, 12.9 wt %) at 273, 283, and 293 K, respectively, at 1 bar. Considering the gravimetric uptake of 1a at 273 K and 1 bar (92.3 cm3 g-1), there is a limited number of MOFs with higher gravimetric CO2 capacity. This value is also comparable with that of the prototype In-soc-MOF (91.1 cm3 g-1) (or CPM-200-In, 109.6 cm3 g-1) with very similar porosity (BET area 888 m2 g-1, pore volume 0.44 cm3 g-1), based on the organic linker 3,3',5,5'-azobenzenetetracarboxylic acid. Compared with our recently reported Cu-based MOF (201.8 cm3 g-1 at 273 K/1 bar), denoted as NbO-Pd-1 (BET surface area 1568 m2 g-1, pore volume 0.60 cm3 g-1, and \u03c1xlt = 0.93 g cm-3) using the same organic linker, the lower gravimetric CO2 capacity is mainly due to the significantly lower BET surface area and total pore volume of 1a. In terms of volumetric capacity (calculated using the crystal density of 1a, 1.31 g cm-3) which is also very important for applications, the corresponding values are 120.9, 101.1, and 86.2 cm3 cm-3 at 273, 283, and 293 K, respectively. The observed uptake at 273 K/1 bar (120.9 cm3 cm-3) is comparable to the corresponding values of some top performing MOFs, including NJU-Bai21 (121.2 cm3 cm-3 at 273 K/1 bar) and Cu-TPBTM (135.9 cm3 cm-3 at 273 K/1 bar).\n\nUsing the isotherms recorded at 273, 283, and 293 K and applying a virial type fitting, the calculated isosteric heat of adsorption, Q st, is 29.8 kJ mol-1 at zero coverage (Q st 0) and as a function of surface coverage remains almost constant, suggesting a uniform potential landscape in the pores of 1a (Figure S27). Interestingly, the observed Q st 0 value is higher compared to that of NbO-Pd-1 (23.5 kJ mol-1); however, it is lower compared to those of other high performance MOFs including CPM-200 (Fe/Mg, 34.3 kJ mol-1), Cu-TDPAT (42.2 kJ mol-1), and Mg-MOF-74 (47 kJ mol-1). A lower Q st 0 value is preferable for practical applications due to the anticipated energy efficient regeneration.\n\nFinally, the hydrogen storage properties of 1a were also investigated. Accordingly, the gravimetric and volumetric uptake at 77 K and 1 bar are 143.9 cm3 g-1 (6.4 mmol g-1, 1.28 wt %) and 188.5 cm3 cm-3, respectively (Figure S26). The Q st 0 value calculated from the corresponding isotherms at 77, 90, and 100 K is 7.1 kJ mol-1 and as a function of surface coverage remains almost constant (Figure S29). The observed Q st 0 value is higher with respect to the prototype In-soc MOF, however the latter shows higher gravimetric uptake (2.6 wt %) due to the combination of higher porosity and lower crystal density.\n\nConclusions\n\nPalladated organic linker H4 L was successfully utilized for the construction of a new member in the important family of MOFs with soc topology. Accordingly, the new In-based material features the unique pore structure of soc-type MOFs decorated with -PdCl2- moieties. This kind of complex heterometallic MOF offers great opportunities for numerous key applications including gas storage and separations.
