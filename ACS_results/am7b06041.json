The single crystal structures of the Cr3O cluster, obtained from diffraction experiments (CCDC deposition 1539824), and the previously reported structure of Fe3O provide quick evidence for the correct phase formation via powder X-ray diffraction followed by subsequent Le Bail fitting (Figures S1-S3). The crystal structures of the mixed metal clusters, Fe2CrO, Fe2CoO, and Fe2NiO, which are to date unreported, are expected to be different from Fe3O and Cr3O as indicated by the pxrd patterns (Figure S1). Given our inability to grow single crystals of these clusters, we have relied on a number of other characterization techniques to indicate their purity and composition. Characterization including MS, EDX, ICP, and IR was deemed necessary to prove the presence and purity of the three mixed metal clusters. First, EDX and ICP-OES gave evidence of the correct Fe:M ratio of ~2:1 for the three Fe2MO samples both on the surface of individual particles and in the bulk powder phase, respectively (Figure S4). Further, elemental mapping, carried out on the surface of the polycrystalline powders showed a homogeneous distribution of the Fe and M atoms (Figure S4). ESI-MS was then used to add further proof that the clusters formed in the crystalline powder samples consist only of the targeted composition.

The observed peaks in the MS spectra include m/z values of 562.87 and 563.87 for [Fe2NiO(CH3CO2)6]Na+ and [Fe2CoO(CH3CO2)6]Na+, respectively, and m/z values of 533.88 and 525.9 for [Fe2CrO(CH3CO2)6]+ and [Cr3O(CH3CO2)6]+, respectively (Figure S5). It should be noted that for all mixed metal clusters no evidence of the Fe3O or Cr3O clusters was observed in ESI-MS, indicating that the target compositions are indeed achieved. Last, IR-ATR data (Figure S6) proved the successful synthesis of these clusters in the solid state. The intense absorption bands at around 1580 and 1420 cm-1 are assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretches of the -COO- groups of the acetate anion, respectively. Absorption in the range of 400-800 cm-1 is further used for the identification of the metal-\u03bc3-oxo bands of the M3(\u03bc3-O) core. In the IR spectrum of the Fe2CoO, Fe2NiO, and Fe2CrO clusters, the characteristic stretching vibration observed for the Fe3(\u03bc3-O) core (at ~600 cm-1) disappears, and two new bands appear. This is due to a reduction in the site geometry from D 3h  to C 2v  upon metal substitution, which lifts the degeneracy of the asymmetric metal-\u03bc3-oxo stretching vibrations.

The Fe3O-BPDC analogue (1) has a surface area, 1690 m2/g, similarly reported for MOF-126 by Serre et al. The gelatinous phase containing the Cr3O cluster, 5, exhibits a BET surface area of 602 m2/g (Figure S10). While this surface area was obtained using normal activation procedures with heat and vacuum, it is expected that higher surface areas could be achieved with supercritical CO2 extraction. While it is not known why the surface areas of 2 and 3 are so much lower than 1 and 4, it could be related to crystalline defects induced by the mismatch in the ligand exchange rate of the M2+ and M3+ cations in 2 and 3, differences in nucleation and growth rates, or other issues regarding the framework charge.

The PXRD pattern of the material quenched at different times (Figure S25) shows first the formation of a gelatinous phase, followed by the formation of Bragg reflections at very low angles (below 5\u00b0), and then the final crystallization of 6.
