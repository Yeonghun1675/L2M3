A comparison of SDU-1 with MOF-1 and MOF-2 suggests that the conformation of hexacarboxylate ligand (Scheme S1 in the ) dictates the resulting structures. In SDU-1, the steric hindrance of three methyl groups drives the three isophthalate units of each TMBHB to be perfectly perpendicular to the central phenyl ring with a dihedral angle of 90\u00b0. However, in the absence of three methyl groups, the steric hindrance effect was alleviated and the resulting dihedral angles between the isophthalate unit and the central phenyl ring in MOF-1 and MOF-2 are 32.6 and 40.9\u00b0, respectively.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 13, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The solid-state luminescent emission spectra of <bold>SDU-1</bold> and H<sub>6</sub>TMBHB were studied at room temperature.\nAs shown\nin Figure , H<sub>6</sub>TMBHB and <bold>SDU-1</bold> have slightly different emissions at 391 and 393 nm upon 300 nm\nexcitation, respectively.
