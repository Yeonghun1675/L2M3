There was no process to characterize the structural change that occurred during the cooling process (the blue line); therefore, we can conclude that 1' was stable even at room temperature, giving good crystals without cracks. The structure of the desolvated 1' was determined by single-crystal X-ray crystallography, as is described below. X-ray powder diffraction analysis confirmed that the other doped compounds were isostructural with 1' (Figure S3, ). It should be noted, however, that the transformation was reversible. When the dried sample was stored with benzene vapor, in a N2 atmosphere, for 1 h, the compound completely returned to the solvated form (i.e., 1), and this was confirmed from the XRPD patterns (Figure a) and the magnetic data (Figure S4, ). XRPD spectra of the powder samples in benzene atmosphere were collected every 10 min for 1 h (Figure b). The crystals did not pass through a new phase with a different lattice from 1' and 1, and the intermediate phase that had already appeared after 10 min was found to be simply a mixture of phases of 1' and 1, indicating that the benzene molecules were absorbed relatively quickly compared with their loss in the elimination process.

The magnitude of the exchange parameter J between [Ru2 II,III]+ and BTDA-TCNQ\u22c5- was basically identical to that for 1, with J ~ -100 K (Table S3, ). The doping of [Rh2 II,II] species into the ionic chain enabled a mixed valence set A-A0 to be formed in a chain domain between [Rh2 II,II] species. Nevertheless, the results indicated that the effect of the mixed valence set in the doped compounds was not dominated by the magnetic correlation, although the [Rh2 II,II] dopants acted as defects, affecting the effective magnetic domain length. The doped compounds, except for Rh-16% and Rh-16%', each underwent an antiferromagnetic phase transition similar to that for 1 and 1', and this can easily be seen in the M-H curves at low fields (Figure b). The T N was 5.9 K for Rh-3%, 3.7 K for Rh-5%, and 9.9 and 9.2 K, respectively, for the solvent-free compounds Rh-3%' and Rh-5%' (Figure a).

In addition, considering the isostructural features of the fresh and dried compound series, the interchain distances should be constant in each series, independent of the amount doped. The simple model based on the individual local spins S = 3/2 and S = 1/2 could, therefore, no longer be used alone to explain the doping-dependent T N. The spins were changed to the effective spins, i.e., S [Ru2]' = 3/2(1 - x) and S Rad' = 1/2(1 - x) for the doped system, and these spin values were very useful for evaluating the nature of the magnetic short-range domains in the chain. This was because the mean size of the one-dimensional (1-D) domains, which will be proportional to the effective spin S eff' = (S [Ru]' - S Rad') = (1 - x), will be a crucial factor in determining T N when the interchain dipole-dipole interactions play an important role in the formation of 3-D domains. The dipole energy is proportional to the magnetic moment \u03bc = g\u03bc B S eff' and the inverse of r 3 (i.e., 1/r 3) because r is the vector distance between S eff' spins.

Interestingly, in addition to the crystal-to-crystal transformation, doping 1 with [Rh2 II,II] instead of [Ru2 II,II] systematically modifies T N, despite the fact that no significant structural differences exist between the original compound (1 or 1') and the corresponding doped compound. In this Article, we report the precise tuning of the magnetic phase in this series of chain compounds by combining two chemical techniques: (i) desolvation/solvation of the crystal phase and (ii) doping with diamagnetic species. Both techniques are associated with changes in interchain dipole-dipole interactions.\n\nCrystallographic Data for 1'\n\nC44H24Cl4N8O12Ru2S2, M r = 1264.79, triclinic, P\u03051 (#2), a = 10.544(11) \u00c5, b = 10.858(9) \u00c5, c = 11.739(10) \u00c5, \u03b1 = 114.00(3)\u00b0, \u03b2 = 94.84(5)\u00b0, \u03b3 = 93.09(5) \u00b0, V = 1218(2) \u00c53, T = 97(1) K, Z = 1, D calc = 1.725 g cm-3, F 000 = 628, \u03bb = 0.71075 \u00c5, \u03bc(Mo K\u03b1) = 9.954 cm-1, 7944 measured reflections, 4180 unique reflections (R int = 0.0342), R 1 = 0.0724 (I > 2\u03c3(I)), R 1 = 0.0955 (all data), and wR 2 = 0.1907 (all data) with GOF = 1.074.
