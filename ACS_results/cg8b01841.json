While this did not lead to isolation of fractionally reduced materials, intriguingly, only a semiconducting polymorph \u03b2 (2) was obtained, rather than polymorph \u03b1 (1) or a mixture of polymorphs. The yield of polymorph \u03b2 (2) increased in proportion to the percentage TCNQF4 present. Thus, in the highest yielding synthesis, a CH3CN solution of [Cp2Co]PF6 (33.4 mg, 0.1 mmol) was added to a CH3OH solution of LiTCNQF4 (28.3 mg, 0.1 mmol) containing 10% TCNQF4 (2.76 mg, 0.01 mmol). The resultant mixture was stirred for 1 h under N2 and filtered to remove the precipitate. The filtrate was diffused with diethyl ether, yielding blue, single crystals suitable for X-ray crystallographic analysis (28 mg, 82%, based on LiTCNQF4).
