The third new Zn/BTB phase adopts a diamondoid net containing trinuclear zinc hourglass SBUs. Linker-linker interactions are key in the formation of each of these new structures. Polymorphic frameworks, due to their identity as supramolecular isomers, allow for the systematic exploration of topological effects on material properties and function. These polymorphic frameworks offer a complement to the recently reported isoreticular MOFs,where the topology and SBU of multiple MCPs remain the same but the length and/or functionality of the linker is varied, and may well be described as a polyreticular series.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 23, "type": "table", "classification": null, "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Crystallographic Data and Structural Refinement Summary for <bold>Zn/BTB ant</bold>, <bold>Zn/BTB tsx</bold>, and <bold>Zn/BTB dia</bold>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table>\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"4\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">compound</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<bold>Zn/BTB ant</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<bold>Zn/BTB tsx</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<bold>Zn/BTB dia</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>chemical formula</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>C<sub>55.65</sub>H<sub>33.3</sub>O<sub>13.55</sub>Zn<sub>4</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>C<sub>54</sub>H<sub>30</sub>O<sub>13</sub>Zn<sub>4</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>C<sub>108</sub>H<sub>63</sub>O<sub>26</sub>Zn<sub>6</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>fw</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1179.05</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1148.34</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2168.81</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>temperature, K</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>100(2)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>150(2)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>293(2)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>space group</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">C</italic>2/c (#15)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">I</italic>4\u03052<italic toggle=\"yes\">d</italic> (#122)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">Fd</italic>3\u0305 (#203)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">a</italic>, \u00c5</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>26.3857(14)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>13.9578(4)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>25.9759(5)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">b</italic>, \u00c5</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>28.3859(14)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>13.9578(4)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>25.9759(5)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">c</italic>, \u00c5</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>31.6139(16)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>28.7133(11)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>25.9759(5)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\u03b1, deg</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>90</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>90</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>90</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\u03b2, deg</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>113.567(2)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>90</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>90</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\u03b3, deg</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>90</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>90</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>90</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">V</italic>, \u00c5<sup>3</sup>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>21703.3(19)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>5593.9(3)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>17527.2(6)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">Z</italic>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>8</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>4</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>8</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\u03bb, \u00c5 (Cu K\u03b1)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.54187</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.54187</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.54187</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\u03c1<sub>calcd</sub>, g/cm<sup>3</sup>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.722</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.363</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.641</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\u03bc, mm<sup>\u22121</sup>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.264</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.431</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.528</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>R<sub></sub>1 [<italic toggle=\"yes\">I</italic> &gt;
