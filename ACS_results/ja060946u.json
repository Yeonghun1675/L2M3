Under N<sub>2</sub>, however, the\nmaterial is stable up to 450 \u00b0C. Figure  confirms that\nconsiderable crystallinity remains, even after the sample has\nbeen heated to 500 \u00b0C in a TGA experiment, with only small\nlevels of peak broadening observed.\n</p><p>The excellent framework stability of <bold>II</bold> provides an opportunity to probe gas adsorption properties. The isotherm\nobtained with N<sub>2</sub> gas at 78 K revealed a typical Type-I\nadsorption curve as defined by the IUPAC classification\nscheme<sup>33</sup> (Figure ).

Using the t-plot\nmodel, the pore volume is 0.146 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, which is smaller than\nthe pore volume of 0.187 cm<sup>3</sup>/g calculated from the crystal\nstructure:\u2009 this discrepancy can be attributed to the N<sub>2</sub> molecules\nbeing unable to fill the void space efficiently. Using the\nHorvath\u2212Kawazoe (HK) method, a very narrow pore width\ndistribution centered at 5.2 \u00c5 was obtained, which is consistent\nwith the single-crystal structure analysis.\n\n\n</p><p>The framework <bold>II</bold> reversibly adsorbs and desorbs H<sub>2</sub> at\n77 K, and typical Type-I adsorption behavior was observed\n(Figure ). The H<sub>2</sub> adsorption data can be fitted by the linear\nLangmuir equation, predicting a maximum uptake of 1.08 wt\n%, which was experimentally observed at 4 bar. The observed\nH<sub>2</sub> adsorption at 300mbar is 0.8 wt %, and almost reaches a\nplateau indicative of strong micropore filling relative to most\nknown coordination frameworks which adsorb hydrogen.\nBy using a value for the density of liquid hydrogen of 0.077\ng/cm<sup>3</sup> at the triple point (14 K), the volume of H<sub>2</sub> adsorbed on\n<bold>II</bold> is 0.158 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, corresponding to 21.3% occupancy and 4.9\nhydrogen molecules in each unit cell.\n</p><p>Methane adsorption at 298 K corresponds to 3.14 wt % (44.0\ncm<sup>3</sup>/g or 67 v/v) at 9 bar (Figure ) and 14.1% occupancy of\nthe unit cell. Although this adsorption is low relative to the\n\nfilling level of other guest species, the adsorption curve lies\nclose to the saturation plateau (Figure ), and therefore little\nfurther uptake can be expected.

Crystal data for I: Tetragonal, P42212, a = b = 7.0249(7) \u00c5, c =19.936(2) \u00c5, V = 983.8(3) \u00c53, T = 150 K, C14H12N2O12Zn2, MW 531.04, Z = 2, D calcd = 1.793 g/cm3, \u03bc = 2.504 mm-1. Of 4888 reflections collected, 746 were independent with R int = 0.027. The structure was solved by direct methods using SHELXS97 refined by least-squares on F 2 in SHEXLX97. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically, and framework hydrogen atoms were placed geometrically and refined as part of a riding model. Hydrogen atoms on the guest water molecules were not located from difference Fourier maps but were included in the formula. Final R 1 = 0.045 for 679 reflections with I > 2\u03c3(I), wR 2 = 0.124 for all 728 reflections, GOF = 1.095, \u0394\u03c1max = 0.85, \u0394\u03c1min = -0.40 \u00c5-3. \n\n B. [Zn  2  (L)] \u221e  (II). The crystal used in the above data collection for I was then mounted on a dual stage glass fiber using epoxy glue. The crystal was placed in a dry nitrogen gas flow at 293 K for 2 h, to remove the guest water molecules and convert compound I to II. Following this treatment of the crystal the diffraction pattern had altered and showed what appears to be a modulated structure with regular satellite reflections around peaks from the original lattice. Only the reflections fitting the original lattice were integrated and used for this study and were indexed as follows. Crystal data for II: Tetragonal, P42/mnm, a = b = 7.0649(4) \u00c5, c =19.775(2) \u00c5, V = 987.03(13) \u00c53, Z = 2, D calcd = 1.544 g cm-3, \u03bc = 2.469 mm-1. Of 5956 reflections collected, 752 were independent with R int = 0.022. The structure was solved by direct methods using SHELXS9728 refined by least-squares on F 2 in SHEXLX97. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically, and hydrogen atoms were placed geometrically and refined with a riding model. Diffuse electron density in the pore cavities was calculated and accounted for using SQUEEZE at 20 electrons per unit cell but the chemical species corresponding to this was not identified. Final R 1 = 0.059 for 291 reflections with I > 2\u03c3(I), wR 2 = 0.148 for all 505 reflections, GOF = 0.93, \u0394\u03c1max = 0.35, \u0394\u03c1min = -0.52 e\u00c5-3. \n\nIn addition to single-crystal X-ray diffraction data for I and II, data were also collected for [Zn2(L)]\u221e\u22c50.55Benzene (III) at 150 K on a Bruker SMART APEX CCD area detector diffractometer using graphite-monochromated Mo K\u03b1 radiation. These data showed a similar pattern of satellite peaks around a tetragonal lattice which was indexed with the following unit cell parameters, a = b = 7.0746(9) \u00c5, c =19.774(2) \u00c5, V = 989.7(4) \u00c53. Although the data confirm that the framework structure remains intact, a fully satisfactory refinement could not be obtained in this case. Several other experiments attempting to study the removal of the guest water molecules in situ have also been carried out using a heated dry nitrogen gas flow and in one case using a room temperature helium gas flow, which in all cases show similar features around this basic tetragonal lattice. We are currently investigating these systems further in order to fully describe these modulated structures. \n\nThe studies of thermal stability and gas absorption properties of compound I have been carried out by combining TGA, powder XRD, and gas isotherm measurements. The microcrystalline sample I loses water very rapidly as anticipated from the DRIFTS experiments. At 70 \u00b0C, the total weight loss is about 12.8%, slightly lower than the calculated water content (13.5%)  obtained from X-ray single-crystal structure analysis. This difference is attributed to the sample used for the TGA experiment losing some water after removal from water solution and prior to the TGA experiment. \n\nThe framework of compound I has a high thermal stability. According to the TGA and DSC data, no phase change was recorded after the removal of the water molecules from the channels up to 250 \u00b0C in air or 450 \u00b0C under a nitrogen atmosphere, above which the framework starts to decompose. By microscopy and powder XRD, a sample can be heated to 150 \u00b0C in air for 4 months without losing crystallinity, although it slowly decomposes above 200 \u00b0C. Under N2, however, the material is stable up to 450 \u00b0C. Figure  confirms that considerable crystallinity remains, even after the sample has been heated to 500 \u00b0C in a TGA experiment, with only small levels of peak broadening observed. \n\nThe excellent framework stability of II provides an opportunity to probe gas adsorption properties. The isotherm obtained with N2 gas at 78 K revealed a typical Type-I adsorption curve as defined by the IUPAC classification scheme33 (Figure ). The nitrogen adsorption increases abruptly at the start of the experiment and reaches a plateau of 97 cm3 (STP)/g at P/P 0 = 0.05, indicating a uniform structured micropore corresponding to 4.1 N2 molecules in each unit cell. The adsorption isotherm data were fitted to the BET equation to give a BET surface area of 312.7 m2/g and to the Langmuir equation giving a surface area of 423.7 m2/g. Using the t-plot model, the pore volume is 0.146 cm3/g, which is smaller than the pore volume of 0.187 cm3/g calculated from the crystal structure: this discrepancy can be attributed to the N2 molecules being unable to fill the void space efficiently. Using the Horvath-Kawazoe (HK) method, a very narrow pore width distribution centered at 5.2 \u00c5 was obtained, which is consistent with the single-crystal structure analysis.   \n\nThe framework II reversibly adsorbs and desorbs H2 at 77 K, and typical Type-I adsorption behavior was observed (Figure ). The H2 adsorption data can be fitted by the linear Langmuir equation, predicting a maximum uptake of 1.08 wt %, which was experimentally observed at 4 bar. The observed H2 adsorption at 300mbar is 0.8 wt %, and almost reaches a plateau indicative of strong micropore filling relative to most known coordination frameworks which adsorb hydrogen. By using a value for the density of liquid hydrogen of 0.077 g/cm3 at the triple point (14 K), the volume of H2 adsorbed on II is 0.158 cm3/g, corresponding to 21.3% occupancy and 4.9 hydrogen molecules in each unit cell. \n\nMethane adsorption at 298 K corresponds to 3.14 wt % (44.0 cm3/g or 67 v/v) at 9 bar (Figure ) and 14.1% occupancy of the unit cell. Although this adsorption is low relative to the  filling level of other guest species, the adsorption curve lies close to the saturation plateau (Figure ), and therefore little further uptake can be expected. The estimated maximum amount of CH4 adsorption on II, obtained by fitting of CH4 adsorption data to the Langmuir plot, is 4.27 wt % (59.8 cm3/g or 91 v/v).
