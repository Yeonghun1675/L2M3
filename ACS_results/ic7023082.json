In these compounds, both the P2W18 anion and the flexible bis(triazole) ligands exhibit rich coordination modes. Two important factors are found to influence the assembly of POM-based coordination polymers: (i) The steric hindrance of the organic ligand can influence the MOFs and tune the coordination mode of the polyoxoanion. (ii) The metal ion coordination geometries also have influence on the MOF structures. This work shows the perspective of using flexible ligands to construct the Wells-Dawson POM-based MOF polymers with interesting structure and to achieve the smart coordination sites of the Wells-Dawson type anions. Furthermore, this work extends the area of introducing flexible organic ligands into the POM system to obtain architectures where rigid inorganic frameworks and flexible metal coordination polymeric matrices are fused. The compounds 1-4 reflect this robustness/flexibility property. Notably, both CuI/II ions and multidentate POMs can be viewed as unsaturated metal centers uniformly distributed in the architectures. It is possible that the catalytic, spectral, and electrochemical properties are tuned or improved by these active centers. The next challenge is the physical functionalization of these architectures through the dynamic properties of the frameworks, the alternative transition-metal oxidation states, and the changeable coordination sites provided by Wells-Dawson POMs. Further investigations are underway.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 56, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Table of selected bond lengths and bond angles and XPRD, IR, TG, CV data, and structural figures for compounds <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>4</bold> (PDF).
