The 1.8 nm free diameter of the channels\ue5f8the largest one-dimensional channel of any known MOF\ue5f8is comparable to the largest pore windows found in carboxylate MOFs with coordinatively unsaturated metal sites (MIL-101_NDC(Cr), 1.8 \u00d7 2.0 nm4). Removal of physisorbed water from the channels yields permanent porosity of 0.68 cm3 g-1 (at p/p 0 = 0.4).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "Crystalline microporous cobalt and nickel bisphosphonates", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "pore diameter": [{"value": "1.8", "unit": "nm", "condition": "hydrothermally prepared"}, {"value": "18.5", "unit": "\u00c5", "condition": "dehydrated STA-16(Co)"}], "pore volume": [{"probe": "", "value": "0.68", "unit": "cm3/g", "condition": "dehydrated STA-16(Co)"}, {"probe": "", "value": "0.68", "unit": "cm3/g", "condition": "removal of physisorbed water from the channels"}], "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "48", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "loss of physisorbed water", "condition": "STA-16(Ni)"}, {"value": "93 to 148", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "removal of chemisorbed water", "condition": "STA-16(Ni)"}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "12.6", "unit": "mmol g-1", "temperature": "", "pressure": "p/p 0 = 0.4", "condition": "STA-16(Ni)"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["pore_diameter", "pore_volume", "decomposition_temperature", "gas_adsorption"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['pore_diameter', 'pore_volume', 'decomposition_temperature', 'gas_adsorption']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"Crystalline microporous cobalt and nickel bisphosphonates\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"pore diameter\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"1.8\",\n                \"unit\": \"nm\",\n                \"condition\": \"hydrothermally prepared\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"18.5\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00c5\",\n                \"condition\": \"dehydrated STA-16(Co)\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"pore volume\": [\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"0.68\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"dehydrated STA-16(Co)\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"0.68\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"removal of physisorbed water from the channels\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"decomposition temperature\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"48\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"loss of physisorbed water\",\n                \"condition\": \"STA-16(Ni)\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"93 to 148\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"removal of chemisorbed water\",\n                \"condition\": \"STA-16(Ni)\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"N2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"12.6\",\n                \"unit\": \"mmol g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"\",\n                \"pressure\": \"p/p 0 = 0.4\",\n                \"condition\": \"STA-16(Ni)\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 4, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Comparison of the channel diameters and bisphosphonate linkers used in the preparation of the isoreticular framework materials STA-12<named-content content-type=\"bibref-group\">\n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref12\"></xref>\u2212<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref13\" specific-use=\"suppress-in-print\"></xref>\n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref14\"></xref>\n</named-content> (left) and STA-16 (right).</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"ja-2010-097995_0002.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Comparison of the channel diameters and bisphosphonate linkers used in the preparation of the isoreticular framework materials STA-12 -   (left) and STA-16 (right).
