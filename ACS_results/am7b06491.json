The saturation uptake of NUM-3a for nitrogen physisorption is 531.2 cm3/g, and the pore volume is 0.82 cm3/g. According to the N2 adsorption data, the apparent Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Langmuir surface areas are 2111.2 and 2307.2 m2/g, respectively, which are located at the middle position among MOFs materials (). The BET surface area of NUM-3a is higher than many reported MOFs, such as MOF-505 (1547 m2/g), Mg-MOF-74 (1495 m2/g), CoMOF-74 (1080 m2/g), and SIFSIX-2-Cu-i (735 m2/g). \n\nDue to its comparatively high surface areas and void volumes and in order to understand the unique pore structure of NUM-3a, the low-pressure sorption isotherms of the pure-components of CO2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, and N2 were collected at 273 and 298 K, respectively. As shown in a, NUM-3a shows a comparatively high adsorption amount of CO2, in which the largest adsorption amount can reach 113 cm3(STP)/g at 273 K and 1 atm. However, compared with CO2, the uptake amounts of CH4, C2H4, C2H6, and N2 are only 39, 41, 27, and 10 cm3(STP)/g, respectively, which are clearly less than the adsorption amount of CO2. As well as at 273 K, at an ambient temperature of 298 K, NUM-3a exhibits a similar adsorption trend (83 cm3 (STP)/g for CO2, 25 cm3(STP)/g for CH4, 34 cm3(STP)/g for C2H4, 24 cm3(STP)/g for C2H6, and 5 cm3(STP)/g for N2; b). As shown in , the adsorption amount of NUM-3a for CO2 is not the highest, but which is still higher than a lot of well-known MOFs, such as MFM-130 (109 cm3/g at 273 K and 59 cm3/g at 298 K), MAF-23 (74.2 cm3/g at 273 K and 56.1 cm3/g at 298 K), ZIF-69 (70 cm3/g at 273 K), Zn(ain)2\u22c5(DMF) (66.4 cm3/g at 273 K and 51.3 cm3/g at 298 K), and BIF-41 (77.0 cm3/g at 273 K and 63.5 cm3/g at 294 K). \n\nConclusions\n\nIn summary, a multicage-based MOF NUM-3 with new topology has been rationally synthesized with angle-directed and face-directed mixed-ligands strategy. Single crystal structure analysis revealed that there exist four kinds of cages in the framework of NUM-3, and the four kinds of cages in the order ABCDCBA as the minimum repeat unit form a 1D tortuous channel along the c axis. Based on these characteristics, NUM-3a exhibits the capacity of efficient CO2 capture over N2, CH4, C2H4, and C2H6. At 273 K, the adsorption amount can reach 113 cm3 (STP)/g, and the selectivities for CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 are 11.0 (50/50) and 82.8 (15/85), respectively, which are higher than those for many famous MOFs materials. Therefore, this work might motivate more extensive research to develop new cage-based MOFs using their confinement effect to enhance the capacities to selectively capture specific gas molecules.",
