This is consistent with the presence of two crystallographically inequivalent water molecules in the crystal structure: one (that of O11) is situated 3.610 \u00c5 from a CuII center (Cu1), indicating a certain degree of coordination; the other (that of O10), by comparison, is not associated with the Cu ions at all. We ascribe the low volatility to the O11 water molecule, and for this we conjure up the following scenario: upon heating, the crystal lattice flexes and allows for this H2O to access more closely the CuII center, which, at higher temperatures, eventually leads to the highly stable cupric hydroxide species [e.g., Cu(OH)+, together with some form of the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on TMBD].", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 25, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Cu(II) ions in the crystal structure of <bold>2</bold> are aggregated into a centrosymmetric tetranuclear core Cu<sup>II</sup>\n<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Figure a).

Significant redox reaction between the Cu(II) species used and the TMBD molecules apparently occurred to generate the Cu(I) species for the formation of Cu2TMBD. Experiments on larger scales (e.g., with 20.0 mg of TMBD) in a 20-mL Teflon-lined reactor provided the same product in single phase purity (as checked by powder XRD). Chemical analysis of the product C6H6CuO2S2 [corresponding to Cu(TMBD)0.5] yields the following: found [C (30.27%), H (2.70%)]; calcd [C (30.31%), H (2.54)]. IR (\u03bd\u0305/cm-1): 2963w, 2923w, 1578s, 1414s, 1312s, 1261s, 1219w, 1029m, 990w, 970w, 840w, 801m, 779w, 606w.\n\nCrystallization of 2 \n\nA mixture of Cu(NO3)2\u22c53H2O (15.0 mg, 0.062 mmol), H2TMBD (9.0 mg, 0.026 mmol), and water (2.0 mL) were sealed in a Pyrex glass tube in an oven at 140 \u00b0C for 48 h and slowly cooled to room temperature within 12 h. Green block crystals of diffraction quality were obtained (4.5 mg, 37% based on H2TMBD). Significant redox reaction between the Cu(II) species used and the TMBD molecules apparently occurred to generate the Cu(I) species for the formation of compound 2. X-ray powder diffraction of the product indicated a single phase consistent with the single crystal structure (vide infra). Chemical analysis of the product C24H29Cu3O11S8 [corresponding to CuII 2OHCuI(TMBD)2\u22c52H2O] yields the following: found [C (30.71%), H (3.12%)]; calcd [C (30.68%), H (3.00%)]. IR (\u03bd\u0305/cm-1): 3411w, 2987w, 2923w, 1600s, 1438s, 1310s, 1123w, 1053w, 973 m, 784w, 624w.\n\nMethylamine Treatment of 2 \n\nA small vial containing about 5.0 mg of solid 2 was placed into a larger vial containing about 1.0 mL of methylamine (33% wt. solution in absolute ethanol), with care being taken to avoid direct contact between the solid sample and the liquid. The larger vial was then capped to facilitate the vapor treatment experiment. The duration of the vapor treatment was 1.0 h. Elemental analysis of the methylamine-treated sample of 2 found [C (29.99%), H (4.71%), N (5.17%)], corresponding to CuII 2OHCuI(TMBD)2\u22c54MeNH2\u22c55H2O: calcd [C (30.08%), H (4.95%), N (5.01%)].\n\nEthylamine Treatment of 2 \n\nA small vial containing about 5.0 mg of solid 2 was placed into a larger vial containing about 1.0 mL of ethylamine (70% wt. solution in water), with care being taken to avoid direct contact between the solid sample and the liquid. The larger vial was then capped to facilitate the vapor treatment experiment. The duration of the vapor treatment was 1.0 h. Elemental analysis of ethylamine-treated sample of 2 found [C (30.55%), H (5.05%), N (4.18%)], corresponding to CuII 2OHCuI(TMBD)2\u22c53.2CH3CH2NH2\u22c57.5H2O]: calcd [C (30.84%), H (5.31%), N
