Synchrotron single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies reveal that the structure of SLUG-22 is also a cationic one-dimensional MOF with infinite chains composed of alternating copper(I) centers and 4,4'-bipy organic linkers (Figures  and ). The Cu(I)-bipy chains are arranged into close-packed layers by \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking between adjacent 1D chains (Figure , right). The Cu(I) atoms and its full d shell form an almost linear two-coordinate environment, with N(5)-Cu(3)-N(6) and N(7)-Cu(4)-N(8) angles between 169.40(11)\u00b0 and 169.48(11)\u00b0.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 14, "type": "table", "classification": null, "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Crystallographic Information, Data Collection, and Refinement Parameters for SLUG-22</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup align=\"left\" cols=\"3\">\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"COLSPEC0\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry valign=\"middle\">empirical formula</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry valign=\"middle\">Cu<sub>2</sub>C<sub>22</sub>H<sub>26</sub>O<sub>9</sub>N<sub>4</sub>S<sub>2</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry valign=\"middle\"></oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>formula weight (g\u00b7mol<sup>\u22121</sup>)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>681.71</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>temperature (K)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>150(2)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>wavelength (\u00c5)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.774\u200990 (synchrotron)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>crystal system</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>triclinic</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>space group</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>1\u0305</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>unit cell dimensions</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">a</italic> = 8.9031(9) \u00c5</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">b</italic> = 10.9120(11) \u00c5</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">c</italic> = 14.4304(10) \u00c5</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u03b1 = 103.6150(10)\u00b0</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u03b2 = 102.272(2)\u00b0</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u03b3 = 97.5290(10)\u00b0</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>volume (\u00c5<sup>3</sup>)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1307.0(2)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">Z</italic>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>crystal descriptions</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>yellow block</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>crystal size (mm<sup>3</sup>)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.05 \u00d7 0.04 \u00d7 0.04</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>index range</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry nameend=\"COLSPEC0\" namest=\"col2\">\u221211 \u2264 <italic toggle=\"yes\">h</italic> \u2264 11, \u221213 \u2264 <italic toggle=\"yes\">k</italic> \u2264 13, \u221218 \u2264 <italic toggle=\"yes\">l</italic> \u2264 18</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>density (calculated g\u00b7cm<sup>\u22123</sup>)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.732</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>reflections collected</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>14355</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>unique reflections</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>5316</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>final <italic toggle=\"yes\">R</italic> indices [<italic toggle=\"yes\">I</italic> &gt;
