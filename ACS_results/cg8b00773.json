On the basis of their photoluminescence properties, four white-light-emitting materials 4-7 were fabricated. Synthetically, the temperature, solvent (DMF), and pH value play a key role in the reactions. Structurally, since the pyridyl N atom does not interact with the Ln3+ center, the channels with the larger windows are found in the 3-D networks of the title compounds. The photoluminescence analysis reveals that H4L can sensitize Tb3+ and Eu3+ to emit the characteristic green or red light. Although Gd3+ cannot be sensitized, the Gd3+ complex exhibits a blue-light emission. The mixture of Tb3+/Eu3+/Gd3+ or the mixture of Tb3+/Eu3+ can both afford the white-light-emitting materials. Here the role of the excitation wavelength cannot be ignored. It not only can alter the transferred energy, letting the emissions of ligand and Ln3+ coexist, but also can modulate the emission intensities of RGB light. 4-7 possess longer fluorescence lifetimes and higher quantum yields, which is due to the bigger \u03c0-conjugated rings of L4-. According to a fluorescence quenching mechanism, the title compound 1 has been found not only to be able to highly selectively sense the different polychlorinated benzenes, but also to be able to highly sensitively sense the Fe3+ ion. The fluorescence quenching of 1 should be related to the electron-deficient nature for polychlorinated benzenes and Fe3+. Due to their electron-deficient nature, the intrinsic energy transferring path is changed, and the antenna effect is prohibited, so the quenching phenomenon occurs. The high selection of 1 on the polychlorinated benzenes should be associated with their electron-accepting ability. The more numbers of Cl atoms, the stronger the electron accepting ability is, while the polychlorinated benzene with the strong electron accepting ability can quickly quench the fluorescence emission of 1. The high sensitivity of 1 on Fe3+ should be associated with the following several factors: the larger \u03c0-conjugated structure for L4-; the larger pore observed in the 3-D network of 1; and the existence of the uncoordinated N atom on the spacer of L4-. The test-paper experiments point out that 1 can be made into test paper to readily detect 1,2,4-TCB and Fe3+.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 41, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information\nis available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.cgd.8b00773\">10.1021/acs.cgd.8b00773</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Projection plots;\npowder XRD patterns for <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>7</bold>; IR spectra\nand TG curves for <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>3</bold>; decay curves\nand lifetimes for <bold>4</bold>\u2013<bold>7</bold>; emission spectra\nof <bold>1</bold> with added polychlorinated benzenes, and corresponding\nStern\u2013Volmer plots; fluorescence spectra and TG curves for <bold>1</bold> before and after interacting with Fe<sup>3+</sup>; HOMO\nand LUMO energies for ligand and polychloriznated benzenes; DFT calculation\nprocess; CIE chromaticity coordinates for <bold>5</bold>\u2013<bold>7</bold> (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.cgd.8b00773/suppl_file/cg8b00773_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.cgd.8b00773.
