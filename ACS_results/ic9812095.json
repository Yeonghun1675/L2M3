Spectroscopic Studies. Pertinent data for phase I and phase II of Cu(TCNQ) are summarized in Table . An interpretation of these data is provided in the following sections.  \n\n (a) X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. The 1:1 ratio of Cu to TCNQ in the material does not necessarily connote that complete charge transfer between the metal and the acceptor has occurred; thus it is important to probe the oxidation state of the metal in the Cu(TCNQ) phases. One method that is useful in this regard is X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In earlier reports, XPS data of Cu(TCNQ) prepared from CuI revealed characteristic binding energies for Cu(I) 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 9,b,d,28 with no evidence for shoulders or higher binding energy satellites that could be attributed to Cu(II). Likewise, XPS data for compounds 1 and 2 prepared in our laboratories gave essentially identical results in accord with Cu(I). Data from the present work as well as earlier papers are presented in Table . The 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 signals are depicted in Figure . Both phases exhibit essentially identical binding energies for the Cu 2p orbitals, with no evidence for shoulders or satellites due to Cu(II). Likewise, the N1s orbitals appear as a single feature at 398.7 eV in both phases, which is indicative of one type of TCNQ. Mixtures of TCNQ- and TCNQ can be readily discerned in this region. The ease with which Cu(II) can be observed in bona fide mixed-valence CuI/CuII compounds and materials is illustrated by a comparison of the data for chemically prepared Cu(TCNQ) with electrochemically prepared Cu(DCNQI)2 materials. For example, the mixed-valence metallic Cu(DM-DCNQI)2 shows two sets of Cu 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 (931.6, 933.6 eV) signals and a more obvious second set of satellite features  at 943 and 962 eV, characteristic of paramagnetic Cu(II). As further support for the lack of Cu(II) in our TCNQ samples we undertook XPS measurements of the nitrile salts [CuI(CH3CN)4][BF4] and [CuII(CH3CN)4][BF4]2 as references. Although they were rather unstable under the vacuum conditions, the Cu(II) salt gave four different signals in the Cu 2p region whereas the Cu(I) analogue reveals only two features. We take these data as convincing evidence that Cu(II) is not present in our samples to any appreciable degree. This conclusion is in contrast to data obtained for electrochemically prepared samples reported by Willett and co-workers which point to the presence of both Cu(I) and Cu(II) species.
