The asymmetric unit corresponds to the formula\nunit, which consists of one uranyl unit, one dbsf<sup>2\u2013</sup> ligand, and one bpy ligand (a). The uranyl center is primarily coordinated by two\nbidentate \u03b7<sup>2</sup>-coordinated carboxyl groups from two\ndbsf<sup>2\u2013</sup> ligands to give a one-dimensional (1D) chain,\nand two nitrogen atoms of the bpy ligand complete the coordination\nspheres of the uranyl centers to form a distorted hexagonal-bipyramidal\ngeometry (b).\nBecause the V-shaped bidentate dbsf<sup>2\u2013</sup> ligands are\nflexible and have a large torsion angle of 107.16(2)\u00b0, the 1D\nchain can further twist to generate a chiral helix along the <italic>b</italic> axis with a large helical pitch of 25.41 \u00c5.

The 2,2\u2032-bpy ligand coordinates to the uranyl centers\nat an out-of-the-equatorial-plane angle of about 34.4(1)\u00b0 and\npoints up at an angle of 34.2(6)\u00b0 to the helical axis. Also,\nthis special orientation affords a face-to-face detachment between\nthe adjacent 2,2\u2032-bpy ligands in the triple-stranded helices.\nIn contrast to the structures of compounds <bold>1</bold> and <bold>1\u2032</bold>, two pyridinyl groups of 2,2\u2032-bpy molecularly\ntwist along the C\u2013C single bond and lead to a dihedral angle\nof 13.238\u00b0, which makes the two pyridine groups parallel to their\ncorresponding adjacent pyridine group, and the two different distances\nof face-to-face detachment between the pyridine groups are 7.46 and\n6.54 \u00c5. Both of these distances are enabling an adjacent triple-stranded\nhelix to be inserted into the space between the 2,2\u2032-bpy motifs.\nTherefore, the pyridine groups of the 2,2\u2032-bpy motifs from\nadjacent triple-stranded helices are alternately arranged with two\ndifferent distances between them of 3.40 and 3.43 \u00c5, which are\nboth within the range for \u03c0\u2013\u03c0-stacking interactions\n(d).

X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed that compound 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/c. The asymmetric unit corresponds to the formula unit, which consists of one uranyl unit, one dbsf2- ligand, and one bpy ligand (a). The uranyl center is primarily coordinated by two bidentate \u03b72-coordinated carboxyl groups from two dbsf2- ligands to give a one-dimensional (1D) chain, and two nitrogen atoms of the bpy ligand complete the coordination spheres of the uranyl centers to form a distorted hexagonal-bipyramidal geometry (b). Because the V-shaped bidentate dbsf2- ligands are flexible and have a large torsion angle of 107.16(2)\u00b0, the 1D chain can further twist to generate a chiral helix along the b axis with a large helical pitch of 25.41 \u00c5. The helical pitch of compound 1 is sufficiently large to accommodate another two identical helical chains, and a unique uranyl triple-stranded helix can be formed by these three independent polymeric chains intertwining with each other (c). The 2,2'-bpy ligand coordinates to the uranyl centers at an out-of-the-equatorial-plane angle of about 34.4(1)\u00b0 and points up at an angle of 34.2(6)\u00b0 to the helical axis. Also, this special orientation affords a face-to-face detachment between the adjacent 2,2'-bpy ligands in the triple-stranded helices. In contrast to the structures of compounds 1 and 1', two pyridinyl groups of 2,2'-bpy molecularly twist along the C-C single bond and lead to a dihedral angle of 13.238\u00b0, which makes the two pyridine groups parallel to their corresponding adjacent pyridine group, and the two different distances of face-to-face detachment between the pyridine groups are 7.46 and 6.54 \u00c5. Both of these distances are enabling an adjacent triple-stranded helix to be inserted into the space between the 2,2'-bpy motifs. Therefore, the pyridine groups of the 2,2'-bpy motifs from adjacent triple-stranded helices are alternately arranged with two different distances between them of 3.40 and 3.43 \u00c5, which are both within the range for \u03c0-\u03c0-stacking interactions (d). Another difference compared to compound 1' is that there are no lattice water molecules in the structure of compound 2. Apart from those above, C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bonds between neighboring strands also make a stacking mode of compound 2 different from that of compound 1' (Figure S3).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 20, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>The structure of compound <bold>3</bold> is also an analogous triple-stranded helical structure with\na shorter helix pitch of 25.09 \u00c5, but single-crystal analysis\nrevealed that compound <bold>3</bold> crystallizes in the triclinic\nspace group <italic>P</italic>1\u0305, and the asymmetric unit of <bold>3</bold> is composed of two crystallographically unique uranyl centers,\nwhich are connected with the carboxyl groups of two dbsf<sup>2\u2013</sup> ligands to perform a helical chain (a,b).

Here we only give a brief description. Compound 6 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c. The coordination environment of the tetranuclear unit in compound 6 is the same as that in compound 4 (Figure S6a), and the distance between the adjacent networks is 10.9 \u00c5. The bpp ligands are located between the networks as 4,4'-bpy ligands in compound 4, but the bpp ligands are connected with the 2D networks through \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and hydrogen bonds (Figure S6b). Compound 6' is the supramolecular isomer of compound 6. The space group and asymmetric unit of compound 6' are the same as those of compound 4 except that the 4,4'-bpy ligand and [Ni(H2O)6]2+ cation were replaced by bpp ligands (Figure S6c). Compared to compound 6, the distance between the adjacent 2D networks in compound 6' is reduced to 10.4 \u00c5, which is still bigger than those in compounds 4 and 5 (Figure S6d). The bpp ligands in compound 6' interacted with the 2D networks by two strong \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions with the face-to-face distances of 3.23 and 3.22 \u00c5.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 27, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Discussion on the Synthesis</title><p>Resembling those of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>1\u2032</bold> reported previously,\n<bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold> are also triple-helical\nstructures.
