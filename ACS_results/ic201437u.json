At room temperature, the values of \u03c7M T for 1 and 2 (8.13 and 7.46 cm3 mol-1 K, respectively) are lower than those expected for the sum of two CuII and two MnII noninteracting ions (\u03c7M T = 9.54 cm3 mol-1 K with g Mn = 2.0, g Cu = 2.1, S Mn = 5/2, and S Cu = 1/2), indicating that a strong antiferromagnetic coupling between CuII and MnII ions through the oxamate is operative at room temperature. Upon cooling, \u03c7M T for 1 decreases and attains a minimum around 60 K (Figure ), and then \u03c7M T rapidly increases to reach a maximum value of 186 cm3 mol-1 K at about 15.0 K, due to saturation effects. The presence of a \u03c7M T minimum for 1 is characteristic of an overall ferrimagnetic behavior resulting from the moderately strong antiferromagnetic interaction between the MnII and CuII ions through the oxamato bridge. In this case, it would mask the moderately weak ferromagnetic interaction between the CuII ions across the double m-phenylene spacers via the spin-polarization mechanism, as was previously observed in the analogue [Co2Cu2(mpba)2(H2O)6]\u22c56H2O. On the contrary, \u03c7M T for 2 continuously decreases upon cooling, and it almost vanishes at 2.0 K, reaching a value of \u03c7M T of 0.08 cm3 mol-1 K (Figure ). This overall antiferromagnetic behavior results from the very strong antiferromagnetic interaction between the CuII ions across the double p-phenylene spacers through the spin-polarization mechanism. In this case, it would dominate over the moderately strong antiferromagnetic interaction between the MnII and CuII ions through the oxamato bridge, thus leading to a nonmagnetic ground state for each MnII 2CuII 2 layer of 2. The lack of a maximum of \u03c7M precludes the occurrence of an antiferromagnetic 3D ordering in the temperature range investigated (2-300 K).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 14, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Temperature dependence of \u03c7<sub>M</sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic> for <bold>1</bold> (\u25b2) and <bold>2</bold> (\u25cf) under an applied magnetic field of 1 T (<italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic> \u2265 50 K) and 100 G (<italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic> &lt; 50 K).
