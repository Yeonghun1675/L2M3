The H atoms of the water molecules could not be located but were considered in the calculation of the molecular weight. Some of the amine molecules are disordered and were refined using a split model. After structure refinement, residual electron densities were observed around the Sb2O5 dumbbells and near two VO5 pyramids, which could be assigned to Sb and V atoms of a second cluster anion. Refinement of the site occupation factor yields a ratio of 9:1 and a reasonable structure model with Sb-O and V-O distances comparable to those retrieved from the literature.
