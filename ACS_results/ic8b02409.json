CeIII cations are triply linked by the OH- group from the threonine residue, a carboxylate O atom from the oxamate network, and a water molecule, which is also bonded, acting as a bridge, to adjacent copper-metal ions of the network (Figure S4c). This direct binding is not observed for LaCl3 and DyCl3, while it is unassisted in ErCl3, which are thus retained by means of weaker intermolecular interactions, and, consequently, a poor uptake of them is shown (, c,d, and S5c,d and S6c,d). Finally, lanthanide salts captured in both 1 and 2 could be easily extracted from the MOFs by using H2O or CH3OH solutions, and the resulting materials (1' and 2') were completely reusable, as confirmed by the PXRD patterns (Figure S15).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 21, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, we report two novel flexible\nand highly crystalline MOFs, prepared from the natural amino acids <sc>l</sc>-serine and <sc>l</sc>-threonine, featuring hexagonal functional\nchannels decorated with the \u2212CH<sub>2</sub>OH and \u2212CH\u00ad(OH)\u00adCH<sub>3</sub> amino acid residues.
