The Schlenk tube was then connected to a vacuum manifold, evacuated, and back-filled with nitrogen gas. After the Schlenk tube was thus purged three times, a 1:1 triethylamine/THF mixture (50.0 mL, prepurged with nitrogen gas) was injected via cannula under nitrogen protection, followed by injection of trimethylsilylacetylene (TMSA, 98%, 1.27 g, 13.0 mmol). The Schlenk tube was then sealed and stirred at 90 \u00b0C overnight (15 h). After being cooled to rt, the reaction mixture was poured into 200 mL of a 1:1 hexanes/dichloromethane mixture and then filtered through a silica gel plug. The solvents were then removed in vacuo and the dark yellow oily residue was purified by flash chromatography (silica gel, with hexane as the eluent) to provide a light yellow oily product (1.82 g, 83% based on 1-bromo-4-methylthiobenzene). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): \u03b4 0.18 (s, 9 H), 2.30 (s, 3H), 6.83 (d, 2H), 7.20 (d, 2H). 13C NMR (75 MHz, CDCl3): \u03b4 0.10, 15.21, 94.10, 104.91, 119.43, 125.74, 132.22, 139.62.\n\n4-Ethynyl-1-methylthiobenzene (EMTB)\n\nTetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF, 1.0 M in THF, 1.54 mL) was injected into a two-neck round-bottom flask containing 1-trimethylsilylethynyl-4-methylthiobenzene (1.82 g, 8.3 mmol) in THF (30.0 mL) at rt with stirring. After being stirred for 1 h, the dark colored reaction mixture was passed through a silica gel plug, and the solvent was removed in vacuo to afford an orange oily product (1.22 g, 100%, based on 1-trimethylsilylethynyl-4-methylthiobenzene). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): \u03b4 2.56 (s, 3H), 3.80 (s, 1H), 7.24 (d, 2H), 7.27 (d, 2H). 13C NMR (75 MHz, CDCl3): \u03b4 15.31, 76.80, 83.51, 118.32, 125.81, 132.42, 140.12.\n\nTetrakis[(4-methylthiophenyl)ethynyl]phenylsilane (TMPES)\n\nAn n-butyllithium solution (1.6 M in hexane, 4.4 mL) diluted with THF (7.0 mL) was added dropwise to a THF solution (10.0 mL) of 4-ethynyl-1-methylthiobenzene (0.69 g, 4.7 mmol) at -78 \u00b0C under nitrogen protection. With the temperature maintained at -78 \u00b0C, a solution of anhydrous zinc chloride (0.96 g, 7.0 mmol) in THF (3.0 mL) was then added dropwise. The resulting mixture was then slowly warmed to rt. Under N2 protection, the solution of the Cl-Zn-methylthiophenylacetylide was transferred via cannula into a degassed Schlenk tube that was previously loaded with tetrakis(4-bromophenyl)silane (0.61 g, 0.96 mmol), tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (0.53 g, 0.46 mmol) and toluene (25.0 mL, prepurged with nitrogen gas). The Schlenk tube was then sealed and stirred at 120 \u00b0C for 2 days. After being cooled down to rt, the reaction solvents were removed in vacuo and the dark orange residue was purified by flash chromatography (silica gel, with 1:1 hexane/dichloromethane as the eluent) to provide a light yellow solid product (0.40 g, 47% yield based on tetrakis(4-bromophenyl)silane). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): \u03b4 2.51 (s, 12H), 7.21 (d, 8H), 7.45 (d, 8H), 7.54 (s, 16H). 13C NMR (75 MHz, CDCl3): \u03b4 15.60, 89.54, 90.90, 119.54, 125.19, 126.09, 131.19, 132.18, 133.70, 136.41, 139.88.\n\nX-ray Quality Single-Crystals of TMPES\u22c5AgBF4\u22c53C6H6 (1)\n\nA nitrobenzene (NB) solution (4.0 mL) of TMPES (24.0 mg, 26.0 mmol) was mixed with an NB solution (2.0 mL) of AgBF4 (5.1 mg, 26 mmol) in a vial and the mixture was filtered to give a light yellow solution. The filtrate (held in a loosely capped vial) was then placed into a larger vial containing about 10 mL of benzene, with care taken to prevent direct contact of the filtrate and the benzene. The larger vial was then sealed and placed in a dark, quiet place for the vapor transport experiment. Clear, plate-like single crystals (20.0 mg, 72.0%, based on TMPES) suitable for X-ray data collection were formed over a period of about 7 days. X-ray powder diffraction of the product indicated a single phase consistent with the single-crystal structure (Figure ).
