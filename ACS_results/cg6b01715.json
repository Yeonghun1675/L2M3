The analytical data showed that this treatment also produced [3]\u22c52NH4ClO4 after a few hours in a single-crystal-to-single-crystal conversion manner. The reverse conversion was partially achieved when [3]\u22c52NH4ClO4 was stored under vacuum at room temperature for 2 days. The reversible inclusion of polar solvent molecules, such as water and alcohols, in the nonporous crystal lattice through the single-crystal-to-single-crystal fashion have been reported in several diphosphine based discrete coordination systems. In these systems, the formation of hydrogen bonds and/or CH\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions between host framework and guest solvent molecules promotes the inclusion reaction. On the other hand, the reversible ammonia adsorption in the present system is induced by the unprecedented acid-base neutralization between template acid (HClO4) and guest base (NH3) molecules.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 19, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we showed an unprecedented template effect due to HClO<sub>4</sub>, which led to the formation of acidic crystals of [<bold>3</bold>]\u00b72HClO<sub>4</sub>.
