We speculate that the low N<sub>2</sub> uptake\nof the activated CZJ-10 should be ascribed to the metastable and flexible\nstructure nature of CZJ-10 consisting of mesopore space and two interpenetrated\nindividual network structures.</p><p>We further explored the CO<sub>2</sub> capture capacity of CZJ-10.\nThe CO<sub>2</sub> uptake capacity of the activated CZJ-10 was obtained\nby measuring the sorption isotherms at 273 and 298 K ( and <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.cgd.7b00188/suppl_file/cg7b00188_si_001.pdf\">S4</ext-link>). Because there exists a large vacant mesopore space without CO<sub>2</sub> affinity site, the activated CZJ-10 only takes up 16.3 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> CO<sub>2</sub> at 298 K and 1 atm,\nwhich is low compared with many reported MOF materials in the literature. However, the mesopore space in CZJ-10 provides us an opportunity\nto introduce additional CO<sub>2</sub> binding sites by encapsulating\nCO<sub>2</sub> affinity moieties inside the vacant pore space. In\nconsideration that there are abundant CO<sub>2</sub> affinity sites\nin many dye molecules (e.g., N\u2013H and O\u2013H groups), different\ndye molecules, including cationic rhodamine B (RB), anionic CR, and\nneutral melanin, were selected and further encapsulated in the pore\nspace of CZJ-10 by an in situ synthesis method. When RB, CR, and melanin\nwere added into the reaction mixtures during synthesis of CZJ-10,\ndifferent dye molecules were readily imbedded inside the pore space\nof CZJ-10, denoted as RB@CZJ-10, CR@CZJ-10, and melanin @CZJ-10, respectively.\nAnalyzed by UV\u2013vis absorption spectroscopy, the encapsulated\ndyes of RB, CR, and melanin are of 0.28, 0.04, and 13.1 mol per formula\nunit of CZJ-10, respectively. PXRD patterns of these dye encapsulated\nsamples suggest that the network structures of these dye encapsulated\nsamples are basically identical to that of original CZJ-10. It is\ninteresting that the CO<sub>2</sub> uptake capabilities of these dye\nencapsulated samples are significantly improved, even though the pore\nspace is partially occupied by dye molecules (). At 1 atm and 298 K, the CO<sub>2</sub> uptakes of RB@CZJ-10, CR@CZJ-10, and melanin@CZJ-10 are of 35.0,\n33.5, and 39.1 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup>, respectively.\nTo make a comparison, we have encapsulated triphenylmethane (TPM)\nwithout CO<sub>2</sub> affinity site instead of dyes in the pore space\nof CZJ-10 to conduct the CO<sub>2</sub> sorption experiments (denoted\nas TPM@CZJ-10). As shown in , the activated TPM@CZJ-10, consisting of 1.7 mol TPM\nper formula unit of CZJ-10, only takes up 13.3 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> CO<sub>2</sub> at 298 K and 1 atm, which is lower\nthan that of CZJ-10. The above results demonstrate that the improved\nCO<sub>2</sub> adsorption capability of these dye encapsulated samples\nshould be attributed to the introduction of strong CO<sub>2</sub> interaction\nsites inside the pore space of CZJ-10.</p>", "clean_text": "Single-Crystal X-ray Data Collection and Structure Determination\n\nThe determination of the unit cell and the data collection for the crystal of CZJ-10 were performed on an Oxford Xcalibur Gemini Ultra diffractometer with an Atlas detector.

CCDC-1531376. Copy of the data can be obtained free of charge on application to CCDC, 12 Union Road, Cambridge CB21EZ, UK (Fax: (+44) 1223-336-033; E-mail: deposit@ccdc.cam.ac.uk). Crystal data for CZJ-10: C132H96Cu6O30, M = 2543.33, cubic space group Pn3\u0305n, a = 33.3261(5) \u00c5, V = 37012.9(10) \u00c53, Z = 4, \u03bc = 0.582 mm-1, F(000) = 5208, \u03c1 = 0.456 g cm-3, R 1 = 0.0788, wR(F 2) = 0.1444 (I > 2\u03c3(I)), and S = 1.027.\n\nPLATON calculations indicate that the total solvent accessible pore volume in CZJ-10 is of 28334.9 \u00c53 per unit cell volume 37012.9 \u00c53 (76.6%), which is occupied by DMF and water solvent molecules. The permanent porosity of CZJ-10 has been examined by N2 adsorption experiments at 77 K (Figure S3). The as-synthesized CZJ-10 was guest-exchanged with dry acetone, followed by activation at room temperature under a high vacuum overnight to get the activated sample. PXRD analysis of the activated sample showed that the diffraction pattern is basically identical to that of the as-synthesized one (Figure S5). The activated solid sample of CZJ-10 takes up 112 cm3 g-1 N2 at 77 K and 0.92 bar, resulting in a BET surface area of 173 m2 g-1. We speculate that the low N2 uptake of the activated CZJ-10 should be ascribed to the metastable and flexible structure nature of CZJ-10 consisting of mesopore space and two interpenetrated individual network structures.\n\nWe further explored the CO2 capture capacity of CZJ-10. The CO2 uptake capacity of the activated CZJ-10 was obtained by measuring the sorption isotherms at 273 and 298 K ( and S4). Because there exists a large vacant mesopore space without CO2 affinity site, the activated CZJ-10 only takes up 16.3 cm3 g-1 CO2 at 298 K and 1 atm, which is low compared with many reported MOF materials in the literature. However, the mesopore space in CZJ-10 provides us an opportunity to introduce additional CO2 binding sites by encapsulating CO2 affinity moieties inside the vacant pore space. In consideration that there are abundant CO2 affinity sites in many dye molecules (e.g., N-H and O-H groups), different dye molecules, including cationic rhodamine B (RB), anionic CR, and neutral melanin, were selected and further encapsulated in the pore space of CZJ-10 by an in situ synthesis method. When RB, CR, and melanin were added into the reaction mixtures during synthesis of CZJ-10, different dye molecules were readily imbedded inside the pore space of CZJ-10, denoted as RB@CZJ-10, CR@CZJ-10, and melanin @CZJ-10, respectively. Analyzed by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, the encapsulated dyes of RB, CR, and melanin are of 0.28, 0.04, and 13.1 mol per formula unit of CZJ-10, respectively. PXRD patterns of these dye encapsulated samples suggest that the network structures of these dye encapsulated samples are basically identical to that of original CZJ-10. It is interesting that the CO2 uptake capabilities of these dye encapsulated samples are significantly improved, even though the pore space is partially occupied by dye molecules (). At 1 atm and 298 K, the CO2 uptakes of RB@CZJ-10, CR@CZJ-10, and melanin@CZJ-10 are of 35.0, 33.5, and 39.1 cm3 g-1, respectively. To make a comparison, we have encapsulated triphenylmethane (TPM) without CO2 affinity site instead of dyes in the pore space of CZJ-10 to conduct the CO2 sorption experiments (denoted as TPM@CZJ-10). As shown in , the activated TPM@CZJ-10, consisting of 1.7 mol TPM per formula unit of CZJ-10, only takes up 13.3 cm3 g-1 CO2 at 298 K and 1 atm, which is lower than that of CZJ-10. The above results demonstrate that the improved CO2 adsorption capability of these dye encapsulated samples should be attributed to the introduction of strong CO2 interaction sites inside the pore space of CZJ-10.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "Zn4O(C8H4O4)3"}, "chemical formula weight": [{"value": "756.9", "unit": "g/mol", "condition": ""}], "crystal
