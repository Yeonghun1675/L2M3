Compound 1 was constructed from [Cu2I] n  chain and Cu2(CO2)4 paddlewheel SBUs and exhibited a new (3,4,4)-connected topology. Although compound 1 possesses moderate surface area, it exhibits better CO2 capture (91.9 cm3 g-1 at 273 K) and separation ability (selectivity for CO2 over CH4 = 8.2 under 1 bar at 298 K) than most of the reported Cu x I y -based MOFs. Moreover, compound 1 is also a good candidate for the capture and release of iodine.\n\nOn the basis of the above considerations, we chose the bifunctional organic ligand 5-(4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)benzene-1,3-dicarboxylate (L2-), which contains two types of coordination groups (triazolate N donors and carboxylate O donors), as it can combine two different SBUs into one framework. Consequently, a novel microporous heterovalent copper-organic framework, [(Cu2I)Cu2L2(H2O)2]2 2+\u22c52NO3 -\u22c55DMF (1), has been successfully synthesized.

The weight loss of about 47% between 230 and 500 \u00b0C can be attributed to removal of the organic ligands and collapse of the structure. The rest of the weight loss (22%) at 530 \u00b0C is ascribed to the remaining CuO.\n\nProperty Characterization\n\nGas Adsorption and Separation Behaviors\n\nN2 adsorption measurements at 77 K were carried out to verify the porosity of compound 1. As shown in Figure S4, the N2 uptake of activated compound 1 displays a typical type-I sorption isotherm, which is the feature of microporous materials, with a N2 uptake of 230 cm3 g-1 under 1 bar.

The experimental pore volume was 0.36 cm3 g-1, which was close to the theoretical one (0.40 cm3 g-1). This indicates that the structure of compound 1 can be kept intact after the guest molecules are removed, which ensures its good adsorption performance.\n\nConsidering the adsorption ability of compound 1, some other small-gas adsorption properties were also investigated. First, CO2 adsorption measurements were carried out, and the adsorption isotherms are presented in a. The CO2 uptakes by compound 1 were 92 and 59 cm3 g-1 at 273 and 298 K, respectively, under 1 bar. The isosteric adsorption enthalpy (Q st) of CO2 on compound 1 was also calculated by the virial model in order to explore the interaction between the framework and CO2 (Figure S9). The Q st value for compound 1 was 32.4 kJ mol-1 near zero coverage. The CO2 uptake (273 K) and Q st values for compound 1 are both higher than those for most of the Cu x I y -based MOFs, such as JLU-Liu23 (39 cm3 g-1, 19 kJ mol-1) and (Cu2I2)[Cu3PDC3(H2O)2]\u22c52MeCN\u22c52DMF (77 cm3 g-1, 27 kJ mol-1).

The adsorption performance of compound 1 for CH4, C2H6, and C3H8 was investigated at 273 and 298 K under 1 bar.
