Still, this is a challenging task for the researcher working in the domain of MOFs and their applications to develop both the stable pores and solvatochromism in a single material. So, based on this aforementioned fact, we have also investigated the solvatochromic behavior of Co-MOFs 1 and 2 by immersing their crystals in a number of solvents such as CH3OH, CHCl3, CH2Cl2, diethyl ether, hexane, THF, CH3CN, DMF, DMA, and DMSO. Notably, we observed a color change from colorless to green (in DMA) and red (in DMSO) for Co-MOF-1 at room temperature. This color change might be due to the exchange of guest DMF molecule (molecular dimension, 5.84 \u00d7 6.74 \u00c52) by the DMA (molecular dimension, 6.31 \u00d7 7.25 \u00c52) or DMSO (molecular dimension, 5.99 \u00d7 6.26 \u00c52) molecules, which are very comparative to the guest DMF molecule in terms of their molecular dimension (see Table S4). The presence of channels with dimensions of 15.46 \u00d7 15.46 \u00c52 and 15.91 \u00d7 16.87 \u00c52 in Co-MOF-1 also facilitate the diffusion of these analytes into the pores and thus the exchange process. The tendency to form strong C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O and C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interaction between the host and guest molecules might be another reason for this exchange. However, under similar circumstances, we did not observe any color change for Co-MOF-2 (see Figure S8). The lack of an electron-rich framework architecture might be the cause for the absence of solvatochromic behavior in Co-MOF-2. The photographs of these experiments are shown in Figure S8 of the Supporting Information. The solvatochromic effect was further analyzed by FT-IR, TGA, UV-vis, and XRD powder analysis (see Figures S9-S15). As expected, the impregnated sample of Co-MOF-1 in DMA (Co-MOF-1\u2283DMA) exhibits \u03bdCO stretching band at 1671 cm-1 (Figure S10). However, under identical conditions, the impregnated sample of Co-MOF-1 in DMSO (Co-MOF-1\u2283DMSO) shows a red shift of 20 cm-1, which clearly indicates that DMF in the channels of Co-MOF-1 is exchanged by DMSO (Figure S11), whereas a new broad peak appeared at 3423 cm-1 ascribed to the presence of water molecules along with DMSO in the cavity of Co-MOF-1. The TGA analysis of Co-MOF-1\u2283DMA displays the first weight loss of 16.31% (observed 16.32%), which corresponds to the loss of two lattice-occluded DMA molecules in the region of 25-200 \u00b0C (see Figure S12). In a similar fashion, Co-MOF-1\u2283DMSO exhibits an initial weight loss of 22.02% (observed 22.52%), which is nicely fitted with the loss of three DMSO and one water molecules in the region of 25-200 \u00b0C (see Figure S13), thereby strongly advocating the inclusion of DMA/DMSO molecules inside the channels of Co-MOF-1, resulting in visible color change. The UV-vis spectra and photographs of these inclusion compounds are shown in Figure S14. Due to the comparable polarity of the analysts {polarity index (P'): DMF, 6.4; DMA, 6.5, and DMSO, 7.2; DMSO is slightly higher than DMF and DMA}, we did not observe any significant shift in the UV-vis absorption bands after the solvent exchange.

To analyze the phase purity of the bulk samples, powder X-ray diffraction measurement was been carried out for the both samples, and it noticed that the simulated diffraction pattern generated from the single crystal X-ray diffraction nicely fit with the as-synthesized one, thus advocating the purity of the bulk compounds ().\n\nGas Adsorption Studies\n\nTo probe the porous nature of the Co-MOFs 1 and 2, the adsorption-desorption isotherms for N2, H2, CH4, and CO2 were measured for the activated samples, and their respective isotherms are depicted in . The N2 and H2 gas sorption isotherms of Co-MOFs 1 and 2 were recorded at 77 K, whereas for CH4 its 295 K. For both Co-MOFs 1 and 2, the CO2 adsorption isotherms were recorded at 273 and 298 K, respectively. The N2 and H2 gas isotherms of Co-MOF-1 show uptakes of 126.87 and 62.15 cm3 g-1, respectively, whereas CH4 exhibits only the surface sorption (2.26 cm3 g-1). As shown in a, CO2 uptake capacities of Co-MOF-1 at 273 and 298 K are 76.48 and 33.03 cm3 g-1, respectively, which are better/comparable to several microporous materials reported in the literature (see Table S3 in the Supporting Information for a comprehensive list of MOFs and their sorption behavior). The N2 sorption exhibits an adsorption-desorption type-II isotherm. However, H2 and CO2 adsorption by Co-MOF-1 shows the reversible type-I isotherm. The high uptake of N2, H2, and CO2 compare to CH4 predominantly ascribed to their diverse electrostatic interactions with the surface of the porous channels/voids and their large quadrupole moment (CO2 = 4.30 \u00d7 10-26 esu-1 cm-1, N2 = 1.52 \u00d7 10-26 esu-1 cm-1, H2 = 0.66 \u00d7 10-26 esu-1 cm-1, and 0 esu-1 cm-1 for CH4). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and pore volume of Co-MOF-1 was found to be 69.4 m2 g-1 and 0.09 cm3 g-1, respectively, which are estimated from the N2 sorption data.\n\nUnder similar conditions, the N2 sorption isotherm of Co-MOF-2 shows 52.38 cm3 g-1 uptake capacity. However, H2 and CH4 isotherms exhibit low uptakes of 15.96 and 2.43 cm3 g-1, respectively. In addition, CO2 isotherms of Co-MOF-2 display uptakes of 37.91 and 31.28 cm3 g-1 at 273 and 298 K, respectively. The high uptake capacity shown by N2 and CO2 gases compare to H2 and CH4 possibly because of their greater affinity toward the micropores of Co-MOF-2. The BET surface area and pore volume of Co-MOF-2 was found to be 22.4 m2 g-1 and 0.048 cm3 g-1, respectively. Importantly, TGA profile of the activated sample of Co-MOFs 1 and 2 clearly indicates that their framework integrity remain intact even after the loss of guest solvent molecules (see Figure S9 of Supporting Information). In addition, activated XRD pattern and post-gas adsorption analysis sample of Co-MOFs 1 and 2 also advocated that both these materials keep intact their crystallinity and framework integrity (see ).\n\nMoreover, to probe the affinity of Co-MOF-1 for CO2, the isosteric heat of adsorption (Q st) was calculated in accordance with the Clausius-Clapeyron equation by fitting sorption isotherms at 298 K. The Q st isotherm of Co-MOF-1 shows heat of adsorption of 32.41 kJ mol-1 (see c), which is higher than the enthalpy of liquefaction of CO2 (17 kJ mol-1) and comparable to Q st values of recently reported MOFs.
