Of particular note is the one-dimensional oxalate of manganese(II) derived from templating by one of the dinuclear complexes, which can be considered a hybrid oxalate material. Electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical studies of the oxo-acetato-bridged complex 3 revealed reversible cycling between MnIII/MnIII and MnIII/MnIV under the appropriate conditions; however, further oxidation and reduction were found to be irreversible. Decomposition of the complexes using wet routes or by thermolysis is a valid means to obtain nanostructured Mn-containing materials. The lamellar materials resulting from the use of wet routes are suitable for processing such as, for instance, catalysts and can be grown on substrates, notably silicon oxide or ITO glass. Thick (>5 \u03bcm) films of the latter materials were found to be less stable, undergoing peeling from the substrates. However, this peeling process resulted in the formation of thin films with improved homogeneity of thickness due to cleavage occurring during the peeling of the thick film from the substrate surface. We are currently undertaking an in-depth study in order to determine the effect of the transition-metal identity on the structures and properties of the respective products. Finally, we are investigating the utility of the peel-back process for the preparation of electrochemically active films.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 24, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Experimental Section</title><p>All solvents and reagents were purchased from commercial sources (Aldrich Chemical Co., Lancaster Chemical Co., and Riedel-de-Ha\u0308en) and used as received. 1,4,7,10-Tetraazacyclododecane (cyclen) was purchased from Strem Chemical Co.
