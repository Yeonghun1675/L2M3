It should be noted that extra nonbonded terepthalate ligands, which could be trapped within the channels, are not found for these two compounds. This differs with the situation encountered in the vanadium-based MIL-68, for which a significant amount of free terephthalate anions (0.15 bdc/metal), but less DMF species (0.33 DMF/metal), are observed. The framework thermal stability is also slightly higher than that of the vanadium compound (300 \u00b0C).</p><title>Measurement of the BET Surface Area</title><p>Both activated MIL-68 (Ga) and MIL-68 (In) were tested for adsorption capacities with nitrogen. The porosity of both compounds was estimated by gas sorption isotherm experiments in liquid nitrogen using the Micromeritics ASAP2010 apparatus. Typical isotherms of type I are observed with a plateau at 320 cm<sup>3</sup>/g (STP) and 260 cm<sup>3</sup>/g (STP) on the activated samples (degassed at 150 \u00b0C overnight under a primary vacuum). From these data, the BET and Langmuir apparent surface areas were calculated as 1117(24) and 1410(2) m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>\u22121</sup> (micropore volume: 0.46 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u22121</sup>) for MIL-68 (Ga) and 746(31) and 1139(5) m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>\u22121</sup> (micropore volume: 0.44 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u22121</sup>) for MIL-68 (In), respectively. These surface areas are much larger than the values reported in the vanadium MIL-68 analog at 603(22) (BET) and 847(1) m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>\u22121</sup> (Langmuir). The surface areas are quite distinct for the MIL-68 phases incorporating different cations, but they are not correlated to their molecular weight differences. If MIL-68 (Ga) is taken as a reference, there would be a variation of +18% (mol wt) for the indium form and \u22127.5% (mol wt) for the vanadium one. This would lead to the expected BET values of 1200 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>\u22121</sup> with vanadium and 916 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>\u22121</sup> with indium. Moreover, a recent computer simulation study reported that the theoretical accessible surface area was calculated as 3333 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>\u22121</sup> for MIL-68 (V). Our experimental values are quite far from that reported by Du\u0308ren et al., and these observations might reflect some issues concerning the activation process in order to get the empty pore solids in the metal-organic framework materials. However, in the case of the MIL-68 phases, many attempts were carried out in order to find a suitable activation process without collapsing the hybrid network, and the calcination procedure (150 \u00b0C under a vacuum overnight) was found to be the best for obtaining the empty pore phase. Moreover, the NMR analysis of the MIL-68 (Ga) clearly confirmed this assessment, showing the departure of almost all encapsulated organic species from the pore channels upon activation. We may say that the measured surface areas using the BET method would give relative evidence concerning the state of porosity of the MIL-68 phases, for which careful structural characterization did not lead to converging values between calculation and experimental results. This series of observations also pointed out the difficulty for obtaining maximum accessible porosity in some MOF materials.</p><p>The hydrogen uptakes at 77 K show a very fast adsorption process for Ga, whereas a slower behavior was observed for the In compound. It is worth noting that the same trend was also observed for the BET measurements with N<sub>2</sub> adsorption, confirming that this behavior is intrinsic to the samples. Nevertheless, both phases exhibit type-I curves or Langmuir isotherm profiles, as expected for physisorption. The MIL-68 (Ga and In) compounds reversibly adsorb up to 2.46 wt % and 1.98 wt % of hydrogen, respectively, at 77 K under a saturated pressure of 4 MPa. Isotherm curves are fully reversible and do not show hysteresis effects. Measurements were reproducible for both cycles, as shown in Figure . The capacity reported for MIL-68 (In) is significantly lower than that of Ga but in good agreement with the molar mass increase and the surface area decrease induced by the replacement of heavier In atoms by Ga ones. Therefore, the amount of active sites for adsorption is expected to be the same for both compounds. It shows however that the nature of the metal center does not play a key role here in the sorption process and that hydrogen uptake is mainly governed by textural parameters.

The last weight loss occurs with the decomposition of the terephthalate ligand from 340 \u00b0C for MIL-68 (Ga) (obsd, 43.3%; calcd, 44.6%) and 350 \u00b0C for MIL-68 (In) (obsd, 36.6%; calcd, 36.4%). After the collapse of the structure, the products transform into dense metal oxides, M2O3 (Ga or In). From the thermogravimetric experiments together with the elemental analyses, chemical formulas could be estimated as follows: Ga(OH)(O2C-C6H4-CO2)\u22c5xDMF\u22c52.3H2O (x = 0.8-0.9) and In(OH)(O2C-C6H4-CO2)\u22c5xDMF\u22c52.2H2O (x = 1.0-1.2). It should be noted that extra nonbonded terepthalate ligands, which could be trapped within the channels, are not found for these two compounds. This differs with the situation encountered in the vanadium-based MIL-68, for which a significant amount of free terephthalate anions (0.15 bdc/metal), but less DMF species (0.33 DMF/metal), are observed. The framework thermal stability is also slightly higher than that of the vanadium compound (300 \u00b0C).\n\nMeasurement of the BET Surface Area\n\nBoth activated MIL-68 (Ga) and MIL-68 (In) were tested for adsorption capacities with nitrogen. The porosity of both compounds was estimated by gas sorption isotherm experiments in liquid nitrogen using the Micromeritics ASAP2010 apparatus. Typical isotherms of type I are observed with a plateau at 320 cm3/g (STP) and 260 cm3/g (STP) on the activated samples (degassed at 150 \u00b0C overnight under a primary vacuum). From these data, the BET and Langmuir apparent surface areas were calculated as 1117(24) and 1410(2) m2 g-1 (micropore volume: 0.46 cm3 g-1) for MIL-68 (Ga) and 746(31) and 1139(5) m2 g-1 (micropore volume: 0.44 cm3 g-1) for MIL-68 (In), respectively. These surface areas are much larger than the values reported in the vanadium MIL-68 analog at 603(22) (BET) and 847(1) m2 g-1 (Langmuir). The surface areas are quite distinct for the MIL-68 phases incorporating different cations, but they are not correlated to their molecular weight differences. If MIL-68 (Ga) is taken as a reference, there would be a variation of +18% (mol wt) for the indium form and -7.5% (mol wt) for the vanadium one. This would lead to the expected BET values of 1200 m2 g-1 with vanadium and 916 m2 g-1 with indium. Moreover, a recent computer simulation study reported that the theoretical accessible surface area was calculated as 3333 m2 g-1 for MIL-68 (V). Our experimental values are quite far from that reported by Du\u0308ren et al., and these observations might reflect some issues concerning the activation process in order to get the empty pore solids in the metal-organic framework materials. However, in the case of the MIL-68 phases, many attempts were carried out in order to find a suitable activation process without collapsing the hybrid network, and the calcination procedure (150 \u00b0C under a vacuum overnight) was found to be the best for obtaining the empty pore phase. Moreover, the NMR analysis of the MIL-68 (Ga) clearly confirmed this assessment, showing the departure of almost all encapsulated organic species from the pore channels upon activation. We may say that the measured surface areas using the BET method would give relative evidence concerning the state of porosity of the MIL-68 phases, for which careful structural characterization did not lead to converging values between calculation and experimental results. This series of observations also pointed out the difficulty for obtaining maximum accessible porosity in some MOF materials.\n\nThe hydrogen uptakes at 77 K show a very fast adsorption process for Ga, whereas a slower behavior was observed for the In compound. It is worth noting that the same trend was also observed for the BET measurements with N2 adsorption, confirming that this behavior is intrinsic to the samples. Nevertheless, both phases exhibit type-I curves or Langmuir isotherm profiles, as expected for physisorption. The MIL-68 (Ga and In) compounds reversibly adsorb up to 2.46 wt % and 1.98 wt % of hydrogen, respectively, at 77 K under a saturated pressure of 4 MPa. Isotherm curves are fully reversible and do not show hysteresis effects. Measurements were reproducible for both cycles, as shown in Figure . The capacity reported for MIL-68 (In) is significantly lower than that of Ga but in good agreement with the molar mass increase and the surface area decrease induced by the replacement of heavier In atoms by Ga ones. Therefore, the amount of active sites for adsorption is expected to be the same for both compounds. It shows however that the nature of the metal center does not play a key role here in the sorption process and that hydrogen uptake is mainly governed by textural parameters. Similarly, the aluminum trimesate MIL-110 exhibits a hydrogen uptake of 3 wt %, a value larger than that of the two former ones, confirming the key role played by the molar mass of the metal building
