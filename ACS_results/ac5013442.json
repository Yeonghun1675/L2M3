Therefore, Ln-TCMs will exhibit guest-dependent luminescence and thus realize their application in decoding different VOMs. Considering that an ideal detector should have accessible pores by solvent molecules to facilitate solvent sensing, we have examined the porosity of La-TCM by CO2 adsorption experiment. After a sample of La-TCM was activated by heating at 80 \u00b0C for 24 h, the activated La-TCM takes up 33 cm3/g CO2 at 0 \u00b0C, corresponding to the surface area of 250.6 m2/g. PXRD peaks of the activated one are different from the freshly as-synthesized sample, indicating that some structural phase transformations might occur during the desolvation process because the \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5AA\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5 stacked grid layers are loosely combined through weak supramolecular interactions. It is interesting that the PXRD pattern can be reversed to the original of La-TCM when a desolvated sample of La-TCM was exposed to the DMF vapor at 80 \u00b0C for 24 h.
