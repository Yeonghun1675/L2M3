The Mn-N bond distances of 1 (Table ) vary from 2.266(2) to 2.338(2) \u00c5 lying within the range of the distances in other compounds containing the [Mn(en)3]2+ cation. No remarkable difference is observed for the bond distances of Mn-Nc (c = chelate) and Mn-Nb (b = bridge). The Sn-St (t = terminal) bond lengths of the [Sn2S6]4- anion are 2.3432(7) and 2.3380(6) \u00c5 for Sn(1)-S(1) and Sn(1)-S(2), respectively, and the Sn-Sb bond lengths are 2.4513(8) and 2.4581(6) \u00c5 for Sn(1)-S(3) and Sn(1)-S(3) a , respectively. These data are in agreement with corresponding bond distances of the discrete [Sn2S6]4- anions; however, the slightly elongated Sn(1)-S(1) distance might be due to the influence of the coordination of S(1) atom to Mn(II) ion. The distance of the coordination bond of Mn(1)-S(1) is 2.5683(9) \u00c5.
