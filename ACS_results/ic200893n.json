The only exceptions occur with very strong nitrogen donors, such as pyridine and ammonia, when the spectrum of these samples contains two \u03bdCN bands. The pyridine complex shows a strong peak at 2172 and a medium one at 2142 cm-1, while the NH3 complex exhibits a medium and a strong peak at 2168 and 2143 cm-1, respectively. The bands at higher frequencies may be attributed to the coordinated cyanide and those at 2142 or 2143 cm-1 to terminal or uncoordinated cyanide ligands of the [Au(CN)2]- anion. For comparison, the K[Au(CN)2] and Na[Au(CN)2] complexes display \u03bdCN stretching frequencies at 2140 and 2153 cm-1, respectively. In contrast, exposure of 8 to vapors of acetonitrile did not induce any changes in the IR spectrum of 8; thus the vapochromic response is negative for this nitrogen-donor ligand.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 47, "type": "table", "classification": null, "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Characteristic \u03bd<sub>CN</sub> Frequencies (cm<sup>\u20131</sup>) of Vapor-Treated <bold>8</bold>\u00b7<bold>v</bold> Complexes</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup align=\"left\" cols=\"3\">\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">vapor</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">color after exposure</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\u03bd<sub>CN</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>water</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>pale-pink</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2206 (m), 2195 (s), 2173 (s), 2161 (s)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>MeOH</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>pale-pink</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2179 (s)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>EtOH</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>light-violet</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2185 (s)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>DMF</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>pale-pink</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2182 (s)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>DMSO</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>pale-pink</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2177 (s)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>THF</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>light-violet</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2183 (s)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>pyridine</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>pale-pink</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2172 (s), 2142 (m)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>NH<sub>3</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>ochre</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2168 (m), 2143 (s)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 48, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>All of these vapochromic responses are fully reproducible with conversion from <bold>8</bold>\u00b7<bold>v</bold> samples back to <bold>8</bold>, accomplished by heating the sample under vacuum conditions.</p><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, the solid-state mechanochemical method using K[Au(CN)<sub>2</sub>] and transition metal(II) chlorides was proved to be a fast, simple, and efficient route to the synthesis of heterometallic dicyanoaurate-based coordination polymers.
