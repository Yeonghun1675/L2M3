Additional structural water molecules are lost within this region for the Th2Al8heidi compound as seen by a gradual decrease in the overall sample mass. The final products in all samples were determined to be amorphous by powder X-ray diffraction, with residual weights between 38.6 and 49.5%. For Th(ntp), the final product is expected to be amorphous ThO2 and Th 6 hedta forms a composite material containing a mixture of amorphous ThO2 and Na2O solids. For each of the ternary complexes, the residual weights also suggested a mixture of solid-state thorium(IV)/iron(III), aluminum(III) oxide materials. Powder X-ray diffraction of the ThFe2dhpta solid after TGA indicated the formation of crystalline ThO2 and Fe2O3, but due to the larger residual weights observed for this sample, amorphous material is also likely in the residual product.", "data": [[[{"value": "80 and 125", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "removal of weakly bound water molecules", "condition": ""}, {"value": "7.1%", "unit": "", "type":
