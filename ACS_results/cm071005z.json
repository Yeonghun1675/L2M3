As it might be expected, the most labile water leaves first while some of the most strongly coordinated water molecules do not leave at all. The step-by-step process starts at temperatures as low as room temperature under vacuum and is completed at 105 \u00b0C. The reversed process of hydration with complete restoration of the original structure occurs also at room temperature. During such a cycle the space group of the structures changes from centrosymmetric P21/c to acentric Pc and back to P21/c. This overall flexibility is possible because of the capability of copper to readily change coordination environments. Both hydrated and dehydrated compounds are homometallic ferrimagnets. Studies of the ability of the dehydrated samples to absorb other guest molecules are in progress.
