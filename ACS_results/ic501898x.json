The best fit of the \u03c7(T) data between 50 and 300 K to the function \u03c7 = (C)/(T - \u03b8) + TIP yields C = 3.50 \u00b1 0.02 emu K mol-1 Oe-1, \u03b8 = -44.6 \u00b1 0.6 K and TIP = 1.37 \u00d7 10-3 \u00b1 0.04 \u00d7 10-3 emu K mol-1 Oe-1.

This could be due to the stabilization of a low-spin ground state for one of the two Co2+ ions (S = 1/2, expected range of 1.7-2 \u03bcB per mole of Co2+), but examples of this unusual configuration at room temperature are very scarce. Although the structural data reveal a rather distorted tetrahedral geometry as coordination polyhedron for Co2 atom, it seems more reasonable to explain such a low \u03c7T value through moderate short-range antiferromagnetic interactions between the tetrahedral and trigonal bipyramidal Co2+ ions. In fact, antiferromagnetic interactions, denoted by the Weiss temperature value (-44.6 \u00b1 0.6 K), are manifested at low temperature for compound 1 as set out below. Upon cooling from 50 K, the \u03c7(T) curve starts deviating upward from the mentioned Curie-Weiss law just below 40 K (see Figure ), in spite of the negative value found for \u03b8.

Then, the \u03c7(T) curve shows a restraint at 8 K on the above-mentioned increase of \u03c7(T), see inset of Figure . This is even more clearly manifested through the sharp maximum reached by \u03c7T at 8 K (see ) before decreasing to 0.448 emu K mol-1 Oe-1 at 2 K. Finally, the \u03c7(T) curve reaches a maximum at 4 K.\n\nCompound 2 \n\nThe analysis of \u03c7(T) for compound 2 (see ) reveals that this compound shows paramagnetism above ~30 K. The best fit of the \u03c7(T) data between 50 and 300 K to the function \u03c7 = (C)/(T - \u03b8) + TIP yields C = 8.814 \u00b1 0.005 emu K mol-1 Oe-1, \u03b8 = -8.64 \u00b1 0.06 K, and the TIP term can be neglected. The \u03c7T value at room temperature is 8.57 emu K mol-1 Oe-1 (\u03bceff = 2.828(\u03c7T)1/2 = 8.29 \u03bcB per formula unit), a value consistent with the presence of three high spin Co2+ ions. Below 30 K the \u03c7(T) curve starts deviating upward from the mentioned Curie-Weiss law, and \u03c7-1 tends toward zero, in the same way that the magnetic susceptibility of noninteracting octahedral Co2+. However, the \u03c7ac(T) obtained at low temperature with H = 0 reveals a rather complex behavior, see Figure . Thus, as temperature decreases \u03c7ac T decreases to reach a local minimum at 19 K, and then it shows an increase reaching the maximum value at 8 K before dropping sharply down to the lowest temperature. This maximum is accompanied by an absorption in \u03c7ac \" that does not show frequency dependence. Such a minimum indicates the appearance of ferromagnetic-like interactions, which likely take place within the linear trimeric clusters. The slight nonlinear M(H) curve obtained at 14 K and their M value at 5 T (~3.8 \u03bcB), see , confirm this point. In the trimeric cluster (see Figure -left) the adjacent cobalt atoms (separated by 3.512 \u00c5) are connected by two carboxylate groups, that is Co-O-C-O-Co supersuperexchange pathways, and one bridging oxygen atom of a third carboxylate. The two carboxylate bridges bring weak antiferromagnetic exchange interactions and in the case of the oxygen bridge the exchange interaction is assumed antiferromagnetic according to the value of the Co-O-Co angle, 108.9\u00b0. Therefore, in order to account for the observed net magnetization in compound 2 an orbital counter complementary effect must be invoked bringing along a ferromagnetic interaction in view of the small Co-O-Co angle.\n\nCompound 3 \n\nThe \u03c7(T) obtained for compound 3 follows the function \u03c7 = (C)/(T - \u03b8) + TIP between 100 and 300 K, and the best fit of the \u03c7(T) data to that function yields C = 7.01 \u00b1 0.02 emu K mol-1 Oe-1, \u03b8 = 1.1 \u00b1 0.2 K, and TIP = 2.1 \u00d7 10-4 \u00b1 0.4 \u00d7 10-4 emu mol-1 Oe-1. The \u03c7T value at room temperature calculated ignoring the TIP is 7.04 emu K mol-1 Oe-1 (\u03bceff = 2.828(\u03c7T)1/2 = 7.50 \u03bcB per formula unit), a value consistent with the presence of two high-spin Co2+ ions. The positive value of \u03b8 denotes likely ferromagnetic interactions between cobalt atoms (separated by 3.214 \u00c5) as one might expect according to the chains of edge-sharing CoO6 octahedra present in this compound (see Figure , left), given that Co-O-Co angles of less than 97\u00b0 (92.15 and 90.87\u00b0) promote ferromagnetic exchange interaction in the case of Co2+. It is indeed what the \u03c7(T) data at low temperature suggest, showing a similar magnetic behavior to that one proposed above for compound 1. This is hardly surprising because both compounds have as SBUs magnetic chains of cobalt polyhedra connected through the almost same ligand. Thus, the \u03c7T versus T plot shown in Figure  reveals a minimum centered at 26 K corresponding to the onset of intrachain ferromagnetic interactions. The sharp maximum at 7 K corresponds to antiferromagnetic interactions between the ferromagnetic chains. Furthermore, the absorption of \u03c7ac \"(T) (see ) reveals the development of weak ferromagnetism. Finally, the M(H) data obtained at 2 K (see ) show a value of 2.75 \u03bcB at 5 T, which can be justified by the presence of noninteracting ferromagnetic chains due to the effect of the applied magnetic field.\n\nCompound 4 \n\nThe \u03c7(T) obtained for compound 4, see Figure , follows a Curie-Weiss law \u03c7 = (C)/(T - \u03b8) between 100 and 300 K and the best fit of the \u03c7(T) data to that function yields C = 8.067 \u00b1 0.005 emu K mol-1 Oe-1 and \u03b8 = -29.8 \u00b1 0.1 K. The \u03c7T value at room temperature is consistent with the presence of two Mn2+ ions (S = 5/2). Below 80 K \u03c7(T) curve starts deviating downward from the mentioned Curie-Weiss and such deviation becomes more noticeable with decreasing temperature. However, there is an increase of \u03c7(T) curve at 47 K that is likely due to the presence of a small amount of ferrimagnetic Mn3O4  oxide as an impurity.
