Besides, PXRD analysis was performed to determine the phase purity of Mg-APDA. As represented in Figure S3, the diffraction peaks of the as-synthesized Mg-APDA are highly consistent with the simulated PXRD patterns, indicative of the excellent phase purity. To determine the effect of fluorescence detections on the structural stability of the Mg-APDA framework, the samples after immersed in the DMF solution (1.0 mM) with different analytes (Fe(III), nitrofurazone (NZF), nitrofurantoin (NFT), and 2,6-dichloro-4-nitroaniline (DCN)) for 6 h were also analyzed by PXRD, as shown in Figure S4. It is seen that there is no significant difference in the PXRD patterns between the immersed sample and the original sample, which indicates that the basic Mg-APDA framework remains unchanged.\n\nPhotoluminescence Properties\n\nThe solid-state luminescence properties of the free ligand and Mg-APDA were conducted at ambient temperature. As illustrated in Figure S5, the free ligand H2APDA shows a fluorescent emission band at 365 nm (\u03bbex = 339 nm), which may be ascribed to the intraligand \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* transition between the \u03c0-bonding orbital and \u03c0*-antibonding orbital. For comparison, Mg-APDA exhibits intense blue light emission at 384 nm (\u03bbex = 351 nm) with a 70.46% quantum yield. Compared to the free ligand, a significant red-shifted emission phenomenon is observed on Mg-APDA, and its fluorescent intensity dramatically increases. On account of the unique d0 electron configuration of Mg(II) ions, it can be concluded that the fluorescence of Mg-APDA should originate from the APDA-centered emission.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "Mg-APDA", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "30 to 170", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "loss of free DMA and water molecules", "condition": "under a nitrogen atmosphere"}, {"value": "170 to 800", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "slow decomposition of the framework", "condition": "under a nitrogen atmosphere"}], "peak spectrum": [{"value": "365", "unit": "nm", "type": "fluorescent emission", "condition": "ambient temperature"}, {"value": "384", "unit": "nm", "type": "blue light emission", "condition": "ambient temperature"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["decomposition_temperature", "peak_spectrum"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['decomposition_temperature', 'peak_spectrum']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n  {\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"name\": \"Mg-APDA\",\n      \"symbol\": \"\",\n      \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"decomposition temperature\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"30 to 170\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"loss of free DMA and water molecules\",\n        \"condition\": \"under a nitrogen atmosphere\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"value\": \"170 to 800\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"slow decomposition of the framework\",\n        \"condition\": \"under a nitrogen atmosphere\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"peak spectrum\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"365\",\n        \"unit\": \"nm\",\n        \"type\": \"fluorescent emission\",\n        \"condition\": \"ambient temperature\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"value\": \"384\",\n        \"unit\": \"nm\",\n        \"type\": \"blue light emission\",\n        \"condition\": \"ambient temperature\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 5, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Chemical Structure of H<sub>2</sub>APDA</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2018-019032_0010.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Chemical Structure of H2APDA   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 11, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) The coordination\nenvironment of Mg\u00ad(II) atoms and the bonding\nmode of APDA in Mg-APDA.
