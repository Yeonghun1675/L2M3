The rapid pressure equilibration and absence of hysteresis confirm that H2 is reversibly physisorbed in the MOP and MOF samples. However, under these conditions, H2 isotherms are not fully saturated because of the low critical temperature of H2 (33 K). Consequently, the uptake of H2 in the low pressure region does not depend on either the surface area or pore volume of the compounds. In general, the chemical functionalities of the organic links are less effective for strong interaction with H2, and therefore the H2 uptake capacity should reflect the geometry of pore systems. In other words, the large internal void space for an nbo-type material is not effective for H2 storage under low pressure.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 69, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>Similarly, there is no specific relationship between CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and the surface area of the materials because of the large saturation pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (<italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>\n<sub>0</sub> = 26\u2009140 Torr at 273 K).
