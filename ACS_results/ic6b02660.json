To further confirm the separation ability of the Cu-MOF 1, ideal adsorbed solution theory was applied to calculate the CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivities at room temperature with 15:85 and 50:50 molar ratios. As shown in Figure S19, the selectivities for CO2 over CH4 and N2 are in the ranges of 4.9-5.4 and 14.7-19.7, respectively, and the calculated values are comparable with some MOFs modified by other polar groups including NOTT-125 with oxamide, ZJNU-40 with benzothiadiazole, and ZJU-8a with amino. \n\nIn summary, we have designed and synthesized a polar ketone-functionalized Cu-MOF 1. Rhombicuboctahedral cages are formed in the title compound possessing the open CuII sites toward the cage center and the channels decorated by uncoordinated carbonyl groups. The activated Cu-MOF 1 shows the large surface area of 1539 m2 g-1 and good thermal stability. More importantly, the Cu-MOF 1 displays high H2 uptake (2.8 wt % at 77 K and 1 bar) and exceptionally high CO2 loading (46.7 wt % at 273 K and 1 bar) as well as high selectivities for CO2 over N2 and CH4 at room temperature. It is concluded that the successful introduction of polar ketone groups in the Cu-MOF 1 is responsible for the high gas adsorption performance in addition to the formation of open CuII sites toward the cage center. Our synthetic strategy for implanting the polar ketone group into a multidentate ligand could throw certain light on designing and preparing novel MOFs with high performance in the research of gas adsorption.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "Cu-MOF 1", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "46.7", "unit": "wt%", "temperature": "273 K",
