Compound 3 is stable nearly up to 400 \u00b0C and decomposes to NiO, as identified by X-ray powder diffraction, in one step (onset at 400 \u00b0C, completion at 450 \u00b0C; obs 76.80%, calcd 77.15%). Compound 2 shows  an unexpected two-step decomposition to NiO from 310 to 400 \u00b0C (total weight loss: obs 85.55%, calcd 83.83%). The intermediate product was identified as compound 3 by X-ray powder diffraction and IR spectroscopy, and the first weight loss was in agreement with the corresponding loss of 1/2H2BDC and 1/3(2,2\u2018-bipy) molecules per nickel (obs 30.12%, calcd 29.25%). The second weight loss was consistent with decomposition of 3 to NiO (obs 55.43%, calcd 54.58%). This, at first sight surprising, condensation of the dimeric molecules 3 to a polymer containing trinuclear clusters, 3, was in agreement with the temperature effect in the synthesis of these compounds: the reactant ratio that gives a mixture of 2 and 3 below 180 \u00b0C results in a pure phase 3 when heated above 180 \u00b0C. In a similar way, compound 1 showed an unexpected decomposition profile in our previous report [calculated weight losses for 0.75H2BDC per Ni2+ and 1.0(BDC + 2,2\u2018-bipy) per Ni2+ were 27.75% and 60. 42%]. The new information on the structural properties and thermal behavior of Ni-BDC/2,2\u2018-bipy coordination polymers allowed the identification of the previously unknown product of the partial decomposition of the framework of 1 as compound 3, which was confirmed by X-ray power diffraction and FTIR spectroscopy. Consequently, the first observed weight loss of 34.56% corresponded to the loss of 0.75 of guest H2BDC and 1/3 of 2,2\u2018-bipy (calcd 35.08%) to form the trinuclear compound 3, and the second weight loss was due to the decomposition of the framework to NiO (obs 50.50%, calcd 50.76%).
