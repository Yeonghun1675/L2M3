Single crystals of Ni(bipy)(hip)(H2O)2 were synthesized by the diffusion method: 1 mmol of NiNO3 (0,8720 g) was dissolved in 5 mL of MeOH, and 1 mmol of H2hip (0.5380 g) was added and stirred for 10 min; then the solution was layered carefully on top of the 5 mL bipy-DMF solution (2 mmol 0.9329 g). These two layers were separated with 2 mL of the DMF-MeOH mixture. After 1 week, light-blue prismatic crystals precipitated ().", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "Ni(bipy)(hip)(H2O)2", "symbol": "AMU-2", "chemical formula": ""}, "processes": [{"synthesis method": "diffusion", "precursor": [{"name": "NiNO3", "amount": "0.8720", "unit": "g"}, {"name": "H2hip", "amount": "0.5380", "unit": "g"}, {"name": "4,4'-bipy", "amount": "0.9329", "unit": "g"}], "solvent": [{"name": "MeOH", "amount": "5", "unit": "mL"}, {"name": "bipy-DMF solution", "amount": "5", "unit": "mL"}, {"name": "DMF-MeOH mixture", "amount": "2", "unit": "mL"}], "pressure": "", "temperature": "", "time": "1 week"}], "yield": ""}]], "include_properties": ["chemical_synthesis"], "intermediate_step": {"text-synthesis-type": "['chemical_synthesis']", "text-synthesis-struct": "```JSON\n[{\"meta\":{\"name\":\"Ni(bipy)(hip)(H2O)2\", \"symbol\":\"AMU-2\", \"chemical formula\":\"\"}, \"processes\":[{\"synthesis method\":\"diffusion\", \"precursor\":[{\"name\":\"NiNO3\", \"amount\":\"0.8720\", \"unit\":\"g\"}, {\"name\":\"H2hip\", \"amount\":\"0.5380\", \"unit\":\"g\"}, {\"name\":\"4,4'-bipy\", \"amount\":\"0.9329\", \"unit\":\"g\"}], \"solvent\":[{\"name\":\"MeOH\", \"amount\":\"5\", \"unit\":\"mL\"}, {\"name\":\"bipy-DMF solution\", \"amount\":\"5\", \"unit\":\"mL\"}, {\"name\":\"DMF-MeOH mixture\", \"amount\":\"2\", \"unit\":\"mL\"}], \"pressure\":\"\", \"temperature\":\"\", \"time\":\"1 week\"}], \"yield\":\"\"}]\n```"}}, {"idx": 9, "type": "table", "classification": ["Crystal"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Selected Crystal Data of AMU-2 Compressed\nin Oil Daphne 7373: Crystal Symmetry Orthorhombic, Space Group <italic>Pccn</italic>, <italic>Z</italic> = 8 <italic>Z\u2032</italic> =\n1<xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"tbl1-fn1\"></xref>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"7\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col6\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col7\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">pressure</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">0.1\u00a0MPa</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">0.08(2) GPa</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">0.3(2) GPa</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">0.5(2) GPa</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">1.0(2) MPa</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">1.67(2) GPa</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic>a</italic>\u00a0(\u00c5)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>13.722(2)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>13.789(9)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>13.530(16)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>13.235(18)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>12.61(2)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>12.23(3)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic>b</italic>\u00a0(\u00c5)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>19.1020(17)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>19.340(3)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>19.337(3)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>19.248(3)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>19.086(4)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>19.025(6)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic>c</italic>\u00a0(\u00c5)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>22.516(3)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>22.514(2)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>22.512(2)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>22.459(3)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>22.360(3)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>22.377(5)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>volume (\u00c5<sup>3</sup>)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>5895.6(13)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>6004(4)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>5890(7)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>5721(8)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>5381(9)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>5205(14)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic>D</italic>\n<sub>\n<italic>x</italic>\n</sub> (g/cm<sup>3</sup>)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.105</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.085</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.106</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.139</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.211</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.252</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n<table-wrap-foot>\n<fn id=\"tbl1-fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>The initial stoichiometry Ni\u00ad(hip)\u00ad(bipy)\u00ad(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>\u00b7H<sub>2</sub>O\u00b7CH<sub>3</sub>OH\u00b7DMF\nassumed for <italic>D</italic>\n<sub>\n<italic>x</italic>\n</sub>.</p>\n</fn>\n</table-wrap-foot>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "Table 1.
