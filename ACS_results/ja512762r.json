As a proof of concept, two functionalized linkers, NH2-BDC (2-amino-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) and (CH3O)2-TPDC (2',5'-dimethoxyterphenyl-4,4\"-dicarboxylate), were installed using the SLI strategy, which gave rise to a new MTV-MOF, namely PCN-704. It exhibits topology identical with that of PCN-703. Single-crystal X-ray crystallography and 1H NMR clearly indicate the existence and proper ratio of NH2-BDC and (CH3O)2-TPDC.
