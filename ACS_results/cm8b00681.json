A cooperative binding model was found to exist in Cu(INAIP) in which the carbonyl group of the amide plays different roles in the adsorption of specific gas molecules, strengthening our understanding of host-gas interactions and gas adsorption in amide-functionalized MOFs. This work lays a solid foundation for future studies of the effect of amide functional groups on gas adsorption in MOFs, and also provides a comprehensive strategy to investigate gas adsorption in other MOFs and porous materials.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 19, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information is available\nfree of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications\nwebsite</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b00681\">10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b00681</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Synthesis and\ncharacterization of materials, SSNMR data,\ncalculation details, structural diagrams, and electron density visualizations\n(<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b00681/suppl_file/cm8b00681_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>SCXRD\ndata for activated-Cu\u00ad(INAIP) at 110 K (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b00681/suppl_file/cm8b00681_si_002.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>SCXRD data for CO<sub>2</sub>-loaded\nCu\u00ad(INAIP) at 110K\n(<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b00681/suppl_file/cm8b00681_si_003.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>SCXRD\ndata for CH<sub>4</sub>-loaded Cu\u00ad(INAIP) at 85\nK (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b00681/suppl_file/cm8b00681_si_004.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>SCXRD\ndata for C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>-loaded Cu\u00ad(INAIP)\nat 110 K (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b00681/suppl_file/cm8b00681_si_005.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>SCXRD data for C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>-loaded Cu\u00ad(INAIP)\nat 153 K (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b00681/suppl_file/cm8b00681_si_006.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>SCXRD data for C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>-loaded Cu\u00ad(INAIP)\nat 193 K (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b00681/suppl_file/cm8b00681_si_007.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>DFT-optimized structure of CO<sub>2</sub>-loaded Cu\u00ad(INAIP)\n(<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b00681/suppl_file/cm8b00681_si_008.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>DFT-optimized\nstructure of CH<sub>4</sub>-loaded Cu\u00ad(INAIP)\n(<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b00681/suppl_file/cm8b00681_si_009.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>DFT-optimized\nstructure of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>-loaded Cu\u00ad(INAIP) (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b00681/suppl_file/cm8b00681_si_010.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b00681.
