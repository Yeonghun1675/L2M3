Before the catalytic process, the binding energy (BE) peak of Cu 2p3/2 was at 929 eV, which was assigned to Cu(I) in 1 and 2. After 1 h of reaction, the BE peaks were at 929 and 931 eV; the higher BE peak at 931 eV was assigned to Cu(II), accompanied by the characteristic Cu(II) satellite peaks (942 eV). After catalysis, the characteristic Cu(II) peak disappeared and only the 929 eV peak was found. The results indicated that there was a reversible oxidation/reduction transformation of central metal ions. On the basis of the above experimental results, we proposed a plausible mechanism for the benzo-cyclanes into cyclanone as shown in . First, the Cu(I)-based MOFs were activated by oxygen to generate Cu(II) and tert-butyl alcohol peroxide was used to generate free radical t-BuO\u22c5. Second, the t-BuO\u22c5 radicals reacted with benzo-cyclanes to generate carbon-centered radicals. Lastly, carbon-centered radicals were converted to desired products and the Cu(II) turned back to Cu(I). To verify the generation of free radicals, we used tetrahydronaphthalene as substrate and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) as radical-trapping reagent in the reaction. As we expected, only the 5% yield was given, which was much lower than entry 1 (). This result demonstrated that free radicals must be generated in this oxidation system.
