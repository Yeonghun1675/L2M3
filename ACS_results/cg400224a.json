The profile parameters, zero-point, and interpolated background were calculated by powder-pattern decomposition based on the Le Bail algorithm. The atomic coordinates obtained from the parallel tempering procedure of FOX were used as the starting model for the Rietveld refinement using the program GSAS with an EXPGUI interface. The 2\u03b8 range of 7.5-60.0\u00b0 was used in the Rietveld refinement. The lattice parameters, the background coefficients, and profile parameters were refined initially followed by the refinement of positional coordinates of all non-hydrogen atoms adopting bond length, bond angle, and planar restraints. The background was described by the shifted Chebyshev function of the first kind with 24 points regularly distributed over the entire 2\u03b8 range. The isotropic displacement parameter of 0.04 \u00c52 for all non-hydrogen atoms was introduced. Hydrogen atoms were placed in the calculated positions with B iso = 0.06 \u00c52.

Statistical analysis of powder data using the FINDSPACE module of EXPO2009 indicated the most probable space group as P21/a, which was used for subsequent structure analysis. The structure solution procedure was carried out using FOX, an ab initio reverse Monte Carlo structure solution program. The initial molecular geometry was optimized by hyperchem using the Polak-Ribiere algorithm. The optimized molecular geometry and lattice parameters were imported into FOX. The profile parameters, zero-point, and interpolated background were calculated by powder-pattern decomposition based on the Le Bail algorithm. The atomic coordinates obtained from the parallel tempering procedure of FOX were used as the starting model for the Rietveld refinement using the program GSAS with an EXPGUI interface. The 2\u03b8 range of 7.5-60.0\u00b0 was used in the Rietveld refinement. The lattice parameters, the background coefficients, and profile parameters were refined initially followed by the refinement of positional coordinates of all non-hydrogen atoms adopting bond length, bond angle, and planar restraints. The background was described by the shifted Chebyshev function of the first kind with 24 points regularly distributed over the entire 2\u03b8 range. The isotropic displacement parameter of 0.04 \u00c52 for all non-hydrogen atoms was introduced. Hydrogen atoms were placed in the calculated positions with B iso = 0.06 \u00c52. Data collection and structure refinement parameters and crystallographic data for complex 3 are given in . Selected coordination bond lengths and bond angles are summarized in .\n\nThermal and PXRD Analysis\n\nThermogravimetric analysis shows that between 170 and 250 \u00b0C one guest water and two coordinated water molecules (theo: 19.42 wt %; exp: 19.31 wt %) are removed, and the resultant anhydrous framework is stable up to 320 \u00b0C, . Phase purity of the as-synthesized complex was checked by PXRD analysis, Figure . When 1 was heated in a vacuum at 250 \u00b0C for 4 h, a deep purple colored amorphous (confirmed through PXRD analysis) specimen was obtained (phase 2). This amorphous material was kept in open air for three days, and the color of the amorphous material turned gradually to pink but still remained amorphous, but when phase 2 is soaked in water the color of the sample instantly changed to light orange along with a sharp \"hiss-hiss\" sound. The PXRD data of the filtered light orange residue (phase 3) show that phase 3 is crystalline material (Figure ). Astonishingly, this PXRD pattern is different from that of phase 1, which indicates that phase 3 is a completely different crystalline material than phase 1. That means under deaquation crystal 1 (mother crystal) becomes amorphous, and upon reaquation it turns into a new crystalline form 3 (daughter crystal). So a crystalline to amorphous to a new-crystalline transformation has taken place, which is a very interesting phenomenon indeed.\n\nThermal and PXRD Analysis of Phase 3 \n\nThermogravimetric analysis of phase 3 shows that within 210 \u00b0C all the guest and coordinated water molecules (theo: 32.50 wt %; exp: 33.36 wt %) are removed, and the resultant anhydrous framework is stable up to 320 \u00b0C, .\n\nPhotoluminescence Spectra of Different Phases\n\nThe emission spectra of all the three phases were studied in solid state at room temperature. It can be observed that intense emissions occurred at 390 nm (\u03bbex ~ 314 nm) for phase 1, 420 nm (\u03bbex ~ 314 nm) for phase 2, and 413 nm (\u03bbex ~ 308 nm) for phase 3 (Figure ). The fluorescence arises due to ligand to metal charge transfer spectra. This result suggests that complexes may be an excellent candidate for potentially photoactive material, and this overall structural transformation upon dehydration-rehydration is accompanied by a change in color (thermochromism).\n\nMagnetic Study of Different Phases\n\nAs the coordination environment around metal ions as well as the structure is changed drastically, a significant change in the magnetic property is expected, and thus the magnetic studies of phase 1, 2, and 3 have been carried out in the temperature range of 3-300 K. For phase 1, the \u03c7m value is 0.011 cm3 mol-1 at 300 K; upon cooling the \u03c7m value increased very slowly to 0.074 cm3 mol-1 at 34 K and afterward increased sharply to reach a maximum value of 0.86 cm3 mol-1 at 3 K, Figure . In order to determine the nature of magnetic interaction, the susceptibility data above 34 K were fitted to the Curie-Weiss Law. Curie and Weiss constants are 3.43 cm3 mol-1 K and \u03b8 = -16.52 K, respectively, . The negative value of the Weiss constant indicates the presence of antiferromagnetic interaction between Co(II) ions. The \u03c7m T value is 3.30 cm3 mol-1 K at 300 K, which is larger than the calculated spin-only value (1.9 cm3 mol-1 K) for one Co(II) (S = 3/2) ions, indicating the important orbital contribution arising from the high-spin octahedral Co(II). Upon cooling, the \u03c7m T value decreased smoothly to reach a value of 2.61 cm3 mol-1 K at 34 K due to antiferromagnetic interaction between Co(II) centers, Figure . Upon further cooling, the \u03c7m T value increased to 2.81 cm3 mol-1 K at 15 K, suggesting an appreciable but weak ferromagnetic exchange interaction between Co(II) centers. The sudden decrease in \u03c7m T to 2.60 cm3 mol-1 K at 3 K may be attributed to a zero-field splitting (ZFS) effect. The high-temperature magnetic behavior indicates that the magnetic interactions between Co(II) ions are dominated by antiferromagnetic coupling, while the low temperature magnetic behavior suggests that weak ferromagnetism exists within the system. For an antiferromagnetic system, such ferromagnetic correlation can be attributed to spin canting. \n\nFor phase 2, the \u03c7m value at 300 K is 0.0059 cm3 mol-1, and upon cooling the \u03c7m value increased very slowly to 0.033 cm3 mol-1 at 35 K and afterward increased sharply to reach a maximum value of 0.20 cm3 mol-1 at 3 K, Figure . To determine the nature of magnetic interaction, the susceptibility data were fitted to the Curie-Weiss Law. Curie and Weiss constants are 1.89 cm3 mol-1 K and \u03b8 = -20.87 K, respectively, . The negative value of the Weiss constant indicates the presence of antiferromagnetic interaction between Co(II) ions. The \u03c7m T value is 1.77 cm3 mol-1 K at room-temperature, and then the \u03c7m T values decreases smoothly to reach minimum value of 0.61 cm3 mol-1 K at 3 K due to antiferromagnetic interaction between Co(II) centers. The phase 2 does not exhibit any hysteresis loop at 5 K. This clearly indicates that phase 2 is antiferromagnetic in nature. It is interesting that a material in amorphous phase (like phase 2) shows antiferromagnetic behavior.\n\nFor phase 3, \u03c7m value at 300 K is 0.0082 cm3 mol-1, and upon cooling the \u03c7m value increased very slowly to 0.051 cm3 mol-1 at 33 K and afterward increased sharply to reach a maximum value of 0.46 cm3 mol-1 at 3 K, Figure . Curie and Weiss constants of the sample are 2.55 cm3 mol-1 K and \u03b8 = -19.42 K, respectively, . The negative value of the Weiss constant indicates antiferromagnetic interaction between Co(II) ions. The \u03c7m T value is 2.46 cm3 mol-1 K at room-temperature, and then the \u03c7m T values decreases smoothly to reach a minimum value of 1.39 cm3 mol-1 K at 3 K due to antiferromagnetic interaction between Co(II) centers. For phase 3 no hysteresis loop has been detected at 5 K, and this corroborates the susceptibility data.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "C36H42N6O4"},
