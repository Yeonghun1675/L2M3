The resulting powder X-ray diffraction patterns show well-resolved diffraction peaks, which confirm a good crystallinity. All diffraction peaks were ticked and indexed with the WinXPOW package using the Loue\u0308r algorithm with a cubic unit cell and refined in space group I4\u03053m (no. 217) with a = 17.0370(3) \u00c5 (FOM(30) = 548.5) and a = 17.0832(6) \u00c5 (FOM(30) = 709.2) for ZIF-8_Cl and ZIF-8_Br, respectively. The Rietveld analysis was performed with the GSAS package and EXPGUI as an interface. A Lebail refinement enabled the determination of the background and profile parameters. The empty structure of ZIF-8_CH3 described in space group I4\u03053m and published by Moggach et al. (CCDC 739168 and RefCode TUDKEJ), where the CH3 group in position 2 of the linker was here replaced by a Cl or Br atom, was used as the starting model for the Rietveld refinement. After the first stage of the Rietveld analysis, after scale factor determination, Fourier difference maps showed unambiguously for both compounds a splitting of the halogen atomic positions on both sides of the imidazolate plane. This splitting is explained by a tilt of the linker around the axis defined by both nitrogen atoms. Following this observation and to take this disorder into account, a second set of atoms defining a differently oriented linker was introduced with the same shared nitrogen atoms. Each moiety having a specific occupancy factor, the sum of them was constrained to one. During the Rietveld refinement process, all atoms were refined isotropically, and soft restraints (bonds, angles, and planes) were added to maintain a proper structure of the imidazolate linker. The final Rietveld refinement gave excellent reliability factors; crystal as well as Rietveld refinement parameters are listed in Tables S1 and S4. Atomic parameters and selected bond distances and angles are listed in Tables S2, S3, S5, and S6.

For ZIF-8_Cl, it remains still unclear whether this second step\ncorresponds to slight modification of packing molecules or surface\nadsorption. However, our computational study (see below) suggests\nthat it would be assigned to the transition toward an accommodated\nmolecules arrangement that is more ordered.

The strength\nof interplays between nitrogen probe molecules and host materials\nframeworks decreases in the order: ZIF-8_Br &gt; ZIF-8_Cl &gt; ZIF-8_CH<sub>3</sub>. The latter may be explained by electrostatic interactions\nor entropic parameters or a combination of both hypotheses. Indeed,\neven though the nitrogen molecules are commonly used for evaluating\nthe textural properties of porous materials, they display a quadrupole\nmoment and may interact preferentially\non the internal surface with linkers in the ascending order mim &lt;\ncim-2 &lt; bim-2 as all ZIFs are Zn-based materials. From a point\nof view concerning the entropy, the stiffness of ZIF-8_Br structure\ncould generate preferentially initial favorable adsorption sites in\npore mouth for the 6-membered facets. Finally, d, where nitrogen capacities of the ZIF-8\nderivatives are expressed in cm<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>\u20133</sup> STP, highlights also a peculiar point resulting from the intersection\nof the three isotherms.

Above, from an experimental point\nof view, we have argued that this point represents the gate opening\npressure due to the swing of linkers in the cases of ZIF-8_CH<sub>3</sub> and ZIF-8_Cl, thereby enabling more probe molecules to be\naccommodated. Given the high structural similitude of ZIF-8 counterparts\n(except the flexibility/stiff characteristic), the slight increase\nfrom 13 to 14.5 mmol cm<sup>\u20133</sup> observed for ZIF-8_Br\nis certainly related to a slight modification packing of nitrogen\nmolecules.</p>", "clean_text": "In more details, ZIF-8_CH3 isotherm is characterized by a two-stepped uptake starting at p/p\u00b0 ~ 0.005 and ending at p/p\u00b0 ~ 0.02 as well as by a sharper reverse phenomenon occurring in the 0.075-0.005 p/p\u00b0 range.
