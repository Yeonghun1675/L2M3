From similar adsorption experiments performed on the non-interpenetrated analogue MIL-88C (), it is clear that the MIL-88 materials hardly display any uptake of the compounds. It seems that the relatively low concentrations of indole or benzothiophene are insufficient to open the structure of MIL-88C. Because of the interpenetration of MIL-126, the structure remains open, resulting in an uptake of the preferred compound indole, already at low concentrations.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 34, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Conclusion</title><p>We report here the synthesis and characterization\nincluding its\nstructure determination using a microdiffraction setup, of the iron(III)\n4,4\u2032-biphenyl dicarboxylate, denoted MIL-126, that is, the\nfirst example of an interwoven MIL-88 solid.
