Therefore, it is possible that 1, 2, and 3 with carbonyl and hydroxyl groups bind to amino and sulfonate groups containing CR and MO by hydrogen bonding. To reveal the intermolecular action between CR/MO and 1-3, Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) were recorded and depicted. The peaks at 3466 and 3296 cm-1 (a) are assigned to N-H and O-H vibrations, respectively. After the adsorption of CR, the peak of -OH from 3296 cm-1 shifted to 3415 cm-1, indicating that CR is loaded onto 1 via hydrogen bonds. The double peaks between 1600 and 1700 cm-1 derived from C\ue5fbO vibrational coupling merge into a broad peak after CR adsorption. Meanwhile, the peak at 1224 cm-1 assigned to the C-O vibration shifts to 1247 cm-1. The results suggest hydrogen bonds among the -NH2, -OH, and C\ue5fbO groups play a key role for removing CR. For 2, the peak of O-H shifted to 3421 cm-1 from 3418 cm-1 and the peak at 1144 cm-1 of the C-O vibration is presented at 1146 cm-1 after CR adsorption, and the vibration peaks of C\ue5fbO had no change (Figure S14a). We believe that the presence of a hydroxyl group promotes 2's adsorption for CR. The peak at 3445 cm-1 of O-H shifted to 3439 cm-1, and the peak at 1141 cm-1 of C-O vibration increases to 1147 cm-1 after CR adsorbed on 3.
