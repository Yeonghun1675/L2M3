Rationalization of such network structures involving covalent bonds is difficult to interpret. However, we have made a systematic a\u0301 posteriori analysis in terms of reacting synthons (chemically reasonable molecules) participating in the supramolecular reaction. Under our reaction conditions, the molar ratio of P/Mo apparently does not influence the nature of polyoxo cluster anion, and hence {P2Mo5} dominates in the formation of solids 1-4. In all the reactions, one or more copper pz complex (formed in situ) gets incorporated into the solid suggesting that as soon as pz is the added to the solution, copper pz complex is formed. However, the nature of the complex (ligand to metal ratio) varies depending on the concentration of the reactants (Scheme ). We have adopted a synthetic protocol to ensure that crystallization from homogenous solution leads to unambiguous analysis of the crystallized solids. In all the reactions, pH control was achieved by acidification with required amounts of H3PO4. It should be remembered that a part of the acid is consumed by the organic base, pz through acid-base reaction resulting in protonated pyrazolium cation. Formation of copper pz complex occurs in a stepwise manner and at equilibrium the solution may contain more than one type of copper pz complex:     [ Cu (   H   2     O )   6     ]   2 +    \u2194  [ Cu (   H   2     O )   5     ( pz ) ]   2 +    \u2194  [ Cu (   H   2     O )   4     ( pz )   2     ]   2 +    \u2194  [ Cu (   H   2     O )   3     ( pz )   3     ]   2 +    \u2194    [ Cu (   H   2     O )   2     ( pz )   4     ]   2 +      At a controlled pH (for e.g., pH ~ 3), increasing ligand/metal ratio favor the growth of three different crystals 1-3, respectively.
