The asymmetric unit contains 4/3 Zn4(\u03bc4-O) cluster consisting of four Zn cations, one \u03bc4-O atom, and four deprotonated L2- ligands. There are two kinds of Zn4(\u03bc4-O) clusters in NENU-522 (Figure S1 in the ). The one Zn4(\u03bc4-O) cluster is encapsulated by six carboxylate groups from six H2L ligands to form a classic secondary building unit (SBU), [Zn4O(CO2)6], in IRMOF-n. In NENU-522, Zn4 adopts six-coordinated octahedral geometry, while Zn1, Zn2, Zn3, Zn5, and Zn6 have tetrahedral coordination geometry, which is the same as that in a classic MOF (Figures S1 and S2 in the ). The Zn4O SBUs are connected by the six ligands to generate an interesting 3D microporous framework (Figure b).

The predominant feature is that the PL intensities are largely dependent on the solvent molecules, particularly in the case of NB, which exhibits significant quenching behavior. The physical interaction of the solute and solvent acts a vital role in such fluorescence behavior. Luminescence quenching is related to the electron-withdrawing -NO2 group, and all Ln3+ ions except La3+ and Lu3+ can generate luminescent f-f emissions from UV to visible and near-infrared ranges. Sm3+, Eu3+, Tb3+, and Dy3+ emit orange, red, green, and blue light upon adequate excitation, respectively, which are easy to observe. We use Tb  3+  @NENU-522 to detect nitroaromatic explosives, taking that the luminescence intensity of Tb  3+  @NENU-522 is much higher than that of Ln  3+  @NENU-522. The fluorescence detection experiments of Tb  3+  @NENU-522 were performed to examine the sensing sensitivity to a series of nitroaromatic explosives such as NB, 1,3-DNB, TNP, and so on. To examine the sensing sensitivity toward TNP in more detail, a batch of suspensions of Tb  3+  @NENU-522 were prepared by dispersing it in a DMF solution while gradually increasing the contents to monitor the emissive response. The luminescence intensity has decreased 35% only at 5 ppm and 58% at 10 ppm, and complete quenching occurred at 80 ppm (Figures c,d and S14 in the ). The finely ground powders could be dispersed well in the analyte solutions, which enables nitro-containing compounds to be closely adhered to the surface of Tb  3+  @NENU-522 particles, facilitating probable host-guest interaction. Here, electron transfer from a electron-donating framework to high electron deficiency can take place upon excitation, causing fluorescence quenching. Similar quenching phenomena were reported in the previous works. Similar fluorescence quenching is recorded by the PL spectra (\u03bbex = 333 nm) when the NB and 1,3-DNB molecules are added to DMF. The fluorescence intensities decrease with an increase of the concentration of the analytes added to DMF. The luminescence intensities have decreased 47% of the original intensity at 100 ppm for NB and 49% at 20 ppm for 1,3-DNB. The lowest concentrations of complete quenching are 2000 ppm for NB and 1000 ppm for 1,3-DNB (Figures a,b and S15 and S16 in the ). The results indicate that Tb  3+  @NENU-522 displays the most effective detection for TNP (Figure e). In other words, the lowest concentrations of complete quenching decrease with an increase in the number of -NO2 of nitroaromatic explosives. These explosives are electron acceptors with electron-deficient -NO2 groups, and the skeleton of NENU-522 possesses strong electron-donating ability with rigid carbazole groups. So, we conclude that, with increasing -NO2 groups, energy transfer from the electron-donating framework to high electron deficiency becomes more, making the effect of fluorescence quenching more obvious.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 20, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>To further demonstrate\nthe phenomena, we also investigated the potential of <bold>Tb</bold>\n<sup>\n<bold>3+</bold>\n</sup>\n<bold>@NENU-522</bold> toward sensing 2,6-DNT\nand TNT.

Under excitation at 320 nm, NENU-522 exhibited significantly enhanced bright-blue-light emission with an emission maximum at 449 nm, which can be attributed to H2L ligand-centered emission because a similar emission can be observed at 441 nm upon excitation at the same wavelength for the free H2L ligand (Figure S7 in the ). The Commission International de I'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates for the blue emission of NENU-522 were calculated to be (0.1528, 0.1024), close to those of a saturated blue-light emitter with CIE coordinates of (0.14, 0.08).
