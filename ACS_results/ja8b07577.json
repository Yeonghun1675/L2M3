The OMSs to the guest interaction basically depend on the electronegativity of the metals or metal ions including the number of OMSs present per metal ion. In our present study, all three compounds PESD-1-3 (Zn-Zn, Zn-Co, and Zn-Ni) contain a similar metal cluster of [Zn4O]6+ (PESD-1) and the composite cluster [Zn2M2O]6+ (M = Co or Ni) (PESD-2 and -3) in the degassed state.

The main difference is at the metal cluster core part, where octahedral coordinated Zn metal was replaced with Co (or Ni) respectively for PESD-2 and -3 (Zn-Co and Zn-Ni) analogues (). As observed in TGA, the coordinated DMF solvent molecules leave at ~173, ~189, and ~231 \u00b0C respectively for Zn, Co, and Ni (PESD-1, -2, and -3) analogues. This is in good agreement with their respective electronegativity values of 1.65, 1.88, and 1.91 respectively for Zn, Co, and Ni metals.

The measurements carried out at various possible high temperatures on as-synthesized and as well as degassed samples separately. The contact angles measured on as-synthesized powder samples at room temperature (RT, ~30 \u00b0C) of PESD- 1, -2 and -3 respectively were 155.5\u00b0, 159.3\u00b0, and 160.8\u00b0 (, , ).

It is noteworthy that the MOFs/PCPs family of archetypal framework [Zn4O(L) n ] formed a similar chemical formula of H3BTB ligands with a coordinating (RCOO - ) moiety at the para-position and others are hygroscopic in nature. However, similar contact angle measurements on the powdered samples of pure H3BTMB ligand alone did not have any contact angle, indicating that the ligand alone in uncoordinated state is hydrophilic in nature.\n\nFor real-time applications of the present composite superhydrophobic PCPs, we also carried out an oil spill cleanup study for PESD-2 and -3. In fact, the powder samples showing superhydrophobicity with contact angles of >150\u00b0 (155.5\u00b0, 159.3\u00b0, and 160.8\u00b0 respectively for PESD- 1, -2, and -3) were converted into pellets (hydrophobic surfaces observed in the pellet-disk form) of PESD-2 and -3 for the oil cleanup study. Pellets of PESD-2 and -3 were placed within a mixture consisting of an organic solvent/oil and water. Outstandingly, the pellets floated on the water surface and adsorbed organic solvents/oils selectively from the water (; see movie files 1-3, in the ). More precisely and quantitatively, 150 and 135 mg of PESD-2 and -3 pellet discs with surface areas of ~1.7 5 and ~1.5 cm2 could uptake ~350 and ~385 wt % of olive oil, respectively. Moreover, these samples could be reused for several cycles without losing its crystallinity and superhydrophobicity.
