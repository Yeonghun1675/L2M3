Atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) analysis of the filtrate, after the removal of the catalyst after reaction, confirms that the Cu2+ content is 0.05 mg/L, indicating the leaching of Cu2+ into the solvent was negligible during the reaction. Lastly, an experiment was carried out to check for the possible occurrence of any leaching. First, after a standard reaction have taken place for 12 h, the mother liquor was split into two fractions, in which one had the solid catalyst while the other was without the solid catalyst. In this case, the conversion of styrene is 68%. After an additional 12 h, the conversion rates of two fractions are 86.2% (with the solid catalyst) and 69.4% (without), respectively. The results indicate that 2' has good stability. Moreover, the solid catalysts still maintain a deep blue color after reaction, which proves that the metal ion coordination sphere is not destroyed. From above studies, we draw a conclusion that 2' acts as a heterogeneous Lewis acid catalyst in these epoxidation reactions. A plausible mechanism of these olefin epoxidation reactions is that unsaturated Cu acts as Lewis acid catalyst after coordinated DMA molecules are removed.

The TGA curve of 1 shows a weight loss of 18.0% from 50 \u00b0C to 300 \u00b0C, corresponding to the loss of disordered waters and DMF molecules in the channels (calc. 17.9%) and then an intense weight loss from ~450 \u00b0C, which is attributed to the decomposition of the framework and ended after 500 \u00b0C to give a total weight loss of ~60.0% (see ). TGA curve of 2 shows a weight loss of ~24.0% from room temperature to 330 \u00b0C, corresponding to the loss of coordinated DMA, uncoordinated DMA, and disordered water molecules (calc. 23.96%) (see ).\n\nGas Sorption\n\nWe have determined the permanent porosity of 1' by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K, as well as the carbon dioxide uptake capacity at 273 K. The N2 adsorption isotherm of 1' reveals Type I behavior, indicative of microporous materials (see Figure ). The nitrogen adsorption shows good reversibility. From these data, the apparent surface area was calculated using the Langmuir method to be 848 m2/g (588 m2/g BET), thus confirming the permanent porosity of 1'. The CO2 gas adsorption property of 1' was investigated. The result shows that CO2 uptake is ~42.0 cm3/g at 273 K at 1.0 atm, highlighting its potential application for the CO2 gas storage (see Figure ). In contrast, its carbon dioxide uptake is moderate.
