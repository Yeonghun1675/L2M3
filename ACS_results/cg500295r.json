The CdII ions are bridged by the carboxylate groups to produce the two kinds of trinuclear units (SBU-A and SBU-B).

The two kinds of 1D double chains are interconnected in a parallel manner and united together to afford a 2D layer. The 2D sheets are joined by hbmb with asymmetric trans-conformation into a graceful 3D structure with point symbol of (43)2(46\u22c5618\u22c584)2.
