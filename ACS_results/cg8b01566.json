At the early stage of research on magnetic cooling materials, efforts have been focused on fabricating the 3d molecular clusters (3d refers to magnetic transition metals), such as {Fe8}, {Fe14}, {Mn10}, {Mn12}, and {Mn14} to obtain a large \u0394S m.

Considering this, the GdIII ion is an ideal choice to construct magnetic cooling materials owing to its zero orbital magnetic moment and large spin state (S = 7/2).

They both exhibit good chemical stability and a significant magnetocaloric effect with the -\u0394S  m value of 28.27 J/kg\u22c5K for 1 and 29.20 J/kg\u22c5K for 2 at 2 K for \u0394H  = 8 T.\n\nIn this communication, we report two hexanuclear GdIII-hydroxy cluster-based MOFs, namely, {H2[Gd6(OH)8(H2O)6(p-BDC-F4)6]\u22c53(2,2'-bpy)\u22c56H2O} (1) and {H2[Gd6(OH)8(H2O)6(m-BDC-F4)6]\u22c53(4,4'-bpy)\u22c56H2O} (2) (p-H2BDC-F4 = tetrafluoroterephthalic acid, m-H2BDC-F4 = tetrafluoroisophthalic acid), which are prepared through hydrothermal reactions of GdIII ions with the corresponding dicarboxylic ligands. Single crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) investigations unveil that they are built from the hexanuclear GdIII-hydroxy cluster MBB {Gd6(OH)8(COO)12(H2O)6}, but with different topologies. Compound 1 is a 12-connected framework with a face-centered cubic (fcu) topology, whereas 2 is a 6-connected framework with a primitive cubic (pcu) topology. Both of them show stability in some refluxing organic solvents, boiling water, and aqueous solutions at pH = 2-11. Moreover, they exhibit significant -\u0394S m values of 28.27 and 29.20 J/kg\u22c5K for 1 and 2, respectively.\n\nThe x m T versus T curves of 1 and 2 are displayed in , which are acquired from 300 to 2 K with H = 0.1 T. The magnetic performance of 1 and 2 is nearly the same, signifying the structure similarity. Thus, only the magnetic property of 1 is described in detail below. The experimental x m T value per {Gd6} unit is 46.65 cm3 mol-1 K at 300 K; this value is slightly low compare to the theoretical value of 47.25 cm3 mol-1 K achieved from six uncoupled GdIII ions. As cooling, x m T products remain practically constant (between 46.65 and 48.20 cm3 mol-1 K) until about 11 K, and then a sharp increase to 50.01 cm3 mol-1 K at lowest temperature is observed (a). This low temperature (below 11 K) magnetic behavior undoubtedly suggests the existence of weak intramolecular ferromagnetic (F) coupling in 1. The small positive \u03b8 value of 0.9 K, attained through simulating the 1/x m - T data in the whole temperature range using the Curie-Weiss law, can also confirm presence of F interaction (a). It is well accepted that the types of superexchange magnetic interactions (paramagnetic, antiferromagnetic, or ferromagnetic) largely depend on the M-O-M bridging angle. Very recently, Tong et al. has demonstrated that the large Gd-O-Gd bond angle (109.96 to 114.29\u00b0) commonly mediates the F interaction. Therefore, the weak F interactions observed in 1 and 2 should be attributed to the large Gd-O-Gd angles (113.61\u00b0 for 1, 113.53\u00b0 and 114.05\u00b0 for 2). a,c displays the magnetization curves (M versus H) of 1 and 2, in which the magnetization for 1 achieves a saturation value of 41.56 N\u03b2 (42.19 N\u03b2 for 2) at 2 K and 8 T, very close to 42 N\u03b2 expected for six isolated GdIII ions.\n\nGiven the large magnetization value and the presence of weak F interaction, the magnetocaloric properties of 1 and 2 were also investigated. On the basis of the experimental magnetization data, -\u0394S m was obtained using the Maxwell equation, and results are presented in b (for 1) and 3d (for 2). The calculated -\u0394S m values of 1 and 2 modestly rise as the temperature decreases or the field increases and achieves maximum values of 28.27 and 29.20 J/kg\u22c5K for 1 and 2 (\u0394H = 8 T at 2 K), respectively. These values are slightly lower than theoretically maximum -\u0394S m value (32.58 J/kg\u22c5K for 1 and 2), obtained from 6Rln(2S + 1) (S = 7/2). This disparity should be attributed to the negative contribution of diamagnetic compositions. Nevertheless, they are larger than those reported for some discrete GdIII clusters, such as {Gd2}, {Gd4}, {Gd7}, {Gd12}, and {Gd18}, whose -\u0394S m values are within the range of 12.93-27.7 J/kg\u22c5K. Interestingly, entropy changes for 1 and 2 are still large even in the low field region (15.36 and 15.87 J/kg\u22c5K for 1 and 2, respectively, with \u0394H = 2 T).
