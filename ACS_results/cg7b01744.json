The single crystal structures of xylene-loaded BIF-20 are successfully resolved, directly revealing the location of the xylene adsorption sites within the framework, and the underlying mechanism for the kinetic selectivity of pX over oX. We find that the tritopic BH(mim)3 unit serves as the primary adsorption site for xylene isomers. The tilting of the imidazole rings, providing local structural flexibility in the framework, could facilitate the adsorption and diffusion of large guest molecules through the narrow critical pore dimension (Table S2). In the presence of steric effects, the xylene isomers exhibit varying degrees of disordered states in their 3-fold symmetry packing arrangements, with pX being more ordered, and increase the BIF-20 lattice symmetry. It is rare to obtain high quality adsorbate-loaded single crystal structures and determine the host-guest structures, particularly the location and orientation of dynamic guest molecules due to the disorder of guest molecules even at low temperatures. These results can complement existing computational modeling work to help advance the understanding of MOF-guest interactions and sorption mechanisms. Importantly, the work provides crystallographic insights to the location of guest binding sites within a locally flexible framework, facilitating the rational design and structural optimization of new materials with improved performance in gas separations. Future work in this area includes other mechanistic investigations through dynamic in situ SCXRD, to further understand the sorption and diffusion of xylene isomers.
