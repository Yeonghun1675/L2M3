Using UV light below 300 nm, only excited states of TbIII are populated, as Box does not possess so high energy levels. The excitation explores spin-forbidden interconfigurational 4f8 \u2192 4f75d1 transitions, which is proved by the characteristic broad bands at 275 and 295 nm in the excitation spectrum for the emission of 545 nm ( Figure S7). The UV light above 300 nm modifies the emission, as it results in the population of both excited states of TbIII and Box. The energy is most efficiently transferred to the T1 state of Box, giving dominated red emission. This is connected with the fast S1 \u2192 T1 ISC due to HAE, and with the relative position of T1 state, much lower than emissive 5D0 level of TbIII, excluding the possible ligand-to-metal energy transfer.
