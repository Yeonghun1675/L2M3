The framework consists of one 3D network containing a series of (4,4') nets. Ordered layers were observed along the c axis (c), while pores are found along the a axis (b). A solvent void-accessible volume of 17% was calculated using the SQUEEZE function in PLATON. This corresponds roughly to the mass loss below 123 \u00b0C in thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the framework, which is due to the liberation of MeOH from the pores (Supporting Information).\n\nThe [Zn(NPy3)(NO2)2\u22c5xMeOH\u22c5xDMF] n  framework retained fluorescence of the ligand (Supporting Information), which was not surprising because diamagnetic d 10 Zn2+ quenches fluorescence of the ligand. An emission peak at 570 nm was observed when the sample was irradiated at 400 nm with a relatively large Stokes shift of 170 nm, which was higher than that observed for the ligand (~50 nm).
