The distribution and accessibility of catalytic sites in Fe(III)PPIX-1 have been confirmed by synchrotron single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and this is the first report of single-crystal X-ray data for encapsulation of Fe(III)PPIX into a MOF. By contrast, Zn-HKUST-1 (2) shows poor substrate uptake, and Fe(III)PPIX-2 shows correspondingly poorer catalytic performance than Fe(III)PPIX-1. Furthermore, the observed aqueous instability of 2 reinforces its unsuitability as a peroxidation catalyst in this system. Inclusion of Fe(III)PPIX into 1 drastically increases both the initial rate of peroxidatic oxidation of ABTS compared to solid Fe(III)PPIX-Cl and dramatically increases the yield compared to both solid-state Fe(III)PPIX-Cl and solution-state Fe(III)PPIX.
