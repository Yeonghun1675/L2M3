In most cases no solid state structure of the corresponding lithium alkyl could be determined to confirm the absolute configuration of the stereogenic metalated carbon center. The stereochemical course of the reaction of our lithium alkyl with the electrophile methyl iodide in toluene can be understood on the basis of the solid state structure of compound (R,S)-2, which was crystallized from the same solvent used in the substitution reaction with the alkyl iodide, in combination with computational studies.
