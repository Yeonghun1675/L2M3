Various pyrazine- and BF4 --related structures show this trend most clearly. For instance, the 986 cm-1 pyrazine ring deformation mode (Figure e) and the 1420 cm-1 C-H in-plane bend (not shown) soften with decreasing temperature. At the same time, the position of the pyrazine-related out-of-plane C-H bend at 817 cm-1 (Figure c), the BF4 - F2 fundamental at 522 cm-1 (Figure a), and the related F2 + A1 combination mode at 1285 cm-1 (Figure i) are insensitive to temperature and do not show normal hardening behavior. Here and in Figure a,i, F2 refers to the spectroscopic notation, not the F2 molecule. Several of the aforementioned pyrazine and BF4 - modes in Cu(HF2)(pyz)2BF4 split as well (Figure c,e,i), indicating a reduction in the local site symmetry with decreasing temperature. Spectral signatures of the bifluoride ligand have been studied by several authors. The symmetric stretch resonates between 527 and 600 cm-1, depending on the chemical nature of the counterion. Further, it is Raman/infrared-active depending on the physical location of the H center with respect to the surrounding F centers. The fact that we do not see the bifluoride ion signature in our spectra between 527 and 600 cm-1 (Figure ) indicates that the HF2 - ligand is symmetric at all temperatures. The bending mode resonates between 1195 and 1233 cm-1, depending on the coordination environment. In Cu(HF2)(pyz)2BF4, the HF2 - bending mode (Figure g) appears as a broad shoulder at room temperature. It sharpens, splits slightly, and hardens by ~12 cm-1 at the base temperature. The asymmetric stretching mode of bifluoride, which has been observed between 1315 and 1730 cm-1, unfortunately overlaps with strong pyrazine ring modes in Cu(HF2)(pyz)2BF4, precluding analysis. Many other modes, including those at 135, 180, and 210 cm-1 (N-Cu-N) and 300 cm-1 (Cu-N stretching), also exhibit normal hardening behavior (Figure ). No distortion of the Cu coordination environment is observed with decreasing temperature.
