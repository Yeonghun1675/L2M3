This study hints the conversion of Fe-metallogel into Fe-MOFs mediated through formic acid/DMF oxidation. This route paves the way for an efficient synthesis and single crystal structure determination of most of the MOFs, in particular, Fe-based MOFs which are otherwise difficult to synthesize and demand high-resolution PXRD data for their structure determination through Rietveld refinement techniques.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 16, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Includes description of experimental details of\nFe-metallogels and MOFs, rheological studies, TGA, powder XRD profiles\nfor MOFs and reduced palladium residues, SEM images, EDAX reports,\nand crystallographic information for Fe-Pd-BTC-DEF and Fe-BTC-NMF.\nThis material is available free of charge via the Internet at <uri>http://pubs.acs.org</uri>.</p>", "clean_text": "Includes description of experimental details of Fe-metallogels and MOFs, rheological studies, TGA, powder XRD profiles for MOFs and reduced palladium residues, SEM images, EDAX reports, and crystallographic information for Fe-Pd-BTC-DEF and Fe-BTC-NMF.
