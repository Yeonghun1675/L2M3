Using acetonitrile as\nthe exchange solvent and with activation at 100 \u00b0C under dynamic\nvacuum overnight, CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption isotherms were carried\nout at 273, 298, and 308 K. These measurements, shown in , revealed a relatively\nhigh CO<sub>2</sub> capacity for <bold>2</bold> of 68 cc\u00ad(STP)/g at\n273 K and 1 atm, corresponding to approximately 12 wt % uptake. The\nisosteric heat of adsorption for CO<sub>2</sub> was calculated from\nthese data using a Virial equation (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b01713/suppl_file/ic6b01713_si_001.pdf\">Supporting Information</ext-link>) and revealed a zero-loading value of approximately\n\u221232 kJ mol<sup>\u20131</sup>, decreasing to approximately\n\u221228 kJ mol<sup>\u20131</sup> at higher loading. These values\nare consistent with a relatively strong physisorption interaction,\nfavored by the narrow channels in <bold>2</bold>. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were measured at both 77\nand 273 K in the pressure range 0\u20131 atm; only minimal uptake\nwas observed at either temperature. CO<sub>2</sub> is expected to\nbe favored as a probe gas in such situations due to its smaller kinetic\ndiameter compared to N<sub>2</sub>, as well as the much higher adsorption\nenthalpy for CO<sub>2</sub> dictating improved physisorption at higher\ntemperatures. Excellent adsorption selectivity for CO<sub>2</sub> over\nN<sub>2</sub> has been increasingly observed in ultramicroporous materials,\nwhich are now seen as a viable route toward various CO<sub>2</sub> separation technologies. Directly comparing\nthe adsorbed quantities of CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> from their\nsingle-component isotherms at 273 K shows a volumetric ratio of adsorbed\nCO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> which steadily decreases from a maximum\nof \u223c70 at 40 mbar flattening to a value of \u223c25 above\n0.5 bar ().</p><p>Given the good performance for CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption\ndisplayed\nby <bold>2</bold> in the pressure range 0\u20131 bar, high-pressure\nadsorption isotherms for CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub> were also measured, as shown in . The CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption isotherm\nat high pressure (273 K) shows saturation at approximately 13 bar\nwith a loading of 93 cc\u00ad(STP)/g, or 15 wt %.

Reaction of H  2  L with zinc acetate in DMSO gives a two-dimensional parallel interpenetrated polyrotaxane structure 1 in which the loops and rods are formed by the bent cis-(eq,ax) twist boat and trans-(ax,ax) twist chair conformers, respectively. By matching the distances between the solvated metal sites in the structure of 1, a related material 2 can be prepared incorporating the pillaring ligand trans-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene bpe. Compound 2 displays a similar polyrotaxane interpenetration mode, permitted by the presence of both cis and trans ligand conformers, but displays a three-dimensional 2.69 topology related to the dia diamondoid network. The guest exchange and gas adsorption properties of both materials were investigated; while compound 1 displays poor stability to guest exchange and negligible gas uptake, the higher connectivity microporous compound 2 shows facile guest exchange and a surprisingly high CO2 capacity of 12 wt % at 1 bar and 273 K, and a zero-loading enthalpy of adsorption of -32 kJ mol-1. High-pressure adsorption isotherms also show moderate physisorption of H2 and CH4 within the material.\n\nSimilar to 1, immersion of 2 in various solvents gave efficient exchange of the lattice DMSO and water molecules over 48 h, and thermogravimetric analysis showed that the exchange solvents were readily lost at low temperatures (Supporting Information). Using acetonitrile as the exchange solvent and with activation at 100 \u00b0C under dynamic vacuum overnight, CO2 adsorption isotherms were carried out at 273, 298, and 308 K. These measurements, shown in , revealed a relatively high CO2 capacity for 2 of 68 cc(STP)/g at 273 K and 1 atm, corresponding to approximately 12 wt % uptake. The isosteric heat of adsorption for CO2 was calculated from these data using a Virial equation (Supporting Information) and revealed a zero-loading value of approximately -32 kJ mol-1, decreasing to approximately -28 kJ mol-1 at higher loading. These values are consistent with a relatively strong physisorption interaction, favored by the narrow channels in 2. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were measured at both 77 and 273 K in the pressure range 0-1 atm; only minimal uptake was observed at either temperature. CO2 is expected to be favored as a probe gas in such situations due to its smaller kinetic diameter compared to N2, as well as the much higher adsorption enthalpy for CO2 dictating improved physisorption at higher temperatures. Excellent adsorption selectivity for CO2 over N2 has been increasingly observed in ultramicroporous materials, which are now seen as a viable route toward various CO2 separation technologies. Directly comparing the adsorbed quantities of CO2 and N2 from their single-component isotherms at 273 K shows a volumetric ratio of adsorbed CO2/N2 which steadily decreases from a maximum of ~70 at 40 mbar flattening to a value of ~25 above 0.5 bar ().\n\nGiven the good performance for CO2 adsorption displayed by 2 in the pressure range 0-1 bar, high-pressure adsorption isotherms for CO2, CH4, and H2 were also measured, as shown in . The CO2 adsorption isotherm at high pressure (273 K) shows saturation at approximately 13 bar with a loading of 93 cc(STP)/g, or 15 wt %. Adsorption of H2 at 77 K showed a maximum loading of 113 cc(STP)/g at 15 bar (1 wt %), while H2 adsorption at 258 K gave a considerably lower maximum loading of 10 cc(STP)/g at 30 atm (Supporting Information). CH4 adsorption carried out at 258 K revealed a maximum loading of 40 cc(STP)/g at 24 bar (approximately 2.5 wt %). Isosteric heat of adsorption calculations for CH4 were carried out using isotherms measured at 258 and 273 K, and revealed a modest zero-loading enthalpy of adsorption of -23 kJ mol-1, reducing to -18 kJ mol-1 at saturation. Each isotherm displayed a smooth desorption curve corresponding closely to the adsorption branch. Following the adsorption experiments, X-ray powder diffraction analysis of the material was carried out (Supporting Information), which showed the crystallinity of the framework was retained
