Compound 2 has a weight loss (ca. 7.7%) between 80 and 199.6 \u00b0C. This corresponds to losing two DMF molecules (5.05%); a rapid weight loss (ca. 49.02%) appeared between 227.1 and 394.6 \u00b0C, which is associated with the loss of one TBA and four triphenylphosphine ligands (44.62%). Compound 3 is stable before 100 \u00b0C; a weight loss of 9.4% is found between 100 and 230 \u00b0C, which is associated with the loss of five crystallized acetonitrile molecules and one coordinated acetonitrile molecule (7.37%); a rapid weight loss (37.1%) corresponds to the loss of six PPh3 (calc. 42.0%) between 230 and 333 \u00b0C. TGA analysis shows that compounds 2 and 3 (2D) are more stable than compound 1 (1D) with the increase of dimensionality.\n\nBecause of their insolubility in common solvent, solid-state luminescence of compounds 1-3 was performed at room temperature. For comparison, the luminescence of (TBA)3POM-1, (TBA)3POM-2, and CuP2, their parents, were investigated in acetonitrile solution at a concentration of 1.0 \u00d7 10-5 mol/L. (TBA)3POM-1 and (TBA)3POM-2 exhibit a weak emission (\u03bbmax = 331 nm) upon the excitation of 300 nm (Figure S22). CuP2 has a green emission (\u03bbmax = 508 nm) upon the excitation of 327 nm (a). The photoluminescence of compounds 1-3 (b-d) are different from that of (TBA)3POM-1 and (TBA)3POM-2, but similar to that of CuP2. They have a broad green emission with the maximum of 496 nm for compound 1 (\u03bbex = 327 nm), 537 nm for compound 2 (\u03bbex = 303 nm), and 530 nm for compound 3 (\u03bbex = 331 nm), respectively. They can be tentatively attributed to ILCT with metal perturbation owing to their similar emission to that of triphenylphosphine ligands. Compounds 1-3 are a class of potential green-emissive hybrid materials consisting of polyoxometalates coordinate polymers (PCPs).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "Compound 1", "symbol": "1", "chemical
