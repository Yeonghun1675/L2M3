As shown in a, the activated sample of NPC-7-Cu shows the typical type-I isotherm according to the IUPAC classification scheme, indicating the microporous nature of this MOF. The pore volume of NPC-7-Cu derived from saturated N2 adsorption is 0.317 cm3 g-1, which is agreeable with the theoretical pore volume of NPC-7-Zn (0.314 cm3 g-1 as calculated by the PLATON program). The agreement between experimental and theoretical pore volume confirms that NPC-7-Cu possesses an identical framework to that of NPC-7-Zn, validating the result of the PXRD pattern. The BET and Langmuir surface areas derived from the N2 isotherms for NPC-7-Cu are 730.6 and 886 m2 g-1, respectively (see calculation details in Figure S10-S12). To evaluate the mean pore size, we employed the Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) analysis based on the CO2 isotherm at 273.15 K, which has been proven as an effective way to determine the pore size distribution (PSD) of adsorbents with a narrow pore size, to calculate the PSD for NPC-7-Cu (see calculation procedures in Figure S13). As shown in b, NPC-7-Cu shows a mean pore width of 0.77 nm, which is consistent with crystallographic data. The significant enhancement in surface area of NPC-7-Cu over NPC-7-Zn is attributed to the improvement of network stability and the successful activation of pores in NPC-7-Cu. The higher stability of the Cu(II) MOF over its Zn(II) analogue is also observed on other analogous MOFs with different metal centers. It is agreeable with the stability sequence of the Irving-Williams series that the order Mn < Fe < Co < Ni ~ Zn < Cu has been found to hold for the stability of complexes irrespective of the nature of the coordinating ligand.
