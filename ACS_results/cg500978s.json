In particular, marked variations in CO2 adsorption enthalpy have been observed between first row transition metals. This material can be activated further by heating at 140 \u00b0C for 1 h, generating \u0394Co@1-Zn, which displays an even higher enthalpy of CO2 adsorption, yet with a lower total CO2 uptake and BET surface area of ~100 cm3/g (Figure a) and 689 m2/g (, Table S3.5), respectively. From the pore size distribution of \u0394Co@1-Zn (, Figure 3.3), a small increase in the size of the ~7 \u00c5 pore is observed compared to Co@1-Zn. However, PXRD patterns collected on samples of \u0394 Co/Zn indicated the material was amorphous; thus the increase in CO2 enthalpy cannot be assigned to a precise structural feature of the MOF.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 35, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig5\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>5</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption isotherms collected at 273 K.
