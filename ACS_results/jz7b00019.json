The corresponding solid-state absorption spectra are shown in . The absorption of phase \u03b1 is dominated by strong broad bands from 425 to 700 nm. In phase \u03b2 the overall absorption of these bands is lower by ~0.05 only; however, a clear division between two regions, of considerably increased (approximately doubled) absorbance below 500 nm, lower absorbance by ca. 23% from 500 to 600 nm, results in the color change of the sample. In phase \u03b3 the absorbance is reduced to below 0.1, with the bands between 490 and 580 nm being the highest mild absorption feature, consistently with the \u03b3-phase sample becoming practically colorless. It is characteristic of CoCl2bpp that both the absorbance magnitude and wavelengths of the absorbance bands hardly change within the phases, but the main hypochromic changes in their spectra occur at the transitions. Owing to this feature the CoCl2bpp crystal is an ideal indicator of the pressure values by the visual inspection, without sophisticated spectroscopic equipment. The CoCl2bpp crystal is also suitable for various types of optoelectronic sensors for indicating exact pressure values as well as for optical devices controlled by the pressure stimuli. It is important for such applications that CoCl2bpp is stable in open air and in many solvents, for example, alcohols, water, and oils.
