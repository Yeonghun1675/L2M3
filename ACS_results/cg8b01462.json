The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, calculated from CO2 sorption at 195 K, is 138 m2 g-1. PXRD measurements (Figure S4) reveal that 1 is a highly flexible coordination polymer because, even at room temperature, its peaks get shifted slightly toward higher 2\u03b8 angle, but at increasing temperatures, peaks shifting is more toward higher 2\u03b8 angle. It leads to the higher shrinkage in the polymer with respect to the increase in temperature. That is why, at room temperature, CO2 adsorption is only 11.4 cm3 g-1 due to contraction in the framework (Figure S6). Pore size distribution analysis shows (Figure S5) that pores have an average diameter of 1.8 nm with pore volume approximately ~0.10 cm3 g-1 due to shrinkage.

But noncovalent supramolecular interactions between the layers make this framework three-dimensional, generating porosity in one dimension. Flexibility arises due to the presence of two types of large linkers wherein some functional groups of the ligands are not coordinated with the metal ion. Desolvated polymer shows moderate CO2 uptake (65 cm3 g-1 at 195 K and 1 bar) at low temperature and pressure. Compound 1 acts as a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst toward the formation of cyclic carbonate through cycloaddition of CO2 as well as toward the synthesis of quinoline derivatives by the Friedla\u0308nder reaction. The presence of the free -COOH, -C\ue5fbO groups and uncoordinated -N atoms on the wall of the pores makes this framework an excellent candidate for the catalytic reactions without activation of the compound.\n\nThermal stability of the compound 1 has been checked by thermogravimetric analysis. The TGA curve (Figure S3) shows a weight loss of ~36.3% (calculated ~35%) corresponding to loss of all solvent molecules (water and DMF) from the cavities of the polymer between the temperatures 80-290 \u00b0C. The compound is stable up to 350 \u00b0C after that decomposition takes place.\n\nTo check the porosity of desolvated compound 1a, gas adsorption studies have been done at low pressure (1 bar) and low temperature for H2 and N2 (77 K) and for CO2 (195 K). The compound exhibits selectivity toward CO2 gas showing a type 1 adsorption isotherm revealing its microporous nature with saturation adsorption up to 65 cm3 g-1 with slight hysteresis at low temperature and pressure as shown in . The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, calculated from CO2 sorption at 195 K, is 138 m2 g-1. PXRD measurements (Figure S4) reveal that 1 is a highly flexible coordination polymer because, even at room temperature, its peaks get shifted slightly toward higher 2\u03b8 angle, but at increasing temperatures, peaks shifting is more toward higher 2\u03b8 angle. It leads to the higher shrinkage in the polymer with respect to the increase in temperature. That is why, at room temperature, CO2 adsorption is only 11.4 cm3 g-1 due to contraction in the framework (Figure S6). Pore size distribution analysis shows (Figure S5) that pores have an average diameter of 1.8 nm with pore volume approximately ~0.10 cm3 g-1 due to shrinkage. H2 gas is not adsorbed due to its nonpolar nature while framework has polarity due to the presence of free functional groups in both the linkers. N2 sorption does not take place at the surface of the flexible polymer due to the presence of 1D pores and large kinetic diameter of N2. While CO2 is a polar molecule and it needs a polar environment to get inside the structure due to having higher quadrupole moment. The presence of free -COOH, C\ue5fbO groups and uncoordinated benzimidazole N atoms provides polarity to the wall of the pore, facilitating CO2 gas adsorption.
