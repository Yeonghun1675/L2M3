First, a mixture of 3,5-dibromotoluene (200 mmol) and lithium ribbon (550 mmol) in diethyl ether was stirred at 0 \u00b0C under Ar for 2 h. Then, SiCl4 (39 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 6 h. The mixture was quenched by water (100 mL) at 0 \u00b0C. A yellow solid (E1) was obtained by filter, washed with water, and dried under a vacuum at 50 \u00b0C. Yield 62%. Second, 6.2 mmol of E1 was dissolved in 150 mL of glacial acetic acid/acetic anhydride/sulphuric (10:4:1 in volume). The reaction mixture was stirred for 12 h at 0 \u00b0C. The product was decomposed with water (200 mL) and filtered. The green solid was dissolved in aqueous NaOH, and the solution was acidified with 6 M aqueous HCl at 0 \u00b0C. The precipitate was collected, washed with water, and dried under a vacuum at 50 \u00b0C. Yield: 28%. 1H NMR (DMSO-d6): 8.25 (8H, s), 8.64 (4H, s), 13.49 (8H, s).

The connections between one L and eight paddlewheel [Cu2(O2CR)4] result in a cube-shaped building unit, which stacks over each other along the a-axis through sharing top and bottom faces to form a 1D square column. Each column is then linked with four neighboring ones via sharing common edges (i.e., [Cu2(O2CR)4] units) to generate a 3D framework. This leads to a highly open framework of 1. Viewing along the a-, b- and c-axes, there exist open channels of approximately 4.7 \u00d7 6.3, 4.7 \u00d7 6.3, and 7.2 \u00d7 7.2 \u00c52, respectively, in which disordered guest solvent molecules locate. PLATON calculations show that the guest accessible void (1248.7 \u00c53 per unit cell) comprises 44.8% of the unit cell volume. From the topological viewpoint, 1 can be considered as a (4,8)-connected  scu  net with a point symbol of {4462}2{416612} (Figure ). The paddlewheel [Cu2(O2CR)4] cluster and ligand L are considered as a 4-connected square planar and 8-connected cube node, respectively.\n\nThermal Properties\n\nTo investigate the thermal stability of compounds 1-3, the TG analyses were carried out (Figure ). Compound 1 displayed a weight loss of 18.57% at 25-150 \u00b0C, corresponding to a loss of water molecules (calcd 18.92%). PXRD studies showed the framework of 1 remained intact after removal of water molecules (). The weight losses from 250 to 400 \u00b0C likely contributed to the departure of the DMF molecules and the decomposition of the structure. Compounds 2 and 3 exhibited a similar TGA profile. The first weight loss occurred at 25-160 \u00b0C with weight losses of 6.59% for 2 (calcd 6.39%), and 9.34% (calcd 9.99%) for 3, respectively. The framework began to decompose with the slow release of guest molecules started from 160 to 400 \u00b0C, accompanied by the loss of the framework crystallinity. The abrupt weight loss at 400-500 \u00b0C could be attributed to the loss of the ligand.\n\nAdsorption Properties\n\nThe X-ray structure analyses showed that compounds 1-3 consist of solvent accessible voids of 44.8, 27.4, and 30.4% of their respective total crystal volume. We thus carried out gas adsorption measurements over three compounds. The samples were treated with supercritical carbon dioxide for four times in order to remove guest solvent molecules in the framework. The results showed that parts of guest solvent molecules in compound 1 were removed (), giving rise to permanent porosity, while compounds 2 and 3 were not stable after removal of guest molecules, which are consistent with the thermal stability studies. As shown in Figure , N2 adsorption isotherm at 77 K for 1 reveals a type-I behavior, indicating the microporous nature. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and the Langmuir surface areas were calculated from the N2 adsorption isotherm to be 875 and 1153 m2 g-1, respectively. The Horvath-Kawazoe (HK) model indicates a median pore diameter of 5.2 \u00c5 in compound 1, which is consistent with that calculated from the single crystal structure analysis. The O2 adsorption isotherm at 77 K for 1 is also of type I (). The maximum O2 uptake is higher than that of N2, which is within the expectation. The activated 1 exhibited reversible H2 adsorption with a type-I isotherm curve, indicating a strong affinity of H2 molecules toward pore surfaces. At 77 K and 760 Torr, the H2 uptake capacity reaches 211 cm3 g-1 (1.88 wt %), which is moderately high in comparison with other MOFs. \n\nTo examine the gas storage capacity and selective adsorption behaviors of 1, CO2 and CH4 adsorption measurements have been carried out at 273 K. As shown in Figure , compound 1 takes up large amounts of carbon dioxide (130 cm3 g-1, 5.80 mmol g-1), which are much higher than that of methane (21 cm3 g-1, 0.93 mmol g-1) at 273 K and 760 Torr. The adsorption for CO2 is higher than that for CH4, with a molar ratio for CO2/CH4 of 6.2, highlighting compound 1 is a potential material for selective separation of CO2/CH4. The selective adsorption of CO2 over CH4 may be a result of the kinetic diameter difference between the two gases (kinetic diameter: CO2, 3.3 \u00c5; CH4, 3.8 \u00c5). Moreover, the quadrupole moment of CO2 (-1.4 \u00d7 10-39 C m2) might induce stronger interactions with the porous framework than CH4.
