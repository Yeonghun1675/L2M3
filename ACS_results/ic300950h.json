The TGA curve (Figure S1, ) of <bold>1</bold> reveals a weight loss of 13.76%\nin the temperature range of 298\u2013371 K, which corresponds to\n loss of free H<sub>2</sub>O molecules (calcd 13.74%). Another weight\nloss (34.27%) in the temperature range of 371\u2013518 K is attributed\nto  release of the coordinated H<sub>2</sub>O and free DMF molecules\n(calcd 34.35%), and further weight losses were observed owing to \ndecomposition of the framework. Samples after solvent exchange and\nvacuum activation show similar weight loss curves (Figure S1, ), which indicated the\ngood stability of the framework after  removal of solvent molecules.\nThe similarity of simulated PXRD pattern from single-crystal data\nof <bold>1</bold> with that for as-synthesized sample <bold>1</bold> and for activated sample <bold>1a</bold> indicates that the single\ncrystal is representative of the bulk sample, and the activated sample\nretained the same structure as that of <bold>1</bold> (Figure ).

To the best of our knowledge, this CO<sub>2</sub> storage capacity at 195 K represents the third highest record so\nfar reported for MOFs under similar conditions, which is just lower\nthan that of Be-BDC (1600 mg g<sup>\u20131</sup>) and SNU-77H (1688 mg g<sup>\u20131</sup>) but greater than that of other reported MOFs such as SNU-6 (1138 mg g<sup>\u20131</sup>) and MCF-19 (1001 mg g<sup>\u20131</sup>).

As revealed by variable-temperature powder X-ray diffraction (VT-PXRD) measurements, N,N'-ditopic DABCO plays an important role for  stabilization of the Cu-L framework. The three-dimensional framework of 1 exhibits high stability and excellent adsorption capacity for H2 (54.3 mg g-1 at 77 K and 20 bar), CO2 (871 mg g-1 at 298 K and 20 bar), CH4 (116.7 mg g-1, 99 cm3 (STP) cm-3 at 298 K and 20 bar), and n-pentane (686 mg g-1 at 298 K and 1 bar). Interestingly, the excellent selectivity toward CO2 over N2 at ambient temperature (273 and 298 K) and 1 bar makes complex 1 possess practical application in gas separation and purification.\n\nRecently, Matzger and co-workers reported that a three-dimensional (3D) porous MOF, UMCM-151, was constructed by  connection of [Cu2(OCO)4] SBUs with [1,1':3',1\"-terphenyl]-4,4\",5'-tricarboxylate (L3-) ligand, which exhibits large channels but collapses after  solvent removal, and afterward a smart strategy was applied to stabilize the overall framework by the increase of the ratio of benzene rings to carboxylate groups. Herein we use DABCO to overcome the problem of low structural rigidity of the Cu-L framework, and a new complex [Cu3(L)2(DABCO)(H2O)]\u22c515H2O\u22c59DMF (1) was synthesized by  reaction of H3L, DABCO with copper(II) nitrate trihydrate under solvothermal conditions, which showed good stability up to 533 K after  removal of lattice solvent molecules. Complex 1 is a 3D noninterpenetrated porous framework. Interestingly, complex 1 showed very good adsorption capacity for H2 (54.3 mg g-1 at 77 K and 20 bar), CO2 (871 mg g-1 at 298 K and 20 bar), CH4 (116.7 mg g-1, 99 cm3 (STP) cm-3 at 298 K and 20 bar), and n-pentane (686 mg g-1 at 298 K and 1 bar). In addition, complex 1 exhibits excellent selectivity toward CO2 over N2 at ambient temperature.\n\nThe bulk identity and thermal stability of 1 were investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The TGA curve (Figure S1, ) of 1 reveals a weight loss of 13.76% in the temperature range of 298-371 K, which corresponds to  loss of free H2O molecules (calcd 13.74%). Another weight loss (34.27%) in the temperature range of 371-518 K is attributed to  release of the coordinated H2O and free DMF molecules (calcd 34.35%), and further weight losses were observed owing to  decomposition of the framework. Samples after solvent exchange and vacuum activation show similar weight loss curves (Figure S1, ), which indicated the good stability of the framework after  removal of solvent molecules. The similarity of simulated PXRD pattern from single-crystal data of 1 with that for as-synthesized sample 1 and for activated sample 1a indicates that the single crystal is representative of the bulk sample, and the activated sample retained the same structure as that of 1 (Figure ). The thermal stability of 1 has been demonstrated using variable-temperature PXRD (VT-PXRD) experiments (Figure ). The VT-PXRD patterns of as-synthesized sample show that the framework is stable at least up to 533 K, which is consistent with  thermogravimetric analysis. Furthermore, sample 1 is stable in open air even after months (Figure b). The PXRD pattern of sample 1, which was immersed in water overnight and dried at ambient temperature, showed  loss of crystallinity (Figure c). However, after further soaked in DMF overnight, the sample completely recovered its crystallinity (Figure d). The activated sample 1a shows the similar structural interconversion as complex 1 (Figure e-g), more importantly, the adsorption ability is almost the same before and after  reformation, as illustrated by CO2 sorption at 273 and 298 K and 1 bar (Figure S2, ).\n\nThe high porosity and thermal stability make 1a a good candidate for gas storage. To check the permanent porosity of 1a, N2 sorption isotherm at 77 K was measured, which showed type I adsorption behavior (Figure S3, ). On the basis of the N2 adsorption isotherm, the BET surface area of 1a is estimated to be 2703 m2 g-1 (Langmuir surface area 3154 m2 g-1, Figure S4, ), which is comparable to the values reported for other MOFs, such as MFU-4l (2750 m2 g-1), SNU-6 (2590 m2 g-1), and PCN-46 (2500 m2 g-1). The pore volume obtained from the sorption isotherm at P = 0.9 bar is 1.13 cm3 g-1, which is close to the value expected from the crystallographic data (1.18 cm3 g-1). The pore-size distributions derived from the N2 isotherms by the Horvath-Kawazoe (HK) method suggest that the average pore size for 1a is 16.6 \u00c5 in diameter, which is consistent with the value expected from the crystallographic data (ca. 17 \u00c5).\n\nThe H2 adsorption isotherms measured at 77 K show the high H2 uptake capability of la (Figure ). It adsorbs up to 20.9 mg g-1 of H2 (234 cm3 g-1 at standard temperature and pressure (STP), 10.44 H2 molecules per formula unit) at 77 K and 1.1 bar (Figure  inset). Values are comparable with those of previously reported Cu(II) MOFs that contain the accessible metal sites on Cu(II) paddle-wheels. The high-pressure H2 sorption study was performed using the gravimetric measurement method up to 20 bar. At 77 K, the excess and total gravimetric H2 uptakes of 1a reach 54.3 and 62.0 mg g-1, respectively, which are lower than those of two reported MOFs for H2 storage (NU-100, 99.5 and 164 mg g-1 at 56 bar; MOF-210, 86 and 176 mg g-1 at 80 bar) but comparable to those of PCN-46 (excess uptake, 56.1 mg g-1 at 32 bar), UMCM-1 (excess uptake, 57.5 mg g-1 at 45 bar), SNU-50' (excess uptake, 54.8 mg g-1 at 60 bar), and NOTT-103 (total uptake 65.1 mg g-1 at 20 bar). \n\nThe CO2 adsorption isotherm of 1a shows a CO2 uptake capacity of 1382 mg g-1 (704 cm3 g-1) at 195 K and 1 bar (Figure ). To the best of our knowledge, this CO2 storage capacity at 195 K represents the third highest record so far reported for MOFs under similar conditions, which is just lower than that of Be-BDC (1600 mg g-1) and SNU-77H (1688 mg g-1) but greater than that of other reported MOFs such as SNU-6 (1138 mg g-1) and MCF-19 (1001 mg g-1). Most interestingly, the CO2 uptake of 120 mg g-1 (61.1 cm3 g-1, 10.7 wt %) at 273 K and 63 mg g-1 (32.0 cm3 g-1, 5.9 wt %) at 298 K is comparable to that for reported MOFs under the same conditions, but almost no N2 adsorption (8 mg g-1, 6.1 cm3 g-1 at 273 K and 5 mg g-1, 3.8 cm3 g-1 at 298 K) was observed for 1a (Figure S2, ). The selectivity ratio of CO2 over N2 is 12:1 at 0.1 bar (a typical partial pressure of CO2 in industrial flue gas) and 10:1 at 1 bar. The isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption calculated  using the virial method is 19.5 kJ mol-1 at low coverage range (Figure S5, ). The value is higher than that for MOF-5 (15.6 kJ mol-1) and MOF-508b (14.9 kJ mol-1) but similar to that of UMCM-150 (20.6 kJ mol-1) and UMCM-150(N)2 (19.5 kJ mol-1) also with open metal sites. The high-pressure CO2 adsorption isotherms are shown in Figure . 1a adsorbs CO2 with an excess adsorption of 871 mg g-1 (19.8 mmol g-1) and a total uptake of 920 mg g-1 at 298 K (1063 mg g-1, 24.2 mmol g-1 and 1117 mg g-1 at 273 K) and 20 bar. In contrast to the reported MOFs with high CO2 capture (e.g., MOF-210, 54.5 mmol g-1 at 50 bar; MOF-200, 55.4 mmol g-1 at 50 bar; NU-100, 46.4 mmol g-1 at 40 bar), 1a still has relatively high uptake (PCN-46, 21.0 mmol g-1 at 30 bar; IRMOF-6, 19.5 mmol g-1 at 35 bar; IRMOF-3, 18.7 mmol g-1 at 35 bar).\n\nTo further monitor the general gas storage capacity and behavior of 1a, gravimetric CH4 adsorption isotherms were also recorded up to 20 bar at both 273 and 298 K (Figure ). Both isotherms show typical type I behavior and fast kinetics. Restricted by the maximum pressure of the instrument here, we are unable to measure the sample at a higher pressure range. At 20 bar, the unsaturated CH4 uptake of 1a reaches 169.3  and 116.7 mg g-1 at 273 and 298 K, respectively, corresponding to volumetric (v/v) uptakes of 143 and 99 cm3(STP) cm-3, which is comparable to other MOF materials in higher pressure at 298 K (PCN-68, 99 cm3(STP) cm-3 at 35 bar; NOTT-119a, 97.8 cm3(STP) cm-3 at 66 bar; DUT-13, 71 cm3(STP) cm-3 at 35 bar).\n\nTo gain insight into the adsorption capacity of 1a for n-pentane, which is toxic to the environment, the adsorption isotherm was also collected (Figure ). At 298 K and saturated vapor pressures, 1a can adsorb n-pentane with a value of 686 mg g-1 (213 cm3 g-1) of the maximum amount, which indicates the excellent n-pentane storage capacity and affinity.
