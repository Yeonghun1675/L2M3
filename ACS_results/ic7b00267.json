The Mn4Cu6 cluster is stabilized by four L ligands, six acetyl groups, and nine coordinated water molecules, while the numbers of the corresponding ligands in Cd4Cu6 cluster are seven, seven, and four, respectively. The coordination model of hydroxyl oxygen atoms in H3L is the same as that in compound 1. In addition, all of the six acetyl groups in the Mn4Cu6 cluster employ only one kind of syn-syn \u03b71:\u03b71:\u03bc2 coordination mode to link one Mn2+ ion and one Cu2+ ion or one Mn2+ ion and one symmetrically related Mn2+ ion of another Mn4Cu6 cluster, which is different from the two types of coordination modes in the Cd4Cu6 cluster. In Mn4Cu6, two crystallographically independent Mn2+ ions (Mn1, Mn2) adopt a slightly contorted octahedral geometry. Mn1 is surrounded by six O atoms of three different acetyl groups and three unique L ligands, while Mn2 is defined by three O atoms from three L ligands, two coordinated water molecules, and one O atom of an acetic group. The Mn-O bond distances fall in the range of 2.048(2)-2.300(1) \u00c5, which are comparable with those in reported Mn-based cluster-organic frameworks. BVS calculations indicated that the Cu and Mn atoms in the Mn4Cu6 cluster are all in the +2 oxidation state (Table S1 in the Supporting Information), which is further supported by an XPS spectrum (Figure S7 in the Supporting Information). Until now, a great number of supertetrahedral TM clusters have been reported, such as {Co10}, {Ni10}, {Cu10}, and {Rh4V6}; however, such a Mn-Cu heterometallic supertetrahedral cluster has yet not been reported, to the best of our knowledge.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 16, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig3\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Ball and\nstick representation of the coordination environment of the supertetrahedral\nMn<sub>4</sub>Cu<sub>6</sub> cluster in <bold>2</bold>.

In addition, the CO2 uptake capacity of 1 is superior to that of the analogous framework TFA-1a based on monometallic cluster SBUs, indicating that the search for heterometallic clusters as SBUs is a promising method in the exploration of functional materials with desired properties. Finally, this work also confirms the possibility of building a large class of functional materials by using a variety of heterometallic clusters such as 3d-4f clusters, 4d-4f clusters, and TM-substituted POM clusters as SBUs.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 24, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting\nInformation is available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at\nDOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b00267\">10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b00267</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Bond valence sum\ncalculations for <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>, additional structural\nfigures, PXRD patterns, XPS spectrum, and TGA curves for complexes <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b00267/suppl_file/ic7b00267_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Crystallographic data (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b00267/suppl_file/ic7b00267_si_002.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Crystallographic data (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b00267/suppl_file/ic7b00267_si_003.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b00267.

Thermogravimetric analysis (Figure S12 in the Supporting Information) and variable-temperature PXRD measurements (Figure S11) indicate that 1 and 2 are thermally stable up to about 240 and 200 \u00b0C. PLATON calculations show that 1 and 2 have respectively 49.7% and 59.6% potential solvent-accessible void volumes. Considering the good stability and porous characteristics of the frameworks, we thus investigated the gas adsorption properties of 1 and 2 on a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 surface-area and pore-size analyzer. As shown in , the N2 adsorption studies revealed that both 1 and 2 exhibit reversible type I isotherms, which testify to the retention of microporosity with saturated uptakes of 217.88 and 211.23 cm3 g-1 at 77 K for 1 and 2, respectively.

The pore distribution analyzed by a density functional theory (DFT) model suggests a narrow distribution of the micorpores with a diameter of about 7.33 \u00c5 (Figure S13). The CO2 and H2 uptake capacities of 1 and 2 were further investigated. 1 exhibits a significant uptake capacity for CO2 of 75.36 cm3 g-1 at 273 K and 760 mmHg, which is not only better than that of TAF-1a (35 cm3 g-1) but is also comparable to that of the well-known porous material ZIF-69 (70 cm3 g-1, Langmuir surface area 1070 m2 g-1) under similar conditions. For 2, the CO2 uptake capacities reached 48.90 cm3 g-1 at 273 K and 760 mmHg, which is smaller than that of 1. The H2 uptake capacities of 1 and 2 reached 124.0 and 108.16 cm3 g-1, respectively, at 77 K and 760 mmHg.

The experimental \u03c7m T values (\u03c7m is the molar magnetic susceptibility and T is the temperature) of 1 and 2 at 300 K are 1.35 and 15.62 cm3 K mol-l (), respectively, being smaller than the theoretical value (2.25 cm3 K mol-1 for 1 and 19.75 for 2 cm3 K mol-1) expected for six Cu2+ ions (g = 2, S = 1/2) in 1 and six Cu2+ ions (g = 2, S = 1/2) and four Mn2+ ions (g = 2, S = 5/2) in 2. As the temperature is decreased, the \u03c7m T value of 1 shows a sustained decline to the minimum value of 0.06 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K. For 2, the \u03c7m T value drops smoothly to 12.56 cm3 K mol-1 at 52 K, then decreases sharply to reach 6.12 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K. The above behaviors suggest the existence of dominant antiferromagnetic coupling within the cluster in 1 and 2. Additionally, the temperature dependence of the reciprocal susceptibility (1/\u03c7m) obeys the Curie-Weiss law above 50 K for 1 and 2 K for 2, respectively. The Weiss constants for 1 and 2 are -153.10 and -18.55 K, respectively, which further support the existence of antiferromagnetic coupling between the metal ions within the cluster.
