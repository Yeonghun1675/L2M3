Its use in boron-containing metal-organic frameworks (B-MOFs) has been demonstrated by the synthesis and isolation of a ZnIIB-MOF compound (B-MOF-1). The crystals of B-MOF-1 belong to the cubic space group F432 with 8-fold interpenetrated networks and ~21% void space. B-MOF-1 exhibits blue fluorescence and is capable of modest gas sorption of N2, argon, and CO2.\n\nLigand 1, a C 3-symmetric star-shaped molecule, was synthesized (Scheme ) by Suzuki coupling of tris(4-bromoduryl)borane (2) with excess boronic acid (3), yielding the triester (82% yield), followed by saponification with LiOH (89% yield). Free ligand 1 exhibits purple-blue fluorescence at 397 nm (\u03bbex = 330 nm, THF, 298 K, \u03a6 = 0.03), which is comparable to the monotopic carboxylate ligand that we previously reported. Crystals of 1 obtained from a toluene and methanol solution belong to the monoclinic space group P21/c. In the crystal lattice, molecules of 1 form an extended, interweaved 2D hydrogen-bonded network via the three carboxylic groups, as shown in Figure . Toluene solvent molecules are found within and between the 2D networks of 1 (see the , SI).\n\nDespite the high degree of interpenetration, the crystals of B-MOF-1 possess modest porosity as revealed by X-ray data (21% of void space; pore volume of 0.18 cm3 g-1 calculated from the crystal density 1.175 g cm-3 accounting for Zn1.5[L-1 -3](H2O)[(NH2Me2)NO3]. As shown in Figure , three different spherical void spaces of approximately 1.4, 0.7, and 0.2 nm in diameter are present in the crystal lattice. The porosity was further probed via gas physisorption analyses using both N2 and argon as the probe gases. The argon adsorption-desorption isotherms of B-MOF-1 are shown in Figure a as linear and semilogarithmic-scale plots. For comparison, the corresponding N2 adsorption data are presented in Figure S10 in the . In both cases, the isotherms are characteristic of a microporous material, with a type I isotherm, typical for most MOF materials. The physicochemical parameters derived from the inert gas adsorption analysis are compiled in Table S2 in the . The argon Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area and pore volume obtained for B-MOF-1 are 368 m2 g-1 and 0.19 cm3 g-1, respectively (ca. 406 m2 g-1 and 0.21 cm3 g-1 from the N2 sorption analysis), in good agreement with data from XRD analysis. Advanced pore-size analysis was performed by applying modern nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) method on the argon data assuming a cylindrical pore model for zeolitic/oxidic pores (see the ). The theoretical NLDFT isotherm fits the experimental data very well (see Figure S11 in the ). The data indicate that B-MOF-1 consists of mainly micropores of diameters approximately 1.2 nm and less.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "B-MOF-1", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "Zn1.5[L-1 -3](H2O)[(NH2Me2)NO3]"}, "crystal system": [{"value": "cubic", "condition": ""}, {"value": "monoclinic", "condition": ""}], "space group": [{"value": "F432", "condition": ""}, {"value": "P21/c", "condition": ""}], "porosity": [{"probe": "", "value": "21", "unit": "%", "condition": ""}, {"probe": "", "value": "0.18", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "condition": ""}], "surface area": [{"type": "Brunauer-Emmett-Teller", "probe": "argon", "value": "368", "unit": "m2 g-1", "condition": ""}, {"type": "Brunauer-Emmett-Teller", "probe": "N2", "value": "406", "unit": "m2 g-1", "condition": ""}], "pore volume": [{"probe": "argon", "value": "0.19", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "condition": ""}, {"probe": "N2", "value": "0.21", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "condition": ""}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "", "unit": "", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": "type I isotherm"}, {"adsorbate": "argon", "adsorbed amount": "", "unit": "", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": "type I isotherm"}], "peak spectrum": []}]]], "include_properties": ["crystal_system", "space_group", "porosity", "surface_area", "pore_volume", "gas_adsorption", "peak_spectrum"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['crystal_system', 'space_group', 'porosity', 'surface_area', 'pore_volume', 'gas_adsorption', 'peak_spectrum']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n  {\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"name\": \"B-MOF-1\",\n      \"symbol\": \"\",\n      \"chemical formula\": \"Zn1.5[L-1 -3](H2O)[(NH2Me2)NO3]\"\n    },\n    \"crystal system\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"cubic\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"value\": \"monoclinic\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"space group\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"F432\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"value\": \"P21/c\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"porosity\": [\n      {\n        \"probe\": \"\",\n        \"value\": \"21\",\n        \"unit\": \"%\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"probe\": \"\",\n        \"value\": \"0.18\",\n        \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"surface area\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"Brunauer-Emmett-Teller\",\n        \"probe\": \"argon\",\n        \"value\": \"368\",\n        \"unit\": \"m2 g-1\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"Brunauer-Emmett-Teller\",\n        \"probe\": \"N2\",\n        \"value\": \"406\",\n        \"unit\": \"m2 g-1\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"pore volume\": [\n      {\n        \"probe\": \"argon\",\n        \"value\": \"0.19\",\n        \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"probe\": \"N2\",\n        \"value\": \"0.21\",\n        \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"gas adsorption\": [\n      {\n        \"adsorbate\": \"N2\",\n        \"adsorbed amount\": \"\",\n        \"unit\": \"\",\n        \"temperature\": \"\",\n        \"pressure\": \"\",\n        \"condition\": \"type I isotherm\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"adsorbate\": \"argon\",\n        \"adsorbed amount\": \"\",\n        \"unit\": \"\",\n        \"temperature\": \"\",\n        \"pressure\": \"\",\n        \"condition\": \"type I isotherm\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"peak spectrum\": []\n  }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 5, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Synthetic Procedures of L-<bold>1</bold> and B-MOF-<bold>1</bold>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2012-020223_0005.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Synthetic Procedures of L-1 and B-MOF-1    ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 6, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Crystal structure of ligand <bold>1</bold> (H atoms removed\nfor\nclarity): (a) illustration of the hydrogen-bonded network and the\nlocations of toluene molecules (pink, boron;
