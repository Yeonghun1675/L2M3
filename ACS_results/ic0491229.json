While the macroscopic structural features of 2 are similar to those of 1, a closer inspection of the layer (Figure ) reveals a number of differences. There is one unique Ag ion in the structure, which is five-coordinate with a distorted square pyramidal geometry. This is in contrast to the six-coordinate center in 1 illustrating the adaptability of the d10 metal center. The distances from Ag1 to the five sulfonate oxygen atoms range from 2.467(9) to 2.855(4) \u00c5. The bridging mode of the    sulfonate group in 2 is \u03bc5 (\u03ba1O1, \u03ba3O2, \u03ba1O3).

The S1-O2 bond is elongated reflecting a resonance form with more single bond character between S1 and O2 (S1-O2 = 1.55(1) \u00c5), and double bond character for O1 and O3 (S1-O1 = 1.462(9) \u00c5, S1-O3 = 1.468(9) \u00c5).

Within a layer, between AgSO3 columns, the orientation of the pyrene units alternates by  ~74.5\u00b0 (Figure ). There is only one type of Ag center present in the structure. It is five-coordinate with an irregular coordination geometry composed of three sulfonate oxygen atoms and the two olefinic carbons. The three bonds to the oxygen atoms are situated close to 90\u00b0 apart while the \u03b72 \u03c0 interaction completes the coordination sphere. There is only one type of sulfonate group present in the structure which bridges three Ag centers in a \u03ba1O, \u03ba2O coordination mode (Ag1-O1 = 2.378(3) \u00c5, Ag1-O2 = 2.298(3) \u00c5, Ag1-O1 = 2.507(2) \u00c5). The noncoordinating oxygen atom has a slightly shorter S-O bond length (1.435(2) \u00c5) relative to the two coordinating O atoms (1.467-1.468(2) \u00c5) indicative of more double bond character. The \u03c0 interactions between the pyrene ring and the Ag center are on the shorter end of the typical range (Ag1-C5 = 2.378(2) \u00c5, Ag1-C6 = 2.426(3) \u00c5). Face-to face \u03c0 interactions further stabilize the framework. Within a layer, along the b-axis, each pyrene ring forms \u03c0-stacking interactions with neighboring pyrene units to both sides. These interactions are of an offset face-to-face nature and involve all four rings of the pyrene unit, two being involved to form the \u03c0 interaction to each side (perpendicular distance = 3.41 \u00c5). Between layers, only van der Waals contacts exist.

A two-component approach to functional solids incorporating \u03c0-stacked arene arrays offers potential advantages, with respect to ordering and ultimately design, over more typically employed three component systems.

Yield 93 mg, 100%. \n\n Preparation of Silver(I) 1-Pyrenesulfonate, AgL4, 4. 1-Pyrenesulfonic acid (0.77 g, 2.72 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL of MeCN; Ag2CO3 (0.37 g, 1.36 mmol, 0.5 equiv) was then added, generating a green suspension. The reaction mixture was sonicated at room temperature until the green turbidity disappeared and the evolution of CO2 ceased. The solution was filtered and the solvent removed under reduced pressure to yield a crude white solid that was redissolved in MeOH (15 mL) and filtered again. The pure complex was obtained via precipitation from this solution upon addition of an equal volume of Et2O and cooling to 4 \u00b0C. Single crystals of this network were obtained by vapor diffusion of i-Pr2O into a saturated MeOH solution of the product.
