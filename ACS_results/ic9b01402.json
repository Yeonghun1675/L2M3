It takes up to 99 cm3 g-1 of N2 at 77 K under 1 bar of pressure showing a BET surface area of 253 m2g-1 (Figure S6, Supporting Information). The BET surface area was also calculated to be 238 m2 g-1 from CO2 sorption measurement at 195 K (Figure S7, Supporting Information). Horvath-Kawazoe (HK) differential pore volume vs pore width plot obtained from 195 K CO2 sorption analysis reveals that this MOF contains pores in the range of 3.47-5.12 \u00c5 with median pore width of 3.77 \u00c5, which is fairly consistent with the single crystal structural analysis (Figure S8, Supporting Information).\n\nSingle-component gas sorption isotherms of CO2, CH4, and N2 performed at 273 and 295 K are presented in . Under 1 bar, CO2 uptake capacity at 273 and 295 K is 75.10 cm3 g-1 (3.35 mmol g-1) and 60.50 cm3 g-1 (2.70 mmol g-1), respectively. Most importantly, it shows remarkably high uptake of CO2 at 0.15 bar, similar to the CO2 partial pressure in flue gas mixtures (1.77 mmol g-1 at 273 K, 1.10 mmol g-1 at 295 K) and at 0.5 bar, similar to the CO2 partial pressure in landfill gas mixtures (2.81 mmol g-1 at 273 K, 2.06 mmol g-1 at 295 K) indicating IITKGP-11 as an efficient material for mixed gas adsorption-based separation studies. On the contrary, it (under 1 bar) takes up a comparatively lesser amount of CH4, 34.20 cm3 g-1 (1.53 mmol g-1) at 273 K and 23.10 cm3 g-1 (1.03 mmol g-1) at 295 K, and N2, 9.80 cm3 g-1 (0.44 mmol g-1) at 273 K and 4.50 cm3 g-1 (0.20 mmol g-1) at 295 K. Hydrogen uptake was found to be 75 cm3 g-1 (0.67 wt %) from the sorption isotherm at 77 K under 1 bar (Figure S9, Supporting Information).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "IITKGP-11", "symbol": "",
