Its maximal uptake level is 14 wt %, whereas the uptake of p-xylene does not exceed 12.2 wt %. After initially decreasing by a small amount, the separation factor tends to remain fairly constant at approximately 1.2, making MIL-53(Fe) one of the first reported MOF structures that has a preference for the meta-isomer. This once more illustrates that small alterations in a MOFs framework, in this case the use of Fe3+ instead of Al3+, can strongly influence the adsorption and separation of organic compounds.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 34, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig11\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>11</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Breakthrough experiments with binary 0.005 M (left) and\n0.05 M\n(right) solutions of C8 alkylaromatic compounds in heptane at 323\nK: (a) effuent concentrations C of <italic toggle=\"yes\">p</italic>-xylene and <italic toggle=\"yes\">o</italic>-xylene as a function of eluted volume (1 mL\u00b7min<sup>\u20131</sup>) and (b) effuent concentrations C of <italic toggle=\"yes\">p</italic>-xylene and <italic toggle=\"yes\">m</italic>-xylene as a function of eluted volume\n(1 mL\u00b7min<sup>\u20131</sup>).</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr11\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cm-2012-01242d_0003.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 11  Breakthrough experiments with binary 0.005 M (left) and 0.05 M (right) solutions of C8 alkylaromatic compounds in heptane at 323 K: (a) effuent concentrations C of p-xylene and o-xylene as a function of eluted volume (1 mL\u22c5min-1) and (b) effuent concentrations C of p-xylene and m-xylene as a function of eluted volume (1 mL\u22c5min-1).
