The closest contact between the benzonitrile and adjacent MOF structure (\u03b4) is 2.81 \u00c5, a relatively short anion-\u03c0 contact. The similarity between the distances described above highlights how the bromide resides in a \"pocket\" within the MOF structure between Mn(I) cations (Mn-Br distances: 6.15 and 6.93 \u00c5 in 1\u22c5[Mn(CO)3(H2O)]Br) and interacts with the backbone of the MOF structure. In 1\u22c5[Mn(CO)3(H2O)]Br the presence of a polar solvent likely stabilizes this charged cation, while in 1\u22c5[Mn(CO)3(PhCN)]Br the presence of a strong ligand (PhCN) promotes the retention of a charged motif.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 19, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>In conclusion, we have shown\nthat the chemistry of a Mn\u00ad(CO)<sub>3</sub>Br species that has been\npostsynthetically incorporated into\nMOF <bold>1</bold> is notably different from the behavior of the discrete\nmolecular analogue [Mn\u00ad(CO)<sub>3</sub>Br\u00ad(bpzm)] in the solid state.\nFor the MOF-tethered complex, changing the MOF pore contents by solvent\nexchange enables modification of the primary coordination sphere of\nthe Mn\u00ad(CO)<sub>3</sub>Br species.
