A crystallographic study of {NH(prol)3}[MnCr(ox)3]\u22c52H2O reveals a structure based on the oxalate-bridged bimetallic layers intercalated by NH(prol)3 + cations. The NH(prol)3 + ions assume a tripodal configuration and interact with the bimetallic layer through hydrogen bonding. One water molecule exists in each honeycomb cavity, deviating by 1.14 \u00c5 from the Cr3Mn3 least-squares plane, and is statistically hydrogen bonded to three hydroxyl oxygen atoms from separate NH(prol)3 + ions. The layer-cation interaction gives rise to a short interlayer separation of 7.90 \u00c5 and the unsymmetrical faces to the bimetallic layer. Cryomagnetic studies demonstrate ferromagnetic ordering, with T C of 5.5 K for the MnCr complex, 9.5 K for the FeCr complex, and 10.0 K for the CoCr complex. It is found that the interlayer magnetic interaction is negligibly weak despite the short interlayer separation. In all of the complexes, a slow saturation in magnetization is observed, which is explained in terms of the spin canting between the MII and CrIII ions.
