For all of the molecular structures, of course, the helical orientation of the 2D ensembles was preserved both before and after the SCSC guest exchange. However, the interlayer interactions (2.9-3.6 \u00c5) and the sliding distances (1.0-2.9 \u00c5) of the layers were dependent on the shape and size of guest molecules; thus, both the structure and the position of the guest molecules determined the channel patterns, as shown in . The channel entrance's diameters were in the range of (2.0-4.7) \u00d7 (5.0-7.3) \u00c52; that is, the channel behaves like a large intestine. Thus, general liquid compounds from n-propanol to n-dodecane and from cyclopentane to 1,5-cyclooctadiene, irrespective of functional groups, were smoothly exchanged into the channel instead of the original solvate molecules. The significant feature is that all of the SCSC exchanged guest molecules within the channel were successfully refined, thereby clearly displaying the structures of the various liquid chemicals irrespective of bulkiness, chain length, and functional groups. Long chains such as 1-octanol, n-decane, 1-bromodecane, and n-dodecane were smoothly exchanged into the channel and positioned therein cross-wise.
