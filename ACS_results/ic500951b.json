Using the well-established Williamson ether synthesis, gram quantities of ligand L1 were readily obtained (Scheme ). Consistent with our earlier findings, L1 produces the desired cross-linked IRMOF as transparent blocks (IRMOF-1-L1) under standard solvothermal procedures for an IRMOF material. Extrapolation from a prior computational analysis suggested that this short tether must force the bdc monomers into an adjacent, orthogonal conformation (isomer 1, ) based on length and geometric requirements. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) of IRMOF-1-L1 matches that of IRMOF-1 (Figure ), and the connectivity and topology was unambiguously confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD, ). As expected, the alkyl linker was disordered and could not be located but was determined to be present and intact by 1H NMR and mass spectral analysis of acid digested IRMOF-1-L1 (). After extensive rinsing with CHCl3 and heating to 150 \u00b0C under a vacuum, significant amounts of DMF remained trapped in IRMOF-1-L1, similar to that observed with other cross-linked MOFs. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows a ~5% weight loss at just under 200 \u00b0C, indicative of trapped solvent (Figure ), followed by decomposition of the framework at ~380 \u00b0C, which is typical for IRMOFs. Activated IRMOF-1-L1 gave a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of 1711 m2/g and 1450 m2/g when activated at 150 and 105 \u00b0C, respectfully, consistent with greater solvent trapping at lower temperature. In contrast, typical, unlinked IRMOFs will release all solvent guests under the aforementioned activation conditions. The trapped solvent in this MOF is a characteristic we have observed with other cross-linked MOFs and may prove to be a means to modulate guest sorption properties.\n\nIRMOF-1-L3 gave a BET surface area of 1619 m2/g after activation at 105 \u00b0C under vacuum. The 1H NMR spectra of digested samples of IRMOF-1-L3 showed a significant amount of DMF was trapped in the material under these activation conditions (). However, the DMF could be removed by heating the material at 150 \u00b0C overnight (under a vacuum) giving a BET value of 2121 \u00b1 54 m2/g (Figure ).

Activation at either temperature results in a steep 10% weight loss at 350 \u00b0C followed by framework degradation at 360 \u00b0C (). We attribute the 10% weight loss at 350 \u00b0C to degradation of the m-xylene linker unit.
