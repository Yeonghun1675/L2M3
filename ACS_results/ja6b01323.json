The CH<sub>4</sub> uptake of MFM-300\u00ad(In)\nat 35 bar and 298 K is one of the highest values reported for a MOF\nto date, surpassed only by MOF-74\u00ad(Ni, Co) and HKUST-1 (). The isosteric heat of adsorption of CH<sub>4</sub> was estimated using the van\u2019t Hoff isochore to be\n16 kJ mol<sup>\u20131</sup>, which gradually rises to 20 kJ mol<sup>\u20131</sup> with increasing CH<sub>4</sub> loading (), comparable to\nthat of other MOFs with similar uptake capacities (12\u201321 kJ\nmol<sup>\u20131</sup>). The steady increase\nin the heat of adsorption reflects the presence of intermolecular\ninteractions between adsorbed CH<sub>4</sub> molecules within the\npores.</p>", "clean_text": "Results and Discussion\n\nSynthesis and Crystal Structure Analysis\n\nThe solvated framework complex [In2(OH)2(C16H6O8)]\u22c51.28H2O\u22c52.87(DMF) [MFM-300(In)-solvate] was prepared via solvothermal reaction of H4L (H4L = biphenyl-3,3',5,5'-tetracarboxylic acid) and In(NO3)3\u22c55H2O in a 2:1 ratio mixture of dimethylformamide (DMF) and acetonitrile and was isolated as a microcrystalline powder. Structure solution by synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction confirmed that this material crystallizes in the tetragonal space group I4122, and is isostructural to the related MFM-300(Al). We note that this MOF has been previously reported in a different preparation, which yields large single crystals. In our hands, these two forms of MFM-300(In) are equivalent despite the difference in morphology. MFM-300(In) exhibits an open structure comprising chains of [InO4(OH)2] moieties bridged by tetracarboxylate ligands L4- to afford a porous structure with channels formed by corner-sharing [InO4(OH)2] octahedra linked via two mutually cis-\u03bc2-OH groups. The [InO4(OH)2]\u221e chain in MFM-300(In) is similar to that found in MIL-53(In), although the latter features trans-\u03bc2-OH groups, resulting in pronounced framework flexibility. The cis-\u03bc2-OH groups in MFM-300(In) tie the framework into a rigid \"wine-rack\" arrangement. Desolvated MFM-300(In) displays a surface area of 1071 m2 g-1 and a total pore volume of 0.419 cc g-1 as determined from the N2 isotherm at 77 K. These values are consistent with the porosity derived from the single-crystal structure, and confirm the complete activation and phase purity of the material.\n\nCH4 adsorption in MFM-300(In) shows a maximum uptake of 328 v/v at 110 K and 0.6 bar, dropping gradually with increasing temperature, with uptakes at 20 bar of 266, 224, and 198 v/v at 195, 245, and 273 K, respectively. High pressure CH4 adsorption isotherms revealed uptake capacities of 220 and 202 v/v at 273 and 298 K, respectively, at 35 bar, rising to 228 and 213 v/v, respectively, at 50 bar. Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations show excellent agreement with these experimental data (b). The CH4 uptake of MFM-300(In) at 35 bar and 298 K is one of the highest values reported for a MOF to date, surpassed only by MOF-74(Ni, Co) and HKUST-1 (). The isosteric heat of adsorption of CH4 was estimated using the van't Hoff isochore to be 16 kJ mol-1, which gradually rises to 20 kJ mol-1 with increasing CH4 loading (), comparable to that of other MOFs with similar uptake capacities (12-21 kJ mol-1). The steady increase in the heat of adsorption reflects the presence of intermolecular interactions between adsorbed CH4 molecules within the pores.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name":
