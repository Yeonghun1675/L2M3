In our previous research, a good linear relationship between the IP of the guests and the emission maxima was observed based on their CT based emission mechanism, which could facilitate the targeted emission modulation of the system. In contrast, although the emission maximum decreases along with the increasing guests' IP in this work, the linear fitting results in an adj. r-square value of 93.52%. In consideration of the unambiguous emission mechanism based on the components and structures of the compounds, this unexpected result indicates new factors that affect their emission properties. First, a careful analysis of the structures about the subtle differences of the tpt conformations as an adaption to the coordination assembly was carried out. As shown in Figure S5, the tpt ligands reveal distinct conformations in three compounds with different torsion angles between the central trizine ring and the pyridine rings attached. For 1, the tpt ligands show two nearly complanate conformations with maximum torsion angles of 6.2\u00b0 and 6.4\u00b0 (Figure S5a,b). For 2, the minimum/maximum torsion angles of the two types of tpt ligands are 4.9/7.3\u00b0 and 5.4/24.1 (27.9)\u00b0, respectively (Figure S5c,d). The minimum/maximum torsion angles in 3 reach 3.6/20.1\u00b0 and 3.7/20.9\u00b0, respectively (Figure S5e,f). Since the CT based emissions of the compounds mainly originate from the electron transfer between the HOMO of guest (refer to the IP) and the LUMO of tpt, the different LUMO energy levels of tpt owing to their different conformations may affect the energy gap that determines the emission wavelength of the compounds. In consideration of this, theoretical calculation about the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of the tpt ligands was executed, and the result reveals that the tpt ligands with different torsion angles show almost negligible influence on their LUMO energy level, which indicates this is not the main factor (Figure S5).
