It has been disclosed that lanthandie triflates can efficiently catalyze the Biginelli reaction under mild conditions. Recently, Bao et al. reported that a coordination polymer, Gd-notp (notpH6 = 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triyl-tris(methylenephosphonic acid)), is also an effective catalyst for the Biginelli reaction. Therefore, we explored the Biginelli reaction using [Gd(H2O)(C2O4)0.5(HPO3)]\u22c5H2O (5) as a catalyst. A mixture of benzaldehyde (0.5 mmol), ethyl acetoacetate (0.5 mmol), urea (0.6 mmol), compound 5 (0.05 mmol), and methanol (2 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 1-3 d, then water (5 mL) was added, and the product was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 \u00d7 5 mL). The organic layer was dried with anhydrous MgSO4 and evaporated, and then the residue was purified by prepared TLC (ether/ethyl acetate = 3:1) to afford 5-ethoxycarbonyl-6-methyl-4-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-pyrimidin-2(1H)-one. The isolated yields for stirring for 1, 2, and 3 d are 26% (34 mg), 47% (61 mg), and 52% (68 mg), respectively. The cyclocondensation reaction product was not obtained in the absence of 5. The isolated yields are lower than those when lanthanide triflates are used as catalysts (>80%) and are comparable to that when the Gd-notp compound was used (60%).
