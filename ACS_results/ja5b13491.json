Now the power of heterometallic MOFs is in full display, as shown by a series of new materials (denoted CPM-200s) with superior CO2 uptake capacity (up to 207.6 cm3/g at 273 K and 1 bar), close to the all-time record set by MOF-74-Mg. The isosteric heat of adsorption can also be tuned from -16.4 kJ/mol for CPM-200-Sc/Mg to -79.6 kJ/mol for CPM-200-V/Mg. The latter value is the highest reported for MOFs with Lewis acid sites. Some members of the CPM-200s family consist of combinations of metal ions (e.g., Mg/Ga, Mg/Fe, Mg/V, Mg/Sc) that have never been shown to coexist in any known crystalline porous materials. Such previously unseen combinations become reality through a cooperative crystallization process, which leads to the most intimate form of integration between even highly dissimilar metals, such as Mg2+ and V3+. The synergistic effects of heterometals bestow CPM-200s with the highest CO2 uptake capacity among known heterometallic MOFs and place them in striking distance of the all-time CO2 uptake record.\n\nMetal-organic framework (MOF) materials are predominantly based on transition metals, and there are comparatively much fewer MOFs based on main-group elements. Despite such great disparity statistically favoring transition-metal MOFs, it is the magnesium form of MOF-74 (MOF-74-Mg) that exhibits the highest CO2 uptake capacity (228 cm3/g at 273 K, 180 cm3/g at 298 K and 1 atm), outshining its transition metal analogues such as MOF-74-Co and MOF-74-Ni and highlighting the unique significance of main-group metals in the design of high-performance gas sorption materials.\n\nTo probe the effect of metal types on gas sorption properties, all as-synthesized CPM-200 samples were activated by immersion in CH3OH for 3 days, followed by evacuation at 80 \u00b0C for 12 h. The high framework stability was evident, as shown by the TGA results (Figure S4) and PXRD patterns (Figure S3). The N2 sorption isotherms of activated CPM-200s at 77 K all exhibit typical type I behavior ( and S7-S17). Their Langmuir and BET surface areas vary from 1216 to 2024 and 877 to 1459 cm3/g, respectively. In comparison, CPM-200-In with the cationic framework has Langmuir and BET surface areas of 1244 and 888 cm3/g, respectively.\n\nThe sorption properties of three fuel molecules (i.e., H2, C2H2, and CH4) were also studied. At 77 K and 1 bar, CPM-200-Fe/Mg and -In/Mg both adsorb 2.8 wt% H2 (), while values for other CPM-200s range from 1.6 to 2.2 wt% H2 (Table S4). At 1 bar, the uptake capacity of CPM-200-Fe/Mg for C2H2 and CH4 reaches 217.2 and 39.5 cm3/g, respectively, at 273 K and 160.8 and 23.5 cm3/g at 298 K.
