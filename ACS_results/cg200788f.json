A mixture of crystalline products was obtained upon cooling the reaction: thin black needles (8), orange plates (9), and brown cubes (10). Because of the extremely small size of the black needles, X-ray diffraction of 8 was performed using synchrotron radiation. The solid-state structure of 8 shows two ligands 3 chelating one copper atom; the pseudotetrahedral geometry at the metal center suggests that it is in the +1 oxidation state (Figure a). The charge balance of the structure is also consistent with a CuI species: the +1 charge on the chelated metal is balanced by one [CuCl2]- counterion in its vicinity. Under the reaction conditions (high temperature and high pressure), the CuII ions are most likely reduced to CuI by methanol, the N-heterocyclic compounds, or free cyanides from dissociation of [Fe(CN)6]3- (or a combination of these species) acting as the reducing agent. Although somewhat unusual, the anion [CuCl2]- has nonetheless been observed and characterized crystallographically several times. Figures b and c show the extended structure of 8. The copper atoms assemble into columns along the b axis, with some interdigitation of the triptycenes along the c axis. Two types of stacking arrangement are observed for ligand 3: one with no significant overlap along the stacks, and one with some amount of overlap between the phenanthrolines, although there is a slight deviation from coplanarity (Figure b). The distance between the ligand dppz moieties in the overlapping stacks is approximately 3.2 \u00c5, which suggests \u03c0 stacking. The presence of the triptycenes and the constraints imposed by the tetrahedral metal center hinder packing, resulting in void channels running along the direction of the b axis (Figure b). The voids are partially filled by the [CuCl2]- counterions, and a single peak of electronic density that was satisfactorily modeled as an oxygen atom was also detected in the asymmetric unit (not shown in Figure ).
