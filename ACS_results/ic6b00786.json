Compounds 1-Cu, 1'-Zn, and 2-Cu show a fair plateau before 240 \u00b0C. Above 250 \u00b0C, a weight loss in the temperature range of 250-300 \u00b0C for 1-Cu and 2-Cu and 250-380 \u00b0C for 1'-Zn may be assigned to the loss of coordination water (for 2-Cu) and partial decomposition of carboxylate groups in the bpdc ligand (for 1-Cu, 1'-Zn, and 2-Cu). This is followed by a sharp weight decrease (from 320 to 480 \u00b0C for 1-Cu and 2-Cu, from 380 to 550 \u00b0C for 1'-Zn) corresponding the fully thermolysis of bpdc ligand. For compound 3-Zn, two small fractions of weight loss which are attributed to the loss of three coordination waters (observed: 4.4%, calculated: 4.7%) can be observed in the range of 150-220 \u00b0C and 250-310 \u00b0C, respectively. The decomposition of bpdc ligand was observed in the range of 370-560 \u00b0C. The following weight loss above 600 \u00b0C could be attributed to the release of SO2 due to the decomposition of SO4 2- groups. The expected remaining weight losses observed in these four compounds are close to the calculated values (based on the stoichiometric chemical formula by treating Cu to CuO, Zn to ZnO, and U to 1/3(U3O8)). The remaining weight value of these compounds were 39.0% for 1-Cu (calculated: 44.0%), 45.2% for 1'-Zn (calculated: 44.1%), 43.0% for 2-Cu (calculated: 41.2%), and 53.7% for 3-Zn (calculated: 51.8%),
