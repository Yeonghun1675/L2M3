The weak binding between 1-2 and Hg2+ or Pb2+ ions is further verified in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Two new peaks appear at 99.1 and 103.1 eV in 1 after addition of Hg2+, which belong to the Hg 4f peak, indicating that there are weak interactions between 1 and Hg2+ (). After addition of Hg2+, the N 1s peak in 1 is shifted from 396.8 to 397.7 eV, while the O 1s peak at 528.6 eV has no obvious change. The similar changes can also be seen in 1 after addition of Pb2+, showing the weak interactions between only N atoms and Hg2+ or Pb2+. Compared with 1, the O 1s peak is also shifted from 529.6 to 530.6/530.3 eV in 2 after addition of Hg2+/Pb2+, respectively. It shows that both nitrogen atoms from amino groups and oxygen atoms from phenolic hydroxyl groups in 2 have weak interactions with metal ions (Hg2+ or Pb2+). 2 has higher selectivity for Hg2+ and Pb2+ because of the more weak interactions with Hg2+ or Pb2+. Although 3 has amino and nitro groups, there is no obvious photoluminescent change by Hg2+ and Pb2+, because its porosity is too small to form weak interactions with metal ions. As reported, stereochemically active lone pairs and the ns2np0 configuration of Pb2+ usually cause substantial luminescent processes including metal centers to increase the photoluminescence intensity. Hence, the photoluminescence intensities of 1-2 increase after addition of Pb2+.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 23, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig6\" position=\"float\">\n<label>6</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) N 1s, (b) O 1s XPS peaks of <bold>1</bold> before and after immersed in Hg<sup>2+</sup> or Pb<sup>2+</sup>.\n(c) N 1s, (d) O 1s XPS peaks of <bold>2</bold> before and after immersed\nin Hg<sup>2+</sup> or Pb<sup>2+</sup>.

The sorption measurements were carried out on the activated samples, using N2, CO2, and CH4 as the adsorptive gases. The adsorption amount of N2 is 59.7, 45.8, and 31.0 cm3/g for 1-3 at 77 K and 1 atm, respectively (a). They all exhibit type IV sorption profiles, showing that only surface adsorption occurs. The CO2 sorption isotherms of 1-3 were measured at 273 K (b). The gas sorption isotherms show the CO2 uptake of 102.1 cm3/g (4.56 mmol/g, 20.1 wt %) for 1, 110.4 cm3/g (4.93 mmol/g, 21.7 wt %) for 2, and 41.9 cm3/g (1.87 mmol/g, 8.23 wt %) for 3 at 273 K and 1.05 atm (800 Torr). There are a few MOFs exhibiting CO2 uptakes of more than 20 wt % under ambient conditions. Although the porosity of 2 is lower than that of 1, the CO2 sorption amount of 2 is higher. This may be attributed to the phenolic hydroxyl groups from the H2HIPA ligand, which can be considered as hydrogen-bonding donors benefiting CO2 sorption. The CO2 sorption amount of 3 is the lowest in them, which may be due to the smallest accessible volumes and the influence of nitro groups from the H2NIPA ligand. As shown in Figure S8, the sorption amount of CH4 is negligible compared with CO2, 22.61 cm3/g for 1, 17.59 cm3/g for 2, and 12.39 cm3/g for 3 at 273 K and 1.05 atm (800 Torr). There are two main reasons for the distinct difference of adsorption capacity of CO2/N2 or CO2/CH4: (1) the smaller kinetic diameter of CO2 (3.3 \u00c5) than that of N2 (3.64 \u00c5) and CH4 (3.8 \u00c5); (2) the influences of the amino groups from the BIPA ligand and phenolic hydroxyl groups from H2HIPA ligand.
