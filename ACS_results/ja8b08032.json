Here let us assume that complex A is in the FeIII state and complex B in the FeII state, but there is a totally equivalent expression interchanging A and B. If we plot the two energy surfaces E tot(d A,d B) we see that they cross along the line d A = d B (b). The initial and final configurations (respectively, top and bottom configurations in a) correspond to minima in the lower surface and the structures for which d A = d B to the crossing seam. The situation is more conveniently analyzed by using a contour plot of the bottom surface (c), obtained by joining the two bottom halves of the two intersecting surfaces. The two minima correspond to the configurations FeIII A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5FeII B (zone noted as F in c) and FeII A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5FeIII B (noted as I). The point on the d A = d B line for which the total energy is minimal (M) is found by taking the derivative of the energy function with d A = d B = d M and equating it to zero. It is found that d M = (k II d II + k III d III)/(k II + k III) and the corresponding energy E M = (k II k III/(k II + k III))(d II - d III)2. In other words, the minimal energy required to make the coordination environments on both Fe centers equal, that is, the height of the barrier for thermally activated electron transfer, depends basically on the difference squared between the radii of the FeIII and FeII coordination environments in their equilibrium geometries.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 36, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The model can\nbe more simply depicted by using a cut through the\ntwo surfaces in which we plot the energy along the dotted path joining\nthe two minima through the M point, which is taken as the origin ().
