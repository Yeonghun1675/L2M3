We selected for screening diaquat dibromide (DQ2+; E f = -289 mV vs RHE) and triquat dibromide (TQ2+; E f = -531 mV vs RHE); their structures are shown in . (See Figure S18 for CVs of bare FTO, Nafion-coated FTO, NU-1000, and MoO   x   -SIM in the presence of 10 mM DQ2+ or TQ2+.) Shown in a are slow-scan-rate voltammograms of MoS   x   -SIM (on FTO) without and with 10 mM of each of the three candidate mediators. (Similar plots are shown in b for RM concentrations of 2 mM.) Although the measurements are constrained (especially for TQ2+) by scan reversal at -520 mV, it is clear that plateau currents for electrocatalytic waves increase in the order DQ2+ < MV2+ < TQ2+. This trend is consistent with the notion that the rate of electrocatalysis is governed, at least in part, by the driving force and the rate of reaction for ET from the mediator to the catalyst. c presents Faradaic efficiencies (FE values) for H2 formation via electrolysis at a fixed potential of -420 mV vs RHE. Ideally, the FE values should approach 100%, provided only negligible amounts of RM\u22c5+ escape from the MOF film. Particularly for DQ2+ at concentrations of 5 and 10 mM, however, the FE values fall well below 100%. They can be largely recovered, however, by changing the potential for electrolysis to -349 mV (=E f(DQ2+/\u22c5+) - 60 mV). We have been unable to identify cause for the diminished FE. Given the sensitivity to electrolysis potential and to mediator concentration, however, we speculate that at sufficiently high concentrations, DQ\u22c5+ dimerizes and that the dimer is only marginally competent, if at all, for delivery of reducing equivalents to catalytic Mo(SH)2 sites. As shown in the SI, a further complication is the chemical instability of TQ\u22c5+ in acidic solutions.

The foot-of-the-wave analysis method (FOWA) developed by Save\u0301ant and co-workers has been widely applied to both homogeneous and heterogeneous electrocatalytic systems in order to understand the intrinsic catalytic performance of a system, where the performance is typically quantified in terms of a potential-independent second-order rate constant (k) and overpotential (\u03b7) dependent TOFs. To our knowledge, the FOWA approach has yet to be applied to mediated electrocatalysis of hydrogen evolution in aqueous solutions. One potential roadblock to using this analysis in an aqueous system is that cathodic peak current of the catalyst (i p 0) in the absence of the substrate (i.e., H+ or H2O) cannot be trivially determined.
