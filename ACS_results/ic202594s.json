More importantly, the reaction yield systematically depends\non the molecular size of the substrate. For example, when cyanation\nof sterically demanding aldehydes, such as 1-naphthaldehyde (1N),\n2-naphthaldehyde (2N), and 9-anthraldehyde (9A), was attempted, substrate-size-dependent\ncatalysis was observed. For network <bold>3</bold>, the conversion\ndecreased in the order of benzaldehyde (86%) &gt; 1N (68%) &gt; 2N\n(60%)\n&gt; 9A (38%), in line with their sizes of 8.21 \u00d7 5.83 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> (benzaldehyde), 9.69 \u00d7 8.29 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> (1N),\n10.67 \u00d7 7.49 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> (2N), and 10.88 \u00d7 8.60 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> (9A).

Therefore, it could be concluded that\nthe conversions are inversely proportional to the molecular size of\n aldehydes and the substrate accessibility to the Cd<sup>2+</sup> sites\ncontrols the catalysis outcome.</p>", "clean_text": "We finally targeted CRs of aldehydes to primarily understand the size selectivity because it does constitute good circumstantial evidence for heterogeneous catalysis within the pores and channels of a network and not only on the surface. Notably, both networks 3 and 4 were able to catalyze the CRs within 4 h (Scheme  and Table S8, ). Benzaldehyde as well as several functionalized analogues provided the corresponding cyanohydrins in high yield (70-92%). The observed catalysis is presumably occurring via displacement of the labile water by aldehyde before its activation and reaction (Scheme S2, ). Importantly, both networks function as heterogeneous catalysts, while the recyclability and control experiments yielded results similar to those noted for RORs. More importantly, the reaction yield systematically depends on the molecular size of the substrate. For example, when cyanation of sterically demanding aldehydes, such as 1-naphthaldehyde (1N), 2-naphthaldehyde (2N), and 9-anthraldehyde (9A), was attempted, substrate-size-dependent catalysis was observed. For network 3, the conversion decreased in the order of benzaldehyde (86%) > 1N (68%) > 2N (60%) > 9A (38%), in line with their sizes of 8.21 \u00d7 5.83 \u00c52 (benzaldehyde), 9.69 \u00d7 8.29 \u00c52 (1N), 10.67 \u00d7 7.49 \u00c52 (2N), and 10.88 \u00d7 8.60 \u00c52 (9A).
