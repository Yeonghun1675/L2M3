The N2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7C15\ndistance is significantly shorter than those in all previous crystallographic\nobservations (3.14\u20133.40 \u00c5). The shorter N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7C separations and\nhigher CO<sub>2</sub> occupancy of site I indicate that a narrower\nN\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N claw has a higher CO<sub>2</sub> binding affinity.\nThe shortest N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7C distance for N2 may be attributed\nto the different ortho substituents of the uncoordinated N atom (methyl\nfor N2 vs methylene for N5, N8, and N11).

While the pore size of <bold>1</bold>\u00b71.5CO<sub>2</sub> is still very small (cavity size 7.2 \u00c5 \u00d7 6.5 \u00c5\n\u00d7 4.9 \u00c5, aperture size 3.9 \u00c5 \u00d7 3.2 \u00c5), the\nhost\u2013guest interactions between other parts of the host framework\n(methyl and methylene groups) and CO<sub>2</sub> (O atom) are quite\nweak (), further\nhighlighting the significance of the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N claws. In\ncontrast, there is a significant interaction between the two independent\nCO<sub>2</sub> molecules [C15\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O3, 3.15(1) \u00c5]\n(Figure a).</p>", "clean_text": "To elucidate the CO2 adsorption mechanism, single crystals of 1 were fixed inside glass capillaries, activated at 358 K under high vacuum, sealed with back-filled CO2, and then subjected to XRD at 195 K. The CO2 loading was controlled by the back-fill pressure and the temperature. A high-quality single-crystal XRD data set was measured for 1\u22c51.5CO2, in which the gas molecules could be anisotropically refined without any restriction. As shown in Figure a, two independent CO2 molecules reside near the original sites of O1W (denoted as site I) and O2W (denoted as site II). The CO2 occupancies were determined by free structural refinement to be 0.816(9) and 0.695(10) at sites I and II, respectively. Compared with 1, the unit cell of 1\u22c51.5CO2 displays obvious expansion and slight distortion (\u0394V/V  1  = 1.4%, \u0394\u03b2 = -0.5\u00b0). The CO2 geometries [C\ue5fbO, 1.047(14)-1.146(9) \u00c5; O\ue5fbC\ue5fbO, 174(2)\u00b0] are similar to that of solid CO2. As expected, each CO2 is chelated by a molecular claw (i.e., it interacts simultaneously with a pair of uncoordinated N-donors). Most of the N\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C separations [N2\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C15, 3.011(8) \u00c5; N8\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C15, 3.178(8) \u00c5; N5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C16, 3.26(1) \u00c5; N11\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C16, 3.15(1) \u00c5] are shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii of N (1.55 \u00c5) and C (1.70 \u00c5). The N2\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C15 distance is significantly shorter than those in all previous crystallographic observations (3.14-3.40 \u00c5). The shorter N\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C separations and higher CO2 occupancy of site I indicate that a narrower N\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5N claw has a higher CO2 binding affinity. The shortest N\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C distance for N2 may be attributed to the different ortho substituents of the uncoordinated N atom (methyl for N2 vs methylene for N5, N8, and N11). Although methyl can induce a stronger \u03c3-\u03c0 hyperconjugation effect than methylene, the electron density on the pyridine N atom can be increased by only ca. 2% (from -0.336 to -0.344 electron unit) by methyl substitution at the ortho position.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that 1\u22c54H2O released all of its water molecules below 150 \u00b0C and decomposed above 520 \u00b0C (). Powder XRD (PXRD) proved that degassed 1 is stable up to 480 \u00b0C (). The single-crystal structure of 1 was measured to confirm the retention of the host framework and the complete removal of guest molecules (). Compared to 1\u22c54H2O, 1 has a similar unit-cell volume with minor distortions (\u0394V/V  1\u22c54H2O = 0.16%, \u0394\u03b2 = 1.8\u00b0). Detailed analysis showed that the structural variation mainly occurred on the coordination bond angles rather than the bond lengths. Dehydration also relaxed the molecular claws [N2\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5N8 from 5.096(3) to 5.188(3) \u00c5, N5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5N11 from 5.434(3) to 5.650(4) \u00c5] because each guest water molecule attracts the two uncoordinated N atoms by hydrogen bonding.\n\nAt 195 K, 1 showed a type-I CO2 sorption isotherm without hysteresis (), giving an apparent Langmuir surface area of 622(5) m2 g-1 and a pore volume of 0.21 cm3 g-1. The saturated CO2 uptake was 138 cm3 g-1, corresponding to 27.2 wt % or 3.0 CO2 per formula unit; this is higher than the theoretical value (97 cm3 g-1, 19.0 wt %, 2.0 CO2 per formula unit) calculated from the crystal structure of 1 using a density of 1.1 g cm-3 for liquid CO2. At 273 and 298 K, 1 showed CO2 uptakes of 74.2 and 56.1 cm3 g-1 (i.e., 14.6 and 11.0 wt %), respectively, at 1 atm (Figure a and ). The CO2 uptake of 1 at 298 K and 1 atm is higher than for other PCPs with similar or lower surface areas/pore volumes (). For N2 under the same conditions, 1 adsorbs only 4.0 and 2.0 cm3 g-1 at 1 atm, respectively (Figure a and ). Using the initial slopes of the CO2 and N2 isotherms, the Henry's law CO2/N2 selectivities were calculated to be 163 and 107 at 273 and 298 K, respectively (). The CO2 and N2 uptakes at the relevant partial pressures for flue gas (0.15 atm CO2, 0.75 atm N2) were also calculated to give more practical CO2/N2 selectivities of 82 and 87 at 273 and 298 K, respectively. These selectivities are higher than for most PCPs, except for a few functionalized with alkylamines and OMSs. These observations indicate that 1 can bind CO2 very strongly. It should be noted that the CO2 sorption isotherms of 1 are fully reversible and show very fast adsorption/desorption kinetics (), indicating that the strong guest adsorption is not necessarily
