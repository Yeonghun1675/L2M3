Their structures and optical properties were studied. The mixed Ln-MOFs, (Eu x Tb y Dy1-x-y )(HL)(H2O)(DEF), easily allow incorporation of three primary colors into one framework. The color-tunable luminescence behavior of these mixed Ln-MOFs is found by rationally modulating the temperature and excitation wavelength. Importantly, by tuning the temperature, the emission colors change broadly and lead to the production of white light, which is necessary for the fabrication of full-color display devices.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 15, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information\nis available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.cgd.6b01541\">10.1021/acs.cgd.6b01541</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Synthesized method,\nstructure information, PXRD, ICP,\nTGA, and other additional spectra (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.cgd.6b01541/suppl_file/cg6b01541_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.cgd.6b01541.
