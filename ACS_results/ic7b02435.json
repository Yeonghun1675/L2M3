However, compounds <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>4</bold> exhibit their different extents of electrical conductivity\nas well as enhanced semiconducting properties under photoilluminated\nconditions through charge transportation, which might be due to many\nfactors, such as (i) metal\u2013metal direct interaction and short\nmetal to metal distance, (ii) formation of intermolecular\nH-bonding between the framework and the guest water molecules occupying\nthe interstitial holes in MOFs, (iii)\nmixed valence oxidation state in the metal ions, (iv) the presence\nof lattice inorganic/organic moieties, and (v) dimensionality of MOFs. However, here all the\ncompounds contain the same metal ion and also form a similar or closely\nsimilar 3D framework. So, in these cases, the role of ligands is the\nkey factor for controlling their differences in conductivity values.\nIt is well-known that the extent of charge transport in MOFs unwaveringly\ndepends on the interaction (effective overlap of frontier orbitals)\nbetween the d-orbital of metal ions and the p-orbital of organic ligands.\nSo in this case, the effective overlap of the d\u03c0-orbitals of\nCd\u00ad(II)-ion with the p\u03c0-orbital of the azbpy ligand can easily\ndelocalized the charge between adjacent metal centers through the\nligand, resulting in the semiconducting behavior of the compounds.\nBut interestingly, the conductivity values for compounds <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>4</bold> are quite different from each other; which\nmight be due to the variation of size and structural substitution\nin the respective dicarboxylates used. However, the conductivity values\nfor <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>4</bold> corroborate that the shorter\nchain length of dicarboxylate (i.e., succinate) precedes over the\nlonger chain one (i.e., glutarate), because the metal-to-metal direct\ninteractions are a very important factor for showing conductivity.\nThus, when the metals are very close enough to form a metal\u2013metal\nbond through the use of organic ligand(s) having very short chain\nlength, then it is quite expected to show high conductivity value.\nNevertheless, when the metal\u2013metal distance increases with\nthe use of organic ligand(s) having comparatively larger chain length,\nthen the conductivity values should be decreased.

However, compounds 1-4 exhibit their different extents of electrical conductivity as well as enhanced semiconducting properties under photoilluminated conditions through charge transportation, which might be due to many factors, such as (i) metal-metal direct interaction and short metal to metal distance, (ii) formation of intermolecular H-bonding between the framework and the guest water molecules occupying the interstitial holes in MOFs, (iii) mixed valence oxidation state in the metal ions, (iv) the presence of lattice inorganic/organic moieties, and (v) dimensionality of MOFs. However, here all the compounds contain the same metal ion and also form a similar or closely similar 3D framework. So, in these cases, the role of ligands is the key factor for controlling their differences in conductivity values. It is well-known that the extent of charge transport in MOFs unwaveringly depends on the interaction (effective overlap of frontier orbitals) between the d-orbital of metal ions and the p-orbital of organic ligands. So in this case, the effective overlap of the d\u03c0-orbitals of Cd(II)-ion with the p\u03c0-orbital of the azbpy ligand can easily delocalized the charge between adjacent metal centers through the ligand, resulting in the semiconducting behavior of the compounds. But interestingly, the conductivity values for compounds 1-4 are quite different from each other; which might be due to the variation of size and structural substitution in the respective dicarboxylates used. However, the conductivity values for 1-4 corroborate that the shorter chain length of dicarboxylate (i.e., succinate) precedes over the longer chain one (i.e., glutarate), because the metal-to-metal direct interactions are a very important factor for showing conductivity. Thus, when the metals are very close enough to form a metal-metal bond through the use of organic ligand(s) having very short chain length, then it is quite expected to show high conductivity value. Nevertheless, when the metal-metal distance increases with the use of organic ligand(s) having comparatively larger chain length, then the conductivity values should be decreased. Besides, the alkyl substitution in a same ligand (linker) can also hinder the charge delocalization process, so that the nonsubstituted one can give a better result than the methyl substituted one. Moreover, in compounds 1-4, the lattice water molecules are placed in the interstitial position and stabilized through the formation of intermolecular H-bonding with the respective framework, which may affect additively for showing electrical conductivity for compounds 1-4.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 43, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Gas and Solvent Vapor Sorption\nStudy</title><p>Possessing effective solvent accessible voids and showing\nhigh thermal stability in the dehydrated frameworks of compounds <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold>, we have performed the sorption study\non their dehydrated frameworks for different gases (e.g., N<sub>2</sub> at 77 K and CO<sub>2</sub> at 195 K) along with solvent vapors (e.g.,\nH<sub>2</sub>O and dry EtOH at 298 K).

With further heating, the dehydrated frameworks of 2, 3, and 4 are collapsed into unidentified product, and finally, they are probably converted into CdO at ~700 \u00b0C (Figure S9).\n\nElectrical Study\n\nTo observe the electric behavior of the synthesized materials (i.e., compounds 1-4), a sandwich structured thin film device of Al/Cd-MOF/ITO configuration has been fabricated. At first, the electrical conductivity of the fabricated thin film has been determined in dark condition and under AM 1.5G radiation. The conductivity of the thin film device was measured in dark as 3.2 \u00d7 10-3 S m-1, 2.64 \u00d7 10-3 S m-1, 1.29 \u00d7 10-3 S m-1, and 2.07 \u00d7 10-3 S m-1 for compounds 1-4, respectively. Maintaining all  experimental conditions the same, the conductivities of those films were measured under illumination conditions as 1.65 \u00d7 10-2 S m-1, 9.76 \u00d7 10-3 S m-1, 3.61 \u00d7 10-3 S m-1, and 6.60 \u00d7 10-3 S m-1 for compounds 1-4, respectively. The obtained optical band gap and the estimated electrical conductivity lie well within the semiconductor limit. Motivated from these results, the current-voltage (I-V) measurements of Al/Cd-MOF/ITO structured devices were performed within the voltage range \u00b12.0 V.  represents the current-voltage (I-V) characteristic curves for compounds 1-4 based thin film devices under dark and photoillumination conditions.\n\nLuminescent Properties\n\nRecently, the MOFs with d10 metal system showing the photoluminescence properties at room temperature have become very important on account of their potential application in selective sensing of small molecules and detection of metal ions, non linear optical (NLO) diode fabrication, and electroluminescence display, etc. The photoluminescence study of complexes 2-4 with free azbpy ligand has been investigated at room temperature, which is shown in Figure S13. Each N,N'-donor azbpy ligand and compounds 2-4 exhibit two emission peaks with maxima at 567 and 760 nm (\u03bbex = 467 nm), 568 and 768 nm (\u03bbex = 480 nm), 570 and 765 (\u03bbex = 482 nm) nm, and 569 and 764 nm (\u03bbex = 471 nm), respectively. All the compounds 2-4 exhibit a similar type free azbpy ligand based emission spectra, which are slightly red-shifted compared to the emission spectra of free N,N'-donor azbpy ligand. For the aromatic N,N'-donor azbpy ligand the emission may be due to the \u03c0*-n or \u03c0*-\u03c0 transition. Similarly for complexes 2-4 the emission may occur through the intraligand charge transfer (ILCT) process from \u03c0*-n or \u03c0*-\u03c0 due to having no possibility of MLCT/LMCT charge transfer, since the d10 metal ions are difficult to be reduced or oxidized. The variation of enhancement of luminescent intensity through coordination of the azbpy ligand in the MOFs can be regulated through the variation of the coordination capability of Cd(II) ions with the O-donor dicarboxylates used.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "compound 2", "symbol": "2", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "40", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "release of
