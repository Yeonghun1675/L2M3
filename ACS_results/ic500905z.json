Recent research by our group and others indicate that the \"pillar-layer\" method is an effective strategy to synthesis porous MOFs. For example, we have reported a series of \"pillar-layered\" zinc MOFs based on 1,1'-biphenyl-2,2',6,6'-tetracarboxylic acid (H4bpta), which show robust frameworks with adjustable pore volume and window size depending on the length of bipyridine pillar ligands. Also, in this system, functional groups could be introduced into the pore surface via the pillar ligand to modulate the pore surface toward the desired properties. Owing to the enhanced interactions between the acylamide groups and CO2 molecules, it has been reported that MOFs with acylamide-functionalized pore surfaces could show excellent performance in CO2 storage; on the other hand, it is well-known that the sorption selectivity of MOFs could also be determined by the sieve effect of the aperture of the pore, which may result in high selectivity.

As shown in Figure a, the asymmetric unit of 1 contains two crystallographically independent Zn(II) centers, one bpta4- ligand and one 4-pna ligand. The Zn1 center is six-coordinated to four oxygen atoms from three carboxylate groups of two bpta4- ligands, one N atom from 4-pna, and one H2O molecule (Zn-O, 2.02-2.20 \u00c5; Zn-N, 2.09 \u00c5). The Zn2 ion is four-coordinated by three carboxylate O atoms from three different bpta4- ligands and one N atom from the 4-pna ligand (Zn-O, 1.93-1.96 \u00c5; Zn-N, 2.01 \u00c5), which results in a tetrahedral geometry. One of the carboxylate groups coordinates to the metal center with a chelating mode and the other two with a monodentate mode. Each bpta4- ligand coordinates with five Zn(II) centers, which results in a complicated two-dimensional (2D) layer (Figure b). A three-dimensional (3D) \"pillar-layered\" structure (Figures c,d) is generated when the adjacent layers are connected through 4-pna ligands coordinated to Zn(II) centers. The space between the layers is occupied by solvent DMF and H2O molecules. After removal of solvent molecules filled in the pore space, the accessible volume is 36.6%, as estimated using the SOLV function of PLATON. \n\nCrystal Structure of {[Zn2(bpta)(bpy-ea)(H2O)]\u22c52DMF\u22c5H2O} n  (2)\n\nComplex 2 crystallizes in P21/c space group. The layers in complex 2 has the same connection mode as that in 1, while the bond distances and angles are slightly changed (see the  for details). The network of complex 2 also contains channels running along the b and c axes. For the channel along the b axis, the opening has a size of ~3.2 \u00d7 3.6 \u00c52 (a \u00d7 c) and along the c axis the triangle dimension is ~3.2 \u00d7 3.2 \u00d7 2.7 \u00c53, excluding the van der Waals radii of atoms. However, there are subtle differences in the arrangement of pillars in complex 2 in comparison with that of 1. In complex 1, the pillars are almost perpendicular to the layers both along b and c axes, while the adjacent bpy-ea ligands between the layers of 2 slightly sloped to the opposite direction along c axis, leading to the formation of triangle channels (Figure b), which is different from the almost squared channels in 1. This should be attributed to the staggering of the layers along the b direction, which affects the connection of pillar ligands. After removal of solvent molecules filled in the pore space, the accessible volume is 36.9%, as estimated using the SOLV function of PLATON. Similar to that of 1, the channel wall was defined by the ethanediylidene group of bpy-ea ligands.\n\nThermogravimetric Analyses\n\nTo examine the thermal stability of the obtained MOFs, thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) experiments were carried out (Figures S5 and S6, ). As shown in the crystal structure analysis, complex 1 includes four DMF and three H2O molecules as guests. The observed weight loss of the guest molecules (20.4%) is in agreement with that calculated for the corresponding crystal structure (21%). After the sample was soaked in methanol for 3 days, the TG curve did not show obvious change, which indicated that the solvent molecules are not exchanged. This might be due to the relatively strong hydrogen bond between the guest DMF and the pillar ligand as we discussed above. On the other hand, there was no weight loss until 380 \u00b0C for the activated sample, showing the successful removal of the solvent molecules during the activation process.\n\nThe TG curve of complex 2 showed no weight loss before 100 \u00b0C, and then it reveals a weight loss of 13.7% in the temperature range 100-219 \u00b0C. After solvent exchange with methanol, the TG curve showed a weight loss of 8% in the temperature range 36-92 \u00b0C, which could be attributed to the loss of solvent molecules residing in the open channels. Also, the activated sample 2 shows high thermal stability up to 380 \u00b0C, indicating the high thermal stability of these pillar-layered MOFs.\n\nPorosity Characterization\n\nNitrogen gas adsorption experiments at 77 K were explored for the pore characterization of complexes 1 and 2 (Figure ). Before the measurement, all of the samples were activated at 150 \u00b0C to remove the guest solvent molecules. As shown in Figure , N2 sorption isotherms of complex 1 present a type I kind behavior, indicating the microporosity of the complex. However, for complex 2, the N2 uptake is relatively low. These sorption curves were analyzed using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Langmuir methods. The estimated apparent BET and Langmuir surface areas are 413 and 547 m2 g-1 for 1 and 51 and 69 m2 g-1 for 2. Although the accessible volumes of the two complexes are similar (36.6% for 1 and 36.9% for 2) on the basis of the crystal structure data, the N2 adsorption results of these two compounds show distinct pore volumes (0.21 cm3 g-1 for 1 and 0.03 cm3 g-1 for 2), less than the pore volumes estimated from the single-crystal structure (about 0.29 cm3 g-1 for both 1 and 2), which indicates the flexibility of the two complexes.\n\nCO2 Adsorption Investigation\n\nIn order to investigate the CO2 capture ability of complexes 1 and 2, CO2 adsorption isotherms were measured at 273 and 298 K for these complexes, respectively (Figures  and  and Figure S7 ()). For 1, the maximum CO2 capacity of adsorption is 60.31 cm-3 g-1 at 273 K/900 mmHg and 41.95 cm-3 g-1 at 298 K/900 mmHg, which are considerable in comparison with its medium surface area. In comparison, the uptake of complex 2 is only 20.51 cm-3 g-1 at 273 K/900 mmHg and 14.89 cm-3 g-1 at 298 K/900 mmHg. It should be noted that, though complex 2 has a low CO2 capacity of adsorption at 273 and 298 K, the maximum adsorption amounts are quite similar to those of N2 at 77 K. Since the saturated N2 adsorption amount achieved at P/P 0 ~ 1 defined the accessible pore volume at 77 K, the unsaturated CO2 uptake indicates increased accessible space at 273 K. This attests to the flexible nature of the framework of complex 2.\n\nTo evaluate the interaction between the adsorbed CO2 molecules and the host framework, the CO2 adsorption enthalpies (Q st) of complexes 1 and 2 were calculated using the modified Clausius-Clapeyron equation by fitting adsorption isotherms at 273 K and 298 k (Figure  and Figures S10 and S11 ()). The Q st value of 1 for CO2 is 34.82 kJ mol-1 at zero loading, reflecting a relatively strong CO2-framework interaction, while for complex 2 the Q st value is 27.69 kJ mol-1. The relatively high Q st value of 1 can be attributed to the enhanced interaction between CO2 molecules and the polar acylamide groups, which could benefit the capture and selective adsorption of CO2.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "[Zn4(bpta)2(4-pna)2(H2O)2]\u22c54DMF\u22c53H2O"}, "crystal system": [{"value": "monoclinic", "condition": ""}], "space
