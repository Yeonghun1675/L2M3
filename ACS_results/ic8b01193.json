As shown in a, the peak belonging to C 1s could be fitted by three subunits located at 284.4 eV, 285.0 eV, and 288.4 eV, which are attributed to the C-C and C-H, C-N, or C-O and O\ue5fbC-O, respectively. After irradiation, the spectrum in b reveals the development of a new peak at 285.7 eV and implies the formation of carbon radicals on the IDA ligand by breaking C-H bonds on the \u03b1-CH2. Meanwhile, other signals at 284.3, 294.9, and 288.4 eV show negligible changes compared to those of unirradiated samples, further supporting the assignment of this new peak. In addition, the absorption spectra of IDA upon irradiation results in an increase in the intensity of absorbance between 275 and 450 nm, which directly affects the intensity of ligand based emission peaks ranging from 420 to 550 nm while the lanthanide based emission is affected (Figure S9). This direct observation of the quenched luminescence from the formation of radicals after exposure to UV radiation is responsible for the continuous color change of Gd99Tb0.1Eu0.9-IDA observed in the CIE chromaticity diagram. The recovery of the irradiated sample fluorescence can be achieved by heating the sample at 80 \u00b0C for 40 h (Figure S10), which further supports the radical mechanism.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 12, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig4\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<p>C 1s XPS core-level spectra\nof Gd<sub>99</sub>Tb<sub>0.1</sub>Eu<sub>0.9</sub>-IDA (a) before\nand (b) after 365 nm light irradiation.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr4\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2018-01193t_0004.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 4  C 1s XPS core-level spectra of Gd99Tb0.1Eu0.9-IDA (a) before and (b) after 365 nm light irradiation.
