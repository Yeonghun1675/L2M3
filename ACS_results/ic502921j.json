The volumetric H2 uptakes in 1 were collected at 77 and 87 K ( Figure S8). All H2 isotherms exhibit rapid kinetics and good reversibility with H2 uptake capacity of 186.1 cm3 g-1 (1.66 wt %) at 77 K and 1.0 bar, and 131.5 cm3 g-1 (1.17 wt %) at 87 K and 1.0 bar. Moreover, Qst for H2 was determined by Clausius-Clapeyron equation and estimated to be 8.34 kJ mol-1 at zero coverage ( Figure S9). These values in H2 capacity and Qst are comparably higher than those of previously reported porous MOFs. \n\nThe special dual-functionalities in 1 prompt us to further explore the potential applications toward CO2 capture and separation. We have measured low pressure CO2, CH4 and N2 sorption data at 273 and 298 K, as shown in Figure .

To predict the CO2 separation performance of 1 at 298 K, ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) calculations were used for binary gas adsorption selectivity under practically relevant conditions (Figure ).

The selectivity of 1 for CO2 over CH4 and N2 under these conditions is comparable to the majority of MOFs reported to date. Indeed, many MOFs with high selectivity have lower CO2 uptake than 1. Therefore, this material would be a promising candidate for natural gas purification and postcombustion CO2 capture applications.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn conclusion, a hexacarboxylate ligand containing azo group has been successfully used for the construction of MOFs, 1 and 2, showing dual-functionalities and novel topologies.
