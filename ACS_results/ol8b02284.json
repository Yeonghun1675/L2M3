Consequently, it was revealed that some 13C NMR signals corresponding to the A, B, and C rings of 1 are significantly broadened at 25 \u00b0C (, Table S2, and Figure S11). However, computational study showed the existence of conformers, which differ mainly in the conformation of the A ring moiety (Figure S32). Thus, the computational study revealed that the skeleton of 1 is not so rigid, and the conformational changes on the A ring of 1 would be a reasonable explanation for the signal broadening. Notably, the A ring of all known cyclopiane-type diterpenes is modified (Figure S5).
