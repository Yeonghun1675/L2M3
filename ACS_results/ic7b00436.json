JUC-141 possesses a 2D channel structure, and the sizes of the channels are 5.2 \u00c5 in the direction of [111] and 10.9 \u00c5 in the direction of [001]. In addition, CO2 adsorption capacities of JUC-141 are 79.94 and 51.39 cm3 g-1 at 273 and 298 K under 1 atm pressure, respectively. However, the N2 adsorption capacities of JUC-141 are 13.90 and 6.76 cm3 g-1 at 273 and 298 K under 1 atm pressure, respectively. IAST calculations indicate that the selectivity values of CO2/N2 are 21.61 at 273 K and 27.6 at 298 K under 101 kPa, respectively. Good selective adsorption of CO2 over N2 makes JUC-141 possible for CO2 storage and separation.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nThe reaction of 5-aminoisophthlic acid (H2L) with Cu(NO3)2 in a DMF/H2O/EtOH (1/1/3 v/v/v) mixture at 85 \u00b0C for 72 h gave blue block crystals of JUC-141 formulated as [CuL](Guest) (yield: 60% based on H2L). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction showed that JUC-141 crystallized in the trigonal space group R3\u0305m with the lattice parameters a = 19.119 \u00c5 and c = 20.303 \u00c5. There were half a ligand and half a Cu atom in the asymmetric unit (a). The carboxyl groups in the ligands coordinated to Cu atoms to form the classic Cu2(COO)4 paddle wheel SBUs. The assembly of paddle wheel SBUs with the isophthlic acid moieties in the ligand led to a 2D kagome lattice (b). Interestingly, the amino groups in the ligand also took part in the coordination and linked to the dipole of the paddle wheel SBUs as pillars, thus forming a 3D porous framework with 2D interconnected channels, which are the hexagonal channels in the [001] direction (c and Figure S2a in the Supporting Information) and the square channels in the [111] direction (d and Figure S2b). The sizes of the channels were about 12.3 and 6.9 \u00c5 as measured by Materials Studio, respectively. The solvent-accessible volume of JUC-141 was calculated to be about 52.4% by the PLATON software package. The topology analysis was conducted with the TOPOS 4.0 software package. Each ligand was connected to two paddle wheel SBUs, and the amino group was coordinated to the dipole of another paddle wheel SBU; thus, the ligand could be simplified as a 3-connected node. Each paddle wheel was connected to four ligands by the carboxyl groups and two amino groups from other two ligands; thus, each paddle wheel SBU could be simplified as a 6-connected node. Therefore, the whole framework of JUC-141 could be simplified as a (3,6)-connected eea net (e). The point symbol for the net was {42\u22c56}2{44\u22c562\u22c586\u22c5103}. The phase purity was confirmed by the similarity between the simulated and experimental X-ray diffraction patterns (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that JUC-141 started to decompose around 130 \u00b0C and the weight loss before 130 \u00b0C could be mainly attributed to the isolated guest molecules in the channels (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information).\n\nIn order to assess the permanent porosity of JUC-141, the as-synthesized samples were soaked in dry methanol for 2 days and then in CH2Cl2 for another 2 days and finally activated under vacuum for 8 h at 80 \u00b0C. The N2 sorption isotherms of the activated sample at 77 K revealed a typical type I adsorption curve according to the definition of the IUPAC classfication, a characteristic of microporous materials. The fast increase in N2 adsorption amounts under low relative pressure (P/P 0 < 0.01) and the following plateau at about 270 cm3 g-1 (STP) indicated a uniform microporous structure. On the basis of the N2 adsorption data, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area was calculated to be 1057 m2 g-1. Using the t-plot method model, the pore volume was calculated to be 0.406 cm3 g-1. According to nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT), there were two narrow pore width distributions located at 5.2 and 10.9 \u00c5 (), which agreed well with that measured by Materials Studio, as mentioned above. The PXRD pattern of the activated samples indicated that JUC-141 still maintained its crystallinity after activation (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information).\n\nWe further investigated the sorption behaviors of JUC-141 for other gases. The adsorption enthalpy (Q st) was calculated from the adsorption isotherms at 273 and 298 K using the virial method. The CO2 adsorption capacities of JUC-141 were observed to be 79.94 cm3 g-1 (3.57 mmol g-1) (a) and 51.39 cm3 g-1 (2.29 mmol g-1) (b) at 273 and 298 K under 1 atm pressure, respectively. The Q st value of CO2 was 27.85 kJ mol-1 (Figure S6 in the Supporting Information), which was higher than those of other reported MOF materials, such as UMCM-1 (12 kJ mol-1), MAF-2 (27 kJ mol-1), MOF-5 (17 kJ mol-1), and NOTT-140 (25 kJ mol-1). This higher adsorption enthalpy could be mainly attributed to the strong interactions of CO2 with the amino groups and the confined channel structures. In addition, the sorption isotherms of N2 and CH4 were also measured at 273 and 298 K under 1 atm pressure. The adsorption capacities for N2 were 13.90 cm3 g-1 (a) and 6.76 cm3 g-1 (b) at 273 and 298 K under 1 atm pressure, respectively, and the values for CH4 were 37.89 cm3 g-1 (a) and 21.85 cm3 g-1 (b) at 273 and 298 K under 1 atm pressure, respectively. The Q st values of N2 and CH4 were 27.24 kJ mol-1 (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information) and 22.73 kJ mol-1 (Figure S7 in the Supporting Information), respectively. In order to estimate the practical separation ability of CO2, CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 theoretical gas mixtures were evaluated by the IAST model, a method used to determine binary mixture adsorption from experimental single-component isotherms. The dual-site Langmuir-Frendlich equation was employed to fit the data with excellent correlation coefficients (Figures S8 and S9 in the Supporting Information). The estimated selectivity data were obtained from a function of pressure at a general feed composition of landfill gas (50/50, m/m) at 273 and 298 K under 101 kPa, respectively. At 273 K and 101 kPa, the selectivity values for CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 were 21.62 and 4.20 (c), respectively; at 298 K and 101 kPa, the selectivity values were 27.60 and 8.72 (d), respectively, which were significantly higher than those of many reported MOFs under the same conditions.
