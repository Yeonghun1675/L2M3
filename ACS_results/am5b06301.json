The additive luminescent colors obtained by superposition of the R- and G-MOF ink dots demonstrates good reproducibility when compared with the theoretical ones. Recent works have reported that the deposition of photoluminescent inks via the halftone method does not cause color quenching. This can be justified by the emitter centers that are inserted in distinct host domains. The emission spectra exhibited in (b) present simultaneous emission transitions typical of Tb3+ and Eu3+ ions whose amplitudes have presented a dependence with each ink dot quantity. Interestingly, luminescence investigations also demonstrate that different quantities of R- and G-MOF ink dots onto substrate surfaces can provide singular and discernible spectroscopic barcodes ((c)).
