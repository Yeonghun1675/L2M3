For the bpb ligand, there exist two peaks, at 447 and 535 nm, and for 1,3-H2bdc, H2mip, and H2tbip, the strongest emission peak is at 387, 495, and 320 nm, respectively. Interestingly, the emission peak of the bpb ligand at 535 nm vanished in DMF solution (Figure S9a), which may be due to the loss of ordered intermolecular accumulation.
