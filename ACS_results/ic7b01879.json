As shown in a, the subunit in the 3D open framework is a chloride-templated Ag14 cluster with ten cPrC\ue5fcC- ligands and two bridging Cl- coordinated on the exterior. The ball-shaped Cl- resides within the cluster with Ag-Cl distances in the range 2.77-3.15 \u00c5, giving a \u03bc6-binding mode. Two external Cl- ions adopt \u03bc3-mode to cap the surface of the Ag14 cluster (Ag-Cl, 2.58-3.00 \u00c5). The 10 cPrC\ue5fcC- ligands exhibit different coordination modes with mixed \u03c3- and \u03c0-type bonding; 3 in \u03bc4-\u03b7\u03c3 1:\u03b7\u03c0 1:\u03b7\u03c0 1:\u03b7\u03c0 2; 5 in \u03bc3-\u03b7\u03c3 1:\u03b7\u03c3 1:\u03b7\u03c0 2; 1 in \u03bc3-\u03b7\u03c3 1:\u03b7\u03c3 1:\u03b7\u03c3 1; 1 in \u03bc3-\u03b7\u03c3 1:\u03b7\u03c0 1:\u03b7\u03c0.
