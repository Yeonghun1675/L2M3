All the complexes were found to have a (4,4) topological 2D networks with smaller cavities given the swastika-shaped building blocks due to the presence of flexible -CH2- groups in L  1  and L  2 . The cationic complexes 1 and 2 incorporate anions (BF4 - and ClO4 -) in the channels that are formed across the packing of the layers. Interestingly, the packing of the layers in 1 and 2 is governed by \u03b2-sheet hydrogen bonds such that they have AA type packing. We note that BF4 - and ClO4 - ions are not interfered in the amide-to-amide hydrogen bonds but form weak C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5F and CH\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bonds, respectively. However, the neutral complexes 3 and 4 do not exhibit such amide-to-amide hydrogen bonding as the anions involved in N-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bonding with amides. As a result, the 3 and 4 exhibit offset packing (AB type). The complexes 1 and 3 were shown to be good for dye sorption as well as chromate and dichromate sorption from the corresponding aqueous solutions. The efficiency of sorption found to depend on the nature of the anion binding in the as-synthesized material. Interestingly, the hydrogen bonded anion (ClO4 - in 2) was found to be more difficult to be exchanged with chromate or dichromate than the anion that is coordinately bound (nitrate in 3) to metal. The complex 1 that has weakly bonded anion in the cavity was found to have a higher tendency for exchange with chromate/dichromate/anionic dye. Further, the matching of the PXRD patterns of 3' and 4 indicates that the chromate absorption by 3 is also happening through the in situ esterification of chromate and also into the crystal lattice but not on the surface. This phenomenon has also been testified by IR spectra of 3' and 4. Lastly, compound 3 has the potential to act as a luminescence sensor for chromate ions as its luminescence is quenched by the absorption of chromate ions.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 26, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Experimental Section</title><title>General</title><p>All commercially available reagents and solvents\nwere used as received.
