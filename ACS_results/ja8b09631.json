Moving forward, this newly characterized phase will aid in identifying structural factors that control the pressure-induced step, thus allowing chemists to more predictably and precisely tune the phase-change pressure and expand the potential of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks as phase-change adsorbents. In particular, pursuing modifications that destabilize intra-framework contacts in the closed phase and increase pore size in the open phase, such as ligand substitution and extension, respectively, may help achieve threshold pressures and capacities relevant to emerging applications, including on-board natural gas storage.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 33, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information\nis available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.8b09631\">10.1021/jacs.8b09631</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Full synthesis\nand characterization details of the frameworks\nand descriptions of crystallographic and gas adsorption data analysis\n(<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.8b09631/suppl_file/ja8b09631_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>DMF-solvated\nCdIF-13 (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.8b09631/suppl_file/ja8b09631_si_002.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>dichloromethane-solvated CdIF-13 (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.8b09631/suppl_file/ja8b09631_si_003.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/jacs.8b09631.
