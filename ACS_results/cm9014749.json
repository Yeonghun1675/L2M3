The surface area calculated from the Langmuir equation is about 69.1 and 324.35 m<sup>2</sup>/g for N<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption profiles, respectively. The steep uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> at low-pressure regions suggests strong interaction with the pore surfaces, which is also realized by the high isosteric heat of adsorption (\u221226.3 kJ/mol) obtained from the Dubinin\u2212Radushkevich (DR) equation.

Steep uptake of H<sub>2</sub> at low- pressure regions at 77 K is consistent with strong interactions between H<sub>2</sub> molecules and pore surfaces, possibly because of the presence of highly reactive unsaturated K-sites. The framework saturated with respect to H<sub>2</sub> at 16 and 50 bar at 77 and 195 K, respectively (see Figure S6 in the ).

The TGA study suggests that four KI-bound water molecules are released in the temperature range of 45-120 \u00b0C and the dehydrated solid (1') is stable up to 380 \u00b0C without further weight loss. The weight loss (obsd 15.01 wt %) is consistent with the four water molecules (calcd 14.16 wt %). The PXRD pattern of 1' shows sharp lines with shifting of some peak positions, like (101) peak shifted from 2\u03b8 = 12.56 to 12.88\u00b0, and the appearance of some new peaks in comparison to the as-synthesised framework 1, suggesting structural transformation after removal of the K-bound water molecules, rather than the collapse of the framework. Indexing of the powder pattern of 1' by using the TREOR program suggests monoclinic crystal system with a = 14.690(5) \u00c5\u0301, b = 11.428(4) \u00c5\u0301, c = 7.879(2) \u00c5\u0301, \u03b2 = 91.50(5)\u00b0, and V = 1322.39 \u00c5\u03013, which indicates the structural distortion in 1 after removal of the water molecules (see the ). When 1' is exposed to water vapor for three days, the original framework is regenerated as suggested by the PXRD pattern (Figure d). Indexing of the powder pattern of the rehydrated solid indicating the tetragonal crystal system with cell parameters a = b = 11.467(7) \u00c5; c = 8.902(5) \u00c5; V = 1170.75 \u00c53, which is similar to the assynthesized framework 1.\n\nAdsorption Property\n\nEncouraged by the exceptionally high thermal stability of the dehydrated compound (1'), N2 (77 K) and CO2 (195 K) adsorption properties were investigated to establish permanent porosity. As shown in Figure , the framework exhibits a typical type-II isotherm for N2 (kinetic diameter 3.6 \u00c5) and type-I profile for CO2 (3.4 \u00c5) adsorption. The surface area calculated from the Langmuir equation is about 69.1 and 324.35 m2/g for N2 and CO2 adsorption profiles, respectively. The steep uptake of CO2 at low-pressure regions suggests strong interaction with the pore surfaces, which is also realized by the high isosteric heat of adsorption (-26.3 kJ/mol) obtained from the Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) equation. Moderate surface area and highly reactive pore surfaces decorated with unsaturated alkali metal ions (KI) prompted us to measure H2 storage capacity of the framework 1'. High pressure hydrogen sorption at 77 and 195 K were found to be 0.70 and 0.11 wt %, respectively (Figure a and Figure S6 in the ). Steep uptake of H2 at low- pressure regions at 77 K is consistent with strong interactions between H2 molecules and pore surfaces, possibly because of the presence of highly reactive unsaturated K-sites. The framework saturated with respect to H2 at 16 and 50 bar at 77 and 195 K, respectively (see Figure S6 in the ). The heat of hydrogen adsorption was calculated using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, suggesting \u0394H ads = -9.21 kJ/mol at low coverage regions, which is significantly high among the reported porous metal-organic framework systems. The density of the adsorbed H2 was calculated with respect to the total pore volume (0.1042 cm3/g), giving a value of approximately 0.0672 g/cm3, which is comparable to liquid hydrogen density (0.0708 g/cm3), indicating that the H2 molecules are in compressed state in the channels. We have also measured H2 sorption at 77 K up to 1 atm (P/P 0 ~ 1), which exhibits a steep uptake at very low pressure regions and ended without saturation (see Figure S7 in the ). The sorption is consistent with high-pressure measurement at low-pressure regions. The high-pressure CO2 adsorption profile shows 4.7 wt % storage capacities at 298 K and 20 bar (Figure b), and this value is slightly decreases to 3.47 wt % at low-pressure measurement (P/P 0 ~ 1) at 298 K (see Figure S8 in the ). Inspired by the square-shaped channel decorated with highly active alkali metal ions, we anticipated that 1' could selectively adsorb solvent molecules on the basis of size and polarity. H2O, CH3CN, and EtOH sorption experiments were carried out at 298 K and MeOH sorption was measured at 293 K (Figure ). H2O (kinetic diameter 2.65 \u00c5) and CH3CN (kinetic diameter 4.0 \u00c5) sorption profiles exhibit typical type-I curve (a and c in Figure ), whereas MeOH (kinetic diameter 3.8 \u00c5) sorption occurs in two-step processes (Figure b (inset)). Hysteretic sorption and a rapid rise at the low-pressure region suggest strong interaction with the pore surfaces. The calculations using saturation sorption amount suggest that framework 1' uptakes 4 molecules of H2O, 0.4 molecule of MeOH, 0.7 molecule of CH3CN per formula unit. All the profiles were analyzed by the DR equation and \u03b2E 0 values, which reflect the adsorbate-adsorbent affinity, are 5.8, 7.72, and 9.99 kJ/mol for H2O, CH3CN, and MeOH, respectively. CH3CN loaded samples of 1' reveals similar PXRD pattern as of assynthesized framework, suggesting structural transformation after accommodation of CH3CN molecules (Figure e). IR spectrum of CH3CN adsorbed sample exhibits additional peaks around 2978 cm-1 and 2258 cm-1, corresponding to the \u03bd(C-H) and \u03bd(CN), respectively of CH3CN molecule (see Figure S9 in the ). The higher \u03bd(CN) stretching frequency compare to the free CH3CN (\u03bd(CN) = 2231 cm-1) suggests that CH3CN molecules are strongly embedded in the pores decorated with unsaturated KI sites. Framework 1' completely excludes EtOH molecules (kinetic diameter 4.3 \u00c5) consistent with the smaller pore size in 1'. The structural reversibility with dehydration and rehydration can be realized by the similar PXRD pattern and the same amount of water adsorption revealed from the sorption profile.\n\nReferences\n\nCrystal data for {KHo(C2O4)2(H2O)4} n  (1): F w = C4H8HoKO12, M w = 452.07, tetragonal, space group I41/amd (No. 141), a = b = 11.4651(3) \u00c5, c = 8.9154(3) \u00c5, V =
