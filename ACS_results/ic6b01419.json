Atom Zn1 (occupancy: 0.5) is four-coordinated by two triazole N atoms and two carboxylic O atoms from two different bpydb2- ligands, creating a tetrahedral geometry (see a). Zn2 is five-coordinated by two triazole N atoms and one pyridine N atom on the bpydb2- ligand, and the remaining sites are finished by two carboxylic O atoms from another bpydb2- ligand. The Zn-O bond lengths fall in the range of 1.954(1)-2.380(2) \u00c5, and the Zn-N bond lengths range from 2.010(7) to 2.056(2) \u00c5.

The desymmetrized triazole linkers not only bond to the Zn(II) ions to result in a new helical Zn-triazolate chain building unit but also lead to the formation of a highly porous framework (N2 uptake: 617 cm3/g; BET surface area: 2393 m2/g) with 1D helical channels. The adsorption properties of desolved 1 were investigated by H2, C2H2, CO2, and CH4 sorption experiments, which showed that 1 exhibited high uptake capacity for H2 at 77 K and C2H2 around room temperature. More importantly, the high C2H2 uptake capacity but low binding energy makes this MOF a promising candidate for effective C2H2 capture from C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/CH4 mixed gases with low regenerative energy cost. In addition, 1 shows potential application for the luminescence sensing of small aromatic molecules picric acid (PA) and p-xylene (PX).\n\nCrystal Structure and Topological Analysis\n\nThe crystal data analysis shows that compound 1 crystallizes in the chiral trigonal space group P3121 and exhibits a three-dimensional porous framework with two different types of 1D helical channels along the c axis. There are one and a half crystallographically independent Zn(II) centers and one bpydb2- and one atz- ligand in one asymmetric unit. Atom Zn1 (occupancy: 0.5) is four-coordinated by two triazole N atoms and two carboxylic O atoms from two different bpydb2- ligands, creating a tetrahedral geometry (see a). Zn2 is five-coordinated by two triazole N atoms and one pyridine N atom on the bpydb2- ligand, and the remaining sites are finished by two carboxylic O atoms from another bpydb2- ligand. The Zn-O bond lengths fall in the range of 1.954(1)-2.380(2) \u00c5, and the Zn-N bond lengths range from 2.010(7) to 2.056(2) \u00c5. Zn2 and its symmetry-related atom Zn2A are ligated by two atz- ligands to afford a Zn-atz \"paddle-wheel\" cluster which is further connected by the Zn1 atom along the c axis to give rise to an interesting 1D right-handed helical SBU chain with a diagonal distance of 2.8 \u00c5 (a and Figure S1 in the Supporting Infomation). It should be noted that the two amino groups on the atz- ligands point to the opposite direction, which might be attributed to the minimization of the interaction energy in the \"paddle-wheel\" cluster. To our knowledge, the combination of the Hatz ligands and Zn(II) ions tends to give Zn-triazolate layers, and 1 represents the first MOF based on the helical Zn-triazolate chain-like SBUs. Compared with the MOF constructed from the same bpydb2- ligand and datz- pillar, we can speculate that the asymmetry substituent group on the atz- ligand might be responsible for the formation of the helical chain. The Flack parameter of 1 is 0.01, which further demonstrates the validity of the absolute configuration. Three such 1D helical SBUs are connected with each other via bpydb2- ligands to give rise to a large trigonal channel with a sphere diameter ca. 6.8 \u00c5 (b and Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). It should be noted that the free NH2 groups are mostly located in the smaller channels formed by the 1D SBU chains. By considering the ligand as a three-connected node, Zn1 as a four-connected node, and the Zn-atz \"paddle-wheel\" as a six-connected node, the whole network of 1 can be viewed as a novel 3,4,6-connected net with the Schla\u0308fli symbol of (52.62.72)(52.6)2(53.62.77.82.9), which has not been reported in MOF chemistry (c). PLATON calculation reveals that 1 contains 63.5% solvent accessible voids (d), which is higher than that of the 4,4'-bpy pillared (51.5%) and datz- pillared (50%) MOFs reported earlier. \n\nPXRD and TGA Experiments\n\nThe phase purity of 1 was confirmed by the comparison of the simulated PXRD patterns from the crystal data with the experimental one (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). The TGA curve of 1 exhibits a weight loss of 38.1% from 50 to 284 \u00b0C (calcd: 37.7% for eight lattice guest DMA molecules; see Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). The guest-free phase 1a can be readily activated by exchanging the DMA with CH2Cl2 and then pumped under high vacuum at room temperature. Its framework integrity and full activation were further confirmed by PXRD measurements and TGA, respectively (Figures S3 and S4).\n\nGas Sorption Properties\n\nTo evaluate the permanent porosity of 1a, its N2 sorption isotherm was measured at 77 K (a). 1a shows a typical type-I sorption isotherm without hysteresis, giving a BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) surface area of 2340 m2/g and Langmuir surface area of 2393 m2/g; the BET surface area is similar to the one calculated from the Poreblazer_v3.0.2 (2388 m2/g). The saturated N2 uptake is 617 cm3/g, corresponding to a pore volume of 0.955 cm3/g. The GCMC simulated N2 sorption isotherm matches well with the one from the experimental result with a saturated N2 uptake of 626 cm3/g, indicating its full activation. Analysis of the pore size distribution from the N2 sorption data reveals a narrow distribution of micropores from 5.5 to 6.2 \u00c5. The low-pressure H2 adsorption isotherms for 1a were collected at 77 and 87 K. 1a adsorbs 1.93 wt % (214 cm3/g) of H2 at 77 K, and 1.17 wt % (130 cm3/g) of H2 at 87 K (b). Significantly, the H2 sorption data of 1a lie in the upper region of mixed-ligand MOFs. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation was used to evaluate the H2 isosteric heat, and its value at zero loading is 6.75 kJ/mol and decreases slowly with increasing H2 loading (Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). The Q st value of 1a at zero loading is comparable to those MOFs with open metal sites such as HKUST-1 (6.83 kJ/mol) and NOTT-122 (6.0 kJ/mol), indicating a moderately strong framework-H2 interaction. The storage capacities of 1a for H2 are still not saturated, which means that their uptake can be further maximized at higher pressure. According to the literature, the H2 adsorption of MOFs under low pressure is mainly influenced by pore size, open metal site, and functional groups on the organic ligand. The present H2 sorption behavior for 1a might be attributed to its unique 1D helical channels.\n\nThe unique helical channel-type structure and permanent microporosity in 1a motivated us to study its potential applications for the gas storage and separation around room temperature. The single-component adsorption isotherms for C2H2, CO2, and CH4 were collected and are plotted in c. Due to its large solvent accessible void, 1a could take up a high amount of C2H2 (218 cm3/g at 273 K and 120 cm3/g at 298 K) under 1 bar around room temperature. The C2H2 uptake value at ambient temperature is much higher than that of some promising MOFs with open metal sites and Lewis basic pyridyl sites used for selective C2H2 capture, such as UTSA-50 (91 cm3/g), UTSA-100a (95.6 cm3/g), M'MOF-3a (20 cm3/g), and UTSA-60a (70 cm3/g). As far as we know, 1a represents the best C2H2 adsorption property among the mixed-ligand MOFs. 1a shows moderate CO2 uptake with the values of 109 cm3/g at 273 K and 52 cm3/g at 298 K. It should be pointed out that the CO2 sorption isotherms show a linear increase without reaching saturation even at 1 bar (which could not), which indicates a lack of strong binding sites in the helical channels of 1a. This speculation is further supported by the isosteric heat of adsorption of CO2 calculated by using the virial equation, whose values are about 20 kJ/mol during the loading process (d). In addition, the Q st value at zero loading for C2H2 is 25 kJ/mol, and then decreases to 24 kJ/mol at higher loading, suggesting that there exist weak interaction sites for the C2H2 molecule in 1a. The Q st value of 1a for C2H2 at zero loading is much lower than that of many MOFs with open metal sites or polar donor atoms. These results show that the energy required for the regeneration of 1a will be lower than that of other MOFs for C2H2 capture, resulting in a significant energy savings and high working capacity for adsorption-desorption cycles. In addition, the CH4 sorption isotherms were also collected around room temperature, which showed the least uptake values (23 cm3/g at 273 K and 14 cm3/g at 298 K) among the gases studied.", "data":
