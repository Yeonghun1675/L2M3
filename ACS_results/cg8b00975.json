The six-coordinated Zn(II) ion adopts a distorted ZnN4O2 octahedron: four N atoms from four individual p-tr2Ph organic ligands and two O atoms of two distinct NO3 - anions to give a [Zn(\u03bc2-tr)2(\u03bc2-NO3)]+ (tr = triazolyl) structural unit (a). The [Zn(\u03bc2-tr)2(\u03bc2-NO3)]+ structural units could serve as the repeating fragments and self-assemble into a one-dimensional (1D) right-handed helical column.
