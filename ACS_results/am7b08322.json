The crystallographic equivalence may arise from a different disposition of the MII and MIII centers in different layers, as observed in the MnFe derivative (where the two metals are different but appear as equivalent). In fact, 1 and 2 are class II mixed-valence compounds, as is shown below, and at 120 K the electron is fully delocalized, rendering both Fe centers equivalent. The Fe-O bond distances in both compounds (2.0634(19) and 2.076(3) \u00c5 for 1 and 2, respectively) are between those found for the FeIIIFeIII (2.020(4)-2.028(5) \u00c5) and FeIIFeII derivatives (2.140(8) and 2.141(3) \u00c5 in two closely related 1D structures), in agreement with the expected average charge of +2.5 in 1 and 2 (Figure S4 and Table S1). In fact, the bond valence sum calculations give oxidation states of 2.465 for 1 and 2.381 for 2 when assuming Fe(II) centers and 2.637 for 1 and 2.547 for 2 when assuming Fe(III). Furthermore, although it could be argued that the two Fe centers could be Fe(III) ions (with the corresponding reduction of one of the three C6O4X2 2- ligands to the radical C6O4X2 3-, as observed in the [FeIIIFeIII(C6O4Cl2)3]2- and [FeIIIFeIII(C6O4Cl2)3]3- lattices), the C-O and C-C bond distances in the ligands clearly exclude this possibility because the reduction of the ligand implies an elongation of the C-O bonds and a shortening of the C-C ones (Table S1). Thus, the C-O bond distances (1.268(3) and 1.262(6) \u00c5 in 1 and 2, respectively) are shorter than those found in the reduced chloranilato ligands (1.280(6) \u00c5 when the charge is -2.67 and 1.298(9) \u00c5 for a charge of -3, Figure S5). Additionally, the C-C bond distances between the two carbon atoms connected to the oxygen atoms in 1 and 2 (1.529(5) and 1.534(9) \u00c5, respectively) are longer than those observed when the chloranilato ligands are reduced and present average charges of -2.67 or -3 (1.480(9) and 1.431(16) \u00c5, respectively, Table S1 and Figure S6). All of these data support the average oxidation state of +2.5 for the Fe atoms and a charge of -2 for the three anilato ligands in 1 and 2 and suggest that the reduction of the chloranilato ligand by the Fe(II) ions takes place only under hydrothermal conditions.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 19, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Structure of <bold>1</bold> (similar for <bold>2</bold>): (a) Side view of the alternating cationic and anionic\nlayers.

The activation energies are all very low, in the range 14-115 meV, and are lower in the high temperature regime (14-60 meV) than in the low temperature one (100-116 meV) (Table S2). The higher conductivity values found for compound 1 (one order of magnitude higher) confirm the idea that the electron delocalization is favored in compound 1 (in agreement with the susceptibility and EPR results). Thus, in 1, the smaller electron density in the anilato ring (due to the higher electron withdrawing ability of Cl) is expected to favor the electron jumping from one to the other Fe atom, resulting in a higher electron delocalization and, accordingly, in a higher electrical conductivity. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the \u03c3par values in 1 and 2 (0.03 and 0.003 S/cm, respectively) are much higher than those found in a pressed pellet of an amorphous compound with a similar composition although with NBu4 + as cation (2 \u00d7 10-5 S/cm) and of a related compound containing one-third of reduced chloranilate anions and [(H3O)2(phenazine)3]2+ dications (4 \u00d7 10-5 S/cm).

Furthermore, when the solvent molecules are removed in A, T c and the conductivity decrease to 26 K and 1.0 \u00d7 10-3 S/cm, respectively. \n\nThe eclipsed packing of the hexagonal layers gives rise to large hexagonal pores running along the c direction with 15.8073(2) \u00c5 diameter in 1 and 15.9173(4) \u00c5 in 2 (measured as the longest Fe-Fe distance in the hexagon). These channels represent ca. 21% of the total space (). These hexagonal channels in 1 and 2 are slightly larger than those in the related [FeIIIFeIII(C6O4Cl2)3]2- lattice (where the Fe-Fe distance is 15.6614(6) \u00c5), in agreement with the larger bond distances expected for Fe(II) compared with Fe(III) ions. The X-ray analysis and the thermogravimetric analysis (Figure S7) show the presence of 12 water molecules disordered in the hexagonal channels in both compounds. Half of these molecules are coplanar to the anionic layer and the other half with the cationic layer, although the exact position of these water molecules cannot be located because they are disordered and appear on special positions (a mirror plane for O3W and a twofold axis for O2W). These guest molecules can be partly exchanged with other molecules or partially removed without collapsing the structure (Figures S16 and S17), as already observed in other similar [M2(C6O4Cl2)3]n- 2D lattices. \n\nElectrical Conductivity\n\nThe electron delocalization found in these compounds is further confirmed by the electrical conductivity measurements performed on several single crystals of both compounds with the current along the hexagonal faces of the single crystals (parallel to the ab plane, \u03c3par) or perpendicular to them (along the c direction, \u03c3per). The \u03c3par measurements show that both compounds are semiconductors with relatively high room temperature conductivities of ca. 0.03 and 0.003 S/cm for 1 and 2, respectively (Table S2 and ). As expected, the room temperature conductivity perpendicular to the hexagonal layers (\u03c3per) is much lower (ca. 1 \u00d7 10-4 and 6 \u00d7 10-6 S/cm, Table S2), resulting in \u03c3par/\u03c3per anisotropy values of ca. 300 and 500 in 1 and 2, respectively. The thermal variation of \u03c3par and \u03c3per shows a classical Arrhenius behavior for both compounds with two different semiconducting regimes (insets in ). The activation energies are all very low, in the range 14-115 meV, and are lower in the high temperature regime (14-60 meV) than in the low temperature one (100-116 meV) (Table S2). The higher conductivity values found for compound 1 (one order of magnitude higher) confirm the idea that the electron delocalization is favored in compound 1 (in agreement with the susceptibility and EPR results). Thus, in 1, the smaller electron density in the anilato ring (due to the higher electron withdrawing ability of Cl) is expected to favor the electron jumping from one to the other Fe atom, resulting in a higher electron delocalization and, accordingly, in a higher electrical conductivity. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the \u03c3par values in 1 and 2 (0.03 and 0.003 S/cm, respectively) are much higher than those found in a pressed pellet of an amorphous compound with a similar composition although with NBu4 + as cation (2 \u00d7 10-5 S/cm) and of a related compound containing one-third of reduced chloranilate anions and [(H3O)2(phenazine)3]2+ dications (4 \u00d7 10-5 S/cm).
