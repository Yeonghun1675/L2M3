Moreover, the Zn5 MOF exhibits ultralong-lived afterglow emission, and the visualization of different colors of fluorescence/phosphorescence also provides an opportunity for potential anticounterfeiting applications. Furthermore, it presents temperature-dependent fluorescence and phosphorescence, which may serve as a heat-responsive dual photoemission switch from 300 to 380 K. Therefore, this work not only provides new types of cluster-based MOFs with tunable fluorescence and phosphorescence by modulation of spatial orientations between phosphor ligands, but also supplies a temperature-responsive phosphorescence switch for sensor applications. It is expected that the strategy to modulate excited singlet and triplet states can be extended to other cluster-based MOF systems for the design of persistent luminescent materials.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 22, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Experimental Section</title><p>Details of the experimental procedures are reported in the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.8b11039/suppl_file/am8b11039_si_001.pdf\">Supporting Information</ext-link>.</p><p>The Supporting Information\nis available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsami.8b11039\">10.1021/acsami.8b11039</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>PXRD patterns\nof simulated and as-synthesized Zn<sub>5</sub> and Zn<sub>3</sub> (Figure\nS1); 3D network of Zn<sub>5</sub> and Zn<sub>3</sub> viewed along\nthe <italic>a</italic> axis and\n[101] direction, respectively, as a ball-and-stick representation\n(Figure S2); scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image for Zn<sub>5</sub> and Zn<sub>3</sub> (Figure S3); fitting goodness for the phosphorescence\nlifetime values of H<sub>2</sub>BIPA, Zn<sub>5</sub> and Zn<sub>3</sub>, in order (Figure S4); halogen-bonding interactions in H<sub>2</sub>BIPA, heavy-atom-based halogen-bonding layer, and hydrogen-bonding\nlayer in pristine H<sub>2</sub>BIPA (Figure S5); halogen-bonding interactions\nin Zn<sub>3</sub> MOF (Figure S6); halogen-bonding interactions in\nZn<sub>5</sub> MOF (Figure S7); electron-density distributions of\nvarious orbitals in Zn<sub>5</sub> (Figure S8); electron-density distributions\nof various orbitals in Zn<sub>3</sub> (Figure S9); phosphorescence\nspectra (a) and time-resolved emission decay curves (b) of Zn<sub>5</sub> at 300 and 380 K (Figure S10); fluorescent and phosphorescent\nCIE 1931 of Zn<sub>5</sub> at different temperatures (Figure S11);\nthermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves of Zn<sub>5</sub> and Zn<sub>3</sub> (Figure S12); PXRD patterns before and after heating Zn<sub>5</sub> to 380 K (Figure S13); crystallographic data and structure\nrefinement details for Zn<sub>5</sub> (Table S1); selected bond distances\nand bond angles for Zn<sub>5</sub> (Table S2); crystallographic data\nand structure refinement details for Zn<sub>3</sub> (Table S3); selected\nbond distances and bond angles for Zn<sub>3</sub> (Table S4); CIE\n1931 color coordinates of H<sub>2</sub>BIPA, Zn<sub>5</sub> and Zn<sub>3</sub>, at room temperature (Table S5); comparison of RTP QY values\nin this work with as-reported MOF systems (Table S6), and different\nkinds of halogen bond and the bond lengths in  H<sub>2</sub>BIPA,\nZn<sub>5</sub> and Zn<sub>3</sub> (Table S7) (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.8b11039/suppl_file/am8b11039_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "Experimental Section\n\nDetails of the experimental procedures are reported in the Supporting Information.\n\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b11039.
