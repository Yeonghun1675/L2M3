The asymmetric unit consists of seven and a half crystallographically unique CuII centers with the closest non-bonding Cu1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu4 separation of 3.0483(6) \u00c5, three fully deprotonated dhs4- components (two (2S,3S)-dhs related to C2/C3 and C6/C7 atoms and one (2R,3R)-dhs related to C10/C11 atoms), three \u03bc3-OH -  anions, five water ligands, and ten lattice water molecules. All CuII centers are almost coplanar, from the central Cu1 ion to the interior six-membered CuII ring (Cu2-Cu3-Cu4-Cu2A-Cu3A-Cu4A), the exterior six-membered CuII ring (Cu5-Cu6-Cu7-Cu5A-Cu6A-Cu7A), and the terminal Cu8 and Cu8A ions in each pentadeca-nuclear unit of [Cu15(dhs)6(OH)6(H2O)10].

The second type (Cu2, Cu3, and Cu4 in the interior six-membered CuII ring) resides in a penta-coordinated square pyramid, in which the basal plane is defined by two \u03bc3-OH- anions (Cu-O = 1.940(3)-1.995(3) \u00c5) and two \u03bc2-O- groups in a dhs4- ligand (Cu-O = 1.924(3)-1.981(3) \u00c5), while the apical sites are occupied by one \u03bc2-H2O ligand (Cu-O = 2.294(4)-2.416(4) \u00c5). Here, the \u03c4 values are 0.01 for Cu2, 0.02 for Cu3, and 0.11 for Cu4, indicating their nearly ideal square-pyramidal coordination geometries. The third type (Cu5, Cu6, and Cu7 in the exterior six-membered CuII ring) has two \u03bc2-O- groups (Cu-O = 1.911(4)-1.949(3) \u00c5) and two carboxylate oxygen atoms (Cu-O = 1.930(4)-1.959(4) \u00c5) from two different dhs4- ligands in the square planar coordination environment.
