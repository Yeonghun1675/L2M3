In order to probe any SMM behavior, ac magnetic susceptibilities were performed for 1 and 2 in the temperature range 2-20 K with zero dc field, and frequency-dependent out-of-phase signals for 1 were observed, meaning that 1 has an Ising-type anisotropy, but the maximum of \u03c7\" is lower than 2 K (Figure S6 in the ). Comparably, out-of-phase susceptibility for 2 is negligible (Figure S7 in the ). The behavior of 1 indicates the presence of slow magnetization relaxation, but the relaxation time and energy barrier cannot be deduced from these data because of the restriction of the instruments without full peak observed above 2.0 K. This phenomenon may originate from the presence of quantum tunneling of magnetization (QTM), and QTM may be suppressed by applying a static dc field. Therefore, the frequency dependence of ac susceptibility was obtained under a static dc field of 5000 Oe for 1. As expected, QTM is partially suppressed, and the maxima of the \u03c7\" values were shifted to higher temperature above 2.0 K and detected for frequencies higher than 3111 Hz for 1 (Figure ). The relaxation time was extracted from the temperature of the maximum \u03c7\"(\u03c9) as \u03c4(T max) = \u03c9-1, and the magnetization relaxation time (\u03c4) follows the Arrhenius law, \u03c4 = \u03c40 exp(E a/k B T). The solid line in Figure  (inset) shows the result of a least-squares fit of the ac susceptibility relaxation data between 3111 and 9111 Hz to the Arrhenius equation, giving an energy gap (E a/k B) of 7.6 K and a preexponential factor \u03c40 = 1.9 \u00d7 10-6 s for 1.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 13, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>The obtained parameters are in the region of some reported Dy<sup>III</sup> SMMs (the lowest-energy barrier reported is 6.2 K) and confirm the SMM behavior of 2D complex <bold>1</bold>.
