The adsorption kinetics are very slow (ca. 50 h for an adsorption-desorption cycle) and is likely linked to a hindered diffusion of the H2 molecules through ultramicropores of comparable size. Given the close match between the pore size of the polymer and the kinetic dimensions of the adsorbate, the interaction potential of the H2 molecules is expected to be very strong, due to the synergic effect of neighboring pore walls. Other authors have also attributed this  behavior to additional steric hindrance caused by adjacent guests (kinetic trapping). Such slow desorption kinetics25 might be the result of the high H2 loading of the porous framework at low pressures, which impedes the flexibility and window-opening.
