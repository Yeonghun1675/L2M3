UNLPF-10 exhibits excellent stability indicated by its well-preserved crystalline nature after reactions (Figure S3-4, ). Importantly, it can also be repeatedly used without decrease of activity (Table , entry 12). The possible overoxidized byproduct, sulfone, was not detected, suggesting that the reaction involves the singlet oxygen pathway, which was further supported by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and a control reaction performed in the deuterated solvent (d 4-MeOD) (see  for details).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 14, "type": "table", "classification": null, "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Photo-Oxygenation of Sulfides</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic content-type=\"header\" id=\"fx1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ja-2014-092672_0005.tif\" xlink:type=\"simple\"></graphic>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup align=\"left\" cols=\"4\">\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">entry</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">substrate</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">conversion<xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"t1fn1\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">time (h)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>1</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1a</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>&gt;99%</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>8</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>2</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1b</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>96%</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>18</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>3</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1c</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>73%</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>24</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>4</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1d</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>98%</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>18</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>5</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1e</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>&gt;99%</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>18</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>6</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1f</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>92%</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>24</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>7</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1g</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>97%</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>24</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>8</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1h</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0%</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>48</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>9</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1a</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0%<xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"t1fn2\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>48</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>10</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1a</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0%<xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"t1fn3\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>48</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>11</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1a</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2%<xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"t1fn4\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>48</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>12</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1a</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>97%<xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"t1fn5\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>8</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>13</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1a</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>31%<xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"t1fn6\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>18</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>14</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1a</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>73%<xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"t1fn7\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>18</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n<table-wrap-foot>\n<fn id=\"t1fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>Determined by <sup>1</sup>NMR.</p>\n</fn>\n<fn id=\"t1fn2\">\n<label>b</label>\n<p>No light.</p>\n</fn>\n<fn id=\"t1fn3\">\n<label>c</label>\n<p>No catalyst.</p>\n</fn>\n<fn id=\"t1fn4\">\n<label>d</label>\n<p>Under an Ar atmosphere.</p>\n</fn>\n<fn id=\"t1fn5\">\n<label>e</label>\n<p>After 5th recycle of UNLPF-10.</p>\n</fn>\n<fn id=\"t1fn6\">\n<label>f</label>\n<p>TPP used as the catalyst.</p>\n</fn>\n<fn id=\"t1fn7\">\n<label>g</label>\n<p>In-TPP used as the catalyst.</p>\n</fn>\n</table-wrap-foot>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 15, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>We next demonstrated that the controllable\nin situ metalation of\nUNLPF-10 leads to its tunable photocatalytic activity: the rate of\nphoto-oxygenation of thioanisole increased as the percent of In-porph\nsites increased (Figure ).
