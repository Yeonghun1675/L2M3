The brominated MOFs (1-Br  2  ) and (2-Br  2  ) were examined by single crystal X-ray diffraction (a) and found to retain the same Fm3\u0305m space group as their parent structures, with bromination resulting in a shortening of the unit cell edges from 30.2386(4) \u00c5 for (1) to 29.861(2) \u00c5 for (1-Br  2  ). This mechanical contraction of the frameworks, a 3.7% decrease in unit cell volume, occurs without damaging the crystal and is a result of the edb2- linker shortening on bromination to edb-Br2 2-, which is evident when examining other crystallographic parameters such as solvent accessible void space (see , Section S10). Comparison of the calculated PXRD pattern from the crystal structure of (1-Br  2  ) with the experimental pattern of the bulk brominated material (b) confirms that the stereoselective bromination proceeds quantitatively and produces phase pure material. The bent edb-Br2 2- linkers lie disordered along the [110] mirror plane and are geometrically frustrated as a result of the nonlinearity that originates from the sp2 carbon atoms at their centers. The ligands adopt two different positions (c), each of which has its own end-to-end orientational disorder (d). Despite the disorder, it is clear that the bromination has proceeded stereoselectively to yield only trans-edb-Br2 2-; similar end-to-end disorder has previously been observed in the crystal structure of trans-dibromo-stilbene (e). The crystal structure of (2-Br  2  ) is isostructural, with an unambiguously trans-edb-Br2 linker and similar mechanical contraction (see , Section S10).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 13, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>In conclusion,\nwe have demonstrated a rare example of postsynthetic\nmodification of an integral component of a MOF linker in a SCSC manner,\nstereoselectively and quantitatively brominating internal alkynes\nin the Zr- and Hf-MOFs <bold>(1)</bold> and <bold>(2)</bold>.
