These supramolecular coordination polymers are isostructural and exhibit rare 3D compact networks composed of 2D noninterpenetrating double anionic layers with a topology of (6, 3) linked by the hexaqua metal cation {[M(H2O)6]2+} n  layers through hydrogen bonds. Further investigations with thermogravimetric analysis, elemental analysis, and powder X-ray diffraction methods indicate that the transformation from the crystal form of {[ML(H2O)3]2[M(H2O)6](H2O)3} n  to the amorphous powder of [M3L2] n  is reversible, and the dried amorphous powder of [M3L2] n  may be applied to the absorption of water and water vapor.

In summary, our research demonstrates for the first time that ligand L could be as a potential building block to construct novel dynamic supramolecular architectures with interesting properties.
