Six new Zn-BTC-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) were successfully fabricated by a surfactant-thermal method. Our results indicated that different surfactants can be used as reaction media for the synthesis of crystalline MOFs with interesting structures. We believe that the surfactant-thermal method should be a promising strategy to prepare various bulky crystal materials with diverse structures and interesting properties.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 14, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Experimental details, summary\nof crystal and structure refinement data, crystal structures of MOFs,\npowder-XRD pattern, TGA curves, and CIF files.
