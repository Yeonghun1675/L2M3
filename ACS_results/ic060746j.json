Owing to this supramolecular structure, the magnetic susceptibility measurement demonstrates the antiferromagnetic interactions between CuII S = 1/2 spins mediated by BP-TTF donors, namely, d-\u03c0 interactions. A further study aimed at the synergetic action of magnetism and conductivity in the novel CuII complex with other pyrazino-fused donors is promising to open to the novel d-\u03c0 system.
