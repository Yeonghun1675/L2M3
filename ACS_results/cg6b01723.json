As mentioned previously, the deprotonated form of this ligand favors high-dimensional frameworks owing to the N1, N2, N4 bridging mode, and no low-dimensional cobalt 1,2,4-triazole based materials have been reported so far. For this reason, our syntheses were carried out under strong acidic conditions. The pH-controlled change of the coordination mode has been previously investigated in polydentate carboxylate based materials. This approach enabled tuning of the dimensionality of the related networks. However, this approach has not been explored up to now in systems with azole ligands. By preventing the deprotonation of the 1,2,4- triazole ligand in our syntheses, we could obtain low-dimensional structures. Compound 1 is built of Co(Htrz)Cl2 chains similar to those observed in Cu(Htrz)Cl2, while compound 2 exhibits the same trinuclear [Co3(Htrz)6(H2O)6]6+ cations as in [Ni3(Htrz)6(H2O)6](NO3)6. The crystal structure of 1 and 2 can also be compared to the 3D Co2(trz)3Cl compound reported by Ouellette et al. In this latter compound, chains of {Co(trz)3} are connected to each other owing to coordination of the 1,2,4-triazolate ligand through the N4 binding site. In compounds 1 and 2, this site is terminal due to its protonation which prevents the propagation of the coordination in three dimensions (). Similarly to 1 and 2, antiferromagnetic interactions occur between Co(II) centers in Co2(trz)3Cl. However, the arrangement of the metal centers in the 3D network leads to a competition between different antiferromagnetic interactions resulting in a canted antiferromagnetic ordered phase below 9 K.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 24, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig5\" position=\"float\">\n<label>5</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Comparison of the crystal\nstructures of (a) Co<sub>2</sub>(trz)<sub>3</sub>Cl reported by Ouellette\net al.,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref27\"></xref> (b) <bold>1</bold> and (c) <bold>2</bold>.
