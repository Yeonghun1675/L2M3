Calcd for C28H20CuN2O4: C, 65.68; H, 3.94; N, 5.47%. ESI-MS: m/z 512.1 [Cu(L3)2 + H]+.\n\nMetallogel Preparation and Characterization\n\nFor investigating metallogel formation, solutions of ligand HL2 (0.2 mmol, 45.05 mg) and CuCl2\u22c52H2O (0.2 mmol, 34.11 mg) in 20 mL of an acetonitrile/water mixture (v/v 1:1) were prepared and mixed in varying mole fractions (x) between x (ligand) = 0.1 and 0.9. Gelation was obtained immediately in the samples for mole fractions between x (ligand) = 0.2-0.6. SEM analyses were undertaken on xerogel samples with an average thickness of 4-6 mm formed by evaporation of the gel to dryness under vacuum at 120\u00b0 for 6 h. Sample preparation involved placing a dry amount of gel on carbon-coated grids and sputtering with a Au/Pd alloy. Cryogel samples were obtained by freezing the gel samples at -20\u00b0. The overlaying solvent was removed, and the samples were evaporated to dryness at -10\u00b0 and 0.370 mbar overnight using a freeze dryer. Sample preparation involved placing a dried amount of gel on grids, coating with silver lacquer, and then sputtering with a Au/Pd alloy. Images were obtained using a DSM 982 Gemini (Zeiss) and accelerating voltage of 3 and 5 kV.", "data": null, "include_properties": [], "intermediate_step": {"text-synthesis-type": "[]"}}, {"idx": 16, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>X-ray structures of (a) HL<sup>1</sup>, (b) HL<sup>2</sup>, and (c) HL<sup>3</sup> showing the intramolecular hydrogen bonds.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"cg-2010-01629w_0002.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  X-ray structures of (a) HL1, (b) HL2, and (c) HL3 showing the intramolecular hydrogen bonds.
