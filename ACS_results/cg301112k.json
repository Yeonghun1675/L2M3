The three compounds comprise short La\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5La distances of 6.2410(10), 5.7098(14), and ca. 5.84 \u00c5 for 1, 2, and 5, respectively, and long La\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5La distances of 12.7044(19), 11.822(2), and ca. 12.18 \u00c5, for 1, 2, and 5, respectively. When the structure of 1 is compared in detail with those of 2 and 5, we note that the two structures are highly superimposable, despite their different La:H4-x pmd-x  proportions in the empirical formula. From only a structural point of view, 1 can be transformed into 2 or 5 by the formation of new O-P-O bridges and the intercalation of additional La3+ centers between the 1D polymers, while eliminating the excess of water molecules. The need for the addition of La3+ is compatible with the higher content of these cations in the crystal structures of 2 and 5 in comparison with 1.

In compound 2, the coordination spheres around the metal centers are fused through a bridging oxygen atom, whereas in 5, all the oxygen atoms from the -PO3 moieties are directly connected to the metal center through single La-O bonds.
