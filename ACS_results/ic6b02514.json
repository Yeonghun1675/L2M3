CuI1 and CuI3 show three-coordinate modes, while CuII2 has an octahedral geometry (a). CuI1 (or CuI3) is coordinated by two 5-eatz ligands and a CN- ligand. The octahedral CuII2 is chelated by two 5-eatz ligands and coordinated by one NO3 - and one H2O molecule (a). The CuII(5-eatz)2 subunits are connected to a Z-type chain by two CuI ions. The resulting chains are further linked into a layer by CN- ligands (b). Finally, the wavelike layers are connected into a 3D framework by ligand-unsupported Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu interactions. Strong Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu interactions, with a distance of 2.695 \u00c5, are observed between the layers. The 3D framework of 1 shows 1D channels along the a axis. The size of each channel is ca. 8.0 \u00c5 \u00d7 7.0 \u00c5 (c). To emphasize, there are NO3 - and H2O molecules hanging along the wall of the 1D pore, which can form hydrogen bonding with the guest (d). The void volume of the pores was calculated using PLATON to be 27% of the unit cell volume. The CO2 gas adsorption was measured to evaluate the porosity of 1. The adsorption isotherm curves show that 1 can take up 30, 40, and 92 cm3 g-1 CO2 gas at 292, 273, and 195 K, respectively (Figure S3). The low adsorption capacities indicate that 1 has a low superficial area.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "Compound 1", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "Cu3(5-eatz)4(CN)2(NO3)(H2O)"}, "crystal system": [{"value": "tetragonal", "condition": ""}], "space group": [{"value": "P212121", "condition": ""}], "porosity": [{"probe": "", "value": "27", "unit": "%", "condition": "calculated using PLATON"}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "30", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "temperature": "292 K", "pressure": "", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "40", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "temperature": "273 K", "pressure": "", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "92", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "temperature": "195 K", "pressure": "", "condition": ""}]}]]], "include_properties": ["crystal_system", "space_group", "porosity", "gas_adsorption"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['crystal_system', 'space_group', 'porosity', 'gas_adsorption']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"Compound 1\",\n            \"symbol\": \"1\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"Cu3(5-eatz)4(CN)2(NO3)(H2O)\"\n        },\n        \"crystal system\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"tetragonal\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"space group\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"P212121\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"porosity\": [\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"27\",\n                \"unit\": \"%\",\n                \"condition\": \"calculated using PLATON\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"CO2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"30\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"292 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"CO2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"40\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"273 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"CO2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"92\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"195 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 10, "type": "table", "classification": ["Property"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Enantioselective Separation for Racemates at Room\nTemperature<xref rid=\"t1fn1\"></xref>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"fx1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2016-02514u_0005.tif\"></graphic>\n<table-wrap-foot>\n<fn id=\"t1fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>For details, see\nthe Experimental Section in the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b02514/suppl_file/ic6b02514_si_001.pdf\">Supporting Information</ext-link>.</p>\n</fn>\n<fn id=\"t1fn2\">\n<label>b</label>\n<p>Determined by GC (letters\nin brackets specify the preferable isomer), and the deviations for\nthe ee values are less than 5%.</p>\n</fn>\n</table-wrap-foot>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "Empty Content", "data": [["No properties found"]], "include_properties": [], "intermediate_step": {"table-convert2MD": "[gpt.ft]Empty Content\n<END>", "table-categorize": "Property", "table-property-type": "[]"}}, {"idx": 6, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Synthesis Route of Compound <bold>1</bold>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2016-02514u_0004.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Synthesis Route of Compound 1    ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 8, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Coordination environment of <bold>1</bold>.
