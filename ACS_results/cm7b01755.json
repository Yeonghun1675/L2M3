As increasing \u0394E Q values correspond to an increasing EFG around the iron atoms, it is therefore possible to assign each doublet to one of the three types of helical chains based on differences in local coordination: Q1 (\u0394E Q = 0.995 mm/s) corresponds to Chain 1, which contains metal centers coordinated by six formate oxygens; Q2 (\u0394E Q = 1.305 mm/s) corresponds to Chain 2, where one formate oxygen is replaced by a neutral water oxygen, leading to a slightly more distorted environment and a larger EFG; Q3 (\u0394E Q = 1.999) corresponds to Chain 3, which is by far the most distorted with four short Fe-O bonds and two long Fe-Cl bonds. This value is also similar to what was observed for FeCl4(OOCH)2 octahedra connected in zigzag chains. These measurements confirm that none of the iron atoms are in the +3 oxidation state, as would be expected if the covalently bound water in Chain 2 was instead a hydroxide group, and this distinction is further supported by the results of neutron powder diffraction (see below).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 22, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig3\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>\n<sup>57</sup>Fe Mo\u0308ssbauer spectra\nof Fe<sub>3</sub>(OOCH)<sub>5</sub>Cl\u00ad(OH<sub>2</sub>) collected at\n293 K (top) and 6 K (bottom).\nExperimental data: black circles; calculated spectrum: black lines;\ncomponent spectra: magenta, cyan, and yellow lines.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr3\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cm-2017-01755e_0003.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 3   57Fe Mo\u0308ssbauer spectra of Fe3(OOCH)5Cl(OH2) collected at 293 K (top) and 6 K (bottom).
