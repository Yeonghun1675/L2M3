Computational analysis revealed that the major reason for the versatile coordination of the ligands can be found in the geometry of the free ligands, especially the torsional behavior of the oxime tail, which in turn is affected by weak intramolecular interactions between the different groups. The differences in the coordination strength can also be rationalized via additional stabilizing intramolecular interactions formed in the coordination, including fairly strong argentophilic interactions obtained in the dinuclear complexes 3 and 6 with bridging imidazole oximes. Additionally, the counterions were found to have a role in packing of the solid state structures, for example, by binding adjacent rows or dimers to more extended structures via intermolecular noncovalent interactions.
