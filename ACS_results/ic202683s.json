The low uptake of N2 prompted the examination of these frameworks with CO2 at 196 K (Figure ).

The PXRD patterns of the activated DMOF-1-dcppy and DMOF-1-bpdc showed differences in the reflections at high-angles, as well as peak-broadening (). These differences may be due to a phase-transition of framework or to degradation of the framework upon activation. It is not uncommon that the DMOF framework shows peak broadening in the PXRD upon activation. However, the changes in the positions of specific reflections are generally indicative of a phase-transition of the framework.

To this solution, 4,4'-bpy (32 mg, 0.2 mmol) was added. The solution was then transferred to a scintillation vial and heated at a rate of 2.5 \u00b0C/min from 35 to 100 \u00b0C. The temperature was then held for 24 h and then cooled to 35 \u00b0C at a rate of 2.5 \u00b0C/min. The resulting clear rod-type crystals were then washed with DMF (3 \u00d7 10 mL). The solvent was then exchanged for ethyl acetate (3 \u00d7 10 mL) where the crystals were left for 3 days, replacing the solution with fresh ethyl acetate every 24 h.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name":
