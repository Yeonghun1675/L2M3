The phase purity of the as-prepared sample was confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction analysis (Figure S2). Single-crystal X-ray structure determination revealed that MOF1 crystallizes in triclinic crystal system with the centrosymmetric, P1\u0305 space group and exhibits a 2D network structure, and it is isostructural to the previously reported MOF. The asymmetric unit consists of one and half Ni(II) ions, one [Ni-HTCPP]3- metalloligand, one coordinated DMF, two coordinated water molecules and one bridging water molecule including two guest DMF molecules (). The central Ni(II) atom (Ni3) of Ni3 cluster occupies an inversion center with distorted octahedral geometry and coordinated by four carboxylate oxygen (O8, O8a, O5 and O5a; a = -x, -y, -z) atoms placed in the equatorial plane. The axial positions are occupied by oxygen (O9 and O9a; a = -x, -y, -z) atoms of two bridging water molecules (Figure S3). The terminal Ni(II) ion (Ni2) of Ni3 cluster is also in a distorted octahedral geometry with NiO6 chromophore satisfied by two carboxylate oxygen (O1 and O7) atoms and an oxygen (O12) atom of a coordinated DMF molecule and three oxygen (O9, O10, and O11) atoms from a bridging water molecule and two terminal water molecules, respectively. The Ni2-O and Ni3-O bond lengths are in the range of 2.006(3)-2.094(3) \u00c5 and 2.025(3)-2.0988(3) \u00c5, respectively (Table S1). Ni2 and Ni3 ions are bridged by two carboxylate oxygen (O7 and O8) atoms of porphyrin ligand and an oxygen (O9) atom of a water molecule forming a Ni3O16 cluster (Figure S3). Out of four carboxylate groups of [Ni-HTCPP]3- metalloligand, two are coordinating to each Ni2 and Ni3 in a monodentate \u03bc1-O fashion, the third carboxylate group bridges Ni2 and Ni3 through \u03bc1, \u03bc1-OO-fashion, and the fourth one is protonated (H4) ( and S4). If we consider the Ni3-oxo cluster as single node, then it is connected to six other nodes through four [Ni-HTCPP]3- SBUs which are acting as three connecting node resulting a (3, 6)-connected binodal net (a). The Ni(II) nodes are further extended in two dimensions to generate a 2D network (b). These 2D layers are stacked with each other through \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions to form a 3D supramolecular framework which houses 1D channels lined with free carboxylic acid groups with a dimension of ~5.0 \u00d7 9.0 \u00c52 running along crystallographic a-axis (, S5). Topological analysis by TOPOS suggests the presence of (3, 6)-connected binodal net and the overall structure has {43}2{46\u22c566\u22c583}-kgd topology (b). The structure possesses a solvent accessible void volume of ~27.3% (2748.3 \u00c53) per unit cell volume calculated using PLATON after the removal of guest DMF molecules.\n\nN2 Adsorption Studies and SEM Analysis\n\nAs mentioned before, single-crystal structural determination of MOF1 revealed that the compound is microporous with a pore diameter of ~5.0 \u00d7 9.0 \u00c52. For further confirmation of microporosity of 1, N2 adsorption measurements were carried out at 77 K. Prior to the adsorption measurements the sample (~0.13 g) was activated at 353 K under vacuum (18 mTorr) for 20 h. The adsorption measurements shows a type II isotherm (Figure S6) with a hysteresis behavior upon desorption which can be attributed to the framework flexibility and hindered diffusion through narrow pore apertures. The estimated BET surface area of MOF1 was found to be 80.4 m2 g-1. In order to check the particle size and morphology of the sample we recorded the SEM images of the as-synthesized sample of MOF1 (Figure S7). SEM images show rod-shape morphology with a particle size of 1-10 \u03bcm. This observation is also in accordance the estimated low value of BET surface area as discussed before.\n\nThermal Stability of MOF1 \n\nThermogravimetric analysis of MOF1 shows an initial weight loss of ~11.8% in the temperature regime 25-155 \u00b0C corresponding to the loss of two guest DMF molecules (ca. 12 wt %) (Figure S11). The second weight loss of ~9.6% in the temperature range of 155-250 \u00b0C corresponds to th eloss of one coordinated DMF and two coordinated water molecules (ca. 9.2 wt %), and the desolvated framework is stable up to 400 \u00b0C.
