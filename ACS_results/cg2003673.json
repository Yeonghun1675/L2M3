The other two carboxylate groups both chelate in a bidentate mode and a \u03bc3-chelating-bridging tridentate mode. Cd1 is seven-coordinate, and Cd2 is six-coordinate; they both bond to O atoms, of which one O atom is from a water molecule and the others are all from the L3- ligand. The bridging carboxylate groups of the L3- ligand link the Cd1 and Cd2 centers into an infinite 1D zigzag chain, as shown in Figure b, which contains nonbonded Cd\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cd contacts of 3.76 \u00c5. The Cd3 cation in an octahedral coordination sphere bonds with six O atoms, of which four O atoms come from two carboxylates with chelating coordination to the same Cd centers. The other two O atoms are from two water molecules, respectively. In compound 2, the Cd cations also have two coordination numbers: seven and six coordination spheres (Figure c). The Cd-O lengths are in the range 2.135(11)-2.587(10) \u00c5, which are all similar to those found in other Cd(II) compounds. The 3D framework contains three kinds of channels, namely, A, B, and C, along the a axis, with DMA molecules in channel B (Figure a). The desolvated framework shows 39.9% void space to the total crystal volume, as calculated by the PLATON. A better insight into the nature of this intricate framework is provided by a topology analysis, reducing multidimensional structures to simple nodes and connection nets. The Cd2(CO2)4 units can be regarded as 6-connected nodes and all crystallographical independent L3- ligands act as 3-connected linkers. Therefore, the whole structure can thus be represented as a 3,3,6-c net  sqc  network topology, which is noninterpenetrated (with the Schla\u0308fli symbol {4\u22c562}2{42\u22c5610\u22c583}) (Figure b).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 19, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig4\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Coordination environment of the Cd(II) ions in <bold>2</bold>.
