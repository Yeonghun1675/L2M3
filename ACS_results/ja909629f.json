Three different crystalline coordination polymers were synthesized using a solvothermal technique and were characterized using a variety of methods, including single-crystal X-ray diffraction, PXRD, TGA, IR spectroscopy, gas adsorption measurements, and luminescence measurements. The coordination polymer built from Ir[3-(2-pyridyl)benzoate]3, 1, was found to be highly porous with a nitrogen BET surface area of 764 m2/g, whereas the coordination polymers built from Ir[4-(2-pyridyl)benzoate]3, 2 and 3, were nonporous. The 3MLCT phosphorescence of each of the three coordination polymers was quenched in the presence of O2. However, only 1 showed quick and reversible luminescence quenching by oxygen, whereas 2 and 3 exhibited gradual and irreversible luminescence quenching by oxygen. The high permanent porosity of 1 allows for rapid diffusion of oxygen through the open channels, leading to efficient and reversible quenching of the 3MLCT phosphorescence.
