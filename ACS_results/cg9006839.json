It has a two-dimensional (2D) periodic layered structure comprising a one-dimensional (1D) {Ag2(CO2)2} chain substructure. As shown in Figure a, two crystallographically nonequivalent Ag(I) cations are present in the asymmetric unit of 1. They all feature highly disordered T-shaped geometries (neglecting the weak Ag\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O and Ag\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Ag interactions) with different coordination spheres: Ag(1) is ligated by two carboxylate oxygen atoms from two different dpa2- (Ag(1)-O(1) = 2.483 \u00c5, Ag(1)-O(2b) = 2.275 \u00c5) and one nitrogen atom (Ag(1)-N(1) = 2.203 \u00c5), while Ag(2) is coordinated exclusively by carboxylate oxygen atoms (Ag(2)-O, 2.260-2.414 \u00c5). The Ag-O bond distances are compatible with the values for its parent compound, [Ag2(dpa)] n  (8). However, the distances of Ag(1)-O(1b) (2.693 \u00c5), Ag(1)-O(3) (2.927 \u00c5) and Ag(2)-O(2b) (3.132) are beyond the range of 2.32-2.52 \u00c5 for silver(I) carboxylate but still shorter than the sum of van der Waals radii (3.24 \u00c5) of the Ag(I) cation and oxygen atom, suggesting non-negligible Ag-O interactions and explaining the deviation of Ag(I) centers from perfect T-shaped geometry. There are also two types of carboxylate groups in this structure which are embedded in the same dpa2- and endows dpa2- a \u03bc5-O,O,O',O'',O'' coordination mode. Taking weak Ag-O interactions into account, the coordination mode of dpa2- can be described as pseudo \u03bc5-(\u03b72-O,O'),(\u03b72-O',O''),(\u03b72-O',O''),(\u03b72-O'',O'''),O,O',O' (mode I in Scheme ) which has never been reported in dpa-containing compounds. The adjacent Ag(I) ions are connected by dpa2- to give 1D {Ag2(dpa)} covalent chain along the a axis (Figure b). The intrachain argentophilic interactions between Ag(1) and Ag(2) (The Ag(1)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Ag(2) distance of 2.948 \u00c5 is slightly longer than the Ag\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Ag separation of 2.88 \u00c5 in the metallic state but greatly shorter than the van der Waals contact distance for Ag\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Ag of 3.40 \u00c5, showing the existence of argentophilic interactions between them.) further consolidate the 1D chain substructure. Then, each 1D chain substructure is further linked to two neighboring ones by bpy ligands, resulting in the overall 2D wavy grid layer, in which the diphenyl groups of dpa2- protrude into the cavity to eliminate the inclusion of any guest molecules (Figure c). There is offset face-to-face \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 stacking interactions between one benzenyl ring of dpa2- and one pyridyl ring of bpy, which is confirmed by the centroid-to-centroid distance of 3.799 \u00c5 and the dihedral angle of 12.15\u00b0 between two corresponding planes defined by them. As a result, the strain deriving from the Ag-O connectivity and the \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 stacking interactions between dpa2- and bpy endows a torsion angle of 64.20\u00b0 between two phenyl rings of dpa2-, revealing that dpa2- is a chiral ligand in this complex. However, the adjacent chains are related by an inversion center, so compound 1 crystallizes in the centrosymmetric Pbca space group.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 22, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Its parent compound, [Ag<sub>2</sub>(dpa)]<sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">n</italic>\n</sub> (<bold>8</bold>), was studied previously by Wang et al.

The full-deprotonated dpa2- dianion contains two carboxylate groups that can be potentially exploited in hydrogen-bonding frameworks. However, water clusters in complexes of dpa2- have never been experimentally observed to the best of our knowledge. In this case, one uncoordinated carboxylate oxygen atom, four crystallographically lattice water molecules, and their symmetry-related ones link to each other forming a 1D water chain through hydrogen bonds (Figure c,d, ). Now we will describe the water chain stepwise. A centrosymmetric octameric core was constructed from a nonplanar eight-membered ring comprising pairs of O(1W), O(2W), O(3W) and uncoordinated O(3). The O\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O distances in the ring range from 2.742 to 2.875 \u00c5, leading to an average O\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O distance of 2.809 \u00c5 which is approximately the same as those observed in another analogous decameric water cluster and in the ice II phase (2.77-2.84 \u00c5), whereas the average O-O-O angle of 148\u00b0 is much larger than that for a ideal tetrahedral coordination around the water molecule. A pair of O2W is linked to the eight-membered ring through weak O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bonding interactions (O(2W)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O(3), 2.938(7) \u00c5), resulting in the formation of decameric water cluster. Adjacent decamers share a dimer of O1W giving rise to a quasi 1D water aggregate which is trapped by the supramolecular host framework (Figure c). Notably, this quasi 1D water aggregate is constructed from both lattice water molecules and uncoordinated carboxylate oxygen atom. This observation indicates that this 1D water aggregate is stablished not only by hydrogen bonds but by coordinative interactions, which is similar to the reported infinite chains of decameric water cluster (H2O)10 with similar configuration. The existence of a 1D water aggregate in this structure may have an important effect on consolidating the overall supramolecular structure because of versatile hydrogen bonds between a 1D water aggregate and the host framework. From another point of view, water molecules can be viewed as space fillers in this structure where there are cavities with an appropriate size for hosting them.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 37, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig6\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>6</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) ORTEP drawing showing the coordination environment of Ag(I) cations.

All these compounds are synthesized by introducing bpy into their parent compound and through controlled syntheses, illustrating that the structures of these compounds may be greatly influenced by the secondary bpy ligand, the molar ratio of components, and the pH value of the reaction. The structures of these compounds are characterized either by 1D chain substructures (compounds 1-5) or by 2D layer substructures (compounds 6 and 7), illustrating the rich supramolecular chemistry of the Ag/bpy/(H)dpa family. And various interactive modes between Ag(I) cations and Hdpa/dpa also have been observed in this work, showing that the Ag(I) cation has a tendency to adopt various bonding modes and coordination geometries. Most interesting about this work is that two true supramolecular isomers 4 and 5 are also observed with serendipity. Luminescent measurements reveal that compounds 2-7 are good candidates for photoactive materials owing to their strong luminescent emissions.
