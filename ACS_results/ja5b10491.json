For O2, N2, and CH4, no appreciable adsorption could be observed due to the nonporosity of the pseudo-1-D channels for these gas molecules. However, 1' adsorbs 111 mL (STP)/g (1.97 mmol CO2/mmol Mn or 21.6 wt %) of CO2 at 195 K, which may be due to its smallest kinetic diameter (3.3 \u00c5) enabling the access of CO2 into the pseudo-1-D channels. It is noted that there are approximately 4 molecules of CO2 per unit cell (Z = 2), in good agreement with the void volume of 1. As 1' does not adsorb N2 at 77 and 195 K (Figures S5 and S6), its surface area was calculated by CO2 adsorption at 195 K using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model to afford a surface area of 535 m2/g (Figure S7). The isosteric heat of adsorption, Q st for CO2 is calculated by the virial method to be 29-30 kJ/mol and does not change appreciably with loading (Figure S8), suggesting uniformity of binding sites. In addition, the Q st for CO2 of our compound is moderately high compared to MOFs with no open metal sites or polar functional groups such as MOF-508 [Zn(bdc)(bpy)0.5] (with Q st of 16-20 kJ/mol). From a practical standpoint, the constant and moderately high value of Q st at different loadings renders 1' useful for the effective separations of CO2 from other gases. The adsorption isotherm of C2H2 was obtained at 195 K (a,c). Unlike the CO2 case, a gated behavior (with P go = 1.45 kPa) was clearly observed. Below the gate opening pressure, adsorption of C2H2 is negligible, but an abrupt increase is observed after P go reaches 86.2 mL/g STP (1.55 mmol C2H2/mmol Mn). In sharp contrast, for CO2 the gas uptake is increasing monotonically and no clear gate opening behavior was observed even at low pressure region. This behavior is markedly different from other 0-D frameworks such as [Cu(etz)] (hetz = 3,5-diethyl-1,2,4-triazole) where gate opening pressures is observed for both CO2 and C2H2. \n\nAlthough the porosity of 2 is almost similar to that of 1' (17.5%, 172 \u00c53), which was also confirmed by a Type I isotherm of O2 at 90 K (Figure S20), now all adjacent 0-D kidney-shaped pores are merged and flattened to afford a single cigar-shaped pore of 2.7 \u00d7 3.4 \u00d7 13.5 \u00c53. Interestingly, in the CO2 gas adsorption isotherm at 273 K for 2 (), it is observed that its profile is linear with a significant decrease in uptake compared to the case for 1'. In addition, the uptake of CO2 (14.1 mL/g STP) and C2H2 (11.8 mL/g STP) at 91 kPa for 2 is now almost identical. This indicates that after photodimerization, in the pores of the resultant PCP, CO2 molecules cannot interact with phenylene rings efficiently because of the significant tilting of phenylene rings upon photodimerization, resulting in the loss of its inverse selectivity for CO2/C2H2 and its sorption behavior. It is noted that the ethylenic double bonds in 1' are not lining the pore surface; thus, they are not contributing to adsorption selectivity.
