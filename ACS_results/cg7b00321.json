The very steep N2 adsorption reaches the first short plateau with ~100 cm3/g of uptake at ~0.01 P/P 0. The second uptake starts at 0.023 P/P 0 and reaches a total uptake of 392 cm3/g at 0.96 P/P 0. While the specific pore volume of 1a that was estimated from the uptake amount of 100 cm3/g at 0.01 P/P 0 (0.155 cm3/g) is much smaller than the calculated specific pore volume of 1 from the single crystal structure (0.459 cm3/g), the specific pore volume of 1a estimated from the uptake amount of 392 cm3/g at 0.96 P/P 0, 0.606 cm3/g, is even larger than the calculated specific pore volume. 1a, with a partially collapsed pore, can be restored by N2 at 77 K. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of the partially collapsed 1a was calculated as 470 m2/g using the adsorption isotherm data of P/P 0 between 0.0006 and 0.0229. The BET surface area of the restored 1a calculated using the adsorption isotherm data of P/P 0 between 0.031 and 0.084 is 1510 m2/g, which is again slightly larger than the calculated BET surface area, 1260 m2/g, using the crystal structure model of 1. The hysteric desorption starts at the very low pressure, ~0.005P/P 0. There is only a negligible amount of N2 adsorption at 273 K, which is probably due to the weak interaction of N2 with the pore surface, even though 1a has some N2 accessible pores. The reversible N2 sorptions on 1a at 195 K confirm the presence of some N2 accessible pores. There is no stepwise adsorption, and the maximum adsorption amount at 1 bar is only 43 cm3/g.

The potential pore volume of 1 calculated using the SOLV option of PLATON corresponds to 1670 \u00c53 per unit cell, which is 44.2% of the total unit cell volume.\n\n 2 also contains orthorhombic cage-like pores with dimensions of 5.8 \u00d7 3.5 \u00d7 9.7 \u00c53, which are interlinked by several different kinds of narrow portals to form a 3-D porous structure as the orthorhombic cage-like pores of 1 (Figure S8). The reduction of the orthorhombic pore dimension in 2 compared to that in 1 comes mainly from the replacement of bipy pillars by short pz pillars. The potential pore volume of 2, 1127 \u00c53 per unit cell, is also significantly reduced compared to that of 1, 1670 \u00c53 per unit cell.\n\nThermal Properties of 2 \n\nThe thermal properties of 2 were evaluated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The analysis was performed using 2 presoaked in MC. The TGA profile indicates at least a six-step weight loss (Figure S10). The first two-step weight loss up to 150 \u00b0C (15.2 wt %) corresponds to the loss of 1.5 MC molecules (calcd. 12.7 wt %) and 1.5 H2O molecules (calcd. 2.5 wt %) in the pore. The next two-step weight loss from 150 to 380 \u00b0C corresponds to some pz pillars and water molecules. The weight loss from 150 to 270 \u00b0C (4.5 wt %) is the loss of a 0.6 pz pillar (calcd. 4.7 wt %). The amount of pz pillar loss during the heating process up to 270 \u00b0C was confirmed by the 1H NMR spectrum of the sample prepared by the same manner used for the TGA heating process. The weight loss from 270 to 300 \u00b0C (17.7 wt %) matches with the loss of two coordinated water molecules (calcd. 3.5 wt %) and 1.8 pz pillars (calcd. 14.2 wt %). Even though the boiling point of pz is higher than that of water, the loss of some pz linkers prior to that of the ligated water molecules is due to the intramolecular hydrogen-bond interaction of the water molecules with the carboxylate oxygens of the btc ligands (Figure S11). The final two-step weight loss that starts at 380 \u00b0C corresponds to the thermal decomposition of the remaining structure together with the loss of the remaining 0.6 pz pillar.\n\nSorption Behaviors of the MOFs\n\nGas Sorption Behaviors of 1a \n\nAlthough the PXRD pattern of activated 1a shows the loss of its crystallinity, it shows stepwise N2 adsorption and hysteric desorption at 77 K (a). The very steep N2 adsorption reaches the first short plateau with ~100 cm3/g of uptake at ~0.01 P/P 0. The second uptake starts at 0.023 P/P 0 and reaches a total uptake of 392 cm3/g at 0.96 P/P 0. While the specific pore volume of 1a that was estimated from the uptake amount of 100 cm3/g at 0.01 P/P 0 (0.155 cm3/g) is much smaller than the calculated specific pore volume of 1 from the single crystal structure (0.459 cm3/g), the specific pore volume of 1a estimated from the uptake amount of 392 cm3/g at 0.96 P/P 0, 0.606 cm3/g, is even larger than the calculated specific pore volume. 1a, with a partially collapsed pore, can be restored by N2 at 77 K. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of the partially collapsed 1a was calculated as 470 m2/g using the adsorption isotherm data of P/P 0 between 0.0006 and 0.0229. The BET surface area of the restored 1a calculated using the adsorption isotherm data of P/P 0 between 0.031 and 0.084 is 1510 m2/g, which is again slightly larger than the calculated BET surface area, 1260 m2/g, using the crystal structure model of 1. The hysteric desorption starts at the very low pressure, ~0.005P/P 0. There is only a negligible amount of N2 adsorption at 273 K, which is probably due to the weak interaction of N2 with the pore surface, even though 1a has some N2 accessible pores. The reversible N2 sorptions on 1a at 195 K confirm the presence of some N2 accessible pores. There is no stepwise adsorption, and the maximum adsorption amount at 1 bar is only 43 cm3/g. The interaction of N2 with the framework at 195 K is not strong enough for complete pore restoration.\n\nThe CO2 sorption behavior on 1a at 195 K is similar to the N2 sorption behavior at 77 K (b). The CO2 adsorption is also stepwise. The first steep adsorption reaches a plateau of ~100 cm3/g uptake at ~0.1 bar. The second adsorption step starts at ~0.16 bar and reaches a total uptake of 360 cm3/g at ~0.99 bar. The hysteric first desorption starts at ~0.1 bar, and the second desorption occurs at ~0.018 bar. In contrast, the CO2 sorptions on 1a at 273 and 298 K are different from that at 195 K. There is no hysteresis and no stepwise adsorptions. The maximum uptakes at 273 and 298 K are 66 and 52 cm3/g at 1.0 bar, respectively. The partially collapsed pore of 1a was not restored by CO2 adsorptions at both 273 and 298 K. The CO2 interactions with the framework of 1a at these temperatures were not strong enough for restoration of the partially collapsed pore. 1a shows reversible CH4 sorption at 195, 273, and 298 K, respectively, using its partially collapsed pore (Figure S18). However, the partially collapsed pore of 1a was not restored by CH4 adsorption, even at 195 K.\n\nThe N2 sorption isotherms on 2a and 3 at 77 K are typical type I isotherms (Figure S19). The pore volumes estimated from the maximum uptake amounts at the saturation pressure, 0.422 and 0.320 cm3/g, respectively, are approximately matched with the calculated values from the corresponding single crystal structures, 0.391 and 0.270 cm3/g, respectively. The BET surface areas of 2a and 3, 1060 m2/g and 810 m2/g, respectively, were calculated using the adsorption isotherm data of P/P 0 between 0.005 and 0.031 and between 0.0001 and 0.034, respectively. The isoreticular exchange of the long pillaring ligand bipy in 1a by short pillaring ligand pz in 2a leads to the reduction of the pore volume and the surface area. The partial and systematic removal of the pz ligand in 2a and the subsequent transformation of the framework structure to 3 further reduces the pore volume and the surface area.\n\nThe CO2 sorption behavior on 2a and 3 at 195 K are also similar to the corresponding N2 sorption behaviors (Figure S20). The CO2 sorption isotherms are typical reversible type I isotherms with no hysteresis. The maximum CO2 uptake on 2a and 3 at 1 bar is 247 and 193 cm3/g, respectively.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "pore volume": [{"probe": "", "value":
