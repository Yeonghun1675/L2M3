The use of bridging unit Ni(L)2 with close to 90\u00b0 angle between \"linking directions\" in combination of trigonal trinuclear pivalate Fe2CoO(Piv)6 resulted in formation of nonplanar 2D layers, the structure of which was significantly distorted compared to planar regular honeycomb, previously found in the case of linear or trigonal bridges.
