The weak but significant Ag\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7C interactions\ncorresponding to the C\ue5fcC bonds were also found in this type\nof interaction mode with the shortest intermolecular separation of\n3.16 \u00c5. If the first type of substrate\u2013framework interactions\nwas related to the trapping of the substrates, the latter is possibly\nrelated to the \u03c0 activation of the C\ue5fcC bonds. These morphological\ndifferences can be attributed to the dynamic interaction process from\nmolecular trapping to the substrate activation stage. From a mechanistic\nviewpoint, the dynamic reversible weak Ag\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O coordinate\nbonds first form to trap the molecules of <bold>1a</bold> within the\npores of the catalyst, fix the molecules close to the catalytic sites\nvia the weak Ag\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7C (aromatic ring) interactions, position\nthe C\ue5fcC bonds close to the silver chains, and finally form\nAg\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7C (C\ue5fcC bond) interactions, thus leading\nto a decrease in the electron density in the triple bonds and the\ndirect activation of them. This unique decentralized structural distribution\nof Ag chains endows the catalyst <bold>Ag-TCPE</bold> with the specific\nalkynophilicity.</p>", "clean_text": "One of the most outstanding features of the porous materials is their ability to accommodate molecules within their pores; the robust crystallinity of these networks facilitates the X-ray analysis of the encapsulated products. The definitive identification of the captured structure gives more information on the intermediate process of the catalytic reactions and has become an increasingly general method for catalytic studies. As postulated in the literature, the well-positioned catalytic Ag(I) sites and the crystalline properties of the frameworks facilitate deep structural analyses of the intermediates of the catalytic steps and provide knowledge of the activation nature of the C\ue5fcC bonds. Fortunately, the quality of substrate 1a-impregnated Ag-TCPE crystals was sufficient for X-ray structure analysis (noted as Ag-TCPE@1a). While the cell dimensions of the crystals are almost the same as those of the original, the strong interactions between the substrates and the frameworks lead to a change in symmetry from the space group C2/c to the space group P21/n. Clearly, the asymmetric unit of this structure contains four independent Ag(I) ions, each bound in a tetrahedral fashion with identical coordination modes. As shown in , two different types of 1a molecules were observed positioned close to the functional Ag chains within the frameworks. One type of 1a molecule exhibited a weak Ag\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O coordinate bond (the Ag\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O separation of 2.81 \u00c5). It is postulated that this type of interaction has the potential to supply the driving force for the substrate trapping in the cavity of catalyst Ag-TCPE. Several cooperative Ag\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C interactions were also found, which corresponded to the aromatic rings stabilizing the encapsulated mode. The distances between the Ag ions and the aromatic atoms of 3.29-3.33 \u00c5 were well within the reported range, probably providing additional driving force to fix the substrate close to the catalytic sites with the potential activated bonds well-positioned near the active silver sites. Another type of 1a molecule exhibited stronger Ag\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C interactions relevant to the aromatic rings, with the average separation compressed from 3.30 to 3.00 \u00c5, but showed much weaker Ag\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O interactions relevant to the hydroxyl group of propargylic alcohol (Ag\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O 3.46 and 2.81 \u00c5).

If the first type of substrate-framework interactions was related to the trapping of the substrates, the latter is possibly related to the \u03c0 activation of the C\ue5fcC bonds. These morphological differences can be attributed to the dynamic interaction process from molecular trapping to the substrate activation stage. From a mechanistic viewpoint, the dynamic reversible weak Ag\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O coordinate bonds first form to trap the molecules of 1a within the pores of the catalyst, fix the molecules close to the catalytic sites via the weak Ag\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C (aromatic ring) interactions, position the C\ue5fcC bonds close to the silver chains, and finally form Ag\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C (C\ue5fcC bond) interactions, thus leading to a decrease in the electron density in the triple bonds and the direct activation of them.
