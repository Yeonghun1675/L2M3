The large voids are filled by water molecules and H2bmib. Notably, the phenyl ring of Hcpip and the protonated 2-methylimidazolyl ring form C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interaction with the distance of carbon to the center of imidazolyl ring being 3.150 \u00c5.

To have a better insight into the fascinating 3-D structure, topological analysis is given. Taking the tetranuclear Cd(II) SBU as one node, each SBU becomes a 12-connected node; cpip and Hcpip can be regarded as two independent three-connected vertices. The interlinkage of these tetranuclear SBUs with three-connected cpip and Hcpip results in the formation of an unprecedented 3,3,12-connected topology (c).
