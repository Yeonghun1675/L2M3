The photoluminescent spectra of free neutral ligands L1-L2 and ODPTA measured at room temperature show the emission maxima at 423 (\u03bbex = 255) for L1, 420 (\u03bbex = 340) for L2, and 406 (\u03bbex = 354) nm for ODPTA, respectively. Compounds 1 and 2 based on L1 and L2 show the emission maxima at 383 (\u03bbex = 336) and 402 (\u03bbex = 340) nm, respectively. The emission of the ODPTA and L1-L2 ligands may be assigned to \u03c0* \u2192 n and \u03c0* \u2192 \u03c0 transitions of the intraligands. In comparison with the N-donor ligands and multicarboxylate ligand, the emission maxima of compounds 1 and 2 have changed and show blue shifts (Figure ). It is possible that a combination of several factors together, including a change in the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels of deprotonated ODPT4- anions and neutral ligands coordinating to metal centers, the charge-transfer transition between N-donor ligands and metal centers, N-donor ligands coordinating to the metal centers, which effectively increase the rigidities of the ligands and reduce the loss of energy by radiationless decay, and \u03c0* \u2192 n and \u03c0* \u2192 \u03c0 transitions of the intraligands. In comparison with 1 and 2, the emission differences between them may be caused by different neutral ligands.\n\nFor compound 1, the weight loss in the range of 17-165 \u00b0C corresponds to the departure of lattice water molecules (observed, 5.6%; calculated, 5.5%), the weight losses in the range of 273-512 \u00b0C correspond to the removal of the corresponding organic components, and the remaining weight corresponds to the formation of ZnO (observed, 16.8%; calculated, 16.2%). The anhydrous compound 2 begins to decompose at 202 \u00b0C and ends above 484 \u00b0C. The weight loss (found, 84.5%) corresponds to the loss of organic components (calculated, 85.2%). The remaining weight of 15.5% corresponds to the percentage (14.8%) of ZnO.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "peak spectrum": [{"value": "1650, 3400",
