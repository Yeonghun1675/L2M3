Moreover, interchain H-bonds are also key to the stabilization of open framework structures to allow for the hierarchical assembly of chiral porous solids of 3 and 4 based on both coordination and H-bonds. Although Lu and DEF guest molecules can be removed from 1 and 2 under vacuum at elevated temperatures, their framework structures have collapsed as evident from powder X-ray diffraction patterns (PXRDs). In stark contrast, py and water guest molecules of 3 and 4 can be readily removed by subjecting their freshly ground samples to a 10-2 Torr vacuum, and PXRDs of evacuated solids of 3 and 4 are essentially the same as those of pristine solids of 3 and 4, respectively. Interestingly, evacuated solids of 3 and 4 readily adsorb expected amounts of guest molecules upon exposure to their vapors, which provides further evidence for the framework stability of 3 and 4.
