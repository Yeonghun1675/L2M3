The glyme-solvated Li+ cations have many similarities to organic cations with delocalized and/or steric shielding of the positive charge. It is thus expected that the glyme-LiTFSI and -LiBETI solvates will also exhibit order-disorder solid-solid phase transitions. This is supported by visual observation. The glyme-LiTFSI and -LiBETI crystalline solvates which display subambient temperature phase changes appear as waxy solids at room temperature rather than white, brittle solids.
