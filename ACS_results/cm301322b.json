The Q st value is higher than other anionic frameworks, such as the 21 kJ/mol in H3[(Cu4Cl)3(BTTri)8] and 25.38 kJ/mol in [(CH3)2NH2]3[(Cu4Cl)3(btc)8]\u22c59DMA. This suggests an enhanced interaction of CO2 with the framework, likely due to the presence of the amino groups from the DATRZ ligands. It is worth noting that while the Q st value at zero loading of CPF-13 is lower than two amino-functionalized anionic MOFs, H3[(Cu4Cl)3(BTTri)8]\u22c5ethylenediamine (90 kJ/mol) and bio-MOF-1 (55 KJ/mol), 26.5 kJ/mol at maximum CO2 loading for CPF-13 is significant because the Q st values of the other two anionic MOFs both decrease rapidly to about 22 kJ/mol with increasing pressure. In our opinion, the maintainable high heat of adsorption Q st for CPF-13 maybe due to the available reactive surface sites (-NH2 groups) does not decrease rapidly with increasing pressure.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 15, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>The adsorption selectivity for CO<sub>2</sub> over N<sub>2</sub> is a prerequisite for the application in CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration.\nFigure b also shows the N<sub>2</sub> isotherms\nobtained for CPF-13 at 273 K and up to 1 atm.
