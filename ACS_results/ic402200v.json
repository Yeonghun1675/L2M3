The conjecture that interplanar interactions can be neglected might be reconsidered because of the peculiarities of significant differences in \u0398 occurring for those compounds that are considered to undergo a structural order/disorder transition related to hydrogen bonding. However, several aspects are still not well understood or investigated by other methods that likely to shed more light into the intriguing properties of square lattices. In particular, the S = 1/2 case has triggered considerable interest in quantum dynamics worldwide, for example, with recent experimental evidence for phenomena such as entanglement of spins on a square lattice.
