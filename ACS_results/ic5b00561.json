It is interesting to notice that the topology of 1 resembles its crystal shape. In the framework, there are one-dimensional channels with a diameter ca. 6.02 \u00c5 running along the [001] direction calculated by Poreblazer software (Figure d).

The collected data is consistent with the simulated one from the single-crystal data, indicative of its high phase purity (Figure  ). Thermal stability was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and variable-temperature PXRD ( Figures S4 and S5), and both show that 1 could be stable up to 260 \u00b0C. The TGA curve of 1 shows a weight loss of 14.3% in the temperature ranging from 25 to 110 \u00b0C, which could be due to the escape of seven lattice H2O and one EtOH molecules (calcd 14.4%), and then a platform appears up to 260 \u00b0C. Recent research reveals that some interpenetrated frameworks show interesting structural changes by external stimuli. To investigate the dynamic structural property of 1, a well-diffracted single crystal was heated on the X-ray diffractometer at 393 K for 5 h to give 1a {[Cu3(CPT)4(\u03bc3-OH)]\u22c5NO3} n  (Scheme ). The structural determination of 1a showed that the unit-cell parameters a, b, and c changed +0.44%, +0.68%, and +0.7% compared with those of 1, respectively. Meanwhile, its \u03b2 angle also decreased 0.36% with the space group change from C 2 /c to P 2 /c. After data collection, the single crystal was cooled at 150 K for 5 h to give 1b with the same formula of 1a. The unit-cell parameters a, b, and c of 1b changed +0.07%, -0.12%, -0.2% with the \u03b2 angle decreased 0.35% compared with that of 1a. It is noticed that the original crystal parameters cannot be generated by simply returning to the original temperature because of the loss of the lattice molecules. The crystal data of 1c (obtained by outgassing a well-diffracted single crystal of 1 under vacuum at 80 \u00b0C overnight) was also collected for further study, which showed the unit-cell parameters a, b, and c changed +1.2%, +0.8%, -0.98% with \u03b2 angle decreased 3.8% compared with those of 1. Although these crystal cell parameters were only fine-tuned, the pore sizes are still sensitive to external stimuli as calculated by Poreblazer software. The calculated results revealed the max pore diameter was 6.02, 6.18, 6.00, and 6.32 \u00c5 for 1, 1a, 1b, and 1c, respectively (Figure ). Since the hexagonal channels are defined by intersection of the trigonal channels from the two identical interpenetrated networks, their pore diameters largely depend on the relative position of each independent framework. The changes of distance between the \u03bc3-OH of each interpenetrated structure confirm the movement of the network ( Figure S6). It is interesting that the two positional disordered CPTs in 1 could not be found in 1c ( Figure S7), revealing a transformation from a disordered phase to a more ordered phase after activation which may result from the stronger interframework interactions. The PXRD patterns of 1c were right shifted a little compared with that of 1 (Figure ). However, they could restore to that of 1 after soaking in MeOH for 3 days, indicating the dynamic structure of 1. Such a type of dynamic behavior is distinguishable from those which possess a large breathing effect along with void volumes and drastic swelling of the cells. \n\nGas Adsorption Studies\n\nInspired by its moderate void volume and dynamic structural nature, the gas adsorption property of 1 was studied. Before the measurements, about 100 mg of crystals of 1 was finely treated ultrasonically and soaked in MeOH for 3 days, and then outgassed under dynamic vacuum at 80 \u00b0C overnight to afford 1c. The surface areas were calculated on the basis of the CO2 isotherm collected at 195 K in a relative pressure ranging from 10-3 to 1 atm. It showed a max uptake of 121 cm3/g with type-I behavior. The surface areas calculated from CO2 sorption data are 386 m2/g (BET) and 472 m2/g (Langmuir), respectively. It is very interesting that 1c showed hysteresis in the desorption of CO2, which may be explained by strong interaction of the CO2 molecules with the framework. At 273 K, the isotherm of CO2 showed an unconspicuous two-step sorption with a slight hysteresis: 1c can capture 25.3 cm3/g of CO2 at 0.074 atm, and then a jump in uptake occurs until the pressure of 0.1 atm with a uptake of 36.2 cm3/g, and further increased to 78.8 cm3/g at 1 atm (Figure ). At 283 K, 1c showed an uptake of 28.7 cm3/g of CO2 at 0.13 atm, and an abrupt increase was observed at the pressure of 0.16 atm, which was followed by a slow increase to the max uptake of 73.1 cm3/g at 1 atm. Isotherms at 298 and 313 K show similar trends, with the max uptake of 60.1 and 48.7 cm3/g, respectively. As shown in Figure , a few PXRD patterns change upon guest removal/recover suggesting the dynamic framework to some degree. So the present unconspicuous stepwise gas sorption isotherms might be attributed to the guest-induced reversible phase transitions on gas adsorption and desorption, which has been encountered in some 2-fold interpenetrated MOFs with stepwise sorption behavior reported recently. The width of the hysteresis loops in the CO2 adsorption isotherms turn out to be more pronounced as the temperature increases, accompanying the phase transition pressure shifts toward higher pressure. Such behavior is the typical characteristic of porous MOFs with flexible pores which could be triggered by gas molecules.
