In this regard, the solid state luminescence properties of CPs 1-4 have been explored at room temperature and compared with emission profile of L (Figure S6a). The free ligand L displayed intense luminescence emission maximum at ~500 nm (\u03bbex = 320 nm), which can be attributed to \u03c0* \u2192 n or \u03c0* \u2192 \u03c0 transitions. When the CPs are excited at 320 nm, CP-1 emits at 525 nm, red-shifted by 25 nm with respect to L, whereas CP-3 and CP-4 emit at 486 and 467 nm, respectively, blue-shifted by 14 and 33 nm with respect to L due to the ligation to carboxylates and coordination environment of the SBUs/metal centers. The CP-2 exhibited an emission similar to L, which is probably caused by LLCT along with the synergistic effect between coligands and metal unit. The luminescence property of free ligand is also investigated in solution state. The ligand is found to be nonemissive in solution state (DMSO) and weakly luminescent in aqueous phase with \u03bbem = 414 nm (Figure S15). The luminescent behavior of CPs in various solvents such as N,N'-dimethylformamide (DMF), methanol (MeOH), acetonitrile (MeCN), benzene, nitromethane (NM), and nitrobenzene (NB) were recorded. Interestingly, the emission of the CPs was found to be quenched to zero in the presence NM/NB (Figure S6c,d). This observation revealed the ability of CPs for the detection of toxic nitro-explosives. Herein, quenching behavior of CP-2 by the nitro analytes has been thoroughly studied as it exhibited highly intense luminescence in aqueous medium. Notably, after sonication CP-2 was found to be stable in water as confirmed by XRPD patterns (Figure S5). Luminescent titrations were performed with several nitro derivatives such as 2,6-dinitro toluene (2,6-DNT), 2,4-dinitro toluene (2,4-DNT), 1,3-dinitrobenzene (DNB), 2-nitro phenol (2-NP), 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP), 4-nitro toluene (4-NT), phenol (PH), NM, and NB (Figure. S8). The quenching efficiency is calculated by using the equation (I 0 - I)/I 0 \u00d7 100%, where I 0 and I are the luminescence intensities of CP-2 without and with addition of the analytes, respectively. Among all the analytes, the quenching efficiency is found to be more for phenolic nitro analytes. The order of quenching efficiency for CP-2 with various analytes was found to be TNP > 4-NP > 4-NT> 2-NP > NB > 2,4-DNT > 2,6-DNT > DNB > NM > PH (c). These observations clearly indicate that the hydrogen bonding of the -OH group of phenolic analytes with framework carboxylates, -NH2 and -CONH, together with aromatic interactions might result in the better quenching abilities. In the case of TNP, the high acidity of -OH and highly electron deficient nature of TNP resulted in the high quenching efficiency over other NP or NB analytes. The CPs have shown the lowest sensing ability toward phenol confirming the affinity of CPs toward the analytes containing electron deficient functional groups such as nitro. Such diverse quenching efficiencies are analyzed further by using the Stern-Volmer (SV) equation (I 0/I) = K SV[A] + 1, where I 0 represents the initial intensity of the CP-2 in absence of analyte, I is the luminescence intensity in the presence of analyte with molar concentration [A], and K SV is the quenching constant (M-1). The SV plots for TNP and 4-NP deviates from linearity at 0.1 mM concentration and bends upward upon incremental addition of those analytes (b), while other analytes give linear variation with concentration in their corresponding SV plots. This nonlinear nature in the SV plot supports dynamic quenching processes or energy transfer between analytes and the host. The K SV value for TNP is 4.19 \u00d7 104 M-1, which is a moderate value and is comparable with reported values of other CPs such as {[Zn2(TPOM)(NH2-BDC)2]\u22c54H2O} (K sv = 4.6 \u00d7 104 M-1) (Table S3).

To this solution, triphenyl phosphite (2.25 mL, 0.0086 mol) was added and was refluxed for 8-9 h. It was allowed to cool to room temperature, and pyridine was distilled out to reduce the volume up to 5 mL. The solid was washed with acetone several times. The brown solid product was recrystallized from DMF.
