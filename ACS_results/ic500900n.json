The pillaring roles of the rigid bipyridyl linkers are imperative and diverse, as they not only fix the neighboring 2D layers with an appropriate distance and prevent the clogging of micropores but also adjust the pore size of the frameworks. Accordingly, the change in the length of the pillared ligands becomes an effective strategy for modulating the pore size and adsorption properties. The N2 adsorption studies of the activated frameworks follow the gradual increase in capacity with an increase in pillar length. Moreover, the presence of the exposed imidazolium moieties and counterions and the accessibility to electron rich double-pillar linkers permit easy discrimination of CO2 over N2, following the order 1a < 2a < 3a. On the other hand, the framework selectivity of CO2 over CH4 is just reversed. The sorption results allow us to conclude that although the pore sizes of the frameworks are large enough compared to the kinetic diameters of N2 and CH4, the electronic environment plays a pivotal role in the selective sorption of CO2 over other gas molecules. While the excellent CO2 selectivity over N2 for 3a is among the best values published to date, 1a exhibits CO2 versus CH4 selectivity that is superior to those of the commonly reported MOFs. Overall, the results present a novel design principle of charged, non-interpenetrated, pillared-layer MOFs for tuning the selective ability, for possible applications in the separation of CO2 from flue gas or natural gas mixtures.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 42, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Several spectroscopic,\nthermogravimetric\nanalysis, and powder X-ray diffraction patterns of compounds <bold>1\u20133</bold>, a table that includes X-ray crystallographic data,\nand figures.

Activation of samples involved the exchange of solvent molecules with EtOH, followed by vacuum drying at 100 \u00b0C for 12 h.
