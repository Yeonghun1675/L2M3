On the basis of the crystal\nengineering principle and the coordination geometry of metal\nions, reasonable selection of organic ligands can afford\nassembly of coordination polymers with a variety of topologies. However, much attention has been paid to coordination\npolymers containing 3d block metals, while the 3d\u22124f\nheterometallic compounds have received less attention.\nThe preparation of 3d\u22124f metal-based MOF has certain\ndifficulties because of the introduction of 4f metals. On the\none hand, a 4f metal ion has a high coordination number\n(commonly 8 and 9), which frequently leads to interpenetration and consequently results in the decrease of the pore size\nor even nonporous MOFs. On the other hand, the competition between 3d and 4f metals in coordinating to the same\nligand often gives rise to homometallic coordination polymers rather than heterometallic ones. Therefore, the selection\nof the ligand is a key point in the preparation of 3d\u22124f\nheterometallic MOFs. A typical strategy is self-assembly\nfrom mixed-metal ions and ligands containing hybrid donor\natoms such as pyridinecarboxylate ligands. Pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (H<sub>2</sub>PDCA) has been widely used to\nconstruct 3d, 4f, or 3d\u22124f MOFs. Generally, when coordinating to 4f metal ions, PDCA adopts a tridentate (ONO)\nmode:\u2009 the N atom coordinates with two O atoms from two\n\nadjacent carboxylate groups (each carboxylate group provides\none O atom), which requires coplanarity of the whole PDCA\nligand, while the other O atoms of the carboxylate groups\ncoordinate to 3d metal ions. If another N atom is introduced\nto the 4 position of PDCA, the new ligand will possess more\ncoordination sites. Moreover, a N atom has affinity to\ntransition-metal ions. Owing to the structural character, the\nN atom at the 4 position can only adopt a monodentate mode\nto coordinate to transition-metal ions. Thus, the new ligand\ncan behave as a proper bridge between 3d and 4f metal ions.\nAs is known, a Cu<sup>II</sup> ion is apt to be reduced to a Cu<sup>I</sup> ion in\nthe presence of N-containing ligands under hydrothermal\nconditions, and a Cu<sup>I</sup> ion with a d<sup>10</sup> configuration tends to\nform a trigonal-planar or tetrahedral coordination geometry\nwith a low coordination number (3 or 4).

So, only the structure of compound 3 will be discussed in detail. The framework is constructed with GdIII or CuI ions and a pyrazine-2,6-dicarboxylate ligand. The GdIII ion (Gd1) in the framework is nine-coordinate in a tricapped trigonal-prism environment with three N atoms and six O atoms from three pyrazine-2,6-dicarboxylate anions (Figure ).
