As expected, UTSA-74a takes up a large amount of C2H2 (145.0 cm3/cm3), which is comparable to 150 cm3/cm3 in Zn-MOF-74 (). However, to our big surprise, UTSA-74a adsorbs a much smaller amount of CO2 (95.0 cm3/cm3) than Zn-MOF-74 of 146 cm3/cm3, which is only about 2/3 of the CO2 uptake in Zn-MOF-74.
