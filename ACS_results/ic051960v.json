The final decomposition product was determined to be U3O8 by powder X-ray diffraction. The observed total weight loss of 22.3% is close to the calculated value of 21.38% for H2O, 1.5F2, CO, and CO2. An abrupt weight loss commences at about 300 \u00b0C because of the decomposition of the oxalate ligand. To confirm the oxidation state of U, magnetic susceptibility data were measured on a powder sample of 23.2 mg using a dc SQUID system between 2 and 300 K in a magnetic field of 0.2 T. Susceptibility values were corrected for the sample diamagnetic contribution according to Pascal's constants (-94 \u00d7 10-6 emu/formula unit).
