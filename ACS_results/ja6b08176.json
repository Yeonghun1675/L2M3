The pore volume, calculated at 0.95 P/Po is 0.99 cm3 g-1, is in excellent agreement with the crytallographically determined value of 1.0 cm3 g-1. In addition to gas adsorption results, the structural integrity of the activated pbz-MOF-1 was supported by PXRD measurements (Figure S7). The pore size distribution was calculated from the Ar adsorption isotherm using NLDFT, revealing three distinct peaks centered at 13, 9.5, and 6.4 \u00c5 (inset in a), in full agreement with the crystallographic analysis.\n\nIn light of its interesting structural features containing a high density of phenyl rings per accessible volume (2.3 per nm3), combined with a well-defined micropore system and high BET surface area (2415 m2 g-1), pbz-MOF-1 may be considered as an excellent adsorbent candidate for gas storage applications and in particular for CH4. Accordingly, CH4 adsorption measurements at 112 K, revealed a reversible type-I isotherm (Figure S13), from which the total pore volume at 0.99 P/Po was calculated to be 0.95 cm3 g-1, indicating that the full available pore space in the pbz-MOF-1 is readily accessible by CH4 molecules. High-pressure CH4 adsorption measurements were carried out at different temperatures up to 80 bar (b). The observed gravimetric and volumetric uptake at 80 bar and 298 K is 0.23 g g-1 and 210.4 cm3 (STP) cm-3, placing pbz-MOF-1 among the high-performing MOFs for CH4 storage (Table S2 and Figure S14). The corresponding CH4 capacities at 273 and 258 K are 0.27 g g-1/246 cm3 cm-3 and 0.29 g g-1/267 cm3 cm-3, respectively. Further analysis of the adsorption uptakes at different pressures and room temperature showed that pbz-MOF-1 exhibits one of the largest increases in the CH4 adsorbed phase density between 35 and 65 bar (38.3%), as compared to other well-performing MOFs for CH4 storage (Table S3 and Figure S15). Reasonably, this enhanced CH4 density in the pbz-MOF-1 could be associated with the favorable and very high efficiency in filling the available space in the pore network. Equivalent values for other existing MOFs such as HKUST-1 (17.4%), Al-soc-MOF-1 (62.8%), PCN-14 (16.6%), MOF-520 (38.7%), and MOF-905 (44.6%) supports and affirms the high degree of CH4 packing in the pbz-MOF-1 between 35 and 65 bar. The gravimetric and volumetric working capacity between 5 and 80 bar and 298 K is estimated to be 22.7 wt % and 180 cm3 cm-3, respectively. Interestingly, in contrast to other MOFs with intermediate porosity such as PCN-14, HKUST-1, Ni-MOF-74, and UTSA-20, the decrease of the storage temperature to 273 K led to an increase in the CH4 working capacity. For instance, in the case HKUST-1 and when going from 298 to 273 K, the volumetric working capacity between 5 and 65 bar decreased from 190 to 155 cm3 cm-3. Whereas for pbz-MOF-1, under the same conditions, the opposite occurred, and an increase from 162 to 185 cm3 cm-3 was observed. This manifest unique feature in the microporous pbz-MOF-1 could be attributed to the favorable synergistic effect between the pore system dimensions and the localized high density of aromatic rings per accessible unit volume.\n\nIn summary, we have demonstrated for the first time the successful use of reticular chemistry and the MMB approach for the construction of a highly connected Zr-based MOF with the intricate pbz topology. The synthesis of the pbz-MOF-1 represents the first example of a crystalline solid-state material displaying the binary 6-c hxg-a net, matching the unique edge-transitive pbz net. High-pressure CH4 adsorption measurements on the highly porous pbz-MOF-1 revealed a high storage capacity of 0.23 g g-1 and 210.4 cm3 (STP) cm-3 at 80 bar. Moreover, pbz-MOF-1 exhibits one of the highest enhancements in the adsorbed phase density when going from 35 to 65 bar. The successful synthesis of the first pbz-MOF paves the way to expand this approach to other ligands and inorganic building blocks with the aim to tune the pore system and functionality.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "pbz-MOF-1", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "pore diameter": [{"value": "13", "unit": "\u00c5", "condition": ""}, {"value": "9.5", "unit": "\u00c5", "condition": ""}, {"value": "6.4", "unit": "\u00c5", "condition": ""}], "pore volume": [{"probe": "", "value": "0.99", "unit": "cm3/g", "condition": ""}, {"probe": "", "value": "0.95", "unit": "cm3/g", "condition": ""}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "CH4", "adsorbed amount": "0.23", "unit": "g/g", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "80 bar", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "CH4", "adsorbed amount": "0.27", "unit": "g/g", "temperature": "273 K", "pressure": "", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "CH4", "adsorbed amount": "0.29", "unit": "g/g", "temperature": "258 K", "pressure": "", "condition": ""}], "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "2415", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}, {"type": "Langmuir", "probe": "", "value": "2556", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}]}]]], "include_properties": ["pore_diameter", "pore_volume", "gas_adsorption", "surface_area"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['pore_diameter', 'pore_volume', 'gas_adsorption', 'surface_area']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"pbz-MOF-1\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"pore diameter\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"13\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00c5\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"9.5\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00c5\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"6.4\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00c5\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"pore volume\": [\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"0.99\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"0.95\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"CH4\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"0.23\",\n                \"unit\": \"g/g\",\n                \"temperature\": \"298 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"80 bar\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"CH4\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"0.27\",\n                \"unit\": \"g/g\",\n                \"temperature\": \"273 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"CH4\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"0.29\",\n                \"unit\": \"g/g\",\n                \"temperature\": \"258 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"surface area\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"BET\",\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"2415\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"type\": \"Langmuir\",\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"2556\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 6, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Part\nof the <bold>pbz</bold> structure emphasizing the tetrahedral\ncavities (a) and the connectivity of adjacent phenyl rings (b).</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ja-2016-08176k_0002.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Part of the pbz structure emphasizing the tetrahedral cavities (a) and the connectivity of adjacent phenyl rings (b).
