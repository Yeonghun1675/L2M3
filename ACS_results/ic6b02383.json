DNBT has a high density (1.903 g cm-3), high heat of formation (285 kJ mol-1), and formidable detonation velocity (8413 m s-1). Furthermore, DNBT is less sensitive to impact compared to many of the state-of-the-art secondary military explosives [e.g., 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazacyclooctane (HMX), 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine, and 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzita-ne (CL-20)]. Nitrogen-rich heterocylic compounds, such as DNBT, have shown promise as single-component energetic materials and are also on the forefront of applications in energetic CPs. High-density energetic materials based on DNBT, which exhibit good energetic properties, have been achieved by the synthesis of nitrogen-rich organic salts and cocrystallization with azole-based energetic conformers. There are no reports, to the best of our knowledge, that exploit coordination polymerization of DNBT to modulate the energetic performance of the material. Herein, we have advantageously utilized two ionizable triazole rings with multiple potential nitrogen-donor sites of DNBT for coordination with transition-metal ions to access high-density energetic materials with high thermal stability. The structures and properties of the new energetic materials and their structure-function relationships are discussed.\n\nThe performance of the DNBT-derived complexes was investigated to determine properties including thermal stability, heat of detonation, and sensitivity to impact.

Presumably, the NiII ion induces decomposition of DNBT in the discrete complex Ni-DNBT. By contrast, the 1D CP Cu-DNBT is thermally stable up to 310 \u00b0C, as revealed by TGA and DSC ( and ). Cu-DNBT undergoes ~3.3% weight loss below 100 \u00b0C, which might be attributed to partial loss of water molecules coordinated to the metal center (water contributes to 5.5 wt % of the complex). The complex starts to decompose above 310 \u00b0C. Cu-DNBT is one of the very few energetics that exhibits thermal stability above 300 \u00b0C.
