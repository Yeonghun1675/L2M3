TGA studies indicate that the activated 1a is thermally stable up to about 300 \u00b0C. The Langmuir and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas are 1618 and 1120 m2/g, respectively, based on the N2 adsorption at 77 K (Figures S1-S3 in the ).\n\nHigh-pressure gas sorption measurements were carried out at various temperatures to explore the potential of 1 as a gas storage material. As shown in Figure , IRMOF 1 takes up quite a large amount of H2 gas of 71 mg/g at 30 K and 3.5 bar and of 52 mg/g at 77 K and 39 bar. These feature 1 as very few high storage MOF materials ever reported. Given the comparatively low surface area of 1, such high hydrogen storage capacities are remarkable. As expected, 1 can only adsorb a very small amount of H2 gas at room temperature (0.32 wt %) even at 40 bar. IRMOF 1 takes up a moderate amount of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) of 8.6 and 69 wt %, respectively, at 28 bar and 300 K (Figure ).\n\nIn conclusion, a new prototype cubic IRMOF Zn4O(FMA)3 (1) was rationally designed and structurally characterized, exhibiting rigid structure and high porosity with a Langmuir surface area of 1618 m2/g. IRMOF 1 can take up 5.2 wt % H2 at 77 K and 39 bar, 7.1 wt % H2 at 30 K and 3.5 bar, 8.6 wt % CH4 at 300 K and 28 bar, and 69 wt % CO2 at 300 K and 28 bar. The straightforward synthesis of this new IRMOF together with the readily available and cheap raw material of fumaric acid will certainly motivate us to explore its new functions.
