Ba is 8-coordinated, connected to six different BPDC ligands with two unique Ba-O distances: 2.689(2) and 2.894(1) \u00c5. If one considers the BaO8 polyhedra, a distorted square antiprismatic structure is obtained. Each polyhedra is linked to four others by sharing edges along the c-axis, to form Ba-O layers (Figure b,c). Formation of a layered structure (i.e., I2O1 structure) with heavy metal ions such as Pb2+, Eu2+, and Ba2+ using a similar, but shorter 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate ligand has been previously observed. However, the connections of these M-O polyhedra are more complicated with a mixture of face and edge-sharing compared to 2, which has only edge-shared polyhedra. The edge-shared polyhedra are topologically similar to fluorite, CaF2 (Figure d). This fashion of sharing polyhedra has not been previously reported, although it is noted that the fluorite topology for 3-D coordination polymers has been previously reported.

Employing biphenyl-3,3',5,5'-tetracarboxylic acid (H4BTTC) as a ligand, [Ba2(BTTC)(H2O)2] n  (1, space group = Pn21 a, a = 7.059(1) \u00c5, b = 12.432(2) \u00c5, c = 19.090(3) \u00c5), a coordination polymer with 1-D inorganic connectivity (I1O2), can be synthesized. The coordinated water is strongly coordinated and removed at 270 \u00b0C. By using 4,4'-biphenyldicarboxylic acid (H2BPDC), [Ba(BPDC)] n  (2, space group = C2/m, a = 6.955(2) \u00c5, b = 5.947(1) \u00c5, c = 13.852 (4) \u00c5, \u03b2 = 92.399(4)\u00b0) a coordination polymer with 2-D inorganic connectivity (I2O1) is obtained. The connection of the Ba-O bonds in each layer is topologically similar to CaF2. Using biphenyl-3,5,5'-tricarboxylic acid (H3BPTC) as a ligand, [Ba3(BPTC)2(NMF)5\u22832NMF] n  (3, space group = I4\u03052d, a = 25.984(3) \u00c5, c = 13.999(2) \u00c5) (NMF = N-methyl formamide), a structurally porous coordination polymer with rare 3-D inorganic connectivity (I3O0) can be synthesized. Hence, barium as a metal is extremely malleable with respect to construction of coordination polymers of different inorganic dimensionalities. 2 with I2O1 connectivity demonstrates extraordinary thermal stability and maintains its crystallinity until decomposition at 590 \u00b0C. The luminescence behavior of 1, 2, and 3 at room temperature has been investigated and is predominantly intraligand based.\n\nThe synthesis and characterization of three barium coordination polymers with one-, two-, and three-dimensional inorganic connectivity using biphenyl carboxylic acids as ligands are reported. [Ba(BPDC)] n , with I2O1 connectivity demonstrates extraordinary thermal stability, preserving its crystallinity until decomposition at 590 \u00b0C.\n\nFor 1, no weight loss was observed from room temperature to 270 \u00b0C, upon which loss of two water molecules occurs (observed: 6.2%, calculated: 5.7% weight loss); this is followed by decomposition at ~525 \u00b0C. The loss of water at such high temperatures is indicative of the strong coordination of water to barium and the nonporosity of the solid. Although the structure of the framework is preserved at 280 \u00b0C, upon heating the framework higher to 315 \u00b0C, the framework collapses as evidenced by a marked decrease in crystallinity of the powder XRD ( S7). This indicates that although 1 decomposes at 525 \u00b0C from TGA, the crystallinity of the compound is not retained upon loss of coordinated water.\n\nFor 3, the sharp weight drop till 220 \u00b0C is 16.6%, corresponding to the loss of two NMF molecules per formula unit (theoretical 17.0%), corresponding to the loss of pore NMF and one of the coordinated NMF. This is followed by a steady weight drop of 8.2% till 405 \u00b0C (theoretical 8.5%) corresponding to the loss of another coordinated NMF per formula unit, and decomposition of the framework results at 570 \u00b0C. Separate heating experiments in nitrogen ( S8) show that 3 is unstable with respect to loss of solvent and undergoes structural transformation to an unknown phase from 150 \u00b0C. Thus, even though 3 possess a high decomposition temperature as evidenced from thermal gravimetric analysis, the original crystal structure had been lost at a much lower temperature.", "data":
