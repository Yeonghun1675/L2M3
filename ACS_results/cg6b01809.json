Such elevated affinity for polar molecules may be attributed to the pbpy ligands which decorate pore wall with dicationic pyridinium units to optimize the adsorption capability of the molecules with larger polarity such as water (molecular dimension: 2.9 \u00d7 3.2 \u00d7 3.9 \u00c53), methanol (molecular dimension: 3.8 \u00d7 4.2 \u00d7 5.0 \u00c53), and ethanol (molecular dimension: 4.2 \u00d7 4.3 \u00d7 6.3 \u00c53). As shown in Figures S9-S11, the XRPD patterns after the water adsorption experiment demonstrate that the complexes 2 and 3 are stable. While the XRPD pattern of 1 shows obvious change, indicating the water molecules may influence the structural stability and lead to its inferior adsorption capability of water. The adsorption amount of methanol (181 mg\u22c5g-1) for 1 is comparable to the bipyridinium functional [Zn2(tpa)2(cpb)] framework with 36.3% void volume reported by Kitagawa and co-workers. It is interesting to note that the enhanced accessibility to ethanol and methanol has been achieved in the presence of chloride, indicating the influence of halide anions on the guest adsorption performance of the compounds. The chloride ion has smaller radius but larger electronegativity than the bromide ion, thus may provide stronger hydrogen bonding sites. So, the compounds 1 and 3 are superior to 2 for the adsorption of methanol and ethanol. Larger molecules with some steric effects, such as ethanol and methanol, can get more benefit from this additional interaction site and achieve an improvement during the guest adsorption process.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "3", "chemical formula": "C44H32N4O8ClBrCd2"}, "chemical formula weight": [{"value": "1084.90", "unit": "g/mol", "condition": ""}], "crystal system": [{"value": "triclinic", "condition": ""}], "space group": [{"value": "P-1", "condition": ""}], "lattice parameters": [{"value": {"a": "9.0410", "b": "17.9143", "c": "18.8513", "alpha": "102.091", "beta": "102.348", "gamma": "102.269", "condition": "T = 295.87(10) K"}}], "density": [{"value": "1.283", "unit": "g\u22c5cm-3", "condition": ""}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "H2", "adsorbed amount": "32.6", "unit": "cm3\u22c5g-1", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "H2", "adsorbed amount": "0.29", "unit": "wt%", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "26.0", "unit": "cm3\u22c5g-1", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "0.51", "unit": "wt%", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": ""}]}]]], "include_properties": ["chemical_formula_weight", "crystal_system", "space_group", "lattice_parameters", "density", "gas_adsorption"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['chemical_formula_weight', 'crystal_system', 'space_group', 'lattice_parameters', 'density', 'gas_adsorption']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"\",\n            \"symbol\": \"3\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"C44H32N4O8ClBrCd2\"\n        },\n        \"chemical formula weight\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"1084.90\",\n                \"unit\": \"g/mol\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"crystal system\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"triclinic\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"space group\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"P-1\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"lattice parameters\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": {\n                    \"a\": \"9.0410\",\n                    \"b\": \"17.9143\",\n                    \"c\": \"18.8513\",\n                    \"alpha\": \"102.091\",\n                    \"beta\": \"102.348\",\n                    \"gamma\": \"102.269\",\n                    \"condition\": \"T = 295.87(10) K\"\n                }\n            }\n        ],\n        \"density\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"1.283\",\n                \"unit\": \"g\u22c5cm-3\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"H2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"32.6\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3\u22c5g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"77 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"H2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"0.29\",\n                \"unit\": \"wt%\",\n                \"temperature\": \"77 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"CO2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"26.0\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3\u22c5g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"\",\n                \"pressure\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"CO2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"0.51\",\n                \"unit\": \"wt%\",\n                \"temperature\": \"\",\n                \"pressure\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 10, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Pseudohexagonal\nring structure of the single 2D coordination\nsheet of <bold>1</bold>.
