Therefore, the water molecules can be divided into two types: O1w, O3w, and O4w (type A) only form water-water hydrogen bonds, while the other four (type B) are involved in hydrogen bonds with carboxylates. When crystals of 1 were exposed in air, gradual loss of crystal transparency was observed, suggesting that the water molecules of type A may escape from the lattice and the heptahydrate 1 may change to a tetrahydrate. Indeed, thermal gravimetric analysis (see Supporting Information) of these crystals showed that the total water loss took place in one step between room temperature and 110 \u00b0C with a 7.49% weight loss, which corresponds well to four water molecules of type B (calculated 7.53% based on the tetrahydrate). The compound is stable up to 261 \u00b0C, at which decomposition of organic components occurs. The binding of water molecules to the MOF was also examined by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of the freshly prepared 1 and the samples heated at 100 \u00b0C for 5 and 7 h, respectively. The broad bands for OH stretching vibrations of the water clusters are centered at 3410, 3357, and 3313 cm-1, respectively, for the different heating times, and the intensity is weakened as heating time is increased (see Supporting Information). This can be attributed to the stepwise removal of the loosely bound water molecules during heating and is in agreement with the results from structure analysis.
