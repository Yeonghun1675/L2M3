The result of PXRD measurement demonstrates that desolvated 4' retains its structural integrity (Figure S11). The porosity of 4' was examined by the gas sorption measurements, which indicates that it can adsorb N2, and CO2 at low and at ambient temperatures. As shown in a, N2 adsorption measurement at 77 K and 1 atm revealed type-I isotherm with saturated N2 uptake of 158 mL g-1 (STP), which is characteristic of a microporous material, corresponding to a BET surface area of 432.5 m2 g-1. CO2 adsorption isotherm demonstrated that 4' can store up to 130 mL g-1 (STP) CO2 at 195 K/1 atm. Further, the CO2 sorption was performed at 0 \u00b0C and near room temperature to study the interactions between CO2 and the host framework of 4'. As shown in b, the CO2 uptakes at 1 bar reaches up to 66 mL g-1 at 273 K and 31 mL g-1 at 298 K. In order to understand the interactions between CO2 and the framework of 4', we calculated the isosteric heat (Q st) of CO2 by fitting the 273 and 298 K isotherms to the virial equation (see the Supporting Information). We note that the value of the initial isosteric heats of adsorption for 4 is 30.7 kJ/mol (c), which implies that the framework of 4' has relatively high binding affinity toward CO2.

The X-ray single crystal analysis reveals that 1 crystallize in P1\u0305 space group with an asymmetric unit that contains one each of Cu(II) ion, ligand, L, coordinated water along with two DMF solvent molecules in the lattice. Hydrogen atoms on lattice DMF solvents could not be located because of the disorder and large thermal ellipsoids of the atoms.

Due to the bent shape of the ligand, L, two {Cu2(COO)4} SBUs and two ligand moieties connect together to form a [2 + 2] rhombic metallacycle which further extends into a 1D chain structure along the bc-plane. This type of architecture was also reported by Yaghi et al. where they have used a bent dicarboxylate ligand. Interestingly, the nitrogen atoms of the pyrazole moiety of L does not coordinate to the metal ion and remains free. The 1D chains with open cavities are packed into a 3D porous supramolecular structure via weak noncovalent interactions (a).

The space taken by solvent molecules is 28.4% (419.1/1478.1 \u00c53) of the total crystal volume as calculated by PLATON. \n\nDetailed structural analysis reveals that, here also, the [2 + 2] rhombic metallacycle motif is present with a disrupted Cu paddle-wheel SBU, which is shown in . A prime distinction of 3 from 2 is that the Cu(I) ion is coordinated to three nitrogen atoms of the pyrazole moiety in atrigonal planar geometry and resulted in a 2D layered structure (a). Furthermore, the 2D sheets arrange and pack themselves in a supramolecular 3D arrangement with a dense packing. The void volume is calculated to be 19% (1325.8/6991.5 \u00c53), which is occupied by disordered nitrate anions and solvent molecules. A sharp distinction of the addition of extra pyridine is visible in 3, where the paddle-wheel SBU has changed, which ultimately resulted in a 2D network as compared to a 3D network in 2.\n\nPXRD and TGA Studies\n\nTo examine the thermal stability and phase purity of the frameworks, we have carried out the TG analysis and PXRD measurements. TGA of all four networks showed that after the loss of lattice solvent molecules, the frameworks are stable up to a moderately high temperature. For compound 1 (Figure S7a), the TG curve reveal a weight loss of ~24% (calculated 24.4%) between 30 and 260 \u00b0C, which corresponds to loss of two DMF solvent molecule and one coordinated water molecule per formula unit. Then, the framework collapses with an abrupt weight loss with decomposition of the framework. MOF 2 (Figure S7b) showed a weight loss of ~32% (calculated 32.6%) between 30 and 325 \u00b0C, which corresponds to loss of four lattice DMF, four water (three lattice and one coordinated), and two coordinated pyridine molecules after which the framework starts collapsing. A similar decomposition process is observed for MOF 3 (Figure S7c) where a weight loss of ~25% (calculated 25.2%) is observed in the temperature range 30-260 \u00b0C, which corresponds to loss of one DMF, four water, and three pyridine molecules after which the framework decomposes. MOF 4 (Figure S7d) showed a weight loss of ~43% (calculated, 43.7%) in the temperature range 30-320 \u00b0C, which corresponds to loss of four DMF and five water molecules, after which the framework is stable up to ~390 \u00b0C without any framework decomposition.\n\nGas Adsorption Studies\n\nActivation of 4 was done by keeping the powdered sample in anhydrous methanol for 4 days followed by heating at 130 \u00b0C under high vacuum for 12 h to produce guest free MOF 4'. The result of PXRD measurement demonstrates that desolvated 4' retains its structural integrity (Figure S11). The porosity of 4' was examined by the gas sorption measurements, which indicates that it can adsorb N2, and CO2 at low and at ambient temperatures. As shown in a, N2 adsorption measurement at 77 K and 1 atm revealed type-I isotherm with saturated N2 uptake of 158 mL g-1 (STP), which is characteristic of a microporous material, corresponding to a BET surface area of 432.5 m2 g-1. CO2 adsorption isotherm demonstrated that 4' can store up to 130 mL g-1 (STP) CO2 at 195 K/1 atm. Further, the CO2 sorption was performed at 0 \u00b0C and near room temperature to study the interactions between CO2 and the host framework of 4'. As shown in b, the CO2 uptakes at 1 bar reaches up to 66 mL g-1 at 273 K and 31 mL g-1 at 298 K. In order to understand the interactions between CO2 and the framework of 4', we calculated the isosteric heat (Q st) of CO2 by fitting the 273 and 298 K isotherms to the virial equation (see the Supporting Information). We note that the value of the initial isosteric heats of adsorption for 4 is 30.7 kJ/mol (c), which implies that the framework of 4' has relatively high binding affinity toward CO2. The obtained Q st value of 4 is comparable to the well-known HKUST-1 (31.2 kJ/mol) and higher than NOTT-101 (26.5 kJ/mol).
