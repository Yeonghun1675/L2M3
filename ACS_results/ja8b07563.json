The loading amounts of both gases were controlled by their backfill pressure. High-quality NPD data of the gas-loaded Cu(Qc)  2  samples were collected at room temperature (Figures S11-12), in which the conformation of gas molecules were successfully identified. As shown in , based on the data of [Cu(Qc)  2  ]\u22c50.41C  2  D  6 , there is only one crystallographically independent C2D6 molecule in the pore systems. Specifically, C2D6 molecule locates in a rhombic cavity formed by aromatic rings (mainly refers to rings 1-4 in c) of ligands from the same layered network, giving a sandwich structure as viewed along two adjacent rhombic edges. The C2D6 occupancy was determined by free structural refinement to be 0.413(5), which is equivalent to 1 mmol g-1 (sealed at 0.4 bar), as consistent with that from the gas sorption experiment (1.1 mmol g-1).
