Compound 4 crystallizes in the chiral orthorhombic space group P212121. As depicted in Figure a, there are two crystallographically independent Zn centers in the asymmetric unit of 4. Zn1 and Zn2 show four-coordinated tetrahedral geometries that are surrounded by two oxygen atoms from two fum2- ligands and two nitrogen atoms from two bix ligands, respectively. The fum2- anions bridge two kinds of Zn(II) atoms by bis(monodentate) coordination mode to form an infinite left-handed 21 helical chain along the a-axis (Figure b, left). The helical chains have a pitch of 14.77 \u00c5, and adjacent helical chains are further pillared by bix ligands to generate a 3D open framework (Figure b, right). The chiral information may be transferred to the 3D framework by helical units with 2-fold rotation. From the topological point of view, if each Zn(II) ion is considered as a four-connected node and bix ligands and fum2- anions are linkers, this framework can be simplified into a four-connected unc-c net with short and long Schla\u0308fli symbols 66 and 6\u22c56\u22c562\u22c562\u22c563\u22c563, which is clearly different from the diamondoid topology despite having the same short vertex symbol (Figure c). In the single 3D framework, there exist two kinds of pore apertures with rectangular shapes running along the a axis; the size of the large channels is about 19.08 \u00d7 19.81 \u00c52, whereas that of the small channels is about 8.71 \u00d7 8.78 \u00c52. As is usually found, the potential voids are large enough to be filled via mutual interpenetration of three independent equivalent frameworks, generating a 4-fold interpenetrating 3D architecture. Despite this 4-fold interpenetration, compound 4 still contains a small solvent-accessible void space of 12.2% (463.5 \u00c53 per unit cell) of the total crystal volume calculated by PLATON. \n\nTo characterize the thermal stability of these compounds, thermogravimetric (TG) measurements were carried out in the temperature range of 30-900 \u00b0C under N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min-1 (Figure S9, ). For compound 1, the weight loss in the range of room temperature to 140 \u00b0C is attributed to the departure of lattice water molecules (obsd 4.29%, calcd 4.55%), and then the decomposition of organic ligands occurs in the range of 260-900 \u00b0C (obsd 74.48%, calcd 74.88%). The remaining weight corresponds to the formation of ZnO (obsd 21.23%, calcd 20.57%). The TGA curve of 2 shows that the first weight loss from room temperature to 90 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of the uncoordinated water molecules (obsd 10.49%, calcd 9.97%). Further weight loss corresponding to bib and aqua ligands (observed 55.39%, calculated 54.31%) was observed between 270 and 670 \u00b0C. Upon further heating, the coordinated ligands were lost until the residue was ZnO. The weight loss is observed owing to the direct decomposition of organic ligands for 3. No mass loss occurs until 290 \u00b0C at which point a series of mass losses ensued. Compound 3 can remain stabile at high temperature because it does not include guest solvent molecule. A total loss of 6.15% is observed for 4 in the temperature range of 30-150 \u00b0C, which can be attributed to the loss of lattice water molecules (calcd 6.07%), and the anhydrous compound begins to decompose at 270 \u00b0C forming an unidentified product. Compound 5 first lost weight corresponding to one lattice water molecule (observed 2.69%, calculated 2.80%) from room temperature to 100 \u00b0C.
