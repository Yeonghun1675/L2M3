The equation used to fit the corrected molar susceptibility data is    where x is J/kT, p the paramagnetic impurity with S = 5/2, and TIP the temperature-independent paramagnetism. The least-squares fitting of the equation yields J = -116 cm-1, p = 0.00488, TIP = 0, g 1 = 2.02, and g 2 = 2.00, indicative of strong antiferromagnetic interactions between the iron atoms of the Fe-O-Fe core. The reliability factor (R = \u2211(\u03c7m obs T - \u03c7m calc T)2/\u2211(\u03c7m obs T)2) is 4.91 \u00d7 10-5, implying that the experimental data are well fitted with the isotropic dimer model and thus the Fe-O-Fe cores are magnetically isolated. This assumption concerning the independent magnetic entities seems reasonable because the \u03c0-type superexchange pathway of the \u03bc-oxo ligand is expected to dominate any coupling within magnetic centers through space or by the long-range \u03c3-type pathway of the mtm ligand.
