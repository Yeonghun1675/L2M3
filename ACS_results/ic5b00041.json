Interestingly, compound 1 (1a) is sensitive to sunlight and undergoes a photochromic transformation from yellowish to dark (1b) upon irradiation by ultraviolet visible light (Xenon Lamp, 300W, PLS-SXE 300/300UV, 320-780 nm) for a few seconds (Figure a). 1b is stable in air and can return to yellow in a dark room for several minutes at ambient temperature. The analysis of electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra indicates that compound 1a shows a weak peak radical signal with the g value of 2.0023 (Figure b). Compared with 1a, 1b exhibits a relatively strong sharp peak ESR signal of radicals, which suggests that there is a small amount of radicals in 1a and that 1b will rapidly generate amount of radicals after irradiated by ultraviolet visible light (1b, Figure b). In addition, the ESR spectra of compounds 1a and 1b both have a slightly wide weak peaks with the g value of 1.9278 (Figure b), which can be attributed to W(V) ions in the sample.
