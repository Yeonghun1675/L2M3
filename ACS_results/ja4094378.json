It shows a maximum in r 1 relaxivity of 15 mM-1\u22c5s-1 at 40 MHz, which remains constant over a wide pH range and increases with temperature. Importantly, this is the first study of the dependence of the r 1 relaxivity of a MOF as a function of a wide range of temperatures, magnetic fields, and pHs, which allowed us to conclude that an inner-sphere type of mechanism is operating and that Gd(III) centers inside the MOF structure also contribute to the relaxation effect. Synthesizing highly stable MOFs and combining their relaxometric properties and porosities should be feasible, making it possible to also exploit them in theranostics.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "CAMOF-1", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "[GdCu(DOTP)Cl]\u22c54.5H2O"}, "etc": [{"property name": "relaxometric properties", "value": "15", "unit": "mM-1\u22c5s-1", "condition": "at 40 MHz (25 \u00b0C)"}, {"property name": "relaxometric properties", "value": "5", "unit": "mM-1\u22c5s-1", "condition": "at a higher field (500 MHz, 25 \u00b0C)"}, {"property name": "stability", "value": "high", "unit": "", "condition": "in physiological saline solution and in cell culture media"}, {"property name": "cytotoxicity", "value": "not cytotoxic", "unit": "", "condition": ""}], "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "CO2 gas adsorption studies", "value": "110", "unit": "m2\u22c5g-1", "condition": "at 195 K"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["etc", "surface_area"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['etc', 'surface_area']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"CAMOF-1\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"[GdCu(DOTP)Cl]\u22c54.5H2O\"\n        },\n        \"etc\": [\n            {\n                \"property name\": \"relaxometric properties\",\n                \"value\": \"15\",\n                \"unit\": \"mM-1\u22c5s-1\",\n                \"condition\": \"at 40 MHz (25 \u00b0C)\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"property name\": \"relaxometric properties\",\n                \"value\": \"5\",\n                \"unit\": \"mM-1\u22c5s-1\",\n                \"condition\": \"at a higher field (500 MHz, 25 \u00b0C)\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"property name\": \"stability\",\n                \"value\": \"high\",\n                \"unit\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"in physiological saline solution and in cell culture media\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"property name\": \"cytotoxicity\",\n                \"value\": \"not cytotoxic\",\n                \"unit\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"surface area\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"BET\",\n                \"probe\": \"CO2 gas adsorption studies\",\n                \"value\": \"110\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2\u22c5g-1\",\n                \"condition\": \"at 195 K\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 5, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Representation\nof DOTP ligand.
