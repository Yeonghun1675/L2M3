The Ag(I) ion is located inside the annulene cage, the conformation of which is similar to that of the free annulene in the crystal. Four double bonds were used for coordination to Ag, i.e., the double bond C13-C14 is 4.09 \u00c5 apart from Ag(I). The coordination geometry of the complex is a distorted trigonal-bipyramid with an axial perchlorate ligand at a distance of 2.94(1) \u00c5. Another axial ligand is the olefinic double bond C5-C6, the coordination distance of which is relatively longer (2.65 \u00c5) than that of the equatrial ligands. Three equatorial ligands have similar coordination distances (2.45-2.50 \u00c5) and elonged double bonds (1.346(9)-1.366(9) \u00c5) which are longer than the axial ligand (1.334(9) \u00c5). This pentacoordinate structure is not consistent with that in solution as descrived above. It can be explained by the rapid exchange of the two olefins (C13-C14 and C17-C18) at the equatorial position.
