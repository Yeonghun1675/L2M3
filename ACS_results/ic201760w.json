They have been prepared by hydrothermal syntheses and characterized by FT-IR, elemental analysis, and thermogravimetric methods. Structures were determined either by single crystal X-ray crystallography or from laboratory XRPD data using ab initio methodology. The crystal structure of some <bold>M-VP</bold> and <bold>M-PVP</bold> materials is the \u201cclassical\u201d 2D layered, with the organic groups (vinyl or phenylvinyl) extending into the interlamellar space. However, the <bold>Pb-VP</bold> and <bold>Cu-VP</bold> materials show dramatically different structural features. <bold>Pb-VP</bold> has a porous, 3D structure. In that structure the Pb<sup>2+</sup> center is found in a pentagonal pyramidal environment. Compound <bold>Cu-VP(2)</bold>, a peculiar variant of the common 2D layered structure, possesses a 2D layered structure, but very different from the other <bold>M-VP</bold> materials. It contains three crystallographically distinct Cu centers: an octahedrally coordinated Cu<sup>2+</sup> ion, a square planar Cu<sup>2+</sup> ion, and a Cu<sup>+</sup> one. The latter has an unusual co-ordination environment as it is 3-coordinated to two oxygen atoms with the third bond across the double bond of the vinyl group. Metal-coordinated water loss was studied by TGA and thermodiffractometry, which revealed that the rehydration of the anhydrous phases to give the initial phase takes place rapidly for <bold>Cd-PVP</bold> but it takes several days for <bold>Co-PVP</bold>. The <bold>M-VP</bold> materials exhibit variable dehydration\u2013rehydration behavior, with most of them losing crystallinity during the process.

They have been prepared by hydrothermal syntheses and characterized by FT-IR, elemental analysis, and thermogravimetric methods. Structures were determined either by single crystal X-ray crystallography or from laboratory XRPD data using ab initio methodology. The crystal structure of some M-VP and M-PVP materials is the \"classical\" 2D layered, with the organic groups (vinyl or phenylvinyl) extending into the interlamellar space. However, the Pb-VP and Cu-VP materials show dramatically different structural features. Pb-VP has a porous, 3D structure. In that structure the Pb2+ center is found in a pentagonal pyramidal environment. Compound Cu-VP(2), a peculiar variant of the common 2D layered structure, possesses a 2D layered structure, but very different from the other M-VP materials. It contains three crystallographically distinct Cu centers: an octahedrally coordinated Cu2+ ion, a square planar Cu2+ ion, and a Cu+ one. The latter has an unusual co-ordination environment as it is 3-coordinated to two oxygen atoms with the third bond across the double bond of the vinyl group. Metal-coordinated water loss was studied by TGA and thermodiffractometry, which revealed that the rehydration of the anhydrous phases to give the initial phase takes place rapidly for Cd-PVP but it takes several days for Co-PVP. The M-VP materials exhibit variable dehydration-rehydration behavior, with most of them losing crystallinity during the process. The photoluminescence emission spectra of the M-VP compounds (M = Cd, Co, Ni, and Co) show very similar characteristics, with the Zn-VP showing a somewhat different response. All spectra are strikingly similar and, most likely, the responses arise from the vinyl group.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 56, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>CIF files for all structures.
