Basically, there is a dimer formed by two zinc (Zn1) and two diphosphonate units (P1). These dimers are connected with two different Zn ions (Zn2) and four other CPO3 tetrahedra forming a one-dimensional chain with 8-membered pore opening along the a axis. The templated DAB unit is placed inside this channel (8-T) formed by four ZnO4 tetrahedra and four CPO3 tetrahedra with a pore size of 7.8 \u00c5 \u00d7 5.4 \u00c5 (shortest atom-atom contact distances, not including the van der Waals radii). The protonated DAB molecules occupy these channels and interacted with the framework through hydrogen bonds. Though the above channel is growing along the a axis, there is one bigger channel of size 12.3 \u00c5 \u00d7 6.3 \u00c5 (shortest atom-atom contact distances, not including the van der Waals radii)  observed along the ac plane in the three-dimensional structure (a). This large channel of 12-membered ring (six ZnO4 tetrahedra and six CPO3 tetrahedra) is constructed by Zn2-P2-Zn1-P1-Zn3-P3-Zn2-P2-Zn1-P1-Zn3-P3 in the ac plane (a). Templated water and pendant -CH3 groups occupy this bigger channel and facilitate stabilization through hydrogen bonds with framework oxygens. The free protonated amine molecules are stabilized through extensive N-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bonding interactions with the framework.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 11, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig2\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Three-dimensional\npolyhedral view of compound <bold>III</bold> along the <italic>ac</italic> plane.
