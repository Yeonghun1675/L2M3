To confirm the permanent porosity of the activated complex 2, the N2-sorption measurements are performed at 77 K. The fresh crystalline samples of complex 2 are degassed under dynamic vacuum at 100 \u00b0C for 10 h after solvent exchange with acetone for 7 days. The N2 adsorption of complex 2 exhibits a reversible type I isotherm (Figure ), thus indicating the microporous nature of the samples. Derived from N2 adsorption, the Langmuir surface area of 2 is 1175 m2 g-1, corresponding to a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of 1042 m2 g-1. Pore-size distribution (PSD) analysis by the Horvath-Kawazoe method utilizing N2-adsorption data at 77 K indicates a narrow distribution of micropores at around 5.8 \u00c5 (Figure ), which is consistent with the diameter of the channels considering the van der Waals radii of the framework atoms.\n\nWe also investigated the H2-adsorption performances of complex 2 at 77 and 87 K. The H2-sorption isotherm of complex 2 reveals a reversible sorption behavior under low pressure (Figure a). The excess H2 uptake capacity of complex 2 reaches 171.9 cm3 g-1 (1.53 wt %, 7.67 mmol g-1) at 77 K and 1.08 bar. This value is comparable with those of currently reported highly porous MOF materials at the same measurement conditions. To evaluate the heats of adsorption (Q st) for H2 in complex 2, H2-adsorption isotherms are also measured at 87 K (Figure a). The adsorption heat of H2 is calculated by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, and its value at zero coverage for complex 2 is estimated to be 6.3 kJ mol-1 and decreases slowly with increasing H2 loading (Figure b). It is worth noting that the Q st value of complex 2 is similar to those of some classical porous materials, such as MOF-5 (5.2 kJ mol-1), NOTT-122 (6.0 kJ mol-1), and HKUST-1 (6.6 kJ mol-1). To our knowledge, low-pressure H2 adsorption of MOFs is mainly influenced by open metal sites, pore size, catenation, and ligand functionalization. The considerable amount of H2 adsorption for complex 2 may be attributed to its micropore structure and the strong binding strength of H2 to the metal centers.\n\nIn this work, single-component low-pressure gas-sorption isotherms for complex 2 toward CO2, CH4, and N2 at 273 and 295 K are measured by ultilizing the volumetric measurement method and presented in Figures  and S16-S20 in the . As shown in Figure a, complex 2 presents a typical type I reversible curve for CO2 sorption. At 273 K, complex 2 can take up 90.8 cm3 g-1 (4.05 mmol g-1, 178.3 mg g-1) of CO2, and at 295 K the CO2 uptake by complex 2 is 63.8 cm3 g-1 (2.85 mmol g-1, 125.2 mg g-1). Correspondingly, complex 2 can only adsorb 31.9 cm3 g-1 (1.43 mmol g-1, 21.4 mg g-1) of CH4 at 273 K and 22.4 cm3 g-1 (1.0 mmol g-1, 15.0 mg g-1) at 295 K, which are also shown in Figure S17 in the .

The much lower adsorption of CH4 and N2 compared to CO2 at the same measurement conditions urges us to investigate the corresponding selectivity. We adopt the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) based upon the experiment single gas-adsorption measurements, which is commonly used to predict binary mixture adsorption selectivity. Using the pure-component isotherm fits, the adsorption selectivity is defined by S ads = (q 1/q 2)/(p 1/p 2), where q  i  is the amount of i adsorbed and p  i  is the partial pressure of i in the mixture. It is worth noting that complex 2 shows a high S ads(CO2/N2) of 20.2 in a 15:85 molar ratio of CO2 and N2 mixtures at 273 K and 1.08 bar (Figure b), indicating that this material may be a promising candidate for postcombustion CO2 capture application.

Their emission spectra are shown in Figure . The free ligand H3TPO displays a weak blue emission centered at 458 nm (excitation at 350 nm) under UV light, which may be attributed to the \u03c0*-n or \u03c0*-\u03c0 transition. For complex 1, intense blue emission is observed with a maximum at 465 nm upon excitation at 370 nm, which is near to that of the free ligand.

In contrast, complex 2 displays the emisson maximum at 500 nm (\u03bbex = 380 nm) with a blue shift of 42 nm compared to that of the free ligand.
