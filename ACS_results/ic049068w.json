Cluster 1 was synthesized by the addition of sodium hydrogencarbonate to an aqueous solution of H5 L\u22c5Na (100 mg, 0.199 mmol in 5 mL of methanol) until pH 7.5 was reached, followed by the addition of 1 equivalent of solid iron(III) chloride (54 mg, 0.199 mmol) and sonication to give a clear orange solution. Slow diffusion of ethanol into the reaction mixture over 10 days yields green crystals of the hexameric cluster Na12[Fe6(O)3(CO3)6(L)2]\u22c536H2O (1) in a yield of 35%, whereby the hexa-deprotonated ligand L is utilizing all 15 donor atoms in coordinative interactions, forming a {Fe6L2} hexanuclear iron cage (Figure ) that is decorated by 12 bridging sodium ions (Figure ).
