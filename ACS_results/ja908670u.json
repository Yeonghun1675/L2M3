We investigated the gas adsorption properties of <bold>2</bold> toward small molecules, i.e. N<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub>. As shown in Figure a, <bold>2</bold> adsorbed CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> into its pores and showed almost no N<sub>2</sub> uptake, indicating a general correlation between the pore size and kinetic diameters of the adsorbates. Apparently, N<sub>2</sub> could not be adsorbed because its kinetic diameter (3.64\u22123.80 \u00c5) was larger than the effective channel size. Because of the relatively smaller kinetic diameters of H<sub>2</sub> (2.827\u22122.89 \u00c5) and CO<sub>2</sub> (3.3 \u00c5), we observed a significant uptake for these gases at 77 and 298 K, respectively. In addition to the size effect, the uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> (15.9 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u22121</sup>) might result from the strong quadrupolar interactions of CO<sub>2</sub> with N atoms present on the pore surface. Moreover, calculations based on the Dubinin\u2212Astakhov (DA) methods gave a pore volume of 0.050 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u22121</sup> and the isosteric heat of adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub> at 298 K (12.5 kJ mol<sup>\u22121</sup>). The heat of adsorption was far less than those of typical chemical adsorption. Thus, the <bold>2</bold>\u2212CO<sub>2</sub> interaction was mainly physisorptive in nature without significant chemical association. The surface area, determined by fitting the CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption isotherm of <bold>2</bold> to the BET equation, was 154 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>\u22121</sup>. We observed a steep rise in the adsorption branch of H<sub>2</sub> at extremely low pressures relative to the saturation vapor pressure of H<sub>2</sub>; this high initial uptake indicated the presence of intrinsic micropores in <bold>2</bold>.\n</p><p>Accompanying the structural conversion, great changes occurred in the magnetic behaviors. As reported by Kim et al., the interaction between Fe<sup>III</sup> and Co<sup>II</sup> in <bold>1</bold> was antiferromagnetic, with a negative Weiss temperature (\u0398 = \u22123.0) given by fitting \u03c7<sup>\u22121</sup> data to the Curie\u2212Weiss law at temperatures above 30 K. For <bold>2</bold>, however, on cooling, the \u03c7<italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic> values increased more and more quickly, reaching a very sharp maximum of 17.8 cm<sup>3</sup> K mol<sup>\u22121</sup> at 4.4 K (Figure <bold>2b</bold>), fitting \u03c7<sup>\u22121</sup> data to the Curie\u2212Weiss law above 30 K and providing a positive Weiss temperature (\u0398 = 5.6).

First, many free solvent molecules were located among the hexanuclear clusters, so a porous framework should have resulted from the removal of the solvent molecules on heating. Second, there was a terminal CN- on the [Fe(Tp)(CN)3]- moiety and weakly coordinated solvent molecules on the CoII on the two diagonal sides of the square core of FeIII 2CoII 2. Hence, once the coordinated solvent molecules were removed on heating, concomitantly, the CN- anions coordinated to the free sites of CoII, allowing a solid state reaction that formed a coordination polymer structure. We performed a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurement to verify the solid state reaction. The TGA curve of 1 displayed a weight loss of 21.8% from 30 to 90 \u00b0C, corresponding to the loss of fourteen H2O molecules and four CH3CN molecules (21.6%) (). Consequent to this weight loss, we observed a long plateau up to 250 \u00b0C, suggesting the formation of a new stable phase as shown by the IR spectrum () and powder XRD patterns (). To shed light on the structural changes, we attempted to analyze the crystal structure of the desolvated sample of [FeIII(Tp)(CN)3]2CoII (2) and succeeded in obtaining single crystals suitable for the XRD measurement by slowly heating single crystals of 1 at 150 \u00b0C under an N2 atmosphere.\n\nThe TGA measurement () showed that 2 was thermally stable until ~250 \u00b0C. This stability provided an opportunity for probing gas adsorption properties of the microporous coordination polymer 2. We investigated the gas adsorption properties of 2 toward small molecules, i.e. N2, H2, and CO2. As shown in Figure a, 2 adsorbed CO2 and H2 into its pores and showed almost no N2 uptake, indicating a general correlation between the pore size and kinetic diameters of the adsorbates. Apparently, N2 could not be adsorbed because its kinetic diameter (3.64-3.80 \u00c5) was larger than the effective channel size. Because of the relatively smaller kinetic diameters of H2 (2.827-2.89 \u00c5) and CO2 (3.3 \u00c5), we observed a significant uptake for these gases at 77 and 298 K, respectively. In addition to the size effect, the uptake of CO2 (15.9 cm3 g-1) might result from the strong quadrupolar interactions of CO2 with N atoms present on the pore surface. Moreover, calculations based on the Dubinin-Astakhov (DA) methods gave a pore volume of 0.050 cm3 g-1 and the isosteric heat of adsorption of CO2 at 298 K (12.5 kJ mol-1). The heat of adsorption was far less than those of typical chemical adsorption. Thus, the 2-CO2 interaction was mainly physisorptive in nature without significant chemical association. The surface area, determined by fitting the CO2 adsorption isotherm of 2 to the BET equation, was 154 m2 g-1. We observed a steep rise in the adsorption branch of H2 at extremely low pressures relative to the saturation vapor pressure of H2; this high initial uptake indicated the presence of intrinsic micropores in 2. \n\nAccompanying the structural conversion, great changes occurred in the magnetic behaviors. As reported by Kim et al., the interaction between FeIII and CoII in 1 was antiferromagnetic, with a negative Weiss temperature (\u0398 = -3.0) given by fitting \u03c7-1 data to the Curie-Weiss law at temperatures above 30 K. For 2, however, on cooling, the \u03c7T values increased more and more quickly, reaching a very sharp maximum of 17.8 cm3 K mol-1 at 4.4 K (Figure 2b), fitting \u03c7-1 data to the Curie-Weiss law above 30 K and providing a positive Weiss temperature (\u0398 = 5.6). It indicated the ferromagnetic interactions between FeIII and CoII in 2. Moreover, the \u03c7T value at room temperature changed from 9.0 cm3 K mol-1 for 1 to 7.4 cm3 K mol-1 for 2 due to the different contributions of the orbital angular momentum of CoII with octahedral and tetrahedral coordination geometries, verifying the hypothesis of Kim et al. Further magnetic investigation revealed that 1 was a paramagnet, whereas 2 was a metamagnet due to the weak interchain antiferromagnetic interactions with a critical field of 4.5 kOe and Neel
