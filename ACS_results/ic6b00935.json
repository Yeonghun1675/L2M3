This double helical structure may effectively protect central metal ions from the interference of solvent molecules and thus provide high resistance of 1 against common organic solvents and aqueous solutions with a pH value ranging from 3 to 11. Moreover, 1 exhibits a selectively fluorescent quenching response to ketones and thus is a potential fluorescent sensor for detecting acetone in aqueous solution.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 17, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting\nInformation is available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at\nDOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00935\">10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00935</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Experimental section,\nsupporting tables and figures, and additional characterizations (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00935/suppl_file/ic6b00935_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Crystallographic\ndetail (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00935/suppl_file/ic6b00935_si_002.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00935.
