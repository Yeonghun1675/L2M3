Single-crystal X-ray analysis indicates that the complexes possess hexagonal channels with dimensions of about 8.3 \u00c5 \u00d7 8.3 \u00c5 along the c axis and void space of about 25% per cell volume. Hydrogen adsorption measurements at 740 Torr and 77 K reveal that hydrogen uptakes of 0.68 and 0.83 wt % were observed in 1 and 2, respectively, with BET surface areas of 309 and 328 m2/g. Magnetic measurement reveals that both of them exhibit global metamagnetic behaviors resulted from strong intrachain ferromagnetic couplings and weak interchain antiferromagnetic interactions, with critical fields of 22 kOe and 6 kOe for 1 and 2, respectively.\n\nTwo new 3D porous metamagnets {[M6(N3)12 L 6]\u22c5(H2O)13}\u221e (M = NiII, 1; CoII, 2) have been constructed from the ligand of 2-(1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylthio)acetic acid (HL), with azido as the auxiliary ligand. The complexes possess hexagonal channels with dimensions of about 8.1 \u00c5 \u00d7 8.1 \u00c5 along the c axis and a void space of about 25% per cell volume.\n\nGas Adsorption Properties\n\nN2 sorption measurements for activated 1a and 2a measured at 77 K revealed a type I isotherm (Figure a), which is characteristic of a microporous material. The uptake amount of N2 increases abruptly at the start of the experiment and reaches a plateau of about 92.6 cm3 (STP)/g for 1a and 98.1 cm3 (STP)/g for 2a, which correspond to apparent BET surface areas of 309 m2/g for 1a and 328 m2/g for 2a, respectively. The nitrogen adsorption and desorption are reversible. The median pore sizes are about 0.83 nm for 1a and 0.87 nm for 2a (Figure S4, ), respectively.\n\nConsidering the structure characteristics of 1 and 2 with L --decorated hexagonal channels, the hydrogen sorption isotherm recorded at 77 K under normal pressure also shows type I behavior. It was found that 1a can store up to 0.68 wt % (76.4 cm3/g at standard temperature and pressure (STP)) H2 at 760 mmHg and 77 K (Figure b). This value is comparable to those for porous MOFs with larger surface areas; e.g., [Co2(6-mna)2]\u22c53H2O displays a H2 uptake of 0.66 wt % with a surface area of 420 m2/g (CUK-2, CUK = Cambridge University-KRICT, 6-mna =6-mercapto-3-pyridinecarboxylate (6-mercaptonicotinate)). Hydrogen adsorption measurements show that 2a can store up to 0.83 wt % (Figure b). As shown in Figure , the adsorption isotherms for 1a and 2a are different, and adsorption/desorption kinetics were very slow in 2a while quick in 1a, which may be attributed to the effect of different metal ions in the 3D frameworks. \n\nMagnetic Properties\n\nMagnetic measurements were carried out on crystalline samples of complexes 1 and 2. The temperature dependence of \u03c7m T for complex 1 as a \u03c7m T vs T plot (\u03c7m is the molar magnetic susceptibility for one NiII) in the range of 2-300 K, under an applied field of 1 kOe, is shown in Figure . The value of \u03c7m T at 300 K is 1.37 cm3 mol-1 K, which is of the order expected for one NiII ion (g > 2.0). The \u03c7m T values increase smoothly from room temperature until 50 K and then sharply reach a maximum value of 3.61 cm3 mol-1 K at 15 K upon cooling, which was due to the ferromagnetic coupling between the NiII ions within the chain. Below 15 K, the \u03c7m T values dropped to 0.40 cm3 mol-1 K at 2 K, which is attributed to zero-field splitting (ZFS) of NiII ions and antiferromagnetic coupling between the chains.", "data":
