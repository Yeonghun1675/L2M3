Compared to the ligand emission (510 nm), the blue-shift luminescence of 1 and 2 is believed to be based upon ligand-to-metal-charge-transfer (LMCT). Different from 1 and 2, compounds 3 and 4 provide typical emission band features. For 3, the emission bands arise from the 5D0 \u2192 7FJ (J = 1, 2, 3, 4) transitions of Eu(III). The corresponding emission bands are 578, 589, 611, 698 nm, respectively. Among these transitions, 5D0 \u2192 7F2 is the strongest. For 5, four lines of Tb(III) emission can be detected in the visible spectrum, corresponding to transitions from the 5D4 state: 5D4 \u2192 7F6 (489 nm), 5D4 \u2192 7F5 (542 nm), 5D4 \u2192 7F4 (585 nm), and 5D4 \u2192 7F3 (620 nm). The most prominent line was observed at 542 nm (Supporting Information).
