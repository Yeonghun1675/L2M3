The data collection for 1 and 2 was carried out at 130 and 100 K, respectively. The crystal structures of 1 and 2 are depicted in Figure  and  Figure  S1. To determine the exact geometry around W, we performed a continuous shape measures (CShM) analysis (Table ). The S X (X = SAPR, DD, BTP) values against the ideal symmetry of a square antiprism (SAPR, D 4d ), dodecahedron (DD, D 2d ), and bicapped trigonal prism (BTP, C 2v ) clearly indicated that the W ion belonged to a distorted DD. The average W-C distances were identical: 2.17(1) \u00c5 for both 1 and 2. The W-C-N angles were almost linear, ranging from 175.9\u00b0 to 179.1\u00b0 for 1 and 176.4\u00b0 to 179.9\u00b0 for 2.
