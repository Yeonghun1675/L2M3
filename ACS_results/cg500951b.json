The value of \u03c7m T (0.08751 emu\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1) was nearly equal to the value expected for single copper(II) ion (\u03bceff = 0.83 \u03bcB, s = 1/2 and g = 2.00). The \u03c7-1 vs T plots obey the Curie-Weiss law with a negative Weiss constant in the range of \u03b8 = -130 to -161 K. The high negative value of \u03b8 and decreasing values of \u03c7m T suggest strong antiferromagnetic interactions between neighboring Cu(II) ions through the EE-azide bridges, as seen in the crystal structure.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "Compound I-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "magnetic susceptibility": [{"value": "0.08751", "unit": "emu\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1", "temperature": "", "condition": "Curie-Weiss law; Weiss constant \u03b8 = -130 to -161 K"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "Compound I-C", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "magnetic susceptibility": [{"value": "0.08751", "unit": "emu\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1", "temperature": "", "condition": "Curie-Weiss law; Weiss constant \u03b8 = -130 to -161 K"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["magnetic_susceptibility"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['magnetic_susceptibility']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"Compound I-A\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"magnetic susceptibility\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"0.08751\",\n                \"unit\": \"emu\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"Curie-Weiss law; Weiss constant \u03b8 = -130 to -161 K\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"Compound I-C\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"magnetic susceptibility\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"0.08751\",\n                \"unit\": \"emu\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"Curie-Weiss law; Weiss constant \u03b8 = -130 to -161 K\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 10, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Coordination sphere in I-AR showing the\nEE-(N3\u2013N4\u2013N5)\nand EO- (N6\u2013N7\u2013N8) modes of binding of the azide ligands.\nThermal parameters are drawn at 50%.
