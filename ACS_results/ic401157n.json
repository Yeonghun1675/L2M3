Fully reversible type-I isotherms are obtained for them, which indicate their microporous structure with apparent Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET: 273 and 243 m2/g) and Langmuir surface areas (423 and 367 m2/g). However, in La-PCP, the CO2 adsorption isotherm shows a two-step curve, and the second uptake occurs around 80 kPa. The BET and Langmuir surface areas are 156 and 534 m2/g (Figure ). Thus, such a kind of adsorption behavior is regarded as a \"gate-opening\" phenomenon that is associated with the flexibility of the frameworks. The S-type methanol adsorption isotherm also indicates the gate-opening behavior. Interestingly, because of the different boiling points of CO2 and methanol gas, the pressures of the gate-opening are different (Figure S14, ). Therefore, the activated material of La-PCP appears to be the \u2018\u2018semiclosed'' form, and then undergoes structural transformation to the \u2018\u2018open'' or as-synthesized form once the crystal obtains sufficient energy from gas adsorbate molecules to overcome the energy barrier. Single-component adsorption isotherms for C2H4 and C2H6 were also measured at 195 K. As shown in Figure , C2H4 adsorption isotherms in Ho-PCP and Y-PCP display quick saturation around 10 kPa (Figure a); however, there is almost no uptake of C2H4 and C2H6 in La-PCP even though the pressure reaches to 100 kPa (Figure b). More importantly, in contrast with the gas uptake in each sample, the highly selective discrimination of C2H4 and C2H6 in La-PCP indicates that La-PCP is a potential candidate for removal of CO2 in natural gas mixtures. In addition, it is necessary to point out that the main peaks of the PXRD around 6\u00b0 and 10\u00b0 (2\u03b8) in the degassed form of Ho-PCP and Y-PCP become slightly broad, indicating the disorder of the framework.
