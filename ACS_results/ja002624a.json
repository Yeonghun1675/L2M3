Applying the BET method we obtain a surface area of ca. 200 m2 g-1. Another proof of the microporous nature of 1 is the reversible loss of water. Thus, thermal analysis of hydrated 1 shows a dehydration process taking place in the 50-140 \u00b0C temperature range (Figure a). The material is stable up to 250 \u00b0C. Upon exposure of anhydrous 1 at 25 \u00b0C to moist air, original hydrated 1 is regenerated (Figure b). XRPD shows that the water exchange process is not responsible for any structural change in 1. Similarly, 1\u22c5NH  4  ClO  4 , upon heating at 100 \u00b0C for 24 h, loses ammonia to give an activated 1\u22c5HClO  4  acidic material (Figure ). This process is also reversible, and when 1\u22c5HClO  4  is exposed to gaseous NH3, it regenerates 1\u22c5NH  4  ClO  4 . This behavior gives 1 a close analogy to zeolites for which removal of protonated  organic amines results in the formation of the corresponding activated acidic material along with formation of large voids.

Freshly prepared empty 1 (a) and 1\u22c5NH  4  ClO  4  (b). 1\u22c5NH  4  ClO  4  loses NH3 upon heating at 100 \u00b0C to give 1\u22c5HClO  4  (c): we observe a slight lose of crystallinity but no phase change (line broadening in powder diffractogram) and slight changes in IR (broadening of some bands and apparition of a new band at 1490 cm-1). 1\u22c5HClO  4  upon exposure to NH3 vapors regenerates 1\u22c5NH  4  ClO  4  (d). 1\u22c5NH  4  ClO  4  when exposed to deionized water loses NH4ClO4 guests with a concomitant phase change to give 1 (e). Finally, when 1 is exposed for 48 h to a 0.1 M NH4ClO4 solution it gives 1\u22c5NH4ClO4 .
