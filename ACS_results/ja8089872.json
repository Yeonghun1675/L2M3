Except for CO2 at 298 K, the isotherms are apparently sigmoidal, which can be clearly identified from the presence of an inflection point in the derivative of the isotherm (Figures S1-S6, ). The 195 K isotherms seem like type I, as their inflection points locate at very low pressures. Their saturation uptakes, ca. 119 cm3 g-1, correspond to one C2H2/CO2 per pocket or six per NbO cage, indicating stoichiometric recognition. A large C2H2/CO2 uptake ratio of 30 was observed at 70 Pa, but the temperature and pressure are too low for practical interest (Figure S7, ). At 298 K, 1 atm, the C2H2 uptake of 70 cm3 g-1 (82 cm3 cm-3) represents a high value among various adsorbents and is just lower than those of zeolite 4A (98 cm3 g-1, 150 cm3 cm-3) and several coordination polymers (82-106 cm3 g-1, 77-116 cm3 cm-3) with relatively large pore volumes. In contrast to the monotonic (Langmuir, type I) and/or hysteretic isotherms resulting from micropores and strong host-guest interactions, the sigmoidal, fully reversible C2H2 isotherm of MAF-2 at 298 K would permit not only large adsorption at 1 atm but also facile desorption at moderately low pressures.
