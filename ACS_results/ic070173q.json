One can see immediately that in powder form the ethanolate is slightly larger than the methanolate. The thermal contraction of the HS and LS forms is also clearly visible. Note that in Figure  only the data obtained through cooling are presented but the complete data are given in the Supporting Information, p S11. The lattice parameters for both solvates are systematically larger during the heating cycle compared to the cooling cycle, but this could arise from imprecise thermostatting of the sample (even a very small error would cause large discrepancies since there is approximately a 10% volume change over 20 K). This is most strongly pronounced for the ethanol HS phase. The patterns that were recorded in the spin-switching regions of the two phases (175 K) yielded unexpected results. In the case of the methanolate, different two-phase mixtures were obtained depending on whether the temperature was lowered or raised (see Figure  bottom). On cooling, the methanolate separates into two phases. Phase 1 consists of 96 mol % with 50% of the Fe(II) in the HS and 50% in the LS state. Phase 2 consists of 4 mol % with 3% HS and 97% LS Fe(II). Each phase is a solid solution with a statistical distribution of the two different iron(II) species on the Wyckoff site 1a. Upon heating, the sample separates again into two different phases: 58 mol % with 51% HS and 49% LS, and 42 mol % with 4% HS and 96% LS. This is shown diagrammatically in Figure . The total fractions of the HS and LS states (T cooling, 48% HS/52% LS; T heating, 32% HS/68% LS) are in very good agreement with the magnetic measurements. For the EtOH solvate, only one pattern around T 1/2 was measured exhibiting a single phase HS/LS ~ 1:1 solid solution (T 1/2 is the temperature at which 50% of the Fe atoms are HS and 50% are LS).

It is interesting to note that despite the large difference in concentrations of solvent, the data show similar values of \u0394H for both solvates but a difference of 14 J K-1 in \u0394S. The difference in \u0394H of approximately 1 kJ mol-1 is near the limit of precision of the DSC method, and indeed the data presented here support the finding that mainly \u0394S changes as one changes from one solvent to another. First, M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of the ethanolate measured at 4.2 and 295 K (see Supporting Information, p S13) are identical to those previously published8 for the methanolate. This suggests that the direct coordination sphere of the iron is unchanged upon changing from methanol to ethanol. Second, variable temperature far-IR spectra (see Supporting Information, p S14) are also identical for the two solvates. Again, this suggests an unchanged coordination sphere, but it could be that in this case any changes are not observable as they are almost certainly within the accuracy of the experiment. Third, and most importantly, the X-ray data (a combination of single-crystal and synchrotron) show practically no change in the Fe-N distance upon changing from methanol to ethanol. Indeed, there is only a 0.02 \u00c5 change in the unit cell parameters a, b, and c in powder form, which corresponds to an approximate 5 \u00c53 increase in the unit-cell volume on going from methanol to ethanol (~0.5%; see Figure  and Supporting Information, p S11). Therefore, slight changes in the structure seem to be caused by the need to fit the larger  ethanol in and the need for the network to relax by exactly the right amount. The shift in transition temperature observed therefore does not seem to be caused by an increase in \"internal pressure\", even though comparable changes in the unit-cell volume caused by the application of an external pressure cause the same shift in T 1/2 for the extremely well studied [Fe(phen)2(NCS)2] polymorph II.
