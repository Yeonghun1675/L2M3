In this study, however, the true pH of the reaction medium is difficult to define, because the major component of the solution is DMF. Following other people\u2019s work, we therefore decided to use the pH* values of the solution, which were directly measured by a conventional pH meter equipped with a glass electrode. The pH* of a mixture of Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\u00b76H<sub>2</sub>O (2.00 mmol) and H<sub>2</sub>bdc (0.75 mmol) in DMF (15 mL) was measured to be 3.8. The pH* of the reaction mixture was adjusted in the range between 2.0 and 6.0, by adding a small amount of aqueous NaOH (2.5 M) or HCl (2.5 M) solution. After the reaction, the phase composition of resulting crystalline products was examined by PXRD and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Interestingly, between pH* 4.0 and pH* 4.5, only crystalline phase <bold>1</bold> was observed (see Figure ). Especially, highly crystalline, phase-pure interpenetrated phase <bold>1</bold> was produced at pH* 4.3, which corresponds to the pH* of the reaction medium in the presence of melamine (see ). When the pH* value of the solution was adjusted above 4.5 or below 4.0, other Zn(II)-terephthalate crystalline phases were identified in the solid product. In particular, at lower pH* (\u22643.5), the XRD pattern of the product was consistent with a simulated one for binuclear [Zn<sub>2</sub>(BDC)<sub>2</sub>(DMF)<sub>2</sub>] layered zinc(II) terephthlate [Zn<sub>2</sub>(BDC)<sub>2</sub>(DMF)<sub>2</sub>] (<bold>2</bold>). At higher pH* (\u22655.0), the diffraction pattern of the product well matched that of [Zn<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>(BDC)<sub>3</sub>] (<bold>3</bold>) phase. Apparently, the addition of a base to the reaction mixture led to the formation of MOFs such as <bold>1</bold> or <bold>3</bold> that contained oxo- or hydroxo- polynuclear zinc(II) clusters. The X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra for the solid products obtained at pH* 3.0, 4.3, and 5.0 were consistent with the

"clean_text": "pH Dependence of the Synthesis of 1 \n\nTo better understand the effect of the pH of the reaction medium on the synthesis of the crystalline products, we carried out a systematic study. In this study, however, the true pH of the reaction medium is difficult to define, because the major component of the solution is DMF. Following other people's work, we therefore decided to use the pH* values of the solution, which were directly measured by a conventional pH meter equipped with a glass electrode. The pH* of a mixture of Zn(NO3)2\u22c56H2O (2.00 mmol) and H2bdc (0.75 mmol) in DMF (15 mL) was measured to be 3.8. The pH* of the reaction mixture was adjusted in the range between 2.0 and 6.0, by adding a small amount of aqueous NaOH (2.5 M) or HCl (2.5 M) solution. After the reaction, the phase composition of resulting crystalline products was examined by PXRD and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Interestingly, between pH* 4.0 and pH* 4.5, only crystalline phase 1 was observed (see Figure ). Especially, highly crystalline, phase-pure interpenetrated phase 1 was produced at pH* 4.3, which corresponds to the pH* of the reaction medium in the presence of melamine (see ). When the pH* value of the solution was adjusted above 4.5 or below 4.0, other Zn(II)-terephthalate crystalline phases were identified in the solid product. In particular, at lower pH* (\u22643.5), the XRD pattern of the product was consistent with a simulated one for binuclear [Zn2(BDC)2(DMF)2] layered zinc(II) terephthlate [Zn2(BDC)2(DMF)2] (2). At higher pH* (\u22655.0), the diffraction pattern of the product well matched that of [Zn5(OH)4(BDC)3] (3) phase. Apparently, the addition of a base to the reaction mixture led to the formation of MOFs such as 1 or 3 that contained oxo- or hydroxo- polynuclear zinc(II) clusters. The X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra for the solid products obtained at pH* 3.0, 4.3, and 5.0 were consistent with the structures of the above-mentioned compounds with different local Zn environments (see Figure  and ).      2   Zn   2 +   + 2   BDC   2 -   + 2 DMF \u2192 [   Zn   2     ( BDC )   2     ( DMF )   2   ]   (  2 )    pH*  \u2264 3.5     4   Zn   2 +   + 3   BDC   2 -   +   H   2   O \u2192   1   2     [    Zn   4   O   ( BDC )   3    ]   2     (  1 ) + 2   H   +     4 \u2264  pH*  \u2264 4.5     5   Zn   2 +   + 3   BDC   2 -   + 4   H   2   O \u2192 [   Zn   5     ( OH )   4     ( BDC )   3   ]   (  3 ) + 4   H   +      pH*  \u2265 5       ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 12, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig4\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) spectra of crystalline materials obtained at different pH* values.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr4\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"ic-2011-00054b_0003.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 4  Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) spectra of crystalline materials obtained at different pH* values.
