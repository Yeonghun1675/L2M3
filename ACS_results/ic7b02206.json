As shown in a, Cd1 is six-coordinated in an octahedral coordination environment, defined by six oxygen atoms from five different L1 anions. The Cd-O bond lengths are in the normal range of 2.255(2)-2.427(3) \u00c5 as other Cd(II)-containing coordination polymers. Two symmetry-related Cd1 ions are connected by four carboxylate groups to generate a binuclear unit with the Cd\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cd distance of 3.443 \u00c5. Each L1 anion links three binuclear units to form a layer (b).

TGA data were collected in the temperature range of 30-800 \u00b0C under a N2 atmosphere. The TGA curves of compounds 1-4 are shown in Figure S15. Compound 1 shows a weight loss of 2.38% from 50 to 135 \u00b0C, which is attributed to the loss of one lattice water molecule (calcd 2.62%). The second gradual weight loss begins at 263 \u00b0C, and does not stop before 800 \u00b0C. Compound 2 undergoes dehydration from 46 to 121 \u00b0C (obsd 2.00%, calcd 2.46%). There is no further weight loss from 121 to 281 \u00b0C. After 281 \u00b0C, the organic components start to decompose. For compound 3, the weight loss of 3.39% from 80 to 165 \u00b0C is consistent with the release of one lattice water molecule (calcd 3.18%). The organic compositions start to decompose at 256 \u00b0C and do not stop before 800 \u00b0C. The anhydrous compound 4 is thermally stable up to around 343 \u00b0C, and the weight losses occur in a consecutive step and do not end before 800 \u00b0C. Variable-temperature PXRD measurements imply that the PXRD patterns of compounds 1 and 2 at 100 \u00b0C and that of compound 3 at 130 \u00b0C were not identical to those of the corresponding as-synthesized samples (Figure S5). On the basis of the fact that compounds 1-3 can proceed reversible photochromic processes after heating at 100 \u00b0C (compounds 1 and 2) or 130 \u00b0C (compound 3), we inferred that, after heating at 100 or 130 \u00b0C, compounds 1-3 lost their lattice water molecules, but the frameworks of them did not collapse. Then, the frameworks which have lost lattice water molecules kept stable at least up to 262 \u00b0C for 1, 281 \u00b0C for 2, and 255 \u00b0C for 3, which have been confirmed by the PXRD patterns (Figure S5). The PXRD pattern of compound 4 at 343 \u00b0C was identical to that of the as-synthesized sample (Figure S5), indicating that the anhydrous compound 4 is stable up to 343 \u00b0C.", "data":
