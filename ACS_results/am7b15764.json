Therein, the finely ground sample of FITC@1 (3 mg) was initially immersed in aqueous solution (3 mL) and subsequently treated by ultrasonication for 30 min and aged for 3 d to form a stable emulsion. Then, the fluorescence responses of the composite were recorded when separately titrating equal amounts of different disruptors listed above. The emission spectra shown in c illustrate that the emission intensity of the suspension of FITC@1 was quenched to ca. 80% when the content of 3-NPA approached 4 \u00d7 10-4 M, whereas, with the addition of the same amount of sucrose, glucose, fructose, serine, or alanine, the maximum change in emission intensity was less than 20%. Obviously, these results indicate that the composite FITC@1 can effectively differentiate several major nontoxic constituents of sugarcane from the toxic 3-NPA by displaying a highly selective fluorescence quenching response. For a comprehensive assessment of the sensing ability of a material, its antiinterference ability should also be examined. Thus, we sequentially introduced the five interfering substances (i.e., sucrose, glucose, fructose, serine, and alanine) into the current system. As shown in d, the fluorescence intensity of the suspension was almost unchanged with the addition of five substances (3 \u00d7 10-5 M), but was acutely decreased after the addition of 3-NPA (3 \u00d7 10-5 M).
