Moreover, it is clearly stated that the role of alkylamines in the synthesis of copper particles is limited to the solvent or dispersing agent in the presence of stronger reducing agents such as hydrogen gas, formate, carbon monoxide, or oxalate. Claims in literature which directly correlate the in situ reduction temperature with the reducing properties of amines or the ease of CO2 evolution can therefore be considered as incomplete simplifications. If the shift of the in situ reduction temperature was solely related to the direct coordination of copper(II) with electron-donating amine groups, it would be expected that the ethylenediamine reference compound exhibited the lowest decomposition temperature because of the fourfold occupation of coordination positions by the amine groups (see ).
