H2 L1 (0.10 g, 0.25 mmol) was dissolved in a DMF (25 mL), water (5 mL), and concentrated nitric acid (2.3 mL) solution. To this was added zinc nitrate hexahydrate (0.075 g, 0.25 mmol), and the orange solution was mixed thoroughly and then dispersed evenly into 4 mL screw-cap vials, which were heated at 90 \u00b0C for 24 h. Orange single crystals suitable for XRD deposited directly from the hot solution and were collected by filtration. Yield: 0.066 g (0.11 mmol, 46%). Anal.
