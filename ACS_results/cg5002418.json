The short O3\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O2 distance 2.6929 \u00c5 indicates a remarkable interaction (Figure ). Interestingly, the left-handed/right-handed helical chains are built on the same Cd1 ions, and the 1D sideline is composed of the X-shaped bracket H2ttac2- ligand and the flexible bpp. It is common neither for the homochiral triple-stranded helical chains built on the same metal nodes nor for 1D structure in which the X-shaped bracket ligand and bpp are involved, because they are inclined to produce higher-dimensional structures instead of 1D chains. From the viewpoint of topology, Cd2+ ion, H2ttac2-, and bpp can be respectively simplified as 4-, 2-, and 2-connected nodes; therefore, the network of 1 belongs to a 4-connected uninodal topology with the Schla\u0308fli symbol as (33.42.5). As an X-shaped bracket ligand, H4ttac, which is half-deprotonated as H2ttac2-, displays two key characters in the formation of the network: (1) in the backbone, H2ttac2- ligands adopt bridging bidentate coordination mode and act as the twisted V-shaped linkage, forming the 1D helical chains along the a-axis and the b-axis; (2) on the arms around the helical chains, two terminal carboxylic groups remain protonated, which may be potential active sites for host and guest interaction, and this provides opportunities for 1 to become a candidate as the luminescent sensor.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 16, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Based\non the above structure analyses, we believe that <bold>1</bold> belongs\nto the rarely reported third category of one-fold L1D +\nR1D \u2192 3D polycatenated networks, and as far as we know, is the first case built on diamine bridging\nligand; among polymers of this structure type, <bold>1</bold> is also\nthe first example containing two protonated carboxylic groups, and\nthe removal of active protons may have an effect on the luminescence\nproperties, which also deserve close attention.</p>", "clean_text": "Based on the above structure analyses, we believe that 1 belongs to the rarely reported third category of one-fold L1D + R1D \u2192 3D polycatenated networks, and as far as we know, is the first case built on diamine bridging ligand; among polymers of this structure type, 1 is also the first example containing two protonated carboxylic groups, and the removal of active protons may have an effect on the luminescence properties, which also deserve close attention.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 17, "type": "text", "classification": ["property"], "content": "<title>Phase Purity\nand Thermal Stability</title><p>PXRD pattern has\nbeen tested to verify the purity of the sample (), and it demonstrates good agreement with the\nsimulated pattern by single crystal X-ray diffraction data.
