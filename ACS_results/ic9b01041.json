The turbid solution was cooled to -40 \u00b0C. After 20 h at -40 \u00b0C, the product had separated as a colorless solid (in this, a few solid crystals suitable for single crystal X-ray diffraction were found, though of low quality). The solution was decanted, and the residue was washed with cold n-pentane (2 \u00d7 2 mL, -40 \u00b0C) and thoroughly dried in vacuo to give the product as PhMe solvate 3a(Ph3B-Bcat)(PhMe) n  with varying amounts of PhMe present (18 mg, 12 \u03bcmol, 51% (based on BPh3)). Slightly better quality single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction studies were obtained by recrystallization of the isolated product from THF/n-pentane at -40 \u00b0C. The NMR spectra suggest the presence of two major species 2m and 3a(Ph3B-Bcat); only the data of the latter are given here. For a detailed discussion of the NMR data, see below.\n\n[(SIDipp)Cu(Ph3B-Bcat)]\n\nIn a nitrogen-filled glovebox, 2m (43.0 mg, 75.2 \u03bcmol, 1.0 equiv) and BPh3 (18.2 mg, 75.2 \u03bcmol, 1.0 equiv) were combined in a screw-cap vial in PhMe (2 mL). The turbid solution was cooled to -40 \u00b0C, and the product was separated within 20 h as colorless crystals suitable for single crystal X-ray diffraction. The solution was decanted, and the residue was washed with cold n-pentane (2 \u00d7 2 mL, -40 \u00b0C) and thoroughly dried in vacuo to give the product (43 mg, 53 \u03bcmol, 70%) as toluene solvate. Recrystallization from Et2O at -40 \u00b0C gave the ether solvate in X-ray quality crystals. The different species present are reported separately; for a detailed discussion, see below.\n\n[((SIDipp)Cu)2Bdmab][Ph3B-Bdmab] (3b(Ph3B-Bdmab))\n\nIn a nitrogen-filled glovebox, 2n (25.0 mg, 41.8 \u03bcmol, 1.0 equiv) and BPh3 (5.1 mg, 20.9 \u03bcmol, 0.5 equiv) were combined in a screw-cap vial in PhMe (2 mL). After 16 h at -40 \u00b0C, the product had separated as a colorless solid. The solution was decanted, and the residue was washed with cold n-pentane (2 \u00d7 2 mL, -40 \u00b0C) and thoroughly dried in vacuo to give 3b(Ph3B-Bdmab) (21 mg, 15 \u03bcmol, 70% (based on BPh3)). Single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction studies were obtained by recrystallization of the isolated product from THF/n-pentane at -40 \u00b0C. The NMR spectra suggest the presence of two major species 2n and presumably 3b(Ph3B-Bdmab); only the data of the latter are given here. For a detailed discussion of the NMR data, see below.\n\n[((SIDipp)Cu)2Bcat][B(C6F5)4] (3a(BArF))\n\nIn a nitrogen-filled glovebox, 2m (30.0 mg, 52.4 \u03bcmol, 1.0 equiv) and [CPh3][B(C6F5)4] (24.4 mg, 26.2 \u03bcmol, 0.5 equiv) were combined in a screw-cap vial in PhMe (1.5 mL). After a few minutes at rt, the solution was layered with n-pentane (ca. 4 mL) and cooled to -40 \u00b0C. After 20 h at -40 \u00b0C, a viscous layer had separated that solidified to an off-white to yellowish solid within 3 days at -40 \u00b0C. The solution was decanted, and the residue was washed with cold n-pentane (2 \u00d7 2 mL, -40 \u00b0C) and thoroughly dried in vacuo to give 3a(BArF)(C5H12)1/2 (16 mg, 9 \u03bcmol, 36%). Single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction studies were obtained by recrystallization of the isolated product from Et2O/n-pentane at -40 \u00b0C.\n\n[((SIDipp)Cu)2Bcat][BF4] 3a(BF4)\n\nIn a nitrogen-filled glovebox, 2m (30.0 mg, 52.4 \u03bcmol, 1.0 equiv) and [CPh3][BF4] (8.6 mg, 26.2 \u03bcmol, 0.5 equiv) were combined in a screw-cap vial in THF (3 mL). After 1 h at -40 \u00b0C, the solution was layered with n-pentane (ca. 4 mL) and cooled to -40 \u00b0C. After 36 h at -40 \u00b0C, a few colorless crystals (also of low quality suitable for single crystal X-ray diffraction) had separated; the solution was decanted, and the solid residue washed with cold n-pentane (2 \u00d7 2 mL, -40 \u00b0C) and thoroughly dried in vacuo to give 3a(BF4) (3 mg, 3 \u03bcmol, 12%). The NMR properties and cell parameters match those reported by Sadighi. \n\n[((SIDipp)Cu)(OEt2)][BArF]\n\nIn a nitrogen-filled glovebox, 2m (30.0 mg, 52.4 \u03bcmol, 1.0 equiv) and [CPh3][B(C6F5)4] (48.8 mg, 52.4 \u03bcmol, 1.0 equiv) were combined in a screw-cap vial in Et2O (1.5 mL). After 16 h at -40 \u00b0C, the mixture was layered with n-pentane (ca. 4 mL). After 20 h at -40 \u00b0C, the product had separated as a microcrystalline solid; the solution was decanted, and the residue was washed with cold n-pentane (2 \u00d7 2 mL, -40 \u00b0C) and thoroughly dried in vacuo (42 mg, 35 \u03bcmol, 67%). Note that it was found that the NHC:Et2O ratio varied according to 1H NMR spectroscopy around unity dependent on the time of vacuum drying, possibly due to solvent adhering to the solid as well as partial loss of the ligand Et2O (see also the analytical data). Single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction studies were obtained by recrystallization of the isolated product from Et2O/n-pentane at -40 \u00b0C.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "[(SIDipp)Cu-Bcat]",
