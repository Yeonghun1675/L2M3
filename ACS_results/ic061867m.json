The other pyridine rings also took part in different two-layered \u03c0-stacking interactions with symmetry-related pyridine rings [centroid-to-centroid distance 3.80 (4\u22c52MeCN\u22c52CHCl  3 ) and 3.68 \u00c5 (5\u22c56MeCN)], and were strictly parallel due to their symmetry. In contrast to the complexes of 3tet, there were no interligand C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0  interactions in these structures. The solvent molecules in the two complexes were held in place by a number of interactions. In 4\u22c52MeCN\u22c52CHCl  3  the MeCN solvent molecules were held in place in the framework by one direct set of interactions. They formed weak C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0(pyridine) interactions with the framework at a distance of 3.05 \u00c5. This distance is close to the van der Waals limit, but CH-\u03c0 interactions have been suggested to be effective at distances beyond this value. The MeCN molecules also formed a C-Cl\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5H-C interaction with the solvent CHCl3 molecules at a distance of 2.69 \u00c5 with corresponding Cl\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C separation of 3.61 \u00c5. The CHCl3 molecules were only very loosely held in place, as they interacted only with the MeCN molecules and the ClO4 - anions (O3Cl-O\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5H-C separation 2.24 \u00c5, corresponding O\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C separation of 3.21 \u00c5). In 5\u22c56MeCN the solvent MeCN molecules in the structure were held in their places in the framework by very weak N\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5H-C interactions between MeCN N atoms and both alkyl and aryl C-H. Distances ranged from 2.54 to 2.92 \u00c5, with C\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C separations of 3.24-3.88 \u00c5. In both complexes the anion had a variety of weak interactions with either or both alkyl and aryl hydrogens. The ClO4 - anions in 4\u22c52MeCN\u22c52CHCl  3  had an O3Cl-O\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5H-C separation of 2.47 \u00c5 and a corresponding O\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C separation of 3.40 \u00c5, while the PF6 - anions in 5\u22c56MeCN had F5P-F\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5H-C separations in the range 2.38-2.55 \u00c5 and corresponding F\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C separations of 3.20-3.39 \u00c5. This confirmed the assumption, made on the basis of the IR data, that the anions did not coordinate to the Ag(I) ion. However, the peak broadening or minor splitting seen in the relevant peaks of the IR spectra could be due to the weak interactions noted here.
