Altogether, these results suggest that the hybrid materials can act as reservoirs of silver ions. The release process likely occurs at the interface of the solid and water solution until equilibrium is reached. Finally, the amount of silver release in solution depends on the structure of the hybrid, thus demonstrating that the topology of the hybrid material can be used to design materials possessing a tunable capability of releasing silver ions in its aqueous environment.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 30, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig6\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>6</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Concentration\n(\u03bcM) of Ag<sup>+</sup> in solution as a function of time when\n12 mg of a selected material (<bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>4</bold>) was placed in 1 mL of water (<italic toggle=\"yes\">t</italic> = 6 h corresponds\nto the first analysis).

As expected, no mass lost was observed for these compounds from room temperature to 360 \u00b0C thus confirming the data obtained by X-ray diffraction that concluded that no water molecules were present in the structures. These analyses also showed the thermal stability of this series of compounds up to 300 \u00b0C.
