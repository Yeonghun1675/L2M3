The solvothermal reaction between Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\u00b76H<sub>2</sub>O and a mixture of H<sub>2</sub>Me<sub>4</sub>BPDC and H<sub>2</sub>TPDC in DEF afforded yellow crystals. The composition of the product was determined by <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy of a solution obtained from digesting the yellow crystals with HCl in DMSO-<italic toggle=\"yes\">d</italic>\n<sub>6</sub> ().

The Zn<sub>4</sub>O(Me<sub>4</sub>BPDC)<sub>3</sub> PXRD pattern is the same as that simulated from its single crystal structure, exhibiting interpenetration (Figure c). As the concentration of the very bulky H<sub>2</sub>TPDC is increased in the reaction mixture, the PXRD patterns of the resulting mixed-linker crystalline solid gradually change from the interpenetrated Zn<sub>4</sub>O(Me<sub>4</sub>BPDC)<sub>3</sub> phase to the noninterpenetrated Zn<sub>4</sub>O(TPDC)<sub>3</sub> phase. At 9 mol % of TPDC incorporation (<italic toggle=\"yes\">y</italic> = 0.09), the pale yellow solid exhibits framework interpenetration. As the TPDC amounts increase to 40 mol % (0.1 \u2264 <italic toggle=\"yes\">y</italic> \u2264 0.4), the noninterpenetrated framework appears and then gradually replaces the PXRD pattern of the interpenetrated copolymers. On the other hand, at over 40 mol % of TPDC (<italic toggle=\"yes\">y</italic> &gt; 0.4), the PXRD patterns of the yellow cubic crystals obtained agree well with that of noninterpenetrated Zn<sub>4</sub>O(TPDC)<sub>3</sub>, indicating that the bulky TIPS groups of TPDC drastically reduce the framework interpenetration within these random coordination copolymers. The dependence of surface area on composition reveals the advantage of this approach (Figure c). First, a slightly reduced surface area is observed for interpenetrated Zn<sub>4</sub>O(Me<sub>4</sub>BPDC)<sub>2.33</sub>(TPDC)<sub>0.27</sub> (<italic toggle=\"yes\">y</italic> = 0.09) compared to that of pure Zn<sub>4</sub>O(Me<sub>4</sub>BPDC)<sub>3</sub>; the introduction of a small amount of the sterically demanding TPDC into the interpenetrated Zn<sub>4</sub>O(Me<sub>4</sub>BPDC)<sub>3</sub> framework results in a reduced surface area of the mixed-linker MCP. As the TPDC content within the mixed-linker coordination copolymers reaches the 40\u201350 mol % level of incorporation, the BET surface areas of the products dramatically increase to approximately 3000 m<sup>2</sup>/g, which is the highest BET surface area experimentally obtained for biphenyl-based IRMOFs. As the PXRD indicates, in the range of 40\u201350 mol % TPDC, the majority of crystals possess the noninterpenetrated frameworks, thus greatly increasing the surface area because the less bulky Me<sub>4</sub>BPDC linkers within the noninterpenetrated framework reduce the proportion of inaccessible sorption sites and enlarge the pores with respect to those of Zn<sub>4</sub>O(TPDC)<sub>3</sub>. As TPDC concentrations continue to increase, the surface areas, however, decrease because the TIPS group now fills the pores, thus blocking sorption sites. Importantly, we also note that in contrast to the nonlinear surface area change for the Me<sub>4</sub>BPDC-TPDC coordination copolymers, the surface areas obtained from physical mixtures of pure Zn<sub>4</sub>O(Me<sub>4</sub>BPDC)<sub>3</sub> and Zn<sub>4</sub>O(TPDC)<sub>3</sub> vary linearly based on that of pure Zn<sub>4</sub>O(Me<sub>4</sub>BPDC)<sub>3</sub> to that of Zn<sub>4</sub>O(TPDC)<sub>3</sub> (Figure S2 of the ). These results highlight the strategy of using mixed linkers in a coordination copolymerization fashion to control the level/extent of interpenetration of a framework by combining linkers that are metrically similar along one axis but quite dissimilar in the other two, thus ultimately influencing pore size and surface area.</p>", "clean_text": "The above results suggest that if a linker is sufficiently bulky to prevent interpenetration, then it may block adsorption sites, leading to little overall advantage. A solution for this dilemma is to mix both bulky and nonbulky linkers together. The solvothermal reaction between Zn(NO3)2\u22c56H2O and a mixture of H2Me4BPDC and H2TPDC in DEF afforded yellow crystals. The composition of the product was determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy of a solution obtained from digesting the yellow crystals with HCl in DMSO-d 6 (). PXRD measurements reveal the differences in structural features of a series of Zn4O(Me4BPDC)3-x (TPDC) x  (0 \u2264 x \u2264 3) copolymers (Figure b). The Zn4O(Me4BPDC)3 PXRD pattern is the same as that simulated from its single crystal structure, exhibiting interpenetration (Figure c). As the concentration of the very bulky H2TPDC is increased in the reaction mixture, the PXRD patterns of the resulting mixed-linker crystalline solid gradually change from the interpenetrated Zn4O(Me4BPDC)3 phase to the noninterpenetrated Zn4O(TPDC)3 phase. At 9 mol % of TPDC incorporation (y = 0.09), the pale yellow solid exhibits framework interpenetration. As the TPDC amounts increase to 40 mol % (0.1 \u2264 y \u2264 0.4), the noninterpenetrated framework appears and then gradually replaces the PXRD pattern of the interpenetrated copolymers. On the other hand, at over 40 mol % of TPDC (y > 0.4), the PXRD patterns of the yellow cubic crystals obtained agree well with that of noninterpenetrated Zn4O(TPDC)3, indicating that the bulky TIPS groups of TPDC drastically reduce the framework interpenetration within these random coordination copolymers. The dependence of surface area on composition reveals the advantage of this approach (Figure c). First, a slightly reduced surface area is observed for interpenetrated Zn4O(Me4BPDC)2.33(TPDC)0.27 (y = 0.09) compared to that of pure Zn4O(Me4BPDC)3; the introduction of a small amount of the sterically demanding TPDC into the interpenetrated Zn4O(Me4BPDC)3 framework results in a reduced surface area of the mixed-linker MCP. As the TPDC content within the mixed-linker coordination copolymers reaches the 40-50 mol % level of incorporation, the BET surface areas of the products dramatically increase to approximately 3000 m2/g, which is the highest BET surface area experimentally obtained for biphenyl-based IRMOFs. As the PXRD indicates, in the range of 40-50 mol % TPDC, the majority of crystals possess the noninterpenetrated frameworks, thus greatly increasing the surface area because the less bulky Me4BPDC linkers within the noninterpenetrated framework reduce the proportion of inaccessible sorption sites and enlarge the pores with respect to those of Zn4O(TPDC)3. As TPDC concentrations continue to increase, the surface areas, however, decrease because the TIPS group now fills the pores, thus blocking sorption sites. Importantly, we also note that in contrast to the nonlinear surface area change for the Me4BPDC-TPDC coordination copolymers, the surface areas obtained from physical mixtures of pure Zn4O(Me4BPDC)3 and Zn4O(TPDC)3 vary linearly based on that of pure Zn4O(Me4BPDC)3 to that of Zn4O(TPDC)3 (Figure S2 of the ).
