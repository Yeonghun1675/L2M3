Higher adsorption\nof N<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> for compound <bold>2\u2032</bold> could be attributed to the open metal sites and larger open channels\nin the framework.</p>", "clean_text": "Structural analysis of 2 revealed that Zn(II) and PO4 3- ions formed a continuous 1D chain along the crystallographic c-axis (b) connected by the ligand L to form double-walled hexagonal channels (c,d) with the window size of ~15 \u00d7 16 \u00c52 and, furthermore, formed an interesting 3D framework with a rosette structure. The large hexagonal channels were filled up with DMF molecules and DMA cations. The total potential solvent accessible void volume of 2 was found to be 42.5% (4477 \u00c53/10532 \u00c53). The framework contained coordinated water molecules inside the walls of the channels. Upon heating, the coordinated water molecules could be removed to obtain activated framework, 2', with open metal sites as a potential candidate for gas adsorption and heterogeneous catalysis.\n\nTGA measurements for 1 and 2 were carried out to examine the thermal stability of the networks. The TGA curve of the as-synthesized sample of 1 showed a weight loss of 38% (calculated 38.1%) between 50 and 350 \u00b0C corresponding to the loss of all solvent molecules in the cavities. Thereafter, a sharp weight loss was observed that corresponded to the decomposition of the framework (Figure S2). For 2, the sample showed a weight loss of 32% (calculated 31.7%) between 50 and 275 \u00b0C corresponding to the loss of all solvent molecules in the cavities along with the loss of coordinated water molecules. Thereafter, a sharp weight loss indicated collapsing of the framework. Phase purity of the synthesized frameworks was analyzed by PXRD measurements of the as-synthesized samples of 1 and 2. The experimental PXRD patterns for the as-synthesized compounds were in good agreement with the simulated patterns of 1 and 2. The methanol exchanged materials were heated under high vacuum at 150 \u00b0C for 8 h to generate the activated compounds, 1' and 2'. The crystalline nature of the evacuated material was also confirmed by powder XRD (Figures S3 and S4) measurements in which no significant shift or broadening of peaks were observed compared to the as-synthesized materials, 1 and 2.\n\nGas Adsorption Studies\n\nThe considerable porosity and thermally robust nature of 1 and 2 along with the presence of open metal sites prompted us to study the gas adsorption studies. Activation of 1 and 2 was achieved by keeping the sample in anhydrous methanol for 5 days, followed by heating at 150 \u00b0C under high vacuum for 8 h, to produce guest-free 1' and 2'. The guest-free frameworks were first subjected to N2 sorption studies at 77 K. For 1', N2 uptake (Figure S5) was negligible (3.8 cc g-1), whereas 2' showed a comparably higher uptake with a maximum uptake of 214.7 cc g-1 (a). The low N2 uptake in 1' can be due to the large kinetic diameter of N2 (3.6 \u00c5) than CO2 (3.3 \u00c5). Furthermore, the low kinetic energy of the N2 molecules at 77 K does not allow entering of the small windows of 1'. Therefore, the BET surface area for 1' was calculated based on the CO2 sorption isotherm at 273 K. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas for 1' and 2' were estimated to be 215 m2 g-1 (from CO2 adsorption isotherm) and 750 m2 g-1 (from N2 adsorption isotherms), respectively.\n\nFurther, the CO2 adsorption studies of 1' and 2' revealed that the isotherms were quite similar and showed complete reversibility and no hysteresis with a type I adsorption curve (b). Sample 1' showed adsorption of CO2 gas at 273 K with a maximum uptake of 58 cc g-1at 1 bar pressure, whereas the uptake value for 2' was 111.7 cc g-1 at 1 bar pressure. Higher adsorption of N2 and CO2 for compound 2' could be attributed to the open metal sites and larger open channels in the framework.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "2", "symbol": "2", "chemical
