According to our X-ray diffraction studies, the FMD+ cation shows trigonal disorder in the high-temperature (HT) phase (see discussion in the next paragraphs of the present paper). For an order-disorder transition, \u0394S = R ln(N), where N is the number of sites for the disordered system. Therefore, for a simple 3-fold order-disorder model \u0394S should be 9.1 J mol-1 K-1. Our data show that \u0394S is an order of magnitude smaller than the expected value. This result indicates that the phase transition is more complex than expected on the basis of a simple 3-fold order-disorder model. It is worth noting that a less than expected entropy change at a phase transition is known in the multiferroic family. It was, for instance, observed for (NH4)3Cr(O2)4 and M3-x (NH4) x CrO8 (M = Na, K, Rb, Cs) multiferroics. It has been discussed that this behavior is observed since some residual entropy is always left over if the transition has some relaxor character.

Figure b,c show that the 245 and 1360 cm-1 Raman modes exhibit significant splitting near T c, and this splitting increases in a continuous way upon further cooling. Frequencies of the 2871 (\u03bd1(HCOO-)), 1373 (\u03bd5(HCOO-)), and 602 cm-1 (\u03c4(NH2)) Raman modes (at 5 K) exhibit a continuous increase upon cooling the high-temperature phase from 450 K to around 340 K. Near 340 K, a clear decrease in frequency is observed for these modes (see Figures a,b and ). The observed decrease is however not very sharp but extends down to about 295 K. Upon further cooling the sample, frequencies of these modes exhibit a further increase. The observed temperature dependence of the discussed modes provides important information on structural changes in FMDMn. First, weak discontinuity of the splitting and lack of discontinuous frequency shifts indicate that the phase transition has slightly first-order nature. Second, the large magnitude of the observed splitting at 5 K, 25 cm-1 for the T'(HCOO-) and 8 cm-1 for the \u03bd2(HCOO-) modes, as well as downshifts of the discussed \u03bd1(HCOO-) and \u03bd5(HCOO-) modes at T c by 1.7 and 2.4 cm-1, respectively, points to a significant distortion of the metal formate framework below T c.

This conclusion is supported by theoretical studies of MOFs with\na perovskite-like topology containing different organic ions such\nas C\u00ad(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>\n<sup>+</sup>, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>\n<sup>+</sup>, and CF<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>\n<sup>+</sup>. These studies revealed\nthat ferroelectric polarization in this class of compounds appears\ndue to the peculiar canted ordering of the organic cation dipole moments.\nThus, it is possible to tune the ferroelectric polarization by changing\nthe magnitude and the canting of the organic molecular dipole. Our results show that in spite of very similar\nstructures of DMAMn and FMDMn compounds, and similar monoclinic distortion\nof the parent trigonal phase below <italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic>\n<sub>c</sub>,\nthe cooperative ordering of the FMD<sup>+</sup> cations leads to the\ncentrosymmetric structure. Furthermore, in contrast to the MOFs containing\nC\u00ad(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>\n<sup>+</sup>, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>\n<sup>+</sup>, CF<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>\n<sup>+</sup>, etc., cations, the FMD<sup>+</sup> cations do not exhibit\nany significant tilting in the low-temperature phase. This very important\ndifference in behavior of FMDMn and ferroelectric MOFs with a perovskite-like\ntopology containing monoamino cations indicates that the size of the\norganic cation and its bonding strength to the anionic framework play\na very important role in the stability of the structure and determine\nits properties. Very weak distortion and negligible tilt of the FMD<sup>+</sup> cation below <italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic>\n<sub>c</sub> can be attributed\nto formation of extensive H-bonds between this diamino cation and\nthe anionic framework.</p>", "clean_text": "Different experimental methods used in the present study show that the phase transition in FMDMn has slightly first-order character, in contrast with a strongly first-order character in DMAMn. Temperature-dependent studies give also strong evidence that the phase transition in FMDMn has an order-disorder character and is governed by dynamics of the FMD+ cations. Our results show that ordering of the FMD+ cations is also associated with a significant distortion of the metal formate framework but very weak distortion of the FMD+ cation itself. In particular, the FMD+ cation remains nearly planar, with the two C-N bonds still equivalent in the low-temperature phase. Furthermore, the FMD+ ions do not exhibit any significant tilting with respect to the anionic framework. This behavior is considerably different from that observed for DMAMn, for which substantial distortion below T c was observed also for the DMA+ cation. Here it is important to mention that theoretical considerations showed that in [C(NH2)3[[Cu(HCOO)3] the organic ion is the main source of polarization. It was also suggested that using a different organic cation with more polarizable electron density would increase the polarization. This conclusion is supported by theoretical studies of MOFs with a perovskite-like topology containing different organic ions such as C(NH2)3 +, CH3CH2NH3 +, and CF3CH2NH3 +. These studies revealed that ferroelectric polarization in this class of compounds appears due to the peculiar canted ordering of the organic cation dipole moments. Thus, it is possible to tune the ferroelectric polarization by changing the magnitude and the canting of the organic molecular dipole. Our results show that in spite of very similar structures of DMAMn and FMDMn compounds, and similar monoclinic distortion of the parent trigonal phase below T c, the cooperative ordering of the FMD+ cations leads to the centrosymmetric structure. Furthermore, in contrast to the MOFs containing C(NH2)3 +, CH3CH2NH3 +, CF3CH2NH3 +, etc., cations, the FMD+ cations do not exhibit any significant tilting in the low-temperature phase. This very important difference in behavior of FMDMn and ferroelectric MOFs with a perovskite-like topology containing monoamino cations indicates that the size of the organic cation and its bonding strength to the anionic framework play a very important role in the stability of the structure and determine its properties.
