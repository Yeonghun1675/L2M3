Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed this family of materials is thermally stable to above 200 \u00b0C (Figure S10). For example, [B 4/3(Ru2 4-hp)] n  is stable up to 250 \u00b0C after which temperature continuous weight loss is observed (Figure S10c).\n\nBoth synthetic conditions utilized to prepare the polymeric materials and activation protocol are important to achieving the indicated surface areas. Initial attempts toward [A 4/3(Ru2 5-hp)] n  utilized Ru2(5-I-hp)4Cl, which is poorly soluble in the reaction medium, as the metallomonomer. The resulting material was found to be nonporous. In contrast, polymerization of the more soluble tetrafluoroborate complex Ru2(5-I-hp)4BF4 provided [A 4/3(Ru2 5-hp)] n , which displayed a BET surface area of 329 m2/g (Langmuir surface area of 516 m2/g). With respect to activation, Soxhlet extraction with MeOH was found to be critical. For example, comparison of the N2 uptake of a sample of [A 4/3(Ru2 4-hp)] n  obtained directly from synthesis to that of [A 4/3(Ru2 4-hp)] n  extracted by MeOH for 48 h is shown in Figure S11g. A significant increase of N2 uptake capacity was observed from 114 cm3/g (P/P 0 = 0.3) of the unextracted sample to 175 cm3/g (P/P 0 = 0.3) of the extracted sample, which corresponds to BET surface areas of 389 m2/g (Langmuir surface area at 462 m2/g) and 499 m2/g (Langmuir surface area at 782 m2/g), respectively.\n\nFor a given Ru2 unit, increasing the alkyne linker length (from A to B) or moving from tris-alkyne A to tetra-alkyne C enhanced the surface area of the resulting polymer. For example, in the case of Ru2(4-I-OBz)4BF4, [B 4/3(Ru2 OBz)] n  and [C(Ru2 OBz)] n  exhibited BET surface areas of 392 and 353 m2/g, respectively, while [A 4/3(Ru2 OBz)] n  was determined to be nonporous. A similar trend was observed with metallopolymers based on both Ru2(4-I-hp)4BF4 and Ru2(5-I-hp)4BF4 (). To evaluate the reproducibility of the described synthetic method, three batches of [B 4/3(Ru2 4-hp)] n  were prepared from independent reactions and were characterized by gas sorption (Figure S11d). The BET surface areas determined for these samples were 641, 627, and 666 m2/g, respectively, with an average value of 644 \u00b1 11 m2/g, which validated the reproducibility of the synthetic protocol.
