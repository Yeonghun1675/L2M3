The above results indicate that small pores in MOFs are beneficial to the uptake of some special gases including H2, D2, C2H2, etc.\n\nIn our previous work, we reported a nanoporous MOF (FIR-29, FIR = Fujian Institute of Research) that consisted of Ca-COO chains linked by tris[(4-carboxyl)phenylduryl]amine (H3TCPA; ) ligands and showed large hexagonal channels with an aperture of 16 \u00c5 and a high BET surface area of 2061 m2 g-1. However, the H2, D2, and C2H2 sorption properties for FIR-29 have not been investigated.

The comparisons of H2, D2, and C2H2 sorption for the activated FJI-Y9-ht and FIR-29-ht indicate the advantage of a small pore in MOFs for H2, D2, and C2H2 storage.\n\n Crystal Data of FJI-Y9: C88H57Ca6N5O28, M r = 1872.86, orthorhombic, space group Pca21, a = 28.5175(3) \u00c5, b = 18.6224(2) \u00c5, c = 23.4007(2) \u00c5, V = 12427.3(2) \u00c53, Z = 4, D c = 1.001 g cm-3, F 000 = 3856, Cu K\u03b1 radiation, \u03bb = 1.54184 \u00c5, T = 100.0(2) K, 2\u03b8max = 146.3\u00b0, 24743 reflections collected, 15121 unique (R int = 0.0281), final GOF = 1.050, R 1 = 0.0427, wR 2 = 0.1116, R indices based on 13772 reflections with I > 2\u03c3(\u0399) (refinement on F 2).\n\nThe purity phase of FJI-Y9 has been verified by PXRD measurements (Figure S1). The TGA curve of FJI-Y9 indicates that the dissociative and coordinated solvent molecules can be gradually removed at 415 \u00b0C with a weight loss of 32% (Figure S2). To attain complete evacuation for gas sorption, the original FJI-Y9 is soaked in fresh acetonitrile under 80 \u00b0C for 2 weeks and then degassed under 150 \u00b0C for 12 h to generate the activated sample FJI-Y9-ht.\n\nIn order to examine the structural stability and porosity of FJI-Y9-ht, N2 adsorption measurement at 77 K is performed. The saturated N2 uptake for FJI-Y9-ht is 361 cm3 g-1 () under 1 bar, corresponding to a BET surface area of 1117 m2 g-1, which is much lower than that (2061 m2 g-1) of FIR-29-ht under the same measurement conditions (Figure S3). The pore diameter distribution analysis by using density functional theory methods indicates a narrow pore size of 8.5 \u00c5, which is according to the value estimated from the single-crystal structure and is smaller than the aperture diameter existing in FIR-29-ht (Figure S5). On the basis of the above sorption data, a micropore volume of 0.54 cm3 g-1 in FJI-Y9-ht is close to 0.49 cm3 g-1 estimated from the single-crystal structure and further confirms the structural stability of the host framework after heat activation.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, by adjusting the arm length of two triphenylamine-based ligands (H3NTB and H3TCPA), we synthesized two nearly isostructural MOFs (FJI-Y9 and FIR-29) with honeycomb lattices of hexagonal channels.
