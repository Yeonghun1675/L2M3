The mean anion-centroid distance of a perchlorate anion to a phenyl ring (a constitutional isomer of the C6H6 [3]-radialene core) was reported to be 3.29 \u00c5 and of a hexafluorophosphate anion to a phenyl ring was 3.26 \u00c5. The authors also reported that the sum of the van der Waals radii of the interacting atoms also provided further insight into the significance of the anion-\u03c0 interactions in a particular structure. For carbon and oxygen, the sum of the van der Waals radii is 3.25 \u00c5, while for carbon and fluorine the sum of the van der Waals radii is 3.22 \u00c5. The anion-centroid distances reported here for 2 and 3 are slightly longer than those summarized for benzene rings by Gamez et al.; as described above, the fluoride to [3]-radialene centroid distance in 2 is 3.47 \u00c5, while the closest radialene centroid anion distance for 3 is 3.35 \u00c5.
