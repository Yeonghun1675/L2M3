Using a combination of single-crystal X-ray diffraction and atomic pair distribution function analysis, we determine the structures of their inorganic cores, revealing a series of pyramidal nanostuctures with cadmium terminated {111} facets. Theoretical and experimental studies on these materials will open the door to a deeper fundamental understanding of structure-property relationships in quantum-confined semiconductors.\n\nThe high reactivity of (TMS)2Se made it possible to monitor QD formation at low temperature by in situ UV-visible absorbance spectroscopy (Figure b-d). As an ethereal solution of n-butylamine (n-BuNH2), cadmium benzoate (Cd(O2CPh)2), and (TMS)2Se is warmed from -78 \u00b0C to -42 \u00b0C (Figure b), the precursors react, and the \u03c0 to \u03c0* transitions of the benzoate ligands become obscured by a much stronger absorbance from the cadmium selenide product (\u03bbmax = 263 nm). This species subsequently converts into a previously unobserved species, CdSe  (315 nm)  (\u03bbmax = 315 nm), at 0 \u00b0C. Further warming to room temperature transforms this QD into a larger one, CdSe  (350 nm) . Controlled conversion to larger sizes continues at higher reaction temperatures, ultimately producing QDs with dimensions of ~3 nm. The well-defined isosbestic points visible in the spectral data (Figure c,d) are characteristic of two families of molecules that quantitatively interconvert without the formation of strongly absorbing intermediates. Thus the component spectra are representative of single QDs. This behavior demonstrates the reaction's extraordinary selectivity for specific products that inhabit local thermodynamic minima and are therefore likely to have atomically precise structures.",
