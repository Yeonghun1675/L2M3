Zn2, Zn3, Zn6, and Zn7 are coordinated to three bridging carboxylates, one amino group, and two bridging \u03bc3-OH, respectively, forming distorted NO5 coordination octahedra. Zn4 and Zn5 are coordinated to four bridging carboxylates and one bridging \u03bc3-OH, respectively, forming distorted O5 trigonal bipyramid coordination geometries. Notably, there are two similar tetranuclear units [Zn4(\u03bc3-OH)2]6+ (one tetranuclear unit [Zn4(\u03bc3-OH)2]6+ including Zn1-Zn4, and the other including Zn5-Zn8) formed through two independent \u03bc3-OH bridging four independent ZnII ions in the asymmetric unit where the two tetranuclear units are further doubly bridged by two \u03bc-Ocarboxylate atoms from two different (L)3- ligands. All four edges of every [Zn4(\u03bc3-OH)2]6+ cluster are bridged by (L)3- ligands' carboxylates in the \u03bc-kO:kO' and \u03bc-O coordination modes. Compared with that four ZnII ions form a tetranuclear unit [Zn4(\u03bc3-OH)2]6+ in an inerratic parallelogram type in the same plane, the four ZnII ions in our tetranuclear units [Zn4(\u03bc3-OH)2]6+ slightly deviate from an ideal parallelogram, being reflected by the about 0.1 \u00c5 difference between two opposite sides. As shown in a, each tetranuclear unit is linked by six (L)3- ligands to produce an interesting 2D framework containing -(Zn-O) n - chain substructure formed by \u03bc-Ocarboxylate atoms of (L)3- ligands doubly bridging those tetranuclear [Zn4(\u03bc3-OH)2]6+ units (b).

The asymmetric structural unit of 3 contains two PbII, two (HL)2- ligands, one lattice methanol molecule, and two and a half lattice water molecules. As found in 2, each H3L ligand in 3 exists in the zwitterionic (HL)2- form, owing to the protonation of its amino group, and acts as a \u03ba4-linker to connect with three PbII ions. The three carboxylates of one independent (HL)2- ligand, namely, [(HL)including N1]2- ligand, one in a chelating coordination mode, and the other two in monodentate coordination modes, bind Pb1, Pb2, and Pb1C, respectively. The three carboxylates of the other independent (HL)2- ligand, namely, [(HL)including N2]2- ligand, adopting the same coordination modes as the former, bind Pb2, Pb1D, and Pb2B, respectively (a). Both Pb1 and Pb2 are ligated by one chelating and two monodentate carboxylates from three different (HL)2- ligands, respectively (b). As a result, they form hemidirected four-coordinate geometries with a stereochemically active lone pair, being similar to that of four-coordinate PbII in the literature. As shown in a, every (HL)2- ligand uses its chelating carboxylate and the monodentate carboxylate belonging to the amino acid group to bridge two independent PbII ions, and in this way, it forms right-handed 41 helixes along c axis with large pitches of 57.3888(7) \u00c5. Every helix further links with four adjacent homochiral helixes through the coordination of the other monodentate carboxylate of every (HL)2- ligand in the chain (Figure S9). Consequently, it creates a novel 3D porous helical HMOF whose chirality stems from the enantiopure H3L ligands and the derived right-handed helixes (b). In the construction of the present HMOF, both PbII centers and (HL)2- ligands act as 3-connected nodes. In view of the topology, however, symmetry-related [(HL)including N1]2- ligands and symmetry-related [(HL)including N2]2- ligands as well as symmetry-related Pb1 and symmetry-related Pb2 ions have the different correlation of network topology node. The minimum closed loops around the nodes involving in symmetry-related [(HL)including N1]2- ligands and symmetry-related Pb2 ions are (62\u22c512), whereas those around the nodes involved in symmetry-related [(HL)including N2]2- ligands and symmetry-related Pb1 ions are (6\u22c5122). Thus, the whole 3D framework can be described as an interesting 3-connected net with point symbol of (62\u22c512)(6\u22c5122) (). Notably, the 3D porous helical HMOFs have three types of channels: the huge rectangular channel with the opening size ca. 5.09 \u00c5 \u00d7 28.14 \u00c5 and the circular channel with the opening size ca. 8.42 \u00c5 along directions [1 0 0] and [0 1 0], and the square channel with the opening size ca. 5.56 \u00c5 \u00d7 5.56 \u00c5 along direction [0 0 1] (considering the atomic van der Waals radii, and see b and S10-13). However, two identical frameworks interpenetrate each other to stabilize the whole structure, which effectively reduces the volumes of the channels along directions [1 0 0] and [0 1 0] and almost blocks all the pores along direction [0 0 1] (Figure S14). The percent effective free volume is of 18.2% (a total potential solvent volume of 1109.6 \u00c53 out of every unit cell volume of 6104.5 \u00c53) calculated with PLATON. Additionally, the protonated amino group of every (HL)2- ligand in 3 forms two N\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen-bonds: one occurring between the two identical frameworks and originating from N-H to uncoordinated Ocarboxylate; the other originating from N-H to Oguest (guest = (H2O)3 cluster and methanol molecule), which binds a (H2O)3 cluster or a methanol molecule in the crystals (Table S2 and Figure S15).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 28, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig7\" position=\"float\">\n<label>7</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Different coordination\nmodes of zwitterionic (HL)<sup>2\u2013</sup> ligands in <bold>3</bold>, showing the permanent chiral carbon atoms C10 and C22 of <italic>S</italic>-configuration, and the protonated nitrogen atoms N1 and\nN2.
