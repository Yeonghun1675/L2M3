Placing ~10 mg samples of 4-7 into a Bunsen burner flame led to rapid burning with intense light and little smoke. Passing sparks from a Tesla coil through ~5 mg samples of 4-7 on an aluminum plate did not lead to explosions or burning. These experiments suggest that 4-7 are not primary energetic materials, although they contain considerable energy, as evidenced by rapid burning. The onset of thermal decomposition of 4-7 started between 210 and 220 \u00b0C, as determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere between 50 and 700 \u00b0C with a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C/min. The weight loss events for 4-7 appear to involve 18-crown-6 evolution and bis(tetrazolyl)borate ligand decomposition, as judged by residual weights upon reaching 450 \u00b0C.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 12, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>A major discovery herein is the isomeric B\u2212N bonds that form in <bold>6</bold> and <bold>7</bold>, compared to those found in <bold>4</bold> and <bold>5</bold> and in previous reports of complexes containing bis(5-H-tetrazolyl)borate ligands.
