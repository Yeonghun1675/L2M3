For SCAM-4, the HE emission (centered at 518 nm) component becomes more dominated at low temperature (lower than 263 K), while the LE band grows weaker with decreasing temperature and disappears at 83 K, which may be ascribed to the electronic interaction between superatom clusters with the rigid and conjugated \u03c0-systems of the linkers. As a result, thermochromism ranging more widely from green to red of SCAM-4 was observed. These findings imply the feasibility of facile modulation of the luminescent properties of the superatomic clusters and cluster-based assembled materials through the appropriate choice of ligand modules or linkers, which may lead to the evolution of novel cluster-based materials with unique properties and functions.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "SCAM-4", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "porosity": [{"probe": "", "value": "45.4", "unit": "%", "condition": "interpenetration with a pore size of ca. 1.12 nm"}, {"probe": "", "value": "0.1075", "unit": "cm3/g", "condition": "interpenetration with a pore size of ca. 1.12 nm"}], "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "220", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "high stability", "condition": ""}], "surface area": [{"type": "", "probe": "", "value": "69.3", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": "N2 adsorption measurement"}], "peak spectrum": [{"value": "595, 668", "unit": "nm", "type": "emission", "condition": "room temperature"}, {"value": "622", "unit": "nm", "type": "emission", "condition": "123 K"}, {"value": "510", "unit": "nm", "type": "emission", "condition": "below 113 K"}, {"value": "518", "unit": "nm", "type": "emission", "condition": "low temperature (lower than 263 K)"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["porosity", "decomposition_temperature", "surface_area", "peak_spectrum"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['porosity', 'decomposition_temperature', 'surface_area', 'peak_spectrum']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"SCAM-4\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"porosity\": [\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"45.4\",\n                \"unit\": \"%\",\n                \"condition\": \"interpenetration with a pore size of ca. 1.12 nm\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"0.1075\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"interpenetration with a pore size of ca. 1.12 nm\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"decomposition temperature\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"220\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"high stability\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"surface area\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"\",\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"69.3\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"N2 adsorption measurement\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"peak spectrum\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"595, 668\",\n                \"unit\": \"nm\",\n                \"type\": \"emission\",\n                \"condition\": \"room temperature\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"622\",\n                \"unit\": \"nm\",\n                \"type\": \"emission\",\n                \"condition\": \"123 K\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"510\",\n                \"unit\": \"nm\",\n                \"type\": \"emission\",\n                \"condition\": \"below 113 K\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"518\",\n                \"unit\": \"nm\",\n                \"type\": \"emission\",\n                \"condition\": \"low temperature (lower than 263 K)\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 7, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Synthesis of desired Ag<sub>14</sub>\n<bold>NC</bold>s; note\nthat the (fcc) array (represented by green spheres) of Ag<sub>14</sub> superatoms are stabilized by face-capping 1,2-dithiolate-<italic>o</italic>-carborane (C<sub>2</sub>B<sub>10</sub>H<sub>10</sub>S<sub>2</sub>) ligands.
