The radical band (14000-18000 cm-1) corresponding to minute amounts of DCNQI\u22c5- present inside the framework increased in intensity, indicating oxidation of DCNQI2-. Additional evidence for the generation of DCNQI radical form can be obtained from an increase in absorption above 24000 cm-1, which was most clearly visible in the difference spectrum. This absorption feature was attributed to the lowering of the \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* transition energy upon formation of the radical species. It is important to note that, unlike the pyridine analogue, [Cd(DCNQI)(isoquin)2] did not exhibit any NIR absorption bands during oxidation. This finding can be explained by the lack of DCNQI\u22c5- radical required to facilitate interligand charge transfer, which can be inferred from the relatively small spectral change observed in the isoquinoline analogue. A similar conclusion can be drawn from the images of [Cd(DCNQI)(isoquin)2] at different potentials (see Figure S13(c)). Application of an anodic potential resulted in minor color changes that were not consistent with the formation of the dark blue coloration characteristic of DCNQI\u22c5-, suggesting that the framework underwent only a partial conversion. The incomplete spectral response can be rationalized by assessing the framework crystal structure, which consists of 2D layers largely held together by edge-to-face interactions between the axial ligands. Since isoquinoline is significantly larger than pyridine, the van der Waals interaction between isoquinoline ligands should be stronger and, thus, separation of the sheets, which is required for intercalation of the counterion upon oxidation, is less likely to occur for [Cd(DCNQI)(isoquin)2]. As a result, DCNQI2- moieties were less accessible for oxidation. A further increase in the applied potential did not result in any additional spectral transformations. Despite the absence of pronounced spectral and color changes, the redox process observed in the cyclic voltammogram of [Cd(DCNQI)(isoquin)2] can be assigned to the one-electron oxidation of DCNQI2- inside the framework, in a similar manner to the pyridine analogue. The reversibility of the redox transformation was confirmed by applying a cathodic potential (-0.1 V) which resulted in the regeneration of the starting spectrum (Figure S13(b)).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 33, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Conclusions</title><p>The new [Cd\u00ad(DCNQI)\u00ad(L)<sub>2</sub>] (L = py and isoquin) frameworks\nexhibit redox-state dependent spectral properties, including an interligand\ncharge-transfer process in the pyridine analogue that has been supported\nusing TD-DFT computational calculations.
