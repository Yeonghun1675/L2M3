Our hypothesis is that the loss of water imposes a first transient step in response to the change in the coordination number from five to four, in which the new geometry around the Cu centers imposes first only a flattening of the basal plane, still reminiscent of the hydrated network, with a consequent increase of the bond lengths in a copper environment (Figure S11b, left).

The strong CO2-1 interaction was confirmed by the anomalous trend in the diffusion coefficient for CO2 as a function of the feed pressure monitored in the range 0.1-1.5 bar for the Pebax1657/22 vol % MOF 1 MMMs (Figure S23). The anomaly originates from the high affinity of CO2 for 1, which affects negatively the diffusion coefficient at low feed pressure, boosting at the same time the solubility. The sorption isotherms of the six gases, determined from the indirectly calculated solubility (C = S \u00d7 p feed), show a clear dual mode sorption behavior for CO2 and a greater affinity of CO2 with MMMs with respect to the other gases (Figure S24). The characteristic gas interaction properties of 1 were further confirmed under mixed gas conditions. The membrane Pebax1657/1 with 22 vol % of MOF 1 was tested using two binary mixtures CO2/CH4 (35/65 v/v) and CO2/N2 (85/15 v/v). a shows the typical sigmoidal curve of CO2 permeate flow rate during single and mixed gas permeation, in the presence of N2 and CH4 for CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 binary mixtures, respectively. The permeation of CO2 slows down markedly by the presence of methane and nitrogen. This behavior was not observed for the neat Pebax membrane (b), confirming the strong CO2-1 interaction. For a more accurate analysis of the transient behavior, the permeate flow rate curves of the two binary mixtures were fitted with eq S1 (Figure S25) describing Fickian diffusion in nonporous polymers.
