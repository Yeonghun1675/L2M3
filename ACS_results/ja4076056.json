For 1-dry, the isotherm shows a steep rise because of \"the first gate-opening\" at low pressures to give a plateau below 52 kPa with an absorbed amount reaching 86 mL (stp) g-1 (4.3 molecules per [Ru2] unit), as is similarly observed in the O2 and CO2 isotherms, and then, a second abrupt increase begins at 52 kPa, which is \"the second gate-opening\", to reach an absorbed amount of 167 mL (stp) g-1 (8.4 molecules per [Ru2] unit) at 95 kPa. The adsorption isotherm for 2-dry also shows stepwise behavior; the plateau region is observed below 21 kPa with an absorbed amount of 89 mL (stp) g-1 (4.1 molecules per [Ru2] unit) followed by the second gate-opening to reach an absorbed amount of 137 mL (stp) g-1 (6.3 molecules per [Ru2] unit) at 96 kPa. A remarkable difference between 1-dry and 2-dry is the absorbed amount of NO after the second gate-opening; 1-dry absorbs ca. two more NO molecules than 2-dry, although almost the same amount of NO is absorbed in the first step. 2-dry experiences the second gate-opening at a lower gate-opening pressure than 1-dry, which should be attributed to the fact that 2-dry has a looser packing than 1-dry. In addition to the specific behavior of the NO adsorption isotherm, the desorption isotherm of NO reveals a distinct difference from inert gases: a hysteretic feature is observed (Figure ). The NO desorption isotherm of 2-dry almost superimposes on the adsorption isotherm below 10 kPa (Figure c,d), whereas the desorption isotherm in 1-dry never merges into the adsorption isotherm (Figure a,b), resulting in a wider hysteresis in 1-dry than in 2-dry. The desorption of NO takes place in a stepwise fashion: for 1-dry, four molecules of NO are gradually released at external pressures down to 1 kPa, leading to a large hysteresis, and 1-2 NO molecules are then released steeply at ca. 1 kPa. Other NO molecules absorbed, 2-3 molecules, are finally trapped at 121 K (Figure b) and are released by heating to room temperature (vide infra). Thus, the NO molecule is more strongly trapped in the pores of 1-dry, even in 2-dry, and this behavior should be distinguished from the simple physisorption observed for O2 and CO2 (note that the adsorption/desorption profiles for O2 and CO2 also have small hysteresis features at the first gate-opening process, which are associated with the first-order structural phase transition, but the income/outgo of gases is identical in each gas).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 18, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Crystal Structure of <bold>1-dry</bold> under Gas Pressure</title><p>To confirm the gas-inserted\nstructure, the XRPD for <bold>1-dry</bold> was measured with controlled\nCO<sub>2</sub> and NO pressures at\n195 and 121 K, respectively: the target is <bold>1-dry</bold>\u2283<bold>G</bold> with G = CO<sub>2</sub> and NO (Figure ).

Figure  shows the adsorption isotherms of 1-dry and 2-dry. 1-dry reveals nonporous behavior for N2 at 77 K, which should be due to the slow diffusion of gaseous molecules into its micropores at such a low temperature as 77 K, as also seen in a similar [Ru2 II,II] chain compound. 2-dry shows a moderate adsorption of N2 at 77 K with an adsorbed amount of 54 mL (stp) g-1 corresponding to 2.5 molecules per [Rh2] unit at 90 kPa. This contrasting behavior of 2-dry compared with 1-dry indicates that the chains of 2-dry are more loosely packed than those of 1-dry, as shown from the difference in their pore volume. For both compounds, the adsorption isotherms of O2 at 90 K and CO2 at 195 K show a steep rise at relatively low pressures, indicating a typical physisorption behavior (type I in the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) classification).
