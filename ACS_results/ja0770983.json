Doped [Pb3(C6S6)] n  was synthesized by performing the synthesis with a mixture of ~99:1 Pb(OAc)2 and Tl(OAc), and the doped material had a conductivity of 1 \u00d7 10-4 \u03a9-1 cm-1. Attempts to synthesize doped versions of [Pb2(S2C6H2S2)(en)] n  and [Pb3(SC6H4S)3(en)2] n  gave products with electrical conductivities of less than 10-12 \u03a9-1 cm-1. However, preliminary experiments show that a selenium analogue, [Pb3(SeC6H4Se)3(en)2] n , was dopable by both Tl and Bi and yielded materials with the low but measurable conductivity of 4 \u00d7 10-11 \u03a9-1 cm-1. Experiments are underway to examine the electrical transport properties of these semiconducting materials more thoroughly and to synthesize new materials of this type.
