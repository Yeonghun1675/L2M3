Both compounds show selective CO2 adsorption () over other gases. This moderately high selective CO2 adsorption is quite logical due to the presence of highly polar -NO2 groups with the polarization of significantly negative charge density on O atoms which may interact with the Lewis acidic C center of CO2 molecules on the basis of the dipole-quadruple interaction. In addition, the N-based Lewis basic functional polar surfaces (-N\ue5fbN- and - CH\ue5fbN\ue5f8N\ue5fbCH-) in the framework may also act additively for the high CO2 selectivity. The space filling models of the dehydrated framework of 1 show a unidirectional channel along the b-axis (Figure S10) which attributes its lack of porosity toward N2 to the blocking of the 1D channel through diffusion of N2 molecules. It also shows a very low uptake at the surface for H2 at 77 K and CH4 at 298 K. It is evident in  that 1 exhibits type I profile in CO2 adsorption at 195 K with a high uptake of CO2. Interestingly, it shows a remarkable step rise up to ~134 cc/g in a very low pressure region (from 0.001 to 0.16 bar); after that, very slow uptake of CO2 was observed with the increase of pressure, which finally reaches ~185 cc/g at 1 bar. It also shows reversible CO2 desorption along with an adsorption isotherm with a small hysteresis which probably  originates from the adsorbent and adsorbate interaction. At the beginning, the isosteric heat of adsorption (Q st) of 1 is ~44 kJ/mol obtained from adsorption data of CO2 (Figures S12 and S13) at two different temperatures (i.e., 273 and 298 K) using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation which is (d lnp/dT) = Q st/RT 2. After that, the isosteric heat of adsorption of 1 decreases with the uploading of adsorbate signifying the filling of their maximum affinity sites. The high Q st value of CO2 adsorption for 1 indicates strong interaction between NO2\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5CO2; N\ue5fbN\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5CO2; aromatic \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5CO2; and cooperative CO2\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5CO2 interactions operating together or in an individual manner. The dehydrated framework of 1 shows appreciable uptake of CO2 at room temperature/273 K, which are 34 cc/g and 44 cc/g, respectively (Figure S12). Similar to 1, the dehydrated framework of 2 also shows no porosity toward N2 molecules with a similar reason for the presence of unidirectional channels along the b-axis (Figure S11) and the H2 uptake and CH4 adsorption are also negligible as that of 1. However, the CO2 adsorption isotherm shows interesting type V profile with good selectivity () over all the other gases mentioned earlier. In the CO2 adsorption profile of 2, it is observed that up to P = 0.55 bar, almost no adsorption has occurred, but after this pressure, there is a sharp uptake of CO2 observed which reaches 103 cc/g at P = 0.85 bar and then gradually attains the final value of 126 cc/g at P = 0.99 bar. After that, the reversible desorption profile with a large hysteresis is regenerated with an incomplete desorption which may be due to strong adsorbate-adsorbent interaction in 2. The gate-opening behaviorof 2 at P = 0.55 bar may be attributed to the expansion of the framework owing to the flexible nature of the pore which is constructed by a flexible ligand, 4-bpdb. The dehydrated 2 also shows nice CO2 uptake at room temperature and 273 K up to 10 cc/g and 15 cc/g, respectively (Figure S14). At the onset, the isosteric heat of adsorption (Q st) of 2 has been calculated like 1, taking two different CO2 adsorption measurements at 273 and 298 K (Figures S14 and S15) and found similarly with a high value (~43 kJ/mol) as that of 1 due to similar reasons discussed above.

Compound 1 shows a weight loss of ~3.55% around 75 \u00b0C corresponding to the loss of one lattice water molecule (calc. wt % 3.79; Figure S4); and the dehydrated framework is stable up to ~285 \u00b0C without any further weight loss, but dehydrated 1a exhibits no weight loss up to 270 \u00b0C (Figure S4) indicating the absence of the guest water molecule which is lost during the dehydration process; after that, the dehydrated framework collapses into unidentified products by further heating. The PXRD pattern of dehydrated framework 1a, which is obtained by heating 1 at 150 \u00b0C under reduced pressure (Figure S6), shows an almost identical peak position to the as synthesized 1 which indicates the rigidity of the framework after the removal of the water molecule. The PXRD pattern of the rehydrated framework 1b (Figure S6) also exhibits the identical peak positions to the as-synthesized 1 after exposing the dehydrated 1a in water vapor for 7 days, indicating the reversible robustness of the framework of 1. The retention of the single crystallinity of 1 at high temperature encouraged us to do the corresponding crystal structure after removing the guest volatile from the parent framework through evacuation at 150 \u00b0C. Herein the single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SC-SC) reversibility study of 1 (deep green) has been performed which represents the dehydrated 1a (dark green) and rehydrated 1b structures with almost analogous cell parameters (Tables S3 and S4, ) showing the complete reversibility of the framework. It is not necessary to mention that the types of crystal systems and space groups in all three structures (1, 1a, and 1b) are equivalent, whereas the bond lengths and angles are almost equal with minor differences (Tables S2-S4). In TGA, compound 2 shows a weight loss of ~7.13% at ~85 \u00b0C corroborating the loss of two lattice water molecules (calc. wt % 6.95; Figure S5) and the dehydrated framework which is further stable up to ~235 \u00b0C. The PXRD patterns (Figure S7) of dehydrated 2 (activated at 130 \u00b0C) are identical with those of the as-synthesized 2, indicating the rigidity of the framework after the removal of guest volatiles; however, unlike 1 the single crystallinity of 2 does not exist at high temperature.\n\nWe have also measured the solvent sorption isotherms of two polar solvents, H2O and EtOH, at 298 K for both compounds, to observe the solvent-framework interaction. The dehydrated framework of 1 shows a lower uptake up to P/P 0 ~ 0.35, and after that an almost steep uptake up to a volume of ~126 cc/g at P/P 0 ~ 0.95 (Figure S20). The said volume indicates the uptake of 2.5 water molecules per formula unit, which is much greater than the calculated value (1.0 water per formula unit), observed possibly due to the expansion of the layered structure which occurs in the higher pressure region. The EtOH vapor sorption of 1 gives a simple type I adsorption profile with saturation value of ~107 cc/g at P/P 0 ~ 0.9 (Figure S20). On the other hand, for dehydrated 2, the H2O and EtOH vapor sorption isotherms at 298 K (Figure S21) show nearly the same pattern and comparatively greater hysteresis as that of 1 with final uptake of EtOH vapor of 44 cc/g at P/P 0 ~ 0.89 and water vapor 75 cc/g at P/P 0 ~ 0.9 corresponding to 1.6 water molecules per formula unit, which closely supports the value obtained in TGA study of 2. In both H2O and EtOH adsorption-desorption curves of 1 and 2, hysteresis is observed which is due to the strong adsorbent-adsorbate interaction.
