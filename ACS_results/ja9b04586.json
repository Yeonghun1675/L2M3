This result suggests that irrespective of the thermal energy provided to the system, MONT growth is driven by thermodynamics rather than kinetic effects. In addition, precursor ions or amorphous clusters do not react instantly, but instead seek the lowest energy face of the growing crystal, and induce anisotropic growth. Therefore, size distributions are not affected by the overall availability of the reactant monomers, but by localized effects within the confined LCTEM environment such as rate of nucleation, number of nucleation sites, depletion of precursor ions/amorphous clusters, surface nucleation on the SiN x  membrane that controls the surface-specific monomer-monomer attachment locally and hence the sizes of MONT bundles.
