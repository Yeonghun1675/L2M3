This self-catenated 6-connected net possesses an unprecedented 446982 topology. This network is further linked by the chain-4 motifs that cut through all three helical motifs via Co2 atoms on the periphery of the {Co3O2} trimeric subunits. If only helix-2, helix-3, and chain-4 are treated as connecting linkers with Co1 atoms as connecting nodes, a 6-connected three-dimensional self-catenated network with a remarkably regular 615 topology can be invoked. Topological analysis of the full covalent net of 1, including all four submotifs and treating only Co1 atoms as connecting nodes, reveals the presence of a previously unknown self-catenated 8-connected uninodal lattice with 4451767 topology, shown in Figure . Bent ligands are crucial for the generation of this framework in order to avoid edge crossings.
