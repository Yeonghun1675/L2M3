Although Cp'' ligands were shown to take a slightly smaller cone angle than Cp* (116.2 vs 122.4\u00b0 for (\u03b77-C7H7)ZrCp x  complexes), the two Cp'' ligands in SmCp\"2 leave space for only one additional ethereal ligand L (L = THF or Et2O) as compared with two of such ligands in [SmCp*2L2] because the  t Bu groups protrude further away from the Cp planes and occupy a larger part of the sphere around the Sm atom. Owing to such shielding, the [SmCp\"2L] complexes should be less reactive in the reduction processes as compared with their Cp* analogs. Indeed, the reaction of [SmCp\"2(THF)] (4) with P2Ph4 proceeds noticeably more slowly than that of [SmCp*2(THF)2] (1) with the same diphosphine. When carried out in hexane or toluene, the reaction is not finished after several hours at room temperature, and even after heating to 60 \u00b0C for 30 min, the solution contains unreacted samarocene.

When the reaction is carried out in hexane, the starting compounds completely disappear only after several repeated evaporation and addition of new portions of the solvent.

Calcd: C, 62.90; H, 6.95%.\n\nReaction of Desolvated [SmCp\"2] with P2Ph4 \n\nTo a mixture of [SmCp\"2] (0.152 g, 0.300 mmol) and P2Ph4 (0.0560 g, 0.151 mmol) was condensed 10 mL of hexane. The solution turned brown after mixing at ambient temperature for 1 h; it was further stirred at 60 \u00b0C for 2 days to ensure completeness of the reaction. The brown solution was evaporated to dryness. The oily crystalline mixture was redissolved in pentane, and the solution was filtered and slowly evaporated in a closed ampule to yield a mixture of crystals of compounds 5, 6, and 7. The crystalline mixture was washed with 2 mL of cold pentane to remove oily impurities; the crystals were dried in vacuum. Complex 5 was manually separated as green-brown large crystalline aggregates, contaminated with minor amounts of 6. Visually homogeneous and free of impurities crystals were used for characterization. Compound 5: yield 0.114 g, 55%. 1H NMR: 17.3 (br s, \u0394\u03bd1/2 = 500 Hz, 2H, 2C-H), 14.27 (br s, \u0394\u03bd1/2 = 46 Hz, 4H, 4C-H and 5C-H), 9.16 (d, J = 7 Hz, 4H, o-Ph), 7.69 (t, J = 7 Hz, 2H, p-Ph), 7.43 (t, J = 7 Hz, 4H, m-Ph), 2.34 (br s, \u0394\u03bd1/2 = 182 Hz, 36H,  t Bu).

Anal. for C38H52PSm, found: C, 66.5; H, 7.8%. Calcd: C, 66.13; H, 7.59%. Yellow crystals of 6 were manually separated and used for X-ray diffraction and IR; their IR spectrum is identical with that of separately synthesized [SmCp\"3]. Compounds 5 and 6 remain unchanged after dissolution of the mixture in THF and successive evaporation of the solvent.\n\nSynthesis of [SmCp\"3] (6)\n\nA mixture of SmI3 (0.110 g, 0.207 mmol) and KCp'' (0.141 g, 0.652 mmol) in 10 mL of diethyl ether was heated in a sealed evacuated vessel for 14 days at 80 \u00b0C. The solution was cooled, filtered, and evaporated to dryness. The crystalline solid was extracted with 10 mL of pentane; the orange solution was filtered from unreacted KCp''. Slow evaporation of the filtrate yielded 6 in the form of orange elongated rectangular crystals, which were washed with 2 mL of pentane, dried in vacuum, and separated from the minor amounts of KCp'' which sticks to the walls as small colorless crystals. Yield 0.060 g (42%). 1H NMR: \u03b4 21.14 (br s, \u0394\u03bd1/2 = 15 Hz, 3H, 2-C-H), 18.64 (br s, \u0394\u03bd1/2 = 21 Hz, 6H, 4C-H and 5C-H), -1.57 (s, 54H,  t Bu).
