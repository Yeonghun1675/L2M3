Here, LITH appears as a result of a dynamical competition between the light excitation, which favors the metastable photoinduced state (the HS-HS state for the green light and the LS-LS state for the red light), and the temperature, which accelerates the sigmoidal relaxation of this photoinduced state, thus stabilizing the HS-LS state for both wavelengths. The competition between these two processes (where the temporal evolution of the HS fraction follows a nonlinear trend) results in a photoinduced thermal instability, which is accompanied by hysteretic behavior. Therefore, the LITH loop reveals the existence of a nonequilibrium transition involving photoinduced and thermally induced states. Because of their dynamical character, usually the LITH loops are very sensitive to the temperature scan rate, leading to wide LITH loops. To access the photostationary (or quasi-static) LITH, given by black curves, we recorded isothermal temporal evolution of the HS fraction under light. The time dependences of the magnetic signals corresponding to these processes are depicted by the vertical lines in a (b), showing that the most significant changes are obtained around 45 and 55 K (50 and 80 K) for the direct (reverse) LITH, i.e., outside the temperature interval quasi-static LITH loop. In contrast, when photoexcitation is performed in the region of the quasi-static LITH curve, the process stops at the quasi-static branch (black curve) of direct- and reverse-LITH loops, whose widths are estimated to be 4 and 25 K, respectively. It is worth noticing that the quasi-static reverse-LITH curve (black curve in b) also matches very well that of the dark (Figure S10).

Its structure consists of [FePt(CN)4] layers separated by interdigited trz-py ligands with two inequivalent FeII sites. The 2D network can be described as a succession of Fe4 pseudosquares, the diagonals of which are formed by Fe1-Pt-Fe2 bridges. Interlayer contacts are assisted by \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between the trz-py ligands and a strong hydrogen-bonding network that involves three noncoordinated water molecules. 1 exhibits an incomplete sharp SCO first-order phase transition centered at 153 K from a HS-HS to a HS-LS structurally ordered state. Irradiation at 10 K with green light induces a photoswitching to the HS-HS state, characterized by a T(LIESST) value of 52 K. Photomagnetic measurements show that the HS-HS state is metastable and relaxes back to the intermediate HS-LS plateau with self-accelerated relaxations, typical for a highly cooperative SCO system. On the contrary, irradiation of the HS-LS state with near-IR light is efficient only below the T(LIESST) value of the direct LIESST process and leads to the emergence of a hidden stable LS-LS state with a markedly different T(reverse-LIESST) value of 85 K. Contrary to the relaxation behavior of the HS-HS state, relaxations from the LS-LS state do not reach the HS-LS plateau, which shows that the LS-LS state is a stable one and, correlatively, the HS-LS state is metastable. The LITH curve associated with the reverse-LIESST process consists of a wide thermal hysteresis whose quasi-static hysteresis loop ranges between 55 and 85 K. Altogether, these results prove the presence of a hidden hysteresis in the HS-LS plateau, which was not accessible due to the slowing down of the relaxation processes upon cooling, with the Fe2 site being trapped in the HS state. Irradiation with near-IR light induces its switching to the LS state. The photocrystallographic investigations for the three 10 K states indicate that the structural topology is retained and no space group change occurs along the bidirectional switching. The very strong metastability of the intermediate HS-LS state originates from antiferroelastic interactions (frustration) within the [FePt(CN)4] layers, accommodated by NC-Pt-CN bridges between inequivalent SCO active FeII sites. This elastic distortion manifests itself in corrugation of the 2D layers and deformation of the square Fe-Pt-Fe-Pt structural topology.
