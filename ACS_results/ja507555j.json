The presence of the highly symmetric BF4 -, PF6 - anions acted as a link between the cyclic supramolecules, forming a robust structure exhibiting permanent porosity (see Figure b). Hence, with LSPh, the determinant for the 3D arrangement was the anion, but the hexameric building block was an invariant feature. In the present case, the modification of the peripheral phenyl ring with the introduction of various substituents implies that with the less symmetric CF3SO3 - anion, the hexameric units are no longer observed; instead, coordination polymeric chains are preferentially formed. However, the presence of the PF6 - anion is associated with the generation of four hexameric systems out of five complexes, and this may be because of the high symmetry of the anion that can be accommodated in the highly symmetric cubic structure. In fact, the octahedral symmetry of PF6 - makes it a good candidate to occupy highly symmetric positions within the cubic lattice.
