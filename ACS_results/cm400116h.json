To study the framework stability of 1, TGA and PXRD patterns at different states were performed. TGA suggests that four KI bound H2O molecules are released in the temperature range of 45-120 \u00b0C and the dehydrated solid (1') is stable up to 380 \u00b0C without further weight loss ( of the ). The weight loss (obs. 15.01 wt %) is consistent with the four H2O molecules (calc. 14.16 wt %). The PXRD pattern of 1' shows sharp lines with shifting of some peak positions, and appearance of some new peaks compared to the as-synthesized compound 1, suggesting structural transformation to lower symmetry after removal of KI bound H2O molecules. Indexing of the powder pattern of 1' by using the TREOR program suggests triclinic crystal system with a = 9.079(9) \u00c5\u0301, b = 12.201(2) \u00c5\u0301, c = 13.990(7) \u00c5\u0301, \u03b1 = 60.473(3)\u00b0, \u03b2 = 84.824(2)\u00b0, \u03b3 = 68.854(8)\u00b0, and V = 1250 \u00c5\u03013, which indicates the structural transformation in 1 after removal of the H2O molecules (see  of the ).

The dehydrated compound 1' uptakes H2O (kinetic diameter 2.8 \u00c5), MeCN (4.3 \u00c5), and MeOH (4.0 \u00c5) in two steps, but the occlusion of EtOH (4.5 \u00c5) occurs in one step. The H2O vapor sorption profile exhibits stepwise adsorption with rapid uptake at low pressure region and incomplete desorption suggesting strong interaction with the pore surface and it has been correlated to the presence of unsaturated KI site. The calculation using a saturation sorption amount suggests that 1' uptakes 3.74 molecules of H2O (220 mL g-1), 0.58 molecule of MeOH (35 mL g-1), 0.74 molecule of MeCN (44 mL g-1), and 0.37 molecule of EtOH (22 mLg-1) per formula unit. The sorption amount of the different solvent vapors depends not only on their size but also on their polarity and interaction with the framework structure having unsaturated KI sites.

The plots of temperature dependence of molar magnetic susceptibility \u03c7M and \u03c7M T of 1 show a very clear signature of weak ferromagnetic interaction between the DyIII centers (Figure a). At room temperature \u03c7M T value is 14.25 emu K mol-1, close to the value (14.17 emu K mol-1) expected for a magnetically isolated DyIII center (g = 4/3, J = 15/2). The \u03c7M T value gradually increases upon decreasing the temperature and reaches a maximum value of 16.68 emu K mol-1 at 50 K and then the \u03c7M T value remains constant up to 32 K. Upon further cooling \u03c7M T rapidly decreases to 14.95 emu mol-1 K at 3 K due to the depopulation of the excited state Stark levels. The increase of \u03c7M T up to 50 K from 300 K suggests the presence of the ferromagnetic interaction in the system. The linear fitting of \u03c7M -1 vs T of 1 at 290-40 K deduce the Weiss constant (\u03b8) = 11.3 K, which supports the presence of ferromagnetic interaction operating between the DyIII centers at a distance of 6.17 \u00c5 connected by the ox2- linker ( of the ). The ox2- is a small linker simultaneously can offer both \u03c3 and \u03c0 electronic pathways for magnetic superexchange between the DyIII centers.

Compound 2 exhibits a parallel response with respect to temperature up to 90 K and \u03c7M -1 vs T profile deduced a very small negative \u03b8 value (-2.1 K) compared to 1 suggesting ferromagnetic
