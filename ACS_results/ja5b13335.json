Then, the isosteric heat of adsorption (Q st) for CO2 capture was calculated based on the adsorption isotherms at 273 and 298 K (b and S6) through the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. It was found that the Q st value of 1 for CO2 sorption is ~32.2 kJ mol-1 at low loading range, followed by the convergence into a pseudoplateau at Q st of ~25.8 kJ mol-1 with relatively high uptake. The Q st is also comparable to some reported nitrogen-rich MOFs such as NTU-105 (~35 kJ mol-1 at low loading range and ~24 kJ mol-1 at relatively high uptake), confirming that the constructed MOF 1 has a high affinity to CO2.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "1", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "[Cu4(L1)] n"}, "porosity": [{"probe": "PLATON/VOID program", "value": "63.3", "unit": "%", "condition": "After removing the discrete and coordinated solvent molecules in the framework"}, {"probe": "", "value": "7.9", "unit": "\u00c5", "condition": "Two kinds of pores in diameters"}, {"probe": "", "value": "12.6", "unit": "\u00c5", "condition": "Two kinds of pores in diameters"}], "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "2436", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": "N2 sorption at 77 K"}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "655", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "1 atm", "condition": "N2 sorption isotherm"}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "160.8", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "temperature": "273 K", "pressure": "1 atm", "condition": "CO2 sorption capability"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["porosity", "surface_area", "gas_adsorption"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['porosity', 'surface_area', 'gas_adsorption']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"1\",\n            \"symbol\": \"1\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"[Cu4(L1)] n\"\n        },\n        \"porosity\": [\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"PLATON/VOID program\",\n                \"value\": \"63.3\",\n                \"unit\": \"%\",\n                \"condition\": \"After removing the discrete and coordinated solvent molecules in the framework\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"7.9\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00c5\",\n                \"condition\": \"Two kinds of pores in diameters\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"12.6\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00c5\",\n                \"condition\": \"Two kinds of pores in diameters\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"surface area\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"BET\",\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"2436\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"N2 sorption at 77 K\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"N2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"655\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"77 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"1 atm\",\n                \"condition\": \"N2 sorption isotherm\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"CO2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"160.8\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"273 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"1 atm\",\n                \"condition\": \"CO2 sorption capability\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 3, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a)\nPerspective view of 3D porous framework of <bold>1</bold> showing\nthe incorporation of unsaturated Cu<sub>2</sub> sites and accessible\nnitrogen-rich triazole groups with two kinds of pores (yellow and\nblue balls).
