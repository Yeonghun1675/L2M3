So we first investigate the hydrogen adsorption based on desolvated FJI-H16, 17, 18. The H2 adsorption isotherms are carried out at 77 K, as shown as a-c, desolvated FJI-H16, 17, 18 exhibit the classical reversible type-I isotherms for H2, and their total amount is 149.7 cm3 g-1 (1.34 wt %, 6.68 mmolg-1), 139.0 cm3 g-1 (1.24 wt %, 6.20 mmol g-1), and 77.7 cm3 g-1 (0.69 wt %, 3.45 mmol g-1) respectively. FJI-H16 and FJI-H17showed a significantly larger H2 adsorption capacity than FJI-H 18, and FJI-H16 is a little larger than FJI-H17. In addition, the H2 adsorption value for FJI-H16 is also higher many famous reported MOFs which have similar (BET) specific surface area as FJI-H16. The higher H2 adsorption for FJI-H16 may result from following two factors: (1) after activation, a large number of open metal sites of FJI-H16 will promote H2 adsorption; (2) stronger \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions comprised in FJI-H16 may improve the interaction between H2 molecules and MOF framework (), The significantly lower H2 uptake for FJI-H18 may be also due to its possible framework contraction after activation.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']"}}, {"idx": 24, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig5\" position=\"float\">\n<label>5</label>\n<caption>\n<p>H<sub>2</sub> adsorption isotherms at 77 K.

MOFs which possess ordered pore structures and high surface areas are considered to be effective candidates for storage of H2. So we first investigate the hydrogen adsorption based on desolvated FJI-H16, 17, 18. The H2 adsorption isotherms are carried out at 77 K, as shown as a-c, desolvated FJI-H16, 17, 18 exhibit the classical reversible type-I isotherms for H2, and their total amount is 149.7 cm3 g-1 (1.34 wt %, 6.68 mmolg-1), 139.0 cm3 g-1 (1.24 wt %, 6.20 mmol g-1), and 77.7 cm3 g-1 (0.69 wt %, 3.45 mmol g-1) respectively. FJI-H16 and FJI-H17showed a significantly larger H2 adsorption capacity than FJI-H 18, and FJI-H16 is a little larger than FJI-H17. In addition, the H2 adsorption value for FJI-H16 is also higher many famous reported MOFs which have similar (BET) specific surface area as FJI-H16. The higher H2 adsorption for FJI-H16 may result from following two factors: (1) after activation, a large number of open metal sites of FJI-H16 will promote H2 adsorption; (2) stronger \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions comprised in FJI-H16 may improve the interaction between H2 molecules and MOF framework (), The significantly lower H2 uptake for FJI-H18 may be also due to its possible framework contraction after activation.\n\nConsidering the rapid increase of CO2 emission, there is a constant need for materials which can effectively eliminate CO2, and MOF materials have been proved as cost-effective and efficient porous material for CO2 capture. So the measurements on CO2 adsorption and selectivity against N2 based on desolvated FJI-H16, 17, and 18 also have been carried out. The CO2 and N2 adsorption isotherms are carried out at 273 K. As shown as a-c, desolvated FJI-H16, 17, 18 exhibit the classical reversible type-I isotherms for CO2 and N2, and their total amount of CO2 uptake is 78.5 cm3 g-1 (3.50 mmol g-1, 154.2 mg g-1), 92.0 cm3 g-1 (4.10 mmol g-1, 180.4 mg g-1), and 53.4 cm3 g-1 (2.37 mmol g-1, 104.28 mg g-1) respectively at 273 K and 1 atm. By the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST), the CO2/N2 selectivity of FJI-H16, 17, 18 for the 15/85 CO2/N2 mixture at 1 atm and 273 K is calculated to be 80, 79, and 60 respectively (d). The FJI-H17 shows a larger CO2 adsorption capacity than FJI-H16 and FJI-H18 due to its much porous, which can be comparable with many famous metal-organic porous compounds. All of three compounds display high CO2/N2 selectivity due to their ultra-microporous structures, in which the pore size distribution of FJI-H16, 17, and 18 are mainly focus on 5.9, 7.3, 6.8 \u00c5 respectively.
