With\nthe aim of getting deeper insights, TD-DFT calculations were carried\nout on suitable models of ligand molecules in order to reproduce the\nexperimental main bands, which showed a good concordance and allowed\ninterpretation of the emission mechanism of the compounds (). As a result, it\nmay be stated that these emissions are ascribed to \u03c0 \u2190\n\u03c0* transitions originated at the aromatic rings of the ligands\ngiven the similar shape and small blue shifts of the bands corresponding\nto all compounds <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>4</bold> with respect\nto those of corresponding free molecules (of ca. 10 nm for bdc, btc,\nand pbptz ligands in compounds <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>3</bold>).

These two bands are undoubtedly\nattributed to the blue-shifted ligand-centered charge transfer (LCCT)\nemissions arising from pbptz and dhbdc ligands. Overall, the small\nhypsochromic shifts observed for all compounds correspond to the coordination\nof the ligands to zinc or cadmium atoms into their crystal structures.\nThis also brings a notorious emission enhancement given that most\nof vibrational modes of the ligands, which usually represent the main\nnonradiative deactivation in metal\u2013organic compounds, are substantially\nquenched <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.cgd.7b00522/suppl_file/cg7b00522_si_001.pdf\">Figure S19</ext-link>.

As stated elsewhere, all employed carboxylato based bdc, btc, and dhbdc as well as pbptz ligands are characterized as exhibiting wide emission bands with maxima peaking at 380, 385, 510, and 430/460 nm, respectively, owing to their strong capacity to absorb UV light through \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* or \u03c3 \u2192 \u03c0* transitions (as confirmed by TD-DFT calculations, see S9 section in the Supporting Information). When excited under UV light at 10 K, a clear distinction can be made between emission characteristics of compounds 1-3 and that of 4 (). Polycrystalline samples of 1-3 show a quite similar emission profile consisting of a main band centered at 445-455 nm, an intermediate one peaking in the 380-395 nm range (which represents a shoulder to main band), and less intense and isolated band at 605-620 nm range. Among them, it must be clearly stated that compound 3 presents a much more intense emission compared to 1 and 2, as inferred from the comparison of their raw emission spectra shown in Figure S16. In fact, the emission of compound 1 is so weak that its spectrum could only be recorded when excited under laser monochromated radiation at 325 nm, in contrast to compounds 2 and 3 that were excited at 305 nm (which corresponds to their excitation maxima, see Figure S17). With the aim of getting deeper insights, TD-DFT calculations were carried out on suitable models of ligand molecules in order to reproduce the experimental main bands, which showed a good concordance and allowed interpretation of the emission mechanism of the compounds (). As a result, it may be stated that these emissions are ascribed to \u03c0 \u2190 \u03c0* transitions originated at the aromatic rings of the ligands given the similar shape and small blue shifts of the bands corresponding to all compounds 1-4 with respect to those of corresponding free molecules (of ca. 10 nm for bdc, btc, and pbptz ligands in compounds 1-3). On the other hand, the bands sited in the 605-620 nm range may be tentatively assigned to a ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (LLCT) mechanism occurring between the excited energy levels of the carboxylato ligands and the ground levels of pbptz ligands within the complexes, in good agreement with the observed energy levels diagram. Upon monochromated laser excitation at 325 nm, the emission spectrum of compound 4 shows a very broad band covering the 400-700 nm in which two main peaks at 460 and 500 nm may be distinguished. It should be noted that 4 gives the poorest emission among all herein studied compounds. These two bands are undoubtedly attributed to the blue-shifted ligand-centered charge transfer (LCCT) emissions arising from pbptz and dhbdc ligands. Overall, the small hypsochromic shifts observed for all compounds correspond to the coordination of the ligands to zinc or cadmium atoms into their crystal structures. This also brings a notorious emission enhancement given that most of vibrational modes of the ligands, which usually represent the main nonradiative deactivation in metal-organic compounds, are substantially quenched Figure S19.
