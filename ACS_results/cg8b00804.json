Colorless rodlike crystals of Na(COOH)[B(OH)3](H2O)2 were obtained in yields of about 52% (on the basis of B).\n\nSynthesis of K3(COOH)3[B(OH)3]2 (2). A mixture of K2B4O7 (0.152 g, 0.5 mmol) and KCOOH (2.52 g, 30 mmol) were added to 5 mL of deionized water and stirred for 20 min at room temperature, and then sealed into a 23 mL Teflon autoclave and heated at 150 \u00b0C for 5 days. The Teflon autoclave was slow cooled to room temperature, and the products were washed with alcohol and dried in air. Colorless block crystals of K3(COOH)3[B(OH)3]2 were obtained in yields of about 40% (on the basis of B).\n\nSynthesis of (HCOOH)3[B(OH)3]2\u22c53H2O (3). Hydrothermal synthesis of K2B4O7 (0.152 g, 0.5 mmol), HCOOH (3 mL), and H2O (5 mL) at 150 \u00b0C for 5 days results in compound 3, and the pH value of the starting mixture is about 9.0. The products were washed with alcohol and dried in air. Colorless rodlike crystals of (HCOOH)3[B(OH)3]2\u22c53H2O were obtained in yields of about 65% (on the basis of B).", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "Na(COOH)[B(OH)3](H2O)2", "symbol": "1", "chemical
