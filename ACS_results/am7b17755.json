As shown in , the isotherms of MOF-3 exhibit type I characteristics, which indicates the microporous nature of MOF-3. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and Langmuir surface areas of MOF-3 were calculated to be 560 and 692 m2 g-1, respectively. In contrast, MOF-1 and MOF-2 exhibit no obvious N2 uptake. This phenomenon indicates MOF-3 is a much better candidate for loading guest molecule for energy-transfer and light-harvesting applications.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-1", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "[Zn3(tppe)1.5(mdc)3]\u22c510DMF"}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "25 to 182", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "evaporation of DMF molecules", "condition": ""}, {"value": "327", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "collapse of framework", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "MOF-2", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "[Cd4(tppe)2(1,4-ndc)4]\u22c58DMF"}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "77 to 310", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "evaporation of DMF molecules", "condition": ""}, {"value": "307", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "collapse of framework", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "MOF-3", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "[Cd2(tppe)(2,6-ndc)2]\u22c512DMF"}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "25 to 222", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "evaporation of DMF molecules", "condition": ""}, {"value": "340", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "collapse of framework", "condition": ""}], "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "560", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}, {"type": "Langmuir", "probe": "", "value": "692", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}]}]]], "include_properties": ["peak_spectrum", "decomposition_temperature", "surface_area"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['peak_spectrum', 'decomposition_temperature', 'surface_area']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n  {\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"name\": \"MOF-1\",\n      \"symbol\": \"\",\n      \"chemical formula\": \"[Zn3(tppe)1.5(mdc)3]\u22c510DMF\"\n    },\n    \"decomposition temperature\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"25 to 182\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"evaporation of DMF molecules\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"value\": \"327\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"collapse of framework\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"name\": \"MOF-2\",\n      \"symbol\": \"\",\n      \"chemical formula\": \"[Cd4(tppe)2(1,4-ndc)4]\u22c58DMF\"\n    },\n    \"decomposition temperature\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"77 to 310\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"evaporation of DMF molecules\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"value\": \"307\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"collapse of framework\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"name\": \"MOF-3\",\n      \"symbol\": \"\",\n      \"chemical formula\": \"[Cd2(tppe)(2,6-ndc)2]\u22c512DMF\"\n    },\n    \"decomposition temperature\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"25 to 222\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"evaporation of DMF molecules\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"value\": \"340\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"collapse of framework\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"surface area\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"BET\",\n        \"probe\": \"\",\n        \"value\": \"560\",\n        \"unit\": \"m2/g\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"Langmuir\",\n        \"probe\": \"\",\n        \"value\": \"692\",\n        \"unit\": \"m2/g\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 6, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Schematic Representation\nof Energy Transformation from tppe-Based MOF to Spatially Confined\nEnergy-Accepting Guest</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"am-2017-177554_0008.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Schematic Representation of Energy Transformation from tppe-Based MOF to Spatially Confined Energy-Accepting Guest   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 7, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch2\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Construction of MOFs <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>3</bold> (Purple\nand Green Polyhedrons Represent Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Cd<sup>2+</sup>, Respectively)</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr2\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"am-2017-177554_0009.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 2  Construction of MOFs 1-3 (Purple and Green Polyhedrons Represent Zn2+ and Cd2+, Respectively)   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 10, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Framework\nstructure of MOF-<bold>1</bold>.
