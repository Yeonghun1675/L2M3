In compound 1 the only magnetic centers are the octacoordinated Mn(II) ions, being Rh(III) diamagnetic. The high-temperature value, 4.33 emu*K/mol at 300 K, is consistent with the presence of isolated high spin Mn(II) centers (S = 5/2, g = 2.0) not strongly interacting through the polymeric chains of the inorganic \"stripes\". The \u03c7T value remains almost constant down to 6 K, markedly decreasing only below this temperature. The observed decrease may be due to weak antiferromagnetic interactions or to zero-field splitting effects. In the former hypothesis, the weakness of these interactions is consistent with the extremely long distance from one paramagnetic metal center to the other, which consists of one Rh(III) ion and two bridging oxalate ligands (see Figure ). The Mn(II) ions are connected by two such bridges, equivalent one to the other as each of them is composed by a long and short distance between the M(II) site and the oxalate (see Table ). The experimental data were fitted by a classical Heisenberg chain model, Mn(II) being an isotropic  ion with a high ground spin state. The Hamiltonian \u210b we considered has the form:    where J is the exchange interaction, S  i , the spin coordinates at the i-th site of the chain, g, the Land\u00e9 factor, \u03bcB, the Bohr magneton, and H, the externally applied magnetic field. The summation over the i index runs all over the N chain sites. For large N, i.e., in the limit of an almost infinite chain, and since the high spin Mn(II) centers, having S = 5/2, can be represented as classical spin vectors, the Hamiltonian (eq 3) leads to a conveniently compact expression that allows fitting of the data for the molar susceptibility according to eq 4:    where \u03b2 = (k BT)-1 and u = coth[\u03b2JS(S + 1)] - [\u03b2JS(S + 1)]-1. The simulation gives good agreement between the theoretical curve and the experimental data (agreement factor R = 0.9915). The best-fit values were found to be J/k B = -0.023 \u00b1 0.002 K and g = 2.00 \u00b1 0.05, as expected for such a long interaction pathway.

When mixing in water K3[Rh(C2O4)3]\u22c54.5H2O, Mn(NO3)2 and [DAMS]I (reaction 1; see Experimental Section), we observed the separation of a partially crystalline phase, \u03b1  Rh , characterized by a very large SHG of the same order of magnitude as that of [DAMS][p-toluenesulfonate]14 working at a 1907 nm nonresonant incident wavelength:    \n\nSolid-state UV-visible absorption spectra of 1 - 6 in nujol (the spectrum of 1 is reported as example in Figure ), show the superposition of two bands: a broad and strong band centered around 464 nm and a strong, narrow signal at 568 nm, indicative of J aggregates of the [DAMS+] cation. When 1 - 6 are dissolved in acetonitrile, the absorption spectra are identical to that of [DAMS]I, with an absorption band at 471 nm (Figure ) due to the disruption of the ordered J aggregates by dissolution in a polar organic solvent.  \n\nThe Fe(III)-containing compound, 2, shows a temperature dependence of the \u03c7T product (Figure ) that is a clear indication of a one-dimensional material with no appreciable three-dimensional long-range ordering. At high temperature the \u03c7T value (12.8 emu*K/mol at 300 K) is slightly lower than expected (13.125 emu*K/mol) for one high spin Mn(II) ion and two high spin Fe(III) ions per repeating unit which are uncoupled. Contrary to 3, the Cr(III) containing material, the \u03c7T curve of 2 decreases steadily on lowering the temperature and reaches a minimum at 25 K (\u03c7T being 7.9 emu*K/mol), where a marked increase of the susceptibility gives rise to a sharp peak at 10 K (\u03c7T being 14.8 emu*K/mol) in H = 1 kOe. Such behavior is quite typical of ferrimagnetic systems. The field dependence of \u03c7T is due to saturation effects. Zero-field-cooled and field- cooled measurements revealed no sign of irreversibility, thus further confirming the absence of long-range 3D ordering due to interchain interactions. The magnetization curve as a function of the field, recorded at 2.0 K, shown in the inset of Figure , gave a saturation value of 5.03 \u03bcB, in agreement to what is theoretically predicted for a single S = 5/2 ion with g = 2. This value can be explained with the presence of two Fe(III) ions oriented parallel to each other and antiferromagnetically coupled to the alternating Mn(II) ions, to give a ferrimagnetic state. Therefore, consistent with this ferrimagnetic behavior, the magnetic structure of the polymeric inorganic chain of 2 at low temperature can be schematized with the magnetization of Mn(II) ions opposed to that of both of the alternating Fe(III) ions. A high-temperature fit of the data with the Curie-Weiss law (R = 0.99994) revealed a significant, antiferromagnetic coupling, estimated as J = -34.5 \u00b1 0.2 K. This rather high value is in overall agreement with what was previously reported for similar compounds.  \n\nBoth compounds 5 and 6 were found to display, at best, a weak antiferromagnetic coupling, as reported in Figure . In the case of the Fe(III)-containing compound 5 a \u03c7T = 8.7 emu*K/mol value is reached at 300 K, consistent with the presence of two high-spin Fe(III) magnetic centers in each repeating unit of the \"stripe\". As can be noticed from the curve of Figure  (black triangles) the magnetic Fe(III) centers are only weakly antiferromagnetically coupled, according to a \u03c7T value that decreases very slightly down to 12 K, markedly showing the effect of interactions only below this temperature. As no effect of the growth of the correlation length is visible from the \u03c7T plot, the magnetic interaction pathway, responsible for the decrease of the \u03c7T value, can be due to either antiferromagnetic coupling between the two Fe(III) centers of the same repeating unit or that between Fe(III) centers placed in two adjacent monomeric units. A Curie-Weiss plot (R = 0.99999) revealed that these interactions (J = -1.0 \u00b1 0.1 K) are more than 1 order of magnitude stronger than those between Mn(II) centers, for instance in compound 1, but considerably lower than those obtained for 2 and 3 when both M(II) and M(III) centers are magnetic. The presence of only weak interactions is also revealed by the magnetization vs field curve, reported in the inset of Figure , which is in agreement with the presence of two very weakly coupled Fe(III) centers, as the saturation value of 9.64 \u03bcB is reached at 60 KOe.
