The framework is comprised of a 9-coordinated Bi3+ building unit and 4', 4\u2034, 4\u2057', 4\u2057\u2034-(ethene-1,1,2,2-tetrayl)tetrakis([1,1'-biphenyl]-4-carboxylic acid) (H4tcbpe) organic linker, which has strong yellow aggregation induced emission (AIE). The structure can be viewed as two interpenetrated 4,4-anionic nets that are stabilized by K+ ions forming one-dimensional helical inorganic chains by connecting bismuth nodes through shared oxygen bonds. The as-made LMOF has a bluish emission centered at 459 nm with an internal quantum yield of 57% when excited at 360 nm. The emission properties of the LMOF were found to be highly solvochromic with respect to DMF. Upon partial solvent removal, the framework undergoes significant red-shifting to a greenish emission centered at 500 nm. Complete removal of DMF results in additional red-shifting fluorescence coupled with structural changes. The resulting material has strong blue-excitable (455 nm) yellow emission centered at 553 nm, with a quantum yield of 74%, which is maintained after heating in air for 5 days at 90 \u00b0C. This is the second highest quantum yield value for blue-excited yellow emission among all reported LMOFs.\n\nIn summary, a new bismuth-fluorophore LMOF, K[Bi(tcbpe)(DMF)2]\u22c5xDMF was obtained using carefully considered synthetic conditions, and its structural and optical properties were studied. The new material was found to have highly sensitive solvochromic optical properties with respect to guest DMF solvent. The as-made LMOF has strong blue emission with a QY of ~57% that undergoes significant optical red-shifting upon incremental removal of DMF. Upon loss of structurally critical DMF molecules, irreversible structural changes occur paired with additional optical red-shifting. The fully activated material has strong yellow emission (QY ~ 74%) when excited by 455 nm blue light, making it a promising candidate as an alternative blue-excitable yellow phosphor totally free of REEs.\n\nThe authors declare no competing financial interest.\n\nReferences\n\nCrystal data for K[Bi(tcbpe)(DMF)2]\u22c5xDMF (LMOF-401), C60H46BiKN2O10, FW: 1203.07, a = 32.0791(13) \u00c5, b = 11.9048(5) \u00c5, c = 37.7384(15) \u00c5, \u03b1 = 90\u00b0, \u03b2 = 99.269(2)\u00b0, \u03b3 = 90\u00b0, synchrotron radiation (\u03bb = 0.7749 \u00c5), T = 100 K, monoclinic, C2/c, Z = 8, absorption coefficient = 2.793 mm-1, F(000) = 4816, reflections collected = 60475, independent reflections = 13085 [R(int) = 0.0804], final R indices [I > 2\u03c3(I)]: R 1 = 0.0465, wR 2 = 0.1112, R indices (all data): R 1 = 0.0628, wR 2 = 0.1168, GOF = 1.023.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "LMOF-401", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "C60H46BiKN2O10"}, "peak spectrum": [{"value": "459, 500, 553", "unit": "nm", "type": "photoluminescence", "condition": "excited at 360 nm; solvochromic with respect to DMF; after heating in air for 5 days at 90 \u00b0C"}], "chemical formula weight": [{"value": "1203.07", "unit": "g/mol", "condition": ""}], "lattice parameters": [{"value": {"a": "32.0791", "b": "11.9048", "c": "37.7384", "alpha": "90", "beta": "99.269", "gamma": "90", "condition": "T = 100 K"}}], "crystal system": [{"value": "monoclinic", "condition": ""}], "space group": [{"value": "C2/c", "condition": ""}]}]]], "include_properties": ["peak_spectrum", "chemical_formula_weight", "lattice_parameters", "crystal_system", "space_group"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['peak_spectrum', 'chemical_formula_weight', 'lattice_parameters', 'crystal_system', 'space_group']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"LMOF-401\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"C60H46BiKN2O10\"\n        },\n        \"peak spectrum\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"459, 500, 553\",\n                \"unit\": \"nm\",\n                \"type\": \"photoluminescence\",\n                \"condition\": \"excited at 360 nm; solvochromic with respect to DMF; after heating in air for 5 days at 90 \u00b0C\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"chemical formula weight\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"1203.07\",\n                \"unit\": \"g/mol\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"lattice parameters\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": {\n                    \"a\": \"32.0791\",\n                    \"b\": \"11.9048\",\n                    \"c\": \"37.7384\",\n                    \"alpha\": \"90\",\n                    \"beta\": \"99.269\",\n                    \"gamma\": \"90\",\n                    \"condition\": \"T = 100 K\"\n                }\n            }\n        ],\n        \"crystal system\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"monoclinic\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"space group\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"C2/c\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 9, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Structure plots of <bold>1</bold> along the crystallographic <italic>b</italic>-axis (left) and slightly rotated from the <italic>a</italic>-axis (right).
