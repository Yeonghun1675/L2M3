However, the trihydrate 1 is transformed to the dihydrate below 85% RH, which was confirmed by thermal gravimetric analysis and X-ray structure analysis. The dihydrate showed a much lower proton conductivity of 6 \u00d7 10-6 S cm-1 at 70% RH, suggesting that water molecules play an important role in creating the proton-conducting pathways.\n\nSynthetic procedure, IR spectra, ac impedance measurements, X-ray crystallographic file in CIF format.
