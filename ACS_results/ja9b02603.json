Afterward, 300 \u03bcL of TFA were added into the mixture. The solution was then put in the 120 \u00b0C oven for 24 h. The purification method for the Hf-NU-1200 was the same as that for the Zr-NU-1200 and gives ~90% yield.\n\n Ce-NU-1200 Powder\n\nIn a 4 mL vial, TMTB linker (0.1 mmol, 50.9 mg) was added into 1.2 mL of DEF, and then 600 \u03bcL of 0.533 M Ce(NH4)2(NO3)6 solution were added into the mixture with sonication for 10 min. Afterward, 40 \u03bcL TFA were added into the mixture. The solution was then put in the 100 \u00b0C heating block and stirred for 15 min. When the vials cooled down, the solution was centrifuged and the upper clear solvent was poured out; DMF was used to wash the material several times, and acetone was used to exchange the DMF. The material was soaked in the acetone overnight; acetone was then used to wash completely for 3 times. After the solvent was poured out, the material was dried at 80 \u00b0C in a vacuum oven for 2 h to give ~50% product based on the linker.\n\n Th-NU-1200 Powder\n\nTwo solutions were made before synthesis. Solution A was made by dissolving 1 g of thorium nitrate (1.8 mmol) in 20 mL of DMF. Solution B was made by dissolving 100 mg of linker (0.2 mmol) in 10 mL of DMF. Afterward, 400 \u03bcL of solution A were combined with 400 \u03bcL of solution B, followed by addition of 80 \u03bcL of H2O and 20 \u03bcL of TFA. Finally, the solution was put into a 120 \u00b0C oven for 24 h. When the vials cooled down, the solution was centrifuged and the upper clear solvent was pour out; DMF was used to wash the material several times, and acetone was used to exchange the DMF. The material was soaked in the acetone overnight, and then acetone was used to wash totally for 3 times. After the solvent was poured, the material was dried at 80 \u00b0C in a vacuum oven for 2 h to give ~60% product based on the linker.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "Hf-NU-1200 Powder", "symbol": "",
