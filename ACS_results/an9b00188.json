The results revealed the occurrence of four distinct phases within a range of water and benzoic acid concentrations ( and Figure S4). In the absence of water and/or benzoic acid, the major phase observed is unknown. Thus, the presence of water and benzoic acid is critical for the formation of the thorium polyoxo-cluster-based MOFs. When the concentration of benzoic acid is as low as 0.3 M and the concentration of water is in the range 2-10 M, Th-NU-1011 is the major phase. However, when the concentration of benzoic acid is higher than 0.3 M, the Th-NU-1008 phase appears. As the starting concentration of water increases, the yield of Th-NU-1008 also increases. When the concentration of water is higher than 6 M, the pure phase of Th-NU-1008 is obtained. The above observations reflect that olation/oxolation hydrolysis reactions can be accelerated by increasing the starting water concentration. Based on previous experimental and theoretical studies of thorium hydrolysis in aqueous solution, the high concentration of benzoic acid lowers the initial pH value and inhibits hydrolysis. Thus, synthesizing thorium polyoxo-cluster-based MOFs requires longer crystallization time since it is difficult for thorium polyoxo-clusters to form in the presence of high concentrations of benzoic acid. As the reaction time becomes longer, the thermodynamically stable Th6O8 cluster is favored instead of the kinetically favored Th4O2 cluster. Therefore, it is more likely to form Th-NU-1008 than Th-NU-1011 when the concentration of benzoic acid is higher.
