Phases 1 and 2 could possesses OMSs after the removal of solvent (DMF or MeOH) as suggested by the selective adsorption of CO2 molecules. To understand the selective binding environment of CO2, we calculated isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption for 1 and 2 by virial analysis using CO2 adsorption isotherms measured at 195 and 210 K (Figures S7 and S8 of the ). The isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption for 1 and 2, are -15 and -39 kJmol-1, respectively. To clarify the specific interactions of CO2 with OMSs present in phases 1 and 2, we carried out in situ DRIFTS. The background-subtracted FT-IR spectra of CO2 adsorbed on phases 1 and 2 at 195 K are shown in Figure .

To the reaction mixture, 20 \u03bcL of NaOH (0.01 M) was added as a deprotonating agent and the initial pH = 6.0. The whole reaction mixture was heated in a temperature controllable oven from room temperature to 100 \u00b0C, over a period of 4 h and then at 100 \u00b0C for 48 h. The oven was cooled from 100 to 30 \u00b0C over a period of 6 h. The product contains homogeneous colorless flake-type crystals, which were isolated by washing with MeOH and dried in air.
