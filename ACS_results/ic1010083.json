A fit of the adsorption data to the Horvath-Kawazoe model shows the maximum pore size in the range of 1.0-1.1 nm, in agreement with the structural analysis above.\n\nThe establishment of permanent porosity of 1a enables us to examine its potential application on the selective gas separation. As shown in Figure , 1a can take differential amounts of C2H2 (44 cm3/g), CO2 (37 cm3/g), and CH4 (10 cm3/g) at 1 atm and 295 K, highlighting 1a as the promising material for the selective separation of C2H2/CH4 and CO2/CH4 at room temperature. Such selective sorption of 1a with respect to these three gas molecules are mainly attributed to their different interactions with the framework surfaces.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "Zn5(BTA)6(TDA)2\u22c515DMF\u22c58H2O", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "Zn5(BTA)6(TDA)2\u22c515DMF\u22c58H2O"}, "surface area": [{"type": "Langmuir", "probe": "", "value": "607", "unit": "m2 g-1", "condition": ""}, {"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "414", "unit": "m2 g-1", "condition": ""}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "", "unit": "", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "", "condition": "type-I sorption behavior"}, {"adsorbate": "C2H2", "adsorbed amount": "44", "unit": "cm3/g", "temperature": "295 K", "pressure": "1 atm", "condition": "selective separation"}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "37", "unit": "cm3/g", "temperature": "295 K", "pressure": "1 atm", "condition": "selective separation"}, {"adsorbate": "CH4", "adsorbed amount": "10", "unit": "cm3/g", "temperature": "295 K", "pressure": "1 atm", "condition": "selective separation"}], "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "23 to 450", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "weight loss", "condition": "release of solvent molecules and coordinated solvent molecules"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["surface_area", "gas_adsorption", "decomposition_temperature"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['surface_area', 'gas_adsorption', 'decomposition_temperature']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"Zn5(BTA)6(TDA)2\u22c515DMF\u22c58H2O\",\n            \"symbol\": \"1\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"Zn5(BTA)6(TDA)2\u22c515DMF\u22c58H2O\"\n        },\n        \"surface area\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"Langmuir\",\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"607\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2 g-1\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"type\": \"BET\",\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"414\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2 g-1\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"N2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"\",\n                \"unit\": \"\",\n                \"temperature\": \"77 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"type-I sorption behavior\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"C2H2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"44\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3/g\",\n                \"temperature\": \"295 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"1 atm\",\n                \"condition\": \"selective separation\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"CO2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"37\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3/g\",\n                \"temperature\": \"295 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"1 atm\",\n                \"condition\": \"selective separation\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"CH4\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"10\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3/g\",\n                \"temperature\": \"295 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"1 atm\",\n                \"condition\": \"selective separation\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"decomposition temperature\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"23 to 450\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"weight loss\",\n                \"condition\": \"release of solvent molecules and coordinated solvent molecules\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 10, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Powder XRD for MOF <bold>1</bold>: simulated pattern (black), as-synthesized (green), and activated (<bold>1a</bold>) samples at 150 \u00b0C (red).
