The crystal structure of 1 was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, which reveals that 1 comprises anionic [Cd(BPE)(\u03b1-Mo8O26)] n  2  n  - two-dimensional (2D) netlike frameworks parallel to the (0 0 1) crystallographic planes, penetrated, in an angle of 64.772\u00b0, by cationic [Cd(BPE)(DMF)4] n  2  n  + chains parallel to the [1\u0304 0 1] direction (Figure ). Numerous types of entanglements of multiple motifs in coordination polymeric networks have been reviewed. Examples of threading one-dimensional (1D) chains into 2D sheets are relatively rare. To the best of our knowledge, 1 is the first 1D-in-2D entangled system incorporating polyoxometalates. It is also noteworthy that 1 was prepared by reacting Lindqvist ion [Mo6O19]2- with Cd2+ and BPE. The conversion of [Mo6O19]2- into [\u03b2-Mo8O26]4- during the progress of reactions has been observed. The interconversion of POMs appears to assist the crystallization process of products.

In 1D [Cd(BPE)(DMF)4] n  2  n  +, each Cd2+ ion is coordinated by four DMF as ligands, and these Cd2+ ions (Cd\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cd distance = 13.62 \u00c5) are then bridged by BPE ligands to extend into infinite chains that penetrate into the meshes of [Cd(BPE)(\u03b1-Mo8O26)] n  2  n  - sheets.

The supermolecular assembly of the 1D chains and 2D grids is stabilized by the \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions between the aromatic rings of BPE ligands of the two motifs, in which the distance between (N1C1-5) and (N2C7-11) pyridyl rings is 3.51 \u00c5.

X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) studies indicated that 1 became poorly crystalline after two unbounded DMF molecules were removed. The removal of four other coordinated DMF molecules led to the complete loss of crystallinity. In the IR spectrum of 1, the peaks between 600 and 1000 cm-1 are attributed to \u03b1-octamolybdate, and the peaks in the range of 1000-1700 cm-1 are due to BPE and DMF.

The crystal structure of 1 was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, which reveals that 1 comprises anionic [Cd(BPE)(\u03b1-Mo8O26)] n  2  n  - two-dimensional (2D) netlike frameworks parallel to the (0 0 1) crystallographic planes, penetrated, in an angle of 64.772\u00b0, by cationic [Cd(BPE)(DMF)4] n  2  n  + chains parallel to the [1\u0304 0 1] direction (Figure ). Numerous types of entanglements of multiple motifs in coordination polymeric networks have been reviewed. Examples of threading one-dimensional (1D) chains into 2D sheets are relatively rare. To the best of our knowledge, 1 is the first 1D-in-2D entangled system incorporating polyoxometalates. It is also noteworthy that 1 was prepared by reacting Lindqvist ion [Mo6O19]2- with Cd2+ and BPE. The conversion of [Mo6O19]2- into [\u03b2-Mo8O26]4- during the progress of reactions has been observed. The interconversion of POMs appears to assist the crystallization process of products. The direct use of [Mo8O26]4- as a starting reagent resulted in quick precipitation of an amorphous material. The structure of the centrosymmetric octamolybdate anion, containing six distorted edge-shared octahedral MoO6 caped by two tetrahedral MoO4 (Chart ), is a typical [\u03b1-Mo8O26]4-, in which each Mo atom adopts a +6 oxidation state as verified by bond valence sum calculations. In the 2D [Cd(BPE)(\u03b1-Mo8O26)] n  2  n  - frameworks, each Cd2+ ion is in an octahedral environment, with its two axial sites bound to two BPE ligands, and with its equatorial sites bound to two [\u03b1-Mo8O26]4- clusters in an unprecedented bonding mode, in which each octamolybdate uses two opposite pairs of oxo groups of adjacent MoO6 octahedra to coordinate two Cd2+ ions, respectively. The 2D framework can also be regarded as [Cd(\u03b1-Mo8O26)] n  2  n  - infinite metal oxide chains cross-linked by BPE ligands, resulting in parallelogram grids of 13.34 \u00d7 11.85 \u00c5. In the [\u03b1-Mo8O26]4- cluster, the average Mo-O distance of MoO4 tetrahedra (1.77 \u00c5), comparable to that of Na2MoO4\u22c52H2O (1.772 \u00c5), is shorter than that of MoO6 octahedra (2.01\u00c5), in which the average Mo-O distances decrease with oxygen coordination numbers: Mo-\u03bc3-O (2.41 \u00c5), Mo-\u03bc2-O (1.91 \u00c5) and Mo-Ot (1.70 \u00c5). In 1D [Cd(BPE)(DMF)4] n  2  n  +, each Cd2+ ion is coordinated by four DMF as ligands, and these Cd2+ ions (Cd\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cd distance = 13.62 \u00c5) are then bridged by BPE ligands to extend into infinite chains that penetrate into the meshes of [Cd(BPE)(\u03b1-Mo8O26)] n  2  n  - sheets. The spacing of two parallel sheets is 12.11 \u00c5. The supermolecular assembly of the 1D chains and 2D grids is stabilized by the \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions between the aromatic rings of BPE ligands of the two motifs, in which the distance between (N1C1-5) and (N2C7-11) pyridyl rings is 3.51 \u00c5. Two equivalents of DMF molecules are found in the void space of the framework as shown in Figure d. Thermogravimetric analysis exhibits two distinct weight loss steps for unbound (6.60 wt %) and coordinated DMF molecules (13.21 wt %), starting at ~100 \u00b0C and ~200 \u00b0C, respectively, followed by the loss of organic ligands. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) studies indicated that 1 became poorly crystalline after two unbounded DMF molecules were removed. The removal of four other coordinated DMF molecules led to the complete loss of crystallinity. In the IR spectrum of 1, the peaks between 600 and 1000 cm-1 are attributed to \u03b1-octamolybdate, and the peaks in the range of 1000-1700 cm-1 are due to BPE and DMF. The intense band centered at 1654 cm-1 features \u03bd(C\ue5fbO) of DMF. The intense peak at 1611 cm-1 is the characteristic pyridyl skeletal vibration of BPE. The diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectrum (Figure ) converted by Kubelka-Munk function shows an absorption edge, indicating that 1 is a semiconductor with a band gap of 3.45 eV. This has also been observed in Co2(bpy)6(W6O19)2, which comprises [Co(W6O19)] n  metal oxide chains. The extended [Cd(\u03b1-Mo8O26)] n  2  n  - framework of 1 appears to be responsible for its optical band gap.
