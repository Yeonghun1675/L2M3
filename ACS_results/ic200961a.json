The supernatant was removed, and the white solid was suspended in 10 mL of a 1:1 water/ethanol mixture, and then centrifuged for 30 min at 20\u2009000 rpm. After repeating once more the latter washing, a similar procedure was then used to dry the solid with 10 mL of diethylether. The white powder was finally air-dried at 80 \u00b0C for 3 days. Yield: 171 mg, 72%.</p>", "clean_text": "Synthesis of Ca(PhB(OH)3)2 \n\n0.192 g (4.8 mmol, 1 equiv) of NaOH was dissolved in 14.0 mL of a 1:1 ethanol/water solution, and 0.585 g of PhB(OH)2 (4.8 mmol, 1 equiv) was then added. After complete dissolution of the phenylboronic acid, the solution was heated. When the temperature reaches ~50 \u00b0C, 3.0 mL of a 0.80 mol L-1 aqueous solution of CaCl2 (2.4 mmol, 0.5 equiv) was then added drop by drop under magnetic stirring, leading to the immediate formation of a white precipitate. The suspension was further heated to 100 \u00b0C and refluxed for 24 h. The reaction medium was then left to cool at room temperature, before being filtered under vacuum for ~15 min. The precipitate was washed twice with 10 mL of a 1:1 ethanol/water solution (with the vacuum maintained for 5 and 15 min, respectively, after each of these washings). The powder was dried by washing it twice with 10 mL of diethyl ether (with the vacuum maintained for 5 and 15 min, respectively), and then air-dried in an oven at ca. 40 \u00b0C for ~60 h. Yield: 458 mg, 60%. Several attempts to recrystallize this sample to obtain single crystals were unfortunately unsuccessful. Anal. Calcd for C12H16B2O6Ca: C, 45.3; H, 5.0; Ca, 12.6; B, 6.8. Found: C, 44.9; H, 5.1; Ca, 12.8; B, 6.5. Its IR and Raman spectra are given in the  in Figure S1.\n\nSynthesis of Sr(PhB(OH)3)2\u22c5H2O\n\n0.192 g (4.8 mmol, 1 equiv) of NaOH was dissolved in 14.0 mL of a 1:1 ethanol/water solution, and 0.585 g of PhB(OH)2 (4.8 mmol, 1 equiv) was then added. After complete dissolution of the phenylboronic acid, the solution was heated to 100 \u00b0C. 3.0 mL of a 0.80 mol L-1 aqueous solution of SrCl2 (2.4 mmol, 0.5 equiv) was then added drop by drop under magnetic stirring, leading to the immediate formation of a white precipitate. The suspension was refluxed for 24 h, during which the formation of fairly large crystallites was observed. The reaction medium was then left to cool, before being filtered under vacuum for ~15 min. The microcrystalline precipitate was washed and dried as described previously for the Ca phase. Yield: 479 mg, 52%. The crystals were suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Anal. Calcd for C12H18B2O7Sr: C, 37.6; H, 4.7. Found: C, 37.1; H, 4.8. Its IR and Raman spectra are given in .\n\nSynthesis of Ba(PhB(OH)3)2 \n\n0.192 g (4.8 mmol, 1 equiv) of NaOH was dissolved in 14.0 mL of a 1:1 ethanol/water solution, and 0.585 g of PhB(OH)2 (4.8 mmol, 1 equiv) was then added. After complete dissolution of the phenylboronic acid, the solution was heated to 100 \u00b0C. 3.0 mL of a 0.80 mol L-1 aqueous solution of BaCl2 (2.4 mmol, 0.5 equiv) was then added drop by drop under magnetic stirring, leading to the immediate formation of a white precipitate. The suspension was refluxed for 3 h. The warm reaction medium was then filtered. The white precipitate was washed and dried as described previously for the Ca and Sr phases and corresponded to a microcrystalline powder of Ba(PhB(OH)3)2 (yield: 360 mg, ~36%). Single plate-shaped crystals of Ba(PhB(OH)3)2 formed in the filtrate upon cooling. However, attempts to use them to determine the crystal structure were unsuccessful (vide infra). Yield (in single crystals): 290 mg, 29%. Anal. Calcd for C12H16B2O6Ba: C, 34.7; H, 3.9; Ba, 33.9. Found: C, 34.7; H, 3.9; Ba, 32.5. Its IR and Raman spectra are given in .\n\nSynthesis of 43Ca-Enriched Ca(PhB(OH)3)2 \n\nThe 43Ca-labeled Ca(PhB(OH)3)2 sample was prepared starting from a 3/2 mixture of 60%-labeled CaCO3 and nonlabeled CaCO3 (meaning that the final 43Ca enrichment in the product is expected to be ~36%). 75.8 mg of the mixture (0.75 mmol, 1 equiv) was placed in an alumina crucible and heated to 1000 \u00b0C for 3 h, to form CaO. The solid was then added to 0.575 mL of ultrapure water (contained inside a centrifuge tube), and the suspension was stirred at room temperature. 1.45 mL of a 1 mol L-1 solution of HCl was then added dropwise (1.45 mmol, 1.9 equiv), to form an aqueous solution of calcium chloride in the centrifuge tube. Separately, 0.061 g of NaOH (1.51 mmol, 2 equiv) was dissolved in a 2:1 mixture of ethanol and water. 0.183 g of PhB(OH)2 (1.50 mmol, 2 equiv) was then added under stirring. After complete dissolution of the phenylboronic acid, this solution was added drop by drop to the CaCl2 solution, leading to the immediate formation of a white precipitate. The suspension was stirred for 2 days at room temperature, then centrifuged for 30 min at 20000 rpm. The supernatant was removed, and the white solid was suspended in 10 mL of a 1:1 water/ethanol mixture, and then centrifuged for 30 min at 20000 rpm. After repeating once more the latter washing, a similar procedure was then used to dry the solid with 10 mL of diethylether. The white powder was finally air-dried at 80 \u00b0C for 3 days.
