Due to the large voids, the two single 3D networks are further entangled with each other to result in a twofold interpenetrating motif. When the [Zn4O(COO)6] SBUs are regarded as 6-connected nodes and all L3- ligands act as 3-connected linkers. The whole structure can thus be represented as a (3,6)-c  sit  network with a symbol of (4\u22c562)2(42\u22c5610\u22c583), as shown in d. The calculated void volume is 26.6% of the total crystal volume by using the PLATON program after excluding NMP and H2O molecules.\n\nPowder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) and Thermal Analysis\n\nPXRD shows that the peak positions of the obtained crystalline samples of complexes 1-3 match well with the ones simulated from the single-crystal data, manifesting the high phase purity of the synthesized samples (Figure S4). The TGA of 1-3 was performed under a N2 atmosphere from 30 to 700 \u00b0C (Figure S5), which showed that complex 1 indicated a weight loss of 30.8% in the range of 30-260 \u00b0C, ascribed to the release of four NMP molecule and three H2O molecule per formula unit (calcd 31.2%). Complex 2 released one DMF molecule and one H2O molecule between 30 and 308 \u00b0C with a weight loss of 15.5% (calcd 15.7%). For 3, it is similar to that of 2, and it lost one lattice water and one DMF molecule from 30 to 306 \u00b0C with a weight loss of 15.1% (calcd 15.5%), the major framework then began to collapse.\n\nGas Adsorption Behavior\n\nTo obtain the guest-free phase of 1a-3a, the samples of complexes 1a-3a were soaked in CH3Cl for 3 days, and then heated under vacuum for 6 h (at 160 \u00b0C for 1; 2 and 3 at 120 \u00b0C) to exclude the guest molecules, which is evidenced by the TGA curves (Figure S5). In order to study the nature of the pores and gas adsorption properties of 1a-3a, the isotherms are measured for N2, CH4, and CO2, respectively. The N2 adsorption isotherms of the activated samples of 1a-3a are measured at 77 K (Figure S6). The reversible N2 sorption experiments of 1a-3a at 77 K all showed the type II adsorption isotherm behaviors, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas are 10.7, 16.5, and 15.4 m2 g-1, respectively.\n\nMoreover, the CO2 sorption properties of the desolvated 1a-3a at three different temperatures (195, 273, and 298 K) were also studied carefully. At 195 K, their CO2 isotherms show almost identical adsorption performance (). The CO2 uptake values are 66.1 cm3 g-1 (12.9 wt %), 70.4 cm3 g-1 (13.9 wt %), and 58.7 cm3 g-1 (11.5 wt %), respectively. However, once the measure temperatures changed to 273 and 298 K, the interesting results were observed (Figure S7). For 1a, the CO2 uptake are 20.2 ccm3 g-1 (3.97 wt %) at 273 K and 11.4 cm3 g-1 (2.24 wt %) at 298 K and 1 bar. For 2a, its CO2 isotherms are close to linear and the CO2 uptake values are 28.1 cm3 g-1 (5.12 wt %) at 273 K and 13.1 cm3 g-1 (2.57 wt %) at 298 K at 1 bar. For 3a, its CO2 isotherms are also type I adsorption isotherms and the CO2 uptake values are 17.7 cm3 g-1 (3.48 wt %) and 13.4 cm3 g-1 (2.63 wt %) at 273 and 298 K, respectively. It is obvious that the final CO2 uptake value of 2a at ambient temperature is comparable with those of 1a and 3a, while the uptake of 2a is relatively higher at 273 K than those of 1a and 3a. This may be, on one hand, attributed to the single network and uncoordinated carboxylate O atoms (inserted into the surface of the pores) relative to 2a, which make the framework highly polar and form stronger affinity with CO2; and on the other hand, it is ascribed to the larger effective free void of 2a (26.6% for 1a, 28.3% for 2a, and 25.1% for 3a). In addition, all of them do not adsorb CH4 well at different temperatures.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "Complex 1", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "[Zn4O(COO)6]"}, "porosity": [{"probe":
