In a previous study, 1 was shown to undergo substantial conversion to hydrocerussite, Pb3(OH)2(CO3)2, upon exposure to humid air free of acetic acid vapor. The experiment was done in a dynamic atmospheric exposure apparatus in which the sample was exposed to a continuous flow of humidified air over the two-week exposure period. The equilibrium reaction 1  Pb   (   CH   3   COO )   2   \u22c5 2 PbO \u22c5 0.5   H   2   O ( s ) + 2   CO   2   ( g ) + 1.5   H   2   O ( g ) \u2194   Pb   3     ( OH )   2     (   CO   3   )   2   ( s ) + 2   CH   3   COOH ( g )  was used to explain the observed transformation and to justify the requirements of atmospheric moisture and a low concentration of acetic acid vapor. An analogous reaction may be proposed for 2: 2  3   Pb   2   O   ( CHOO )   2   ( s ) + 4   CO   2   ( g ) + 5   H   2   O ( g ) \u2194 2   Pb   3     ( OH )   2     (   CO   3   )   2   ( s ) + 6 CHOOH ( g )  To determine whether this reaction occurs to a significant extent, we carried out a two-week exposure in a chamber with a static, humidified atmosphere. Because of the difference in these conditions from those used previously by Svensson and co-workers, we also exposed 1 under static conditions to be able to compare the behaviors of the two compounds. After the two-week static exposures, a PXRD pattern of each sample showed only a trace amount of hydrocerussite, and the starting compound remained as the dominant phase. The much lower extent of conversion of 1 in the static exposure chamber compared with the dynamic chamber may be explained by eq . In the dynamic exposure, products are favored because the continuous stream of humidified air brings CO2 and H2O to the sample and takes away acetic acid vapor that has been released. Like 1, compound 2 showed conversion to hydrocerussite to a minimal extent under static conditions, and study of this process under a dynamic atmosphere and over longer periods of time could be the focus of future experiments.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 34, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<title>Conclusions</title><p>Hydrothermal reactions proved to be an effective means of crystallizing basic lead acetate (<bold>1</bold>) and basic lead formate (<bold>2</bold>), both of which had previously been prepared only in polycrystalline form.
