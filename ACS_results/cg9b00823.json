It is also well-known that at this temperature the diffusion of nitrogen through the micropores of the framework is very sluggish, and diffusional limitation at this temperature may influence the adsorption in ultramicropores. However, 1a adsorbed 84 cm3 g-1 of CO2 at 195 K/1 bar, which corresponds to a BET surface area of 197 m2 g-1 (a), thus establishing its permanent microporous nature. On the other hand, 2a did not adsorb CO2 under similar conditions, confirming its non-microporosity and less affinity toward CO2. 1a took up moderate CO2 uptake amount of 1.6 and 1.2 mmol at 273 and 295 K respectively under 1 bar (b), whereas 2a showed negligible uptake under such conditions (Figure S6, Supporting Information).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-1", "symbol": "1", "chemical
