If these deuterons are protein-associated water, they would be very susceptible to a temperature-induced increase in isotropic motion. These dynamics should be reversible and would not require the protein itself to undergo isotropic motion. Such behavior is shown after heating the spore to 100 \u00b0C and cooling it back down to 21 \u00b0C (Figure ). The dramatic change of the anisotropic feature III into the isotropic signal of feature I supports our view that these deuterons are in rigid water associated with biomolecules, and their increased motion does not require a diffuse liquid-like state. Within a few degrees of the D2O melting point (3.8 \u00b0C), water molecules flip between ice crystal sites yielding a narrow isotropic peak. Wittebort et al. used variable temperature 1H and 2H NMR studies to examine molecular dynamics in ice. In the hexagonal form of ice, I  h , the central water molecule is bound to 2 neighboring H atoms (via the oxygen) and 2 neighboring oxygen atoms (via the protons). These four bonds form a tetrahedron around the central water molecule. In Wittebort's sample, a narrow line is seen at -6 \u00b0C and attributed to isotropic reorientation within the ice lattice.
