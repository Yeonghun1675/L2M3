Moreover, in the field dependence of the magnetization measured at several temperatures (Figure c), the magnetization abruptly increased at low fields and shows hysteresis at temperatures below 8 K (Figures d and S1 in the ). In the M/H curves, the magnetization only reaches a value of ca. 0.4 \u03bcB (1.8 K) for a saturation value (M s) at low fields, followed by a sigmoidal curve with an inflection at around 0.8 T (H ex from a dM/dH plot, Figure c; the phase diagram, Figure S2 in the ), becoming M s = 1.82 \u03bcB at 7 T. This M/H feature indicates that the interchain interaction is antiferromagnetic and that the spontaneous magnetization is due to a canting mode of antiferromagnetically ordered spins. The interchain interactions (zJ', where z is the numbers of neighbors) having an effective spin (S eff) of 1 were estimated from H ex to be -0.54 K (g = 2.0). From a structural point of view, the stacking of the [Pt(mnt)2]- moieties is important for interchain interactions.

The M s value at 7 T is smaller than the expected value of M s (=gS eff, where g = 2.0) of 2 due to a contribution of the strong anisotropy of [Ru2 II,III]+ (D ~ 60 cm-1 with S = 3/2).
