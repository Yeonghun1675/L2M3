A white precipitate formed immediately. Ethanol (2 mL) was added to the precipitate. After 10 min of heating in an oil bath at 60 \u00b0C, a homogeneous solution was observed. The solution was cooled to room temperature overnight. Subsequent evaporation of ethanol with the screw cap loosely attached produced colorless plates after 2 days. The X-ray powder diffraction data taken on the bulk sample indicate that the primary product of this procedure is 4 as major peaks in the powder data correspond to the peaks calculated from the solved single crystal structure.
