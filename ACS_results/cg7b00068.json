By using such a ligand, a novel multifunctional metal-organic framework Zn-TCPP has been successfully constructed. The cross-linkage of dinuclear Zn2(COO)4 clusters and organic TCPP4- ligands results in the three-dimensional channel structure of Zn-TCPP, which has a four connected lvt topology with the point symbol of {42.84}. Zn-TCPP not only displays bright blue luminescence arising from the matrix coordination-induced emission effect of the TCPP4- ligand, but also exhibits effective detection for picric acid and Fe3+ ions. In addition, the activated Zn-TCPP possesses a highly porous framework with a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of 984 m2 g-1 and CO2 adsorption capacity up to 135 cm3 g-1 at 273 K and 732 mmHg. This work represents a successful example of constructing metal-organic frameworks with desired functions based on the designed organic ligand.\n\nIn this paper, a new tetraphenylpyrazine-based tetracarboxylic ligand 2,3,5,6-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)pyrazine (H4TCPP, ) has been designed and synthesized based on the following reasons. First, H4TCPP possesses a rigid skeleton similar to H4BTTB and can be easily synthesized from methyl 4-formylbenzoate. Second, there are two N atoms within the pyrazine core, which is propitious to enhance the adsorption ability for CO2 and the sensing selectivity for analytes. Finally and most importantly, the AIE effect of H4TCPP will endow MOFs with interesting luminescent properties. By using this ligand, a new multifunctional Zn-TCPP MOF with lvt topology has been successfully constructed. The activated Zn-TCPP possesses high CO2 adsorption capacity up to 135 cm3 g-1 at 273 K and 732 mmHg. Zn-TCPP displays bright blue luminescence benefiting from the matrix coordination-induced emission effect of the TCPP4- ligand, which can be used as a sensor to detect picric acid (PA) and Fe3+ ions.\n\nCrystal Structure of Zn-TCPP \n\nSingle-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that Zn-TCPP crystallizes in an orthorhombic space group of Imma. As shown in , its framework is composed of paddlewheel dinuclear Zn2(COO)4 clusters and organic TCPP4- ligands which can be simplified as a pair of 4-c nodes (a). Each Zn2(COO)4 cluster is linked by four organic ligands, and the axial positions of the cluster are coordinated by two DMF molecules (b), which could be removed to form unsaturated open metal sites. Each organic ligand is linked by four Zn2(COO)4 clusters. The connection of Zn2(COO)4 clusters and organic ligands constructs a highly porous framework with interconnected 3D channels along the [001], [010], and [100] directions (c,d and S2). It should be noted that these channels are partially blocked by the coordinated DMF molecules. Calculation by PLATON reveals that the free space per unit cell is approximately 4669.2 \u00c53 upon removal of the guest molecules, corresponding to 68.0% of the crystal volume (6864.8 \u00c53).\n\nGas Adsorption Property\n\nInspired by the large void volume and high thermal stability of Zn-TCPP, the permanent porosity of activated Zn-TCPP has been explored by using low-pressure N2 adsorption-desorption at 77 K. a and Table S3 shows the N2 sorption isotherm and porous properties of the activated Zn-TCPP. According to the IUPAC classification, it exhibits Type I nitrogen gas sorption isotherm with type IV character at higher relative pressure that may be caused in the activation process. The calculated Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area is of 984 m2 g-1. The pore size distribution of activated Zn-TCPP is calculated by using nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT). The result indicates that there are three main pores centered at 0.84, 1.56, and 1.84 nm, respectively (a inset and S2). Furthermore, the CO2 adsorption property of Zn-TCPP has been investigated. The adsorption amounts of CO2 reach 135 and 101 cm3 g-1 at 273 and 298 K under 732 mmHg, respectively (b), which is comparable to the value of Zn-BTTB (128 cm3 g-1 at 273 K and 1 atm). The isosteric heat (Q st) of adsorption for Zn-TCPP has been calculated by fitting the CO2 adsorption isotherms measured at 273 and 298 K to the virial equation (Figure S8). At zero-coverage, the Q st of CO2 for Zn-TCPP is 19.8 kJ mol-1 (Figure S9).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "Zn-TCPP", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "Zn2(COO)4-TCPP4-"}, "topology": [{"value": "lvt", "condition": "point symbol of {42.84}"}], "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "N2", "value": "984", "unit": "m2 g-1", "condition": ""}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "135", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "temperature": "273 K", "pressure": "732 mmHg", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "101", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "732 mmHg", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "", "unit": "", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "", "condition": "Type I nitrogen gas sorption isotherm with type IV character at higher relative pressure"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["topology", "surface_area", "gas_adsorption"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['topology', 'surface_area', 'gas_adsorption']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"Zn-TCPP\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"Zn2(COO)4-TCPP4-\"\n        },\n        \"topology\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"lvt\",\n                \"condition\": \"point symbol of {42.84}\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"surface area\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"BET\",\n                \"probe\": \"N2\",\n                \"value\": \"984\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2 g-1\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"CO2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"135\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"273 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"732 mmHg\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"CO2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"101\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"298 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"732 mmHg\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"N2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"\",\n                \"unit\": \"\",\n                \"temperature\": \"77 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"Type I nitrogen gas sorption isotherm with type IV character at higher relative pressure\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 8, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Design and Synthesis Diagram of H<sub>4</sub>TCPP Ligand</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cg-2017-00068b_0008.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Design and Synthesis Diagram of H4TCPP Ligand   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 20, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Description of <bold>Zn-TCPP</bold> structure: (a and b) dinuclear Zn SBU and organic\nligand viewed as a pair of 4-c nodes; (c) the 3D framework of <bold>Zn-TCPP</bold>; (d) space-filling model of channels along the [001]\ndirection; (e) polyhedral view of the <bold>lvt</bold> topology; (f)\nthe <bold>lvt</bold> topology.
