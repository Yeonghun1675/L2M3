RSMOF-1 crystallizes in the chiral hexagonal space group P6222 with a = 15.683(3) \u00c5 and c = 11.5526(16) \u00c5 (). The asymmetric unit contains an indium atom, two NH2-BDC linkers, and 1.5 guest water molecules. Each indium atom is coordinated to four NH2-BDC ligands through eight oxygen atoms from four carboxylate groups to form an InO8 polyhedron. The lengths of the In-O chelating bonds range from 2.250(8) to 2.271(10) \u00c5. Each InO8 polyhedron is connected to four other InO8 polyhedra via the linear NH2-BDC ligands, forming a twofold-interpenetrated 3D anionic coordination network with the \u03b2-quartz topology (). Extra protons reside on the amino and carboxylate groups to neutralize the framework (), while guest water molecules are trapped in the hexagonal helical nanochannels of the MOF material with an amine-functionalized wall running in the c direction (Figure ). The water molecules in the channel form a hydrogen-bonding network. The diameter of the nanochannel is 7.4 \u00c5. The total solvent-accessible volume of RSMOF-1 is 1310.9 \u00c53, as calculated using PLATON, and corresponds to ca. 53.3% of the unit cell volume (2460.8 \u00c53). The geometric parameters in the coordination sphere of RSMOF-1 are similar to those of its analogues. The phase purity of RSMOF-1 was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction, as shown in Figure c. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in a nitrogen flow revealed that RSMOF-1 is stable up to 160 \u00b0C ().\n\nInterestingly, as shown in the polarization-electric field (P-E) characteristics (Figure a), RSMOF-1 demonstrates polarization switching behavior with a saturation polarization (P s) of ~3.81 \u03bcC/cm2, a remnant polarization (P r) of 1.64 \u03bcC/cm2, and a coercive field (E c) of 1.65 kV/cm when the potential is scanned between \u00b16 V along the c axis. When the applied voltage maximum is decreased from \u00b16 to \u00b14 V, both the saturated and remnant polarizations as well as the coercive field decrease accordingly. With a decrease in the frequency of the ac electric field applied to the single crystal, the saturated polarization of the P-E loops increases while the coercivity decreases accordingly (Figure b). The polarization of RSMOF-1 also shows thickness-independent characteristics (Figure c). Moreover, the dielectric constant-temperature (\u03b5-T) characteristics exhibit a frequency-dependent broad band over the wide temperature range from 17 to 183 \u00b0C (Figure d), wherein the dielectric constant maxima correspond to the order-disorder (or paraelectric-ferroelectric) transition of a ferroelectric material. Such a transition cannot be observed in electrets or leaky dielectrics, therefore suggesting that the single crystal of RSMOF-1 is ferroelectric in nature. Similar ferroelectricity has also been demonstrated in other systems containing guest water molecules in porous materials and is ascribed to the alignment of the hydrogen-bonding-related dipoles (see detailed discussion below). As the frequency is increased from 1 kHz to 1 MHz, the dielectric constant maximum decreases from 243 to 16 while the transition temperature shifts from 130 to 160 \u00b0C, thus implying that RSMOF-1 behaves as a relaxor ferroelectric.
