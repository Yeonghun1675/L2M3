Second, the apical positions on the Pd atom in the crystal are blocked by the \u03c0-stacking ligand 2 (Figure S7, ), though the facile slip/slide motion of the triphenylene moiety, observed in our previous studies, may allow the formation of Pd(IV) species. Third, even though a Pd(IV) species is formed during the reaction, it must have sufficient lifetime; otherwise, it cannot be detected by our X-ray crystallography technique. Therefore, the best interpretation of our results presented here is that the Pd(IV)/Pd(II) mechanism is not exclusive and a Pd(II)/Pd(0) mechanism can also account for Pd-mediated bromination.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 14, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Nevertheless,\ncrystallography-based mechanistic studies within\ncrystalline flasks provide important and significant advantages compared\nto conventional solution-state reactive intermediate structural investigations.\nFirst, the isolation of each individual, often unstable species is\nnot necessary because the structure of the reactive intermediate can\nbe determined when severe disorder of the intermediate is not observed.\nSecond, the reaction can be either completely frozen or drastically\nslowed down at any stage of the reaction by simply cooling the crystal,\nand thus data collection at various points of the reaction can be\ndone.
