The structure of Cu[Ni(pdt)2] () has been previously reported and consists of sulfur-coordinated square planar nickel(II) pyrazine-2,3-dithiolate units linked by nitrogen-coordinated square planar copper(II) centers in a three-dimensional lattice. The resulting framework features square channels with edge dimensions defined by the Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu separation of 6.8132(10) \u00c5 and walls that are lined by the [Ni(pdt)2]2- complexes. While the structure is anisotropic, significant conductivity along any of the three crystallographic axes may be expected, in view of the similarity in metal coordination environments and connectivity.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "Cu[Ni(pdt)2]", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "Cu[Ni(pdt)2]"}, "surface area": [{"type": "Langmuir", "probe": "", "value": "426", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}]}]]], "include_properties": ["surface_area"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['surface_area']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[{\"meta\":{\"name\":\"Cu[Ni(pdt)2]\", \"symbol\":\"\", \"chemical formula\":\"Cu[Ni(pdt)2]\"}, \"surface area\": [{\"type\": \"Langmuir\", \"probe\": \"\", \"value\": \"426\", \"unit\": \"m2/g\", \"condition\": \"\"}]}]\n```"}}, {"idx": 39, "type": "table", "classification": ["Property"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Critical Adsorption and Chemiresistive\nParameters<xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"tbl1-fn1\"></xref>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"5\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col5\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">adsorbate</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">Q</italic>\n<sub>ads</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\u0394\u03c3/\u03c3<sub>0</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">S</italic>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">C</italic>\n<sub>p</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>acetylene</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.869<xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"t1fn1\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.115<xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"t1fn1\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.153(9)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>43.93</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>ethylene</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.781</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.144</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.172(9)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>43.56</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>ethane</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.547</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.158</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.311(12)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>52.63</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>propylene</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.561</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.311</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.63(5)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>63.89</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>propane</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.499</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.342</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.80(8)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>73.51</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">cis</italic>-2-butene</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.591</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.197</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.58(4)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>78.91</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n<table-wrap-foot>\n<fn id=\"tbl1-fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>Adsorption capacity, <italic toggle=\"yes\">Q</italic>\n<sub>ads</sub>, is reported in units of moles adsorbate\nper mole Cu\u00ad[Ni\u00ad(pdt)<sub>2</sub>].
