The asymmetric unit of PNU-22 consists of one molecule each of mono and completely deprotonated H2stdb (Hstdb and stdb), one molecule each of adeninate (Ade) in anionic and zwitterionic (8H-Ade) forms, along with two crystallographically independent Cd1 and Cd2 metal ions. In the 3D network, both metal ions adopted different coordination geometries: pentacoordinated Cd1 holds a distorted trigonal bipyramidal, and hexacoordinated Cd2 adopted a distorted octahedral geometry (b & Figure S2). The distorted trigonal bipyramidal coordination of Cd1 is provided by carboxylate oxygen atoms (O1, O2, and O5) from three different dicarboxylates and imidazole nitrogen atoms (N1 and N6) from two heterocycles, while the distorted octahedral N3O3 coordination for Cd2 is governed by carboxylate oxygen atoms (O5, O6, and O7) from two independent dicarboxylates, and imidazole nitrogen atoms (N2, N7 and N10) from two different heterocycles. Cadmium metal centers are linked by an anionic form of adenine, through the deprotonation of an imidazole nitrogen (Ade), and the neutral form (8H-Ade) by migration of hydrogen with formal opposite charges on N7 and N8. As depicted in Figure S2, Ade is involved in a \u03bc2-type coordination through the imidazole nitrogen atoms (N1 and N6) linking the adjacent Cd1 and Cd2, while 8H-Ade is making a \u03bc3-type coordination, which involves both imidazole nitrogen atoms (N2 and N7) and additional pyrimidine nitrogen (N10), generating a [Cd2(Ade)(8H-Ade)] n  zigzag loop motif. In the [Cd2(Ade)(8H-Ade)] n  motif, the Cd1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cd2 separation distance by the \u03bc2-bridged Ade is 6.381, and the \u03bc3-bridged 8H-Ade is 6.381 and 6.417 \u00c5, respectively; the closest Cd1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cd2 distance within the bilayer is 4.21 \u00c5 (b). The heterocyclic rings of the 8H-Ade moiety create a very strong \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 stacking interaction, which is reflected in the mean plane distance between them (3.19 \u00c5), in the formation of the bilayer. Two different stilbene dicarboxylic acid moieties (one with monoprotonated (Hstdb) and the other completely deprotonated (stdb)forms) are involved in bridging the [Cd2(Ade)(8H-Ade)] n  zigzag loops, in a bid to generate the two-dimensional network in PNU-22. Thus, [Cd2(Ade) 8H-Ade] n  loops oriented along b-axis are pillared by a completely deprotonated stdb along c-axis, from either side, involving the \u03bc3-\u03b72\u03b71:\u03b71\u03b70 mode of coordination between them, and Hstdb, as a hanging moiety, is involved in the \u03bc2-\u03b71\u03b71:\u03b70\u03b70 mode of coordination between Cd1 within the loop holding free terminal carboxylic acid. The overall network topology in PNU-22 can be described as a 3,4,5-connected three-nodal network with point symbols {4.62.83}{42.6}2{43.64.83} (). The hanging Hstdb moiety from the adjacent loops overlaps and is involved in the effective \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 stacking of the aromatic phenyl rings (3.67 A), and the free carboxylic acid (-COOH) creates O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5N and N-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen-bonding interactions with 8H-Ade [O4-H4\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5N9: H4\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5N9 = 1.93; N8-H8A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O3: H8A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O3 = 2.15] (c).

Prior to gas analysis, as-synthesized samples were activated at 80 \u00b0C for 8 h. The BET analysis by N2 gas adsorption at 77 K revealed that both MOFs are type-III nonporous materials, and external surface areas were found to be 2.56 m2 g-1 for PNU-21 and 1.5 m2 g-1 for PNU-22 (Figure S12a). CO2 adsorption of both MOFs reached the maximum uptakes up to 0.26 and 1.4 cm3 g-1 for PNU-21 and PNU-22 at 298 K, respectively (Figure S12b). Both MOFs showed good CO2 uptake compared to the N2 uptake probably due to the interaction between CO2 and free pyrimidine N atoms and -NH2 functional groups of MOF framework. Moreover, the acidic and basic sites in PNU-21 and PNU-22 were analyzed by NH3 and CO2 TPD analyses. The acid and base strength of these catalysts were described by three regions, namely, weak, medium, and strong acidic/basic sites, over the temperature ranges of 200-310, 310-500, and 500-1000 \u00b0C.

The effect of the reaction duration on the PNU-21/PNU-22-catalyzed reaction is depicted in d. ECH conversion gradually increased within 4 to 8 h, and the maximal conversion was obtained at 8 h. It was found that a reaction duration of 8 h and 0.4 MPa CO2 pressure are needed to attain the maximum ECH conversion, at 80 \u00b0C, in the presence of 0.6 mol % PNU-21/PNU-22 catalyst. Following the performances of these catalysts in the conversion of ECH to ECH carbonate, the efficiencies of both catalysts were further investigated over the other aliphatic cyclic/acyclic and aromatic epoxides. As shown in , both catalyst systems could convert all epoxides (propylene oxide, allyl glycidyl ether, and styrene oxide) to the corresponding cyclic carbonates effectively, under 0.4 MPa pressure, at 80 \u00b0C, and for 8 h, up to some extent; however, cyclohexene oxide exhibited very low conversion with negligible yields (11 and 8%; , entry 6). The catalytic performance, which was clearly observed for epichlorohydrin, propylene oxide, and allyl glycidyl ether with good conversion rates in the cycloaddition reactions with CO2, may be due to the small size of epoxides, which can easily access the active sites (acidic and basic sites) on the surface of the catalysts, whereas low conversions were observed for styrene oxide and cyclohexene oxide, due to their bulky and steric hindrance toward the active sites of PNU-21 and PNU-22. The results clearly demonstrate that both amine-functionalized catalysts exhibit efficient heterogeneous catalytic performances in the cycloaddition of a variety of epoxides under moderate reaction conditions (small amount of catalyst [72 mg (0.6 mol %)] and 0.4 MPa CO2 pressure). In all the catalytic reactions, the cyclic carbonate yields were estimated by GC, and the purities were confirmed by 1H NMR analyses of the isolated products (Supporting Information). Moreover, the efficiencies of the catalysts were investigated by a recyclability test for the conversion of ECH to ECH carbonate. Both catalysts exhibited good conversions and selectivities up to five cycles without loss of their structural stabilities, which was confirmed by the PXRD analysis ( & Figure S14a,b). Further, the heterogeneous nature of both catalysts was also confirmed by leaching test. The filtrates after five catalytic cycles showed a very small amount of Zn metal leaching of 0.065 mg mL-1 for PNU-21 and Cd leaching of 0.07 mg mL-1 for PNU-22, respectively.
