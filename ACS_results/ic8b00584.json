In both cases, the\ntransitions were of \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 in nature, but for the\nlinear case, the transition occurred from an upper energy level (where\nthe corresponding molecular orbital has 9 nodes) to the lower energy\nlevel (where the molecular orbital has 8 nodes). In the case of the\ntwisted molecule, the transition occurred from an energy level with\nthe molecular orbital having 9 nodes to a lower energy level where\nthe molecular orbital also had 9 nodes.

However, when the emission spectrum of 1a was recorded at the same excitation wavelength, there was a red shift of the emission wavelength to 525 nm (a). It is known that OPE systems show a change in the emission color based on the degree of twisting of the central phenyl ring, i.e., ligand conformation. Previous reports suggest that a large bathochromic shift occurs when the central phenyl ring is twisted out-of-plane of the terminal phenyl rings. Excimer formation also leads to a bathochromic shift in the emission. So, to rule out one possibility over the other, we carried out lifetime measurements on 1 and 1a. The lifetimes of both 1 and 1a monitored at 488 nm and excited at 405 nm revealed minimal changes. 1 had an excited-state lifetime of 1.6 ns, whereas 1a revealed a lifetime of 1.8 ns (Figure S14). These ruled out any possibility of excimer formation. Additionally, there was a minimal change of 2 nm in the UV spectra of 1 and 1a, suggesting no ground-state interaction (Figure S13). Thus, the bathochromic shift in 1a may be due to the twisting of OPE chains. To gain more insight into this phenomenon, theoretical modeling was carried out. The central benzene ring of 1 was rotated by 20\u00b0 to check the effect of the molecular plane rotation on the emission spectra of the system. It was found that the emission spectra of the rotated system was red-shifted by 44.8 nm, with peaks at 447.6 nm for the twisted system and 402.8 nm for the linear system (c). To find the reason, we further plotted the wave functions corresponding to these transitions and saw that, in the rotated system, the nature of the orbital overlap changed, leading to a red shift of the spectra. In both cases, the transitions were of \u03c0-\u03c0 in nature, but for the linear case, the transition occurred from an upper energy level (where the corresponding molecular orbital has 9 nodes) to the lower energy level (where the molecular orbital has 8 nodes). In the case of the twisted molecule, the transition occurred from an energy level with the molecular orbital having 9 nodes to a lower energy level where the molecular orbital also had 9 nodes. This leads to a lower energy gap or higher wavelength transition for the twisted system (d). Visual observations under normal and UV light for 1 and 1a also corroborated the red shift in emission (b).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 11, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig2\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<p>PL plots: (a) experimental for <bold>1</bold>, <bold>1a</bold>, and DMF-exposed <bold>1a</bold>; (c) theoretical\nfor <bold>1</bold> (black) and <bold>1a</bold> (red).
