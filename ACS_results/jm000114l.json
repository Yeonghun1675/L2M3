The present crystal structure determination provides experimental evidence that the MTX molecule does not prefer one conformation only but may rotate about many single bonds including those linking the pteridine ring to the rest of the molecule. The specific observed MTX conformations in this crystal form may of course be influenced to some extent by crystal packing forces. However, we emphasize that two differing conformations in the same crystal provide direct experimental proof that such distinctly different orientations of the pteridine ring and other parts of the MTX molecule are indeed physically possible and that rotations about most of the single bonds within the MTX molecule (to achieve the two observed conformations) are allowed.
