The presence of methyl groups in the pyrazolyl rings leads to the formation of coordination polymers. The formation of a homochiral helix (2) that exhibits spontaneous resolution was also observed. Helices of M-chirality were found in the monocrystal used for the X-ray structure determination and both enantiomers were observed from solid-state circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy applied to bunches of crystals. This reveals that locally, one enantiomer is formed in excess, possibly even exclusively, and suggests that growth of single colonies of homochiral crystals starting from single nucleation points may occur. The homochiral motif is stable even upon removal of guest solvent molecules. Significantly, this chiral architecture is generated from simple and inexpensive achiral building blocks.
