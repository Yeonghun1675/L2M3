Benzene, toluene, and ethanol each underwent rapid uptake at low pressure, leading to saturation below p/p 0 = 0.2, indicative of favorable host-guest interactions in all cases. The internal pore surfaces of PCM-16 are comprised primarily of aromatic rings, so it is not difficult to understand why the aromatic vapors would be easily adsorbed via \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions. Polar species such as ethanol most likely form hydrogen-bonded interactions with the charged moieties (Dy-carboxylates in this instance). The highest vapor uptake in PCM-16 was observed for benzene (34.8 wt % or 10.5 molecules per unit cell;  Figure S17). Toluene showed a lower total uptake, as expected due to the larger adsorbate size (25.2 wt %, kinetic diameter = 5.9 \u00c5; 6.5 molecules per unit cell; Figure , orange triangles). While there are no examples of analogous vapor adsorption studies in other Ln-based porous coordination polymers, the present data can be contrasted against similar measurements on d-metal-based polymers, such as Ni(bpb) (bpb = 1,4-bis(4-tetrazolyl)benzene) which exhibited a benzene uptake of 5.8 mmol g-1, corresponding to 45.3 wt % under comparable conditions. The higher wt % uptake observed in the latter case is to be expected, since the density of the Ni-based material is significantly lower than the Dy-based PCM-16.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']"}}, {"idx": 23, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig3\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Observed adsorption\u2013desorption\nisotherms for benzene, toluene,\nand ethanol vapors in PCM-16 at 298 K.

PCM-16 also adsorbs 2.7 wt % H2 and 65.1 wt % O2 at 77 K and 0.97 bar. The adsorption-desorption behavior of a series of organic vapors has been studied in PCM-16 to probe the nature of certain host-guest interactions in the pores. Aromatic and polar guest species showed high uptakes and marked adsorption/desorption hysteresis, while aliphatic vapors were less easily adsorbed. The surface area of PCM-16 could be increased significantly (to 1814 m2 g-1) via exchange of Me2NH2 + cations in the pores with smaller NH4 + groups.\n\nPCM-16 is based on Dy(III) and phsosphine oxide. It has a CO2 BET surface area of 1511 m2 g-1 and adsorbs aromatic, aliphatic, and polar organic vapors.\n\nIntroduction\n\nPorous coordination materials that incorporate esoteric organic substituents are currently of great interest because they may induce particular host-guest selectivity. For example,  inclusion of polar or charged organic groups in a coordination polymer may improve the adsorption enthalpy and/or  spatial orientation of certain polarizable guest adsorbates such as CO2. \n\nCrystal Data for PCM-16\n\nC21.5H12.5DyO8P; MW = 592.29, monoclinic, space group P2/c, a = 14.537(3) \u00c5, b = 10.492(2) \u00c5, c = 23.403(5) \u00c5, \u03b2 = 107.32(3)\u00b0, V = 3407.8(12) \u00c53, Z = 4, \u03c1 = 1.154 g cm-3, \u03bc(Mo K\u03b1) = 2.268 mm-1, R 1 = 0.057, 49072 measured reflections (5990 independent reflections, I > 2\u03c3(I)), wR 2 = 0.146 (all data), R int = 0.124, GoF = 1.03; CCDC 883819.\n\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of a crystalline sample of PCM-16 showed a continual mass loss of 21.1 wt % in the range 25-200 \u00b0C, which, supported by microanalytical data, corresponds closely to the calculated value for 3 dmf and 3 H2O molecules per formula unit (20.0 wt %) ( Figure S3). The fully desolvated material remained stable up to 440 \u00b0C. In situ variable-temperature powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) of PCM-16 under vacuum (1 \u00d7 10-10 bar) confirmed retention of framework crystallinity at 150 \u00b0C. Above 200 \u00b0C and under vacuum, a phase transition was observed to a new crystalline phase that was stable up to 350 \u00b0C ( Figure S4). Although it was not possible to ascertain the absolute structure of this new phase via single-crystal X-ray diffraction, the original low-temperature PXRD pattern corresponding to PCM-16 was easily recovered by exposure of the material to humid air (see  Figure S5). On the basis of this observation, all subsequent textural measurements of PCM-16 were performed on crystalline samples that were activated below the phase transition temperature.\n\nPrimary assessment of the surface area of an activated sample of PCM-16 (150 \u00b0C, 1 \u00d7 10-10 bar, 12 h) using N2 and CO2 probe gases gave BET surface areas of 620 and 1511 m2 g-1, respectively (Figure ); the estimated CO2 micropore volume for PCM-16 was 0.83 cm3 g-1. The disparity in the observed BET surface areas suggested that PCM-16 has a significantly greater affinity for CO2 adsorption, as has been previously reported for other porous f-block coordination polymers. The measured surface area of PCM-16 surpasses the recently reported Tb(III)-based material (PCM-15) which  showed the highest CO2 surface area (1187 m2 g-1) reported to date for an f-block porous coordination polymer. The lower N2 BET surface area is similar to other important recent examples of Ln(III)-based porous coordination polymers, such as Tb(btc) (678 m2 g-1), the PCN-17 series (Er, 606 m2 g-1; Dy, 738 m2 g-1; Yb, 820 m2 g-1), or Tb(btb)(OH2) (730-930 m2 g-1). Due to the apparent preference of PCM-16 to adsorb CO2 over N2, the isosteric heat of adsorption of CO2 was derived from adsorption studies conducted at 278 and 298 K. Fitting of both isotherms to a virial-type equation gave an estimated value of 35.7 kJ mol-1 ( Figures S8 and  S14). Kaneko et al. previously reported a heat of adsorption for CO2 of 30.10 kJ mol-1 for Er2(pda)3. \n\nFollowing confirmation of the inherent porosity of PCM-16, adsorption experiments using alternative probe analytes were carried out on fresh, desolvated samples. H2 sorption studies at 77 K revealed rapid uptake kinetics and reversibility without hysteresis (Figure ; purple triangles). Total H2 uptake was 2.66 wt % at 77 K and p/p 0 = 1.0 (295.61 cm3 g-1, 26.60 mg g-1). This uptake is also significantly higher than the previously highest reported H2 uptake for a Ln(III)-based coordination polymer (1.96 wt %). The isosteric heat of adsorption of H2 in PCM-16 was estimated as 8.1 kJ mol-1 using data at 77 and 87 K (see  Figure S7 and Figure S13). Hong et al. previously reported a value of 7.8 kJ mol-1 for Gd(tctpo). O2 adsorption at 77 K showed a total uptake of 456 cm3 g-1 (65.1 wt % at 0.97 bar; Figure , red triangles). Total Ar uptake was measured as 254 cm3 g-1 (Figure , blue circles).\n\nA sample of PCM-16 was subjected to cation exchange using a saturated solution of NH4Cl in solvent of synthesis (see ), and the surface area of the resulting material was studied by CO2 sorption analysis in addition to other characterization studies. Thus, NH4-PCM-16 was prepared and activated at 150 \u00b0C and 1 \u00d7 10-10 bar for 12 h. Interestingly, the CO2 gas adsorption experiment at 196 K gave a BET surface area of 1814 m2 g-1 ( Figure S15), which is 17% higher than the as-synthesized PCM-16. Schro\u0308der et al.  previously showed that  replacement of Me2NH2 + by smaller Li+ cations enhanced the porosity of a MOF-type material by ca. 25%. Thus, it seems very likely in this instance that the observed increase of surface area was indeed due to  replacement of larger Me2NH2 + groups by smaller NH4 +. Successful exchange of cations inside PCM-16 using the method employed herein was confirmed by elemental and TGA analyses ( Figure S16).\n\nSelective vapor sorption at ambient temperature by highly porous coordination polymers is an interesting and largely unexplored potential application.

The higher wt % uptake observed in the latter case is to be expected, since the density of the Ni-based material is significantly lower than the Dy-based PCM-16.\n\nEthanol adsorption in PCM-16 exhibited an uptake of 28.8 wt % (15 molecules per unit cell). Strong hysteresis was observed for all three probe molecules, with marked stepped profiles in the desorption phase (Figure , open symbols). The largest pore openings in PCM-16 are significantly larger than the kinetic diameters of the adsorbates (toluene, 5.9 \u00c5; benzene, 5.8 \u00c5; ethanol, 4.5 \u00c5).

Most notably, however, the lack of any pronounced desorption hysteresis for the alkanes is consistent with the lack of strong host-guest interactions. Kinetic analysis of the aliphatic C6 adsorbates showed that although the total uptakes were similar, the sorption rate of n-hexane was much faster than for cyclohexane (Figure , inset), which may be an effect of the disparity in kinetic diameters (4.3, 6.0 \u00c5 respectively).
