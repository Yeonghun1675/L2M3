It is noted that the Pb(II) ion exhibits an unusual N1O2 coordination mode in R- and S-1, where two Schiff base nitrogen atoms are blocked by strong intramolecular O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5N hydrogen bonds with two phenolic protons and they are kept uncoordinated. Considering that unsaturated coordination of macrocyclic donors and the presence of two weak-coordinated nitrate anions in R-1 and S-1, NaOH is used as a base to remove the phenolic protons, destroy the intramolecular O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5N hydrogen bonds, eliminate two nitrate anions accordingly, and spare several coordination sites of the Pb(II) ion, which will make the rearrangement of coordination geometry possible. As a result, further self-assembly can be fulfilled and a pair of 1D ribbon coordination polymers (R-2 and S-2) has been successfully produced without adding additional bridging linkers, where two Schiff base nitrogen atoms are coordinated with the central Pb(II) ion instead of the original weakly coordinated tertiary nitrogen atom and two nitrates.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 15, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>In this work, we have demonstrated that a base-induced\nlinker-free macrocyclic self-assembly can be achieved just by adding\nNaOH as a base to remove the phenolic protons of metallomacrocyclic\nprecursors in the absence of any additional bridging linkers, thereby\nvarying the coordination geometry of metal centers and facilitating\nthe self-assembly process.
