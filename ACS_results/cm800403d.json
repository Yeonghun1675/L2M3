The solvent-accessible volumes, calculated using PLATON, are as high as 71.2% (PCN-10) and 71.9% (PCN-11) after being activated. The calculated density of structures after removal of solvent is 0.767 and 0.749 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. TGA of polycrystalline samples of PCN-10 and PCN-11 revealed similar thermal behavior (see ). Both samples showed that one discrete weight loss (about 36%) occurred at 25\u2013250 \u00b0C, corresponding to removal of three DMA molecules per formula unit (37% calculated), the subsequent loss of coordinated aqua ligands (about 4.3%) of the copper paddlewheel SBU occurring from 250 to 310 \u00b0C. The framework is stable up to 310 \u00b0C, beyond which decomposition of the structures takes place. Both of the activated samples readily maintain porosity and structural integrity in a dry environment.

To obtain the isotherms, blue-green block crystals of each MOF were soaked in methanol for 2 days to remove the DMA guest solvates. Afterward, the sample was soaked in dichloromethane for 3 days to remove methanol solvates. After decanting the extract, the sample was kept under a dynamic vacuum at room temperature overnight for activation, during which the crystal color shifted gradually to light blue. The aqua ligands on SBUs should remain in the framework at this stage. To remove the aqua ligands, samples were heated at 120 \u00b0C under a dynamic vacuum with the color of the sample shifting gradually to blue purple. Upon heating, PCN-11 retains its structure but PCN-10 partially decomposes upon activation (see ). The N<sub>2</sub> adsorption isotherms of the activated samples exhibit type-I sorption behavior (Figure ) with a Langmuir surface area of 1779 or 2442 m<sup>2</sup>/g, corresponding to a BET surface area of 1407 or 1931 m<sup>2</sup>/g and a total pore volume of 0.67 or 0.91 mL/g for PCN-10 or PCN-11, respectively. Because PCN-10 and PCN-11 are isostructural, one would expect that the activated samples of the two should have equal or similar surface areas. The significant reduction of surface area in PCN-10 is presumably due to the fact that an N\ue5fbN double bond is thermally less stable than a C\ue5fbC double bond.</p><p>The hydrogen sorption properties of PCN-10 and PCN-11 are shown in Figure . Neither sample shows evidence for saturation at 1 atm. In addition, the absence of adsorption\u2013desorption hysteresis indicates that dihydrogen is reversibly adsorbed by PCN-10 and PCN-11. At 760 Torr and 77 K, PCN-10 adsorbs 2.34 wt % hydrogen (18.0 g/L), while PCN-11 adsorbs 2.55 wt % hydrogen (19.1 g/L). These hydrogen uptakes are among the highest reported for MOF materials. The difference between the hydrogen uptakes of PCN-10 and PCN-11 is consistent with their corresponding surface areas, albeit at low coverage (less than 1.5 wt %), the small difference in uptake can be ascribed to the variation in the strength of interaction between the two different linkers and dihydrogen molecules, implying that the N\ue5fbN double bond has higher H<sub>2</sub> affinity than that of the C\ue5fbC double bond, consistent with a theoretical calculation.\n</p><title>High Pressure Hydrogen Sorption</title><p>Volumetric capacity is a significant parameter when comparing different storage materials. As shown in Figure , the maximum hydrogen adsorption of PCN-10 and PCN-11 is 52.5 (6.84 wt %) and 59.1 g/L (7.89 wt %) at 30 K, 3.5 bar, respectively. When temperature increases, the excess volumetric (gravimetric) adsorption in PCN-10 is 32.2 g/L (4.20 wt %) at 45 bar and 77 K and the total uptake is 39.2 g/L (5.23 wt %). Consistent with the trend shown in the low-pressure adsorption studies, the excess volumetric (gravimetric) adsorption of PCN-11 at 45 bar and 77 K is 37.8 g/L (5.04 wt %) and the total uptake reaches 44.7 g/L (5.97 wt %).

The relatively high volumetric storage density of PCN-11, compared to its moderate gravimetric uptake, can be attributed to its higher density (0.749 g/cm<sup>3</sup>), compared to superlight MOFs such as MOF-5 (0.593 g/cm) and MOF-177 (0.477 g/cm<sup>3</sup>). However, at 300 K, the excess hydrogen uptakes of both PCN-10 and PCN-11 can only reach 0.25% and 0.34% at 45 bar, respectively, although the uptake may still increase if the pressure increases. The task of increasing the hydrogen affinity of MOFs at room temperature remains a challenge.</p><title>High Pressure Methane Sorption</title><p>To evaluate the methane-sorption properties of PCN-11, methane isotherms were measured in the pressure range of 0\u201360 bar at a variety of temperatures.
