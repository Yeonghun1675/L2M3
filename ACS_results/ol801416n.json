The anionic compound [NBu4]2 presents the typical cyanine-like absorption spectrum with a sharp transition featuring an exceptional extinction coefficient (>300000 L/mol/cm) located in the infrared (900 nm) and red-shifted by 110 nm compared to 1[PF6]. The emission band (936 nm) follows the same trend. It is worth noting that the strong red-shifts of the absorption and emission bands for [NBu4]2 have been achieved without any chain-length modulation and that this chromophore conserves an excellent thermal stability (Td10 = 260 \u00b0C) which is of prime importance for further applications. In addition, as already observed for cationic cyanine dyes, substitution of the central chloride atom by amino moieties ([NBu4]3) results in a profound blue shift of the absorption band but has only little influence on the emission. As underlined by Peng and co-workers, amino-substituted cyanines present a larger Stokes shift which is a great advantage for bioimaging applications.
