In particular, the photophysical properties of coordination polymer gels such as emission and absorption have been controlled with metal ions including alkali-earth and transition-metal ions. Among these, Co2+ coordination polymer gels have been demonstrated to exhibit thermochromic properties involving red or blue color changes with temperature that parallel the interchange between octahedral and tetrahedral structural forms. Indeed, such color changes for Co2+ upon a change of the coordination geometry are often quite sensitive to the temperature, anion, and ligand concentration. For example, Kimizuka and co-workers reported color changes for lipophilic Co2+ triazole complexes in both gel and solution states whose reversibilities were temperature-dependent. These workers also reported that the blue color of the Co2+ complex is due to the tetrahedral (T  d ) structure in the gel state, whereas the red color of the Co2+ complex corresponds to the octahedral (O  h ) structure.

However, there has been no previous study of the role of the coordination structure influencing the color changes of Co2+ complexes with triazole- or tetrazole-based ligands.

However, very interestingly, the fourth cobalt(II) atom adopts a distorted tetrahedral geometry, being bound to three carboxylate oxygen atoms from three different L 4- in a monodentate manner. The coordination sphere of this metal center is completed by a water molecule (Figure B). Importantly, the presence of the cobalt(II) atom with tetrahedral geometry clearly distinguishes 4 from 3 and is very likely the cause of the observed change in color from red for 3 to blue for 4. One L 4- ligand is linked to four different cobalt(II) atoms connected to three different L 4- ligands via Co-O(carboxylate) coordination bonds in a monodentate manner to afford the 3D motif (Figure S3 in the ). The powder XRD patterns of the single crystals 3 and 4 are also compared to those for G1 and G2 (Figure S4 in the ). The powder XRD pattern ranging from \u03b8 = 13 to 50\u00b0 in single crystal 3 is different from that of single crystal 4 (Figure S4C in the ). The pattern at the [211] face obtained from G1, G2, and red and blue crystals 3 and 4 was the highest, indicating that these gels and crystals may be oriented into the [211] face. Furthermore, the bonding lengths of both the [211] and [220] faces of G1 are the same as those of the red crsytal 3. Among the four materials, the pattern at the [211] face obtained from the blue crsytal 4 was the highest, indicating that the blue crystal 4 may be well oriented into the [211] face. On the other hand, the powder XRD patterns of the red and blue single crystals of Co2+ complexes are quite similar to those obtained for G1 and G2, indicating that the single-crystal structures of Co2+ complexes are similar to those of G1 and G2.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 24, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>To\nprobe the mechanism of the change from an octahedral structure to\na tetrahedral structure of Co<sup>2+</sup>, the introduction of COCl<sub>2</sub> gas to a red single crystal of the Co<sup>2+</sup> complex\nwas performed.

This is clear evidence for the coordination geometry of single\ncrystal <bold>4</bold>, in which one of the octahedral structure was\nchanged into the tetrahedral structure. In addition, elemental compositions\nof the blue powder obtained by the introduction of COCl<sub>2</sub> gas were analyzed by SEM with EDX equipment (Figure S6 in the ). The EDX spectrum of the blue powder of Co<sup>2+</sup> shows carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, sodium, and cobalt components.\nThese studies clearly indicated that conversion of the red crystal\nwith the octahedral structure into a blue color upon the introduction\nof COCl<sub>2</sub> gas was due to the removal of three DMF molecules\npresumably by an intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interaction between\nDMF and HCl. In addition, elemental analysis and ICP of the blue-colored\npowders obtained with COCl<sub>2</sub> gas demonstrated an elemental\ncontent profile of 52.33% for C, 5.35% for H, 1.08% for N, 10.95%\nfor S, 2.55% for Na, and 6.63% for Co<sup>2+</sup>. These results\nare in excellent agreement with the calculated data: C, 52.20%; H,\n5.47%; N, 1.19%; S, 10.93%; O, 20.90%; Na, 2.61%; Co<sup>2+</sup>,\n6.70%. Therefore, the geometric change of a thiacalix[4]arene supramolecular\ngel with VGCl in this work would occur by the following steps. In\nthe step 1, Co<sup>2+</sup> forms the octahedral structure, having\nthree DMF and three water molecules. In the first step, which involves\noctahedral cobalt gels, the aqueous pH condition is adjusted to neutral\n(pH = 7.0). In the step 2, COCl<sub>2</sub> gas is hydrolyzed to HCl\nin the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O. Then, HCl molecules remove three\nDMF molecules in the Co<sup>2+</sup> complex by forming an intermolecular\nhydrogen-bonding interaction, turning to the tetrahedral structure\nin the step 3. Once again, HCl produced by hydrolysis of COCl<sub>2</sub> (eq ) forms an intermolecular hydrogen-bonding\ninteraction with DMF molecules. It is known that the oxygen atom of\nDMF interacts with the hydrogen atom of HCl. Therefore, the HCl molecule cleaves the bond between Co<sup>2+</sup> and DMF because the coordination bond between Co<sup>2+</sup> and\nDMF is comparatively weaker than the intermolecular hydrogen bond\nbetween HCl and DMF.<disp-formula id=\"eq1\">\n<label>1</label>\n<mml:math display=\"block\">\n<mml:mn>3</mml:mn>\n<mml:mi
