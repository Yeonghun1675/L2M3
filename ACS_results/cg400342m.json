In the case of RO-MOF(c-f), L1(c-f) ligands underwent acid-induced ether cleavage upon exposure to D2SO4, most likely due to the formation of stable carbocations; however, the remaining pyridyl protons related to ligands L1(c-f) showed stoichiometric agreement with those for L2.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 14, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Crystallography-derived stick representations\nof the unit cells\nof <bold>RO-MOFa</bold> and <bold>RO-MOFc</bold> (yellow polyhedral\n= Zn, blue = N, red = O, gray = C).
