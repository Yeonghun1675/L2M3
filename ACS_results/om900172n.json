Anal. for C70.5H102N2Al2O6Sm found (calcd): C 66.21 (66.26), H 7.98 (8.05), N 2.15 (2.19).\n\nPreparation of Sm{\u03bc[6,6'methylenebis(2tertbutyl4methylphenol)]2\u03bcAlMe2}{THF}2{C6 H14}0.5 (5)\n\nA solution of diazobenzene (0.059 g, 0.32 mmol) in toluene (4 mL) was added dropwise to a solution of 3 (0.410 g, 0.65 mmol) in toluene (10 mL). An immediate color change from the initial deep red was observed upon mixing, and stirring was continued for 3 h at room temperature. After that time a significant amount of colorless solid separated from the mother liquor. The mother liquor was discarded, and the colorless solid was redissolved in THF (5 mL). A very small amount of insoluble material was eliminated by centrifugation. The resulting clear solution was layered with hexane (10 mL) and left undisturbed at room temperature for three days. The colorless crystalline 5 thus separated was washed with cold hexane (-35 \u00b0C) and dried under an N2 atmosphere (0.290 g, 0.27 mmol 42%). Upon drying in vacuo, crystals rapidly deteriorated with the formation of a white powdery material. Anal. for a dried sample of C56H82AlO6Sm found (calcd): C 65.31 (65.39), H 7.97 (8.04). 1H NMR (500 MHz, THFd 8, 20 \u00b0C): \u03b4 6.94(4H, ArH), 6.79(4H, ArH), 4.02(2H, -CH 2-), 3.53(8H, THF), 3.25(2H, -CH 2-), 2.16(6H, ArCH 3), 2.03(6 H, ArCH 3), 1.73(8H, THF), 1.36(36H, C(CH 3)3), -0.31(3H, AlCH 3), -0.68(3H, AlCH 3).\n\nPreparation {Sm\u03bc[6,6'methylenebis(2tertbutyl4methylphenol)][\u03bcMe2AlMe2]}2 (6)\n\nA solution of Sm[N(SiMe3)2]3 (0.200 g, 0.32 mmol) in toluene (10 mL) was treated with a solution of AlMe3 in toluene (0.97 mL, 2.0 M, 1.94 mmol) and stirred for 2 h at room temperature. A solution of bisphenol (0.108 g, 0.32 mmol) in toluene (7 mL) was then added dropwise to the reaction mixture. A vigorous gas evolution and significant color change from pale yellow to bright orange were observed upon mixing, and the reaction mixture was stirred for an additional 3 h. The solution was concentrated to 4 mL and allowed to cool. Upon cooling, a large amount of bright orange, highly crystalline 6 separated, which was washed with cold toluene (-35 \u00b0C) and dried in vacuo (0.156 g, 0.27 mmol, 84%). Anal. for C54H84Al2O4Sm2 found (calcd): C 56.22 (56.30), H 7.07 (7.35). 1H NMR (500 MHz, toluened 8, 40 \u00b0C): \u03b4 7.27(2H, ArH), 7.15(2H, ArH), 4.22(1H, -CH 2-), 3.61(1H, -CH 2-), 2.71(3H, ArCH 3), 2.28(3H, ArCH 3), 1.06(9H, -C(CH 3)3), 0.44(9H, -C(CH 3)3), -1.88(6H, AlCH 3), -3.96(6H, AlCH 3).\n\nPreparation of Sm{\u03bc[6,6'methylenebis(2tertbutyl4methylphenoxy)]}2\u03bcAlMe2 (7)\n\nA solution of bisphenol (0.111 g, 0.33 mmol) in toluene (5 mL) was added to a solution of bright orange 6 (0.188 g, 0.33 mmol) in toluene (5 mL). Intense gas evolution and discoloration to pale yellow was observed upon mixing, and stirring was continued for an additional 3 h. The volume of the mixture was reduced to about 4 mL by evaporation, and the resulting solution was brought to the boiling point and allowed to cool undisturbed to room temperature. After 6 h, yellow prisms of 7 were formed, which were separated from the mother liquor and dried under an N2 atmosphere (0.248 g, 0.28 mmol, 85%). Anal. for C48H66AlO4Sm found (calcd): C 65.03 (65.19), H 7.41 (7.52). 1H NMR (500 MHz, benzened 6, 20 \u00b0C): \u03b4 10.58(2H, ArH), 9.86(2H, ArH), 8.13(2H, ArH), 8.12(2H, ArH), 4.92(1H, -CH 2-),
