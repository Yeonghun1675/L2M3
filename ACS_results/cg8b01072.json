Cu-O distances fall in the range from 1.933(3) to 2.033(5) \u00c5, while the Cu-N bond length is 2.094(4) \u00c5, also in accordance with the typical values. Each L2 ligand utilizes its two carboxyl groups to connect two paddlewheel SBUs to form dia topological structure with the point Schla\u0308fli symbol {66} calculated with TOPOS. The same two dia networks are further bound together via the Cu-N coordination bonds from triazole groups and paddlewheel SBUs in different single networks, and then the self-interpenetrating Flu MOF has been obtained with the point Schla\u0308fli symbol {4\u22c562}2{42\u22c567\u22c586} calculated with TOPOS (c,d). The irregular porosities are still retained in the final packing structure. The solvent accessible volume is calculated as 66.7% (9684.2 \u00c53/14524.0 \u00c53) by PLATON. \n\nPXRD and Thermal Stability of 1 and 2 \n\nThe purity of as-synthesized samples 1 and 2 has been confirmed by PXRD experiments and matches well with the simulations from the crystal data (). In order to explore the stability of 1 and 2, the samples of 1 and 2 were first immersed in deionized water at room temperature, separately. The PXRD pattern of the water-treated samples corresponds well with those of pristine samples, indicating that the structures of 1 and 2 are well-retained in water (). Furthermore, the PXRD of 1 and 2 in weak acidic and basic aqueous solutions revealed their different framework stabilities. After being treated with the HCl aqueous solutions (pH = 3, 5) or the NaOH aqueous solutions (pH = 9, 11) for 12 h at room temperature, the PXRD patterns of the samples still retain diffraction peaks of 1 (a), whereas the samples of 2 could only retain diffraction peaks in the HCl aqueous solutions (pH = 5) or the NaOH aqueous solutions (pH = 9) for 6 h at room temperature (b). As shown in , the thermogravimetry curve of 1 shows a slow weight loss of 32.4% from room temperature to 245 \u00b0C due to the escape of solvent molecules in 1. The main skeleton framework starts to decompose with an increase in temperature from 330 \u00b0C. TGA curve of 2 shows a continuous weight loss of 44.6% from room temperature to 250 \u00b0C, corresponding to the loss of solvent molecules in the lattice of 2 (). The structure can stable up to 310 \u00b0C, and then the rapid weight loss could be attributed to the collapse of the framework of 2.\n\nGas Sorption Properties\n\nThe high stabilities endow the potential for two self-interpenetrating MOFs as adsorption materials, which encourages us to further explore their adsorption capacities. The permanent porosities of 1 and 2 have been validated via N2 sorption isotherms at 77 K (a), which show typical Type-I adsorption isotherms for microporous materials, in accordance with the results of structural analysis. The activated samples of 1 adsorbs 246 cm3 g-1 N2 at low temperature, which gives the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Langmuir surface areas of 796 m2/g and 1054 m2/g, respectively. Comparably, the adsorption amount of 2 for N2 is 165 cm3 g-1 at low temperature, which gives the BET and Langmuir surface areas of 535 m2/g and 707 m2/g, respectively. Larger porous surface area of 1 was observed compared to 2, which is consistent with the results observed from the structural analysis. Furthermore, the C2H2 and CO2 uptake capacities of two self-interpenetrating MOFs were also measured (b). CO2 uptake capacities of 1 and 2 are 45.2 and 24.5 cm3 g-1 at 293 K and 1 atm, respectively. These amounts are not very large, which might be ascribed to the lack of open metal sites since the axial position of copper ions are occupied by nitrogen atoms. However, both of these MOFs exhibit the higher affinities toward C2H2 than CO2, with the amounts of 92.1 and 39.5 cm3 g-1, which exhibit the moderate adsorption C2H2/CO2 selectivity. The nitrogen-rich porous structures might be responsible for the moderate selectivity. In addition, the different capacity of C2H2 might be caused by the specific porous structures and surface in 1 and 2.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "1", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula":
