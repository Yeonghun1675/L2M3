Both methods are in good agreement and complement each other. For compound 2, TGA data indicate immediate release of crystallization water until 130 \u00b0C and then until 270 \u00b0C no mass loss occurs. The TD-PXRD patterns in the range from rt to 270 \u00b0C show slight shifts of diffraction peaks due to release of water from the rhombic channels. Above 270 \u00b0C, a sharp mass loss corresponding to Hpz-tr decomposition is observed as well as loss of sample crystallinity. Compound 3, which has no water molecules in the structure, shows higher thermal stability until 300 \u00b0C, as confirmed by the TG curve and TD-PXRD data. Complex 4 realizes a stepwise mass loss in the range from rt to 180 \u00b0C that corresponds to the elimination of six water molecules and also exhibits a slight shift of diffraction patterns in TD-PXRD. The decomposition process starts at 230 \u00b0C, followed by further water release taken from the OH- bridges. Thus, the thermal stability of compound 4 is apparently lower than those of complexes 2 and 3 (, Figures S27-S29).\n\nIn contrast, compound 4 shows a distinctly different \u03c7M T(T) plot () with strongly decreasing \u03c7M T values (rt \u03c7M T value of 0.95 cm3 K mol-1 per CuII 4 unit) but with a sharp increase below 20 K and a sharp turn with decreasing values below 10 K. Again, the higher temperature regime indicates strong antiferromagnetic interactions between the CuII centers, and at low temperature (<20 K) a long-range order of residual spin moments (e.g., from canted AF) is indicated. For the high-temperature region (200-300 K), an analogous fit as for 2 and 3 leads to the parameters g = 2.2 (fixed), J = -418(6) K (-291(4) cm-1). To confirm a possible phase transition at low temperature, the magnetization as a function of temperature under a weak magnetic field (10 G) was measured. This field-cooled (FC) magnetization obtained by cooling the sample under 10 G shows a rapid increase of the magnetization for temperatures below T c = 13 K (). When the field was switched off, a remnant magnetization remained at the same value, and it vanished upon warming above 13 K. The zero-field-cooled (ZFC) magnetization (cooling in zero field and warming up under 10 G) remains almost constant until T c and vanishes above 13 K. The field dependence of the magnetization at 1.9 and 20 K is shown in . At 1.9 K, it exhibits a hysteresis with a coercitive field of 600 G and a remnant magnetization of 660 cm3 G mol-1 (0.118 \u03bcB), whereas a linear dependence is observed above T c at 20 K. Accordingly, compound 4 shows a 3D magnetic order below T c with a net magnetization which may result from a spin canting or distinct magnitudes of the ordered moments on the four CuII sites.",
