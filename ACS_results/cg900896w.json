However, as reported by Murrie and co-workers, a Co\u2212O\u2212Co angle of 96\u221299\u00b0 leads to weak ferromagnetic coupling. Also, no possible exchange pathways between the Co1\u2212Co1\u2032 and Co2\u2212Co2\u2032 pairs exist. Thus, the magnetic structures of the metamagnetic <bold>2</bold> can be described as ferromagnetically coupled [Co<sub>2</sub>] units that form a zigzag chain linked by the triply bridging OH ligands. The coupling between [Co<sub>2</sub>] units along the chain is antiferromagnetic.</p>", "clean_text": "At 2 K, magnetization rises suddenly to a value of 1.1 \u03bcB at an applied DC field of 160 G, indicating onset of the weak ferromagnetic state. Saturation is never reached and the maximum magnetization value reached at 5 T is 1.6 \u03bcB. The absence of 3D order is further confirmed by the lack of an out-of-phase peak in the ac magnetic susceptibility, as well as lack of magnetization hysteresis. The crystal structure of 2 consists of 3D array of puckered chains of Co(II) ions along the crystallographic a axis that are bridged by the triply bridging OH and bridging oxygen donors from the carboxylate. The chains are linked by the carboxylates with interchain Co-Co distances of 7.5 \u00c5. Thus, magnetically 2 can be considered as weakly interacting infinite 1D chains. There are two crystallographically distinct Co(II) ions, Co1 and Co2. The Co1-OH-Co2 angles are 119.93\u00b0, with additional syn,syn-carboxylato bridges to afford antiferromagnetic superexchange pathways between these ions. The Co1-O-Co1' and Co2-O-Co2' are 98.75\u00b0 and 99.19\u00b0, respectively, giving rise to weak magnetic interaction between the metal pairs that could be weakly ferromagnetic. No reliable magneto-structural correlation for Co(II)-O complexes is available due to the complication of the large spin-orbit coupling of the hexacoordinated Co(II). However, as reported by Murrie and co-workers, a Co-O-Co angle of 96-99\u00b0 leads to weak ferromagnetic coupling. Also, no possible exchange pathways between the Co1-Co1' and Co2-Co2' pairs exist. Thus, the magnetic structures of the metamagnetic 2 can be described as ferromagnetically coupled [Co2] units that form a zigzag chain linked by the triply bridging OH ligands.
