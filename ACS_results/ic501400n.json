Below this temperature the \u03c7M T curve increases more rapidly, reaching a maximum of 27.2 cm3 K mol-1 at 12 K. At even lower temperatures \u03c7M T drops, which may be due to the effects of zero-field splitting and/or intermolecular antiferromagnetic interactions. According to the molecular structure of 3, only one unique exchange interaction pathway exists between neighboring chromium(II) ions (S = 2) and radical ligands (S = 1/2) (Figure , left). If we assume that this exchange interaction is ferromagnetic, a large spin ground state of S T = 4\u22c52 + 4\u22c51/2 = 10 should result. The expected \u03c7M T value is 55.0 cm3 K mol-1 at low temperatures, which is much higher than the experimentally observed value. The alternative case, i.e., antiferromagnetic interaction between chromium(II) ions and radical ligands, leads to S T = 4\u22c52 - 4\u22c51/2 = 6 and a theoretical \u03c7M T value of 21.0 cm3 K mol-1, which is closer to the experimental value. Since antiferromagnetic coupling between nonequivalent spin carriers (S = 2 and S = 1/2 in this case) leads to noncompensated magnetic moments that are ferromagnetically coupled (i.e., ferrimagnetic alignment), and since an exact model with eight spin carriers exceeds our present computational possibilities, for further preliminary analysis we assume an effective spin state (S eff = 3/2) as the result of antiferromagnetic coupling between a high-spin chromium(II) ion (S Cr = 2) and a ligand radical (S L = 1/2).

The solution was kept at room temperature for a couple of days to afford red crystals suitable for X-ray analysis. Yield: 0.064 g (68%).
