It has furthermore been shown that, depending on the exact reaction conditions, the silver centers can occupy different coordination sites and therefore offer excellent possibilities for linking the {Mo8} groups into a whole range of 1D and 2D supramolecular assemblies. The preferred primary binding sites of the cluster are two distinct square-planar arrangements of four terminal oxygen atoms ({O4}) with O-O distances between 3.0 and 3.2 \u00c5, see Figure . The two {O4} faces are arranged in a coparallel fashion and therefore allow the transition-metal-mediated assembly of multiple {Mo8} groups into linear supramolecular structures. The secondary binding sites are two sets of two terminal oxygen atoms with O-O distances of ca. 3.0 \u00c5, which act as bidentate chelating ligands and are arranged perpendicularly to the primary {O4} moieties, see Figure . This spatial orientation allows the extension of the structural growth from unidimensional chains into 2D gridlike nets.
