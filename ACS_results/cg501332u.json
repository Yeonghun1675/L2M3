The TG curve of 1 suggests that guest molecules (approximately 7 H2O and 1 DMF) are released from the framework in the temperature range of 30-200 \u00b0C (expt. 11.4 wt %, calcd. 11.5 wt %). To exchange the lattice solvent molecules, the as-prepared sample was soaked in chloroform for 2 days. The guest molecules in the pore were successfully replaced with chloroform, as confirmed by TG data. To obtain the desolvated sample, the CHCl3-exchanged sample was heated at 100 \u00b0C under vacuum for 3 h. Although the desolvated framework rapidly adsorbed water from the atmosphere, it was stable up to 260 \u00b0C (Figure S3a). We measured PXRD data of the as-prepared, CHCl3-exchanged, and desolvated samples (Figure S4, ). All major peaks of the experimental PXRD profiles of 1 match well with the simulated pattern, indicating that the original phase is maintained during the solvation and activation processes. The temperature-dependent PXRD data of 1 show that sharp and intense peaks are retained until 250 \u00b0C, suggesting the structural stability of the 3D compound in the given temperature range (Figure S5, ). The TG graph of 2 also reveals that the thermal stability of 1 is analogous to that of 2, which originates from the structural similarity (Figure S3b). The guest molecules (approximately 5 H2O and 2 DMF) in 2 are eliminated in the temperature range of 30-200 \u00b0C (expt. 13.1 wt %, calcd. 13.3 wt %). After desolvation, the framework of 2 remains intact, as corroborated by the PXRD data (Figure S4).\n\nGas Sorption\n\nN2 gas adsorption and desorption isotherms of 1 and 2 were measured at 77 K (Figure ). The Brunauer\ue5f8Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of 1 and 2 are similar, which are estimated as 472 m2 g-1 for 1 and 488 m2 g-1 for 2 from the N2 adsorption isotherms. The H2 sorption capacities of 1 and 2 reach 103 cm3 g-1 (0.92 wt %) and 110 cm3 g-1 (0.99 wt %), respectively, at 1 bar and 77 K (Figure S6, ). In the H2 sorption isotherms, no hysteresis upon adsorption or desorption is detected. An additional hydrogen isotherm at 87 K was collected to calculate the isosteric heat of adsorption by fitting with a virial-type equation (Figures S7 and S8, ). The adsorption enthalpy is -9.6 kJ mol-1 for 1 and -9.9 kJ mol-1 for 2 (Figures S9 and S10, ), which are in the range of some carboxylate-bridged MOFs. The CO2 adsorption isotherms of 1 and 2 were measured at different temperatures of 195, 273, and 298 K (Figures S11 and S12, ). Interestingly, a significant hysteresis is manifest in the adsorption isotherm at 195 K. The large hysteresis may pertain to the flexibility of the frameworks. Using the virial equation fitting parameters obtained from the adsorption data measured at 273 and 298 K, the isosteric heats of CO2 adsorption at zero coverage are estimated to be -21.5 kJ mol-1 for 1 and -24.3 kJ mol-1 for 2 (Figures S13-S16, ), which are similar to those of other MOFs.
