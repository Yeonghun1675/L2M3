The reaction mixture turned from cloudy to clear and then to cloudy during the reflux. After cooling to room temperature, 20 mL of diethyl ether was added, and the mixture was stirred for another 20 min. A white precipitate of the Boc-protected (  S,S  )-9 formed and was collected via filtration. Five milliliters of concentrated HCl (37 wt % in H2O) was used to dissolve this white powder, and the mixture was stirred for another hour. The acidic solution was then neutralized with sodium carbonate, and then to it was added 0.5 g of potassium hexafluorophosphate. The mixture stirred for 18 h to allow salt metathesis. The white precipitate that formed was filtered, and the filtrate was extracted with 50 mL of CH2Cl2 three times, and the extracts were combined with the precipitate. Evaporation of all volatiles under vacuum gave a white solid, which was then dissolved in a minimum amount of CH2Cl2.
