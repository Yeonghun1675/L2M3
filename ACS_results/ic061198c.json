A 1 M solution (0.9 mL) of (n-C4H9)4NOH in CH3OH (0.9 mmol) was added to a solution of 809 mg (0.9 mmol) of [(o-tolyl)2Bi(OTf)(hmpa)2] in 10 mL of CH2Cl2. A turbid solution formed, which was stirred for 2 h at room temperature and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated until a white precipitate began to form. After the addition of a minimum amount of CH2Cl2 to redissolve the precipitate, the clear solution was cooled to -30 \u00b0C. After a few days, a white precipitate had formed, which was filtered off and dried in vacuo to yield 0.262 mg (0.62 mmol, 69%) of 3. 1H NMR spectroscopic data revealed a contamination by small amounts of the condensation product [(o-tolyl)2BiOBi(o-tolyl)2], 2, which can be separated by recrystallization from CH2Cl2 at -30 \u00b0C. The first fraction of the crystallization is purer when 5 mL of MeOH are added to the initial solution of [(o-tolyl)2Bi(OTf)(hmpa)2] in CH2Cl2. Anal. Calcd for C15H17BiO: C, 42.66; H, 4.06.

Similar structural features are observed, for example, in II, where the O-Bi-O angle is 170.46(9)\u00b0, or in a series of bismuth halides ligated by organometallic complex fragments such as, for example, [BiX{Mo(CO)3Cp}2] (X = Cl or Br) with a Cl-Bi-Cl angle of 151.6(1)\u00b0 and a Br-Bi-Br angle of 148.2(1)\u00b0.

Compound 1 represents a rare example of a bismuthhydroxide compound, and it can be obtained in pure state from the reaction  of [(o-tolyl)2Bi(hmpa)2]SO3CF3 with NBu4OH/H2O in thf/water. Dissolved in dichloromethane, 1 immediately eliminates water to give [(o-tolyl)2BiOBi(o-tolyl)2], 2, which can be obtained on a preparative scale in this manner. If [(o-tolyl)2Bi(hmpa)2]SO3CF3 is reacted with NBu4OH/MeOH in dichloromethane, (o-tolyl)2BiOH undergoes methanolysis before condensation leading to the isolation of [(o-tolyl)2BiOMe] n , 3.
