In contrast to the organic constituents of MOFs, which are based on linkers that serve as preformed building units that remain largely unchanged during MOF synthesis, a major challenge is control of the metal-based components of MOFs. Recent efforts to target MOFs based on a specific discrete SBU rely on the presynthetic growth of metal clusters prior to linkage into an extended structure.
