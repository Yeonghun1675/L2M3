We have determined the surface area from a CO2 adsorption isotherm (surface area 55.81 m2/g). CO2 uptake of 1 is comparable to previously reported MOFs (, Table S3). It is important to mention that attractive materials for CO2 uptake include those that may possess a moderate CO2 adsorption but that show completely reversible isotherms.
