Although the aniline molecules as guests in the channel exhibit disorder around crystallographic 2-fold axes, it is clear that each of them is located in one of two clearly distinct sites within the channel (Figure a). One of these sites (site A) is situated between pairs of clusters that are face-on to each other, while the other site (site B) is between a pair of bridging cyanide ions. In the crystal structure refinement, site B was found to be only 50% occupied.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "porosity": [{"probe": "", "value": "29", "unit": "%", "condition": "of the total crystal volume"}, {"probe": "", "value": "618", "unit": "\u00c53", "condition": "per unit cell"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["porosity"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['porosity']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"porosity\": [\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"29\",\n                \"unit\": \"%\",\n                \"condition\": \"of the total crystal volume\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"618\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00c53\",\n                \"condition\": \"per unit cell\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 6, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Part of the polymeric structure of <bold>1a</bold> with only one set of atoms for the disordered cyanides shown.
