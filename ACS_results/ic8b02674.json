The room temperature \u03c7M T value of 1 is 14.2 cm3 mol-1 K-1, very close to 14.1 cm3 mol-1 K-1 expected for a free Dy3+ ion with the 6H15/2 ground-state multiplet. The analogous \u03c7M T values for 2 and 3 are 14.5 and 14.7 cm3 mol-1 K-1, respectively, which agree well with 14.5 cm3 mol-1 K-1 originating from the combined contributions of a noninteracting pair of Dy3+ and [MV(CN)8]3- (M = Mo, W) ions with S = 1/2 and g = 2.0. Upon cooling, \u03c7M T gradually decreases similarly in 1-3; thus, it can be ascribed to the crystal-field effect of the 6H15/2 multiplet, related to a thermal depopulation of its m  J  sublevels (a). However, below 50 K,  \u03c7M T  for 2 and 3 decrease faster than those for 1, reaching a deeper minimum of 8.6 cm3 mol-1 K-1 at 7 K, followed by a rapid increase of the signal below 5 K. In 1, \u03c7M T monotonically decreases in the whole T range. This indicates that 2 and 3 show antiferromagnetic coupling within M-CN-Dy linkages, leading to a ferrimagnetic spin chain, while the DyIII complexes in 1 are magnetically separated. Magnetization at 1.8 K for 1 reaches 5.0 \u03bcB at 50 kOe, which suggests that the ground-state doublet can be close to a  m  J  = \u00b115/2 state. Magnetization curves at 1.8 K for 2 and 3 grow faster than that for 1, which is in line with the presence of antiferromagnetic coupling.
