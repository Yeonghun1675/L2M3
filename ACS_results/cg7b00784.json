In the case of compound 2, its final product with a metal-to-ligand ratio of 2:1 and 1:1 is the same.

Therefore, they have not any other role in the preparation and final morphology of the mentioned complexes. Infrared spectroscopy and elemental analysis confirmed that these compounds are stable in air and atmospheric moisture but slightly sensitive to light and are sparingly soluble in polar solvents such as DMF and DMSO, so that it was not possible to record their NMR spectra. In view to confirm the phase purity of the synthesized polymers, PXRD experiments were carried out for compounds 1-5 in which the results of the simulations were consistent with the experimentally observed spectra (Figure S4).

In contrast to polymers 2, 6, and 7, in complexes 8 and 9 the L  1  ligand bridges a pair of silver(I) centers. These observations explain the influences of the spacer length of L  1  and L  4  upon the coordination mode of the ligands and dimension of the polymers. In the structures 6 and 7, the L  4  ligand displays two different conformation modes, anti-anti-anti and gauche-antigauche with different S\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5S distances, while in the structure of 2 this ligand exhibits only anti (anti-anti-anti) conformation. The difference between the conformation behaviors of the L  4  ligand in these polymers can be attributed to the size of the counterions. Structural analysis between the 3D ionic compounds 2, 6, 7, and 1D neutral structure of polymer 1 with the same flexible ligand and variable counterions demonstrates the impact of the coordination strength of the counterions on the structure of these polymers. In contrast to the polymers 2, 6, and 7 in which the anions CF3SO3 -, ClO4 -, and BF4 - were used to balance or neutralize the charge of the cationic polymers. In polymer 1 with AgS2O and AgS2O2 donor sets, the nitrate group was coordinated to the metal center as a coligand. In order to evaluate the influence of spacer length on the topology of the networks, in polymers 3-5, L  6  was used instead of L  4 . As pointed out in the crystal structure description of polymers 3 and 4, the coordination mode of the L  6  ligand in these polymers is completely different with that observed for L  4  in its complexes. It is important to note that in the L  6  complexes the counterions have a noticeable impact in directing the coordination geometry around the silver atoms so that when the spacer length increases from L  4  to L  6  attempts to design and synthesis 3D networks with the AgS4 core failed. In the L  4  and L  6  complexes there is a competition between the coordination ability of nitrate and perchlorate anions. In polymer 4, these anions are coordinated to the Ag centers, while an attempt to synthesize analogous complexes with the L  4  ligand was failed. Instead, compound 6 was isolated, with the perchlorate anion acting as counterion. In the 2D structure of polymer 5, the bromide ion, has a critical role in directing the structure of this compound compared to the 1D structures of 3 and 4. In the structure of 5, coordination mode of the L  6  ligand is bis-\u03bc2 bridging, while in 3 and 4 this ligand is coordinated to the silver atom via chelating combining \u03bc2 and \u03bc3-bridging modes. On the other hand, the conformation of L  6  ligand in 5 is completely different from those in 3 and 4. In conclusion, polymers based on the L  4  ligand frequently show an AgS4 core structure, while the Ag centers in compounds with the L  6  ligand cannot adopts this core structure and complete their coordination environment by anions such as perchlorate ion.
