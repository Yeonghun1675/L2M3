In addition, the fluorescent emissions of all compounds\nin the solid state are also investigated in detail.</p><p>In this work, by employing the H<sub>3</sub>L ligand\nto assemble\nwith Ln<sup>3+</sup> ions, we successfully synthesized four isostructural\nnoninterpenetrating MOFs containing the infinite rod-shaped SBUs,\nnamely, [Ln(L)]\u00b71.5H<sub>2</sub>O\u00b70.5EtOH\u00b7DMF (Ln =\nCe (<bold>FIR-8</bold>), Pr (<bold>FIR-9</bold>), Nd (<bold>FIR-10</bold>), Sm (<bold>FIR-11</bold>)).

Compared to previous <bold>FIR-5a-ht</bold>, which also possesses an inorganic rod-shape\nchain and a Langmuir surface area of 1457 m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup>, the surface area of <bold>FIR-8a-ht</bold> is inferior.\nHowever, the H<sub>2</sub> uptake capacity, 165.2 cm<sup>3</sup>\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup> (1.48 wt %) at 77 K and 1 atm, is higher than that\nfor <bold>FIR-5a-ht</bold> (109.6 cm<sup>3</sup>\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup>, 0.98 wt %) and comparable to those of recently reported MOFs at\nthe same condition.

Four isostructural noninterpenetrating frameworks (FIR-8 to FIR-11) are constructed from rod-shaped secondary building units and four other isostructural frameworks (FIR-12 to FIR-15) based on single Ln nodes are described as 8-fold interpenetrating dia-type nets. Gas sorption measurements for FIR-8 give a Langmuir surface area of 633.8 m2\u22c5g-1 and a H2 uptake of 165.2 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 77 K and 1 atm. However, FIR-12 with smaller pores can hardly adsorb any N2 and H2. Because both FIR-8 and FIR-12 crystallize in acentric space group, the second-harmonic generation (SHG) measurements indicate that both of them display strong powder SHG efficiencies, which are approximately 8 and 3 times as strong as that of a potassium dihydrogen phosphate powder. In addition, the fluorescent emissions of all compounds in the solid state are also investigated in detail.\n\nIn this work, by employing the H3L ligand to assemble with Ln3+ ions, we successfully synthesized four isostructural noninterpenetrating MOFs containing the infinite rod-shaped SBUs, namely, [Ln(L)]\u22c51.5H2O\u22c50.5EtOH\u22c5DMF (Ln = Ce (FIR-8), Pr (FIR-9), Nd (FIR-10), Sm (FIR-11)). However, the presence of five drops of HCOOH in the reaction system gives four other isostructural 8-fold interpenetrated diamondoid MOFs built by small-sized and mononuclear SBUs, namely, (Me2NH2)[Ln(HL)2(H2O)2]\u22c51.5H2O\u22c5DMF (Ln = Ce (FIR-12), Pr (FIR-13), Nd (FIR-14), Sm (FIR-15)). FIR-8 shows a high permanent porosity with a Langmuir surface area of 633.8 m2\u22c5g-1 and a high H2 uptake of 165.2 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 77 K and 1 atm. However, FIR-12 with smaller pores can hardly adsorb N2 and H2. Second-harmonic generation (SHG) measurements reveal that FIR-8 and FIR-12 display strong powder SHG efficiencies. In addition, the fluorescent emissions of all the compounds in the solid state are also investigated.\n\nThe thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curve of FIR-8 reveals a weight loss of 14.5% in the range of 120-260 \u00b0C (Figure S5, ), which is corresponding to one and a half H2O, half of EtOH, and one DMF guests. The result is also determined by elemental analysis (calcd 14.21%). Only a slight weight loss is observed between 260 and 500 \u00b0C, suggesting that no chemical decomposition occurs between the desolvating and ligand-releasing temperatures. For FIR-12, a lower weight loss of ~9% corresponding to the release of one and a half H2O, one DMF, and two coordinated H2O molecules (calcd 8.89%) can be seen (Figure S6, ). For gas sorption studies, they were exchanged by EtOH and activated at 90 \u00b0C for 7 h under high vacuum, forming the hollow samples FIR-8a-ht and FIR-12a-ht, respectively. The PXRD patterns of two compounds before and after removing solvent confirm the keeping of porosities (Figures S7 and S8, ).\n\nTo investigate the permanent porosity of desolvated FIR-8a-ht and FIR-12a-ht, the gas sorption experiments of N2 and H2 were measured at 77 K (Figure a). The N2 sorption isotherm of FIR-8a-ht reveals a typical type-I sorption behavior and N2 uptake of ~149.7 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 1 atm, giving BET and Langmuir surface areas of 457.1 and 633.8 m2\u22c5g-1, respectively. However, FIR-12a-ht can hardly adsorb N2 (5.4 cm3\u22c5g-1) and H2 (4.7 cm3\u22c5g-1) because of the size-exclusion effect in the high-fold interpenetrated FIR-12a-ht with small pores. Compared to previous FIR-5a-ht, which also possesses an inorganic rod-shape chain and a Langmuir surface area of 1457 m2\u22c5g-1, the surface area of FIR-8a-ht is inferior. However, the H2 uptake capacity, 165.2 cm3\u22c5g-1 (1.48 wt %) at 77 K and 1 atm, is higher than that for FIR-5a-ht (109.6 cm3\u22c5g-1, 0.98 wt %) and comparable to those of recently reported MOFs at the same condition. In addition, the CO2 uptakes of FIR-8a-ht are 63 and 39 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 273 and 298 K under 1 atm, respectively (Figure b).\n\nWe also measured the pure component sorption isotherms of various hydrocarbons for FIR-8a-ht at 298 K under 1 atm. As shown in Figure c, FIR-8a-ht takes up different amounts of C3H8 (53.3 cm3\u22c5g-1), C2H6 (54.1 cm3\u22c5g-1), C2H4 (54.7 cm3\u22c5g-1), and CH4 (15.3 cm3\u22c5g-1) at 298 K. Although the maximum uptake of C3H8, C2H6, and C2H4 is significantly lower than that for MOF-74 with unsaturated metal ions under the same condition, the C2H6 and C2H4 uptake capacities are better than those for UTSA-35a and UTSA-36a, as previously reported by Chen et al. \n\nThe solid-state emission spectra of compounds FIR-8 to FIR-15 together with the H3L ligand in this work have been investigated at room temperature. It is shown that the free H3L ligand displays the emission maxima at 494 nm, which can be assigned to the \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* transition (Figure ). Apparently, all of the compounds have a peak similar to that of the ligand with a maximum absorption emission band range from 478 to 493 nm, which exhibits a slight blue-shift compared with the emission peak of the H3L ligand. In this case, the ligand-based luminescence dominates and the blue-shifted phenomenon may possibly be attributed to the metal-ligand coordinative interactions. However, except for the ligand-based emission, compound FIR-15 shows other four emission peaks at 558, 594, 642, and 701 nm, which are corresponding to the 4G5/2 \u2192 6H5/2, 4G5/2 \u2192 6H7/2, 4G5/2 \u2192 6H9/2, and 4G5/2 \u2192 6H11/2 characteristic transitions of the Sm3+ ion, respectively, but these characteristic peaks are not obvious in the compound FIR-11.
