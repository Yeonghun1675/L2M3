Highly efficient I2 enrichment of 1 was successfully performed (the loaded material is denoted as 1@I  2 , as indicated in the energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) plot in  in the Supporting Information) by the approach of I2 vapor at ordinary pressure 75 \u00b0C (typical conditions of fuel reprocessing). Activated crystals were placed in a preweighed vial, and then they were sealed at 75 \u00b0C under ambient pressure. The crystals color progressively transformed to black (a). As shown in b, the adsorption ability of 1 was very quick originally, and then no further change was observed after 50 h, which was indicatative that the system had reached equilibrium. For 1, the amount of I2 loading was 216 wt%, which is close to the value indicated by TGA on 1@I  2  ( in the Supporting Information). Furthermore, the adsorption value is similar to the estimated value of 227%, according to the density of I2 (4.93 g cm-3) and the pore volume of 1 (0.46 cm3 g-1), which is one of the maximum values in all reported porous adsorbents (zeolites, MOFs, and POFs; see ). The high affinity of 1 can be ascribed to plentiful phenyl rings, large porosity, and strong electron-donor aminos, which can be interpreted as follows. First, iodine molecules can be adsorbed in the inner of pore using I-I\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5N and I-I\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 halogen bonds. Furthermore, the iodine molecules can form intermolecular I-I\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5I-I halogen bonds, so as to connect firmly. The cooperation effect of three types of halogen bonds largely improves the adsorption ability of I2. The adsorbed I2 species remains neutral, which is confirmed by XPS of 1@I  2  ( in the Supporting Information).\n\nPhotoluminescence and Sensing\n\nAs shown in  in the Supporting Information, the luminescent spectra of free ligand H4tptc and 1 have been investigated in the solid state. Compared with H4tptc, 1 exhibits enhanced blue emission peaks at 400 and 464 nm with 319 nm excitation, which can be mainly ascribed to ligand-centered electronic transitions perturbed by metal ions, because similar emissions are detected at 415 and 464 nm (\u03bbex = 327 nm) for free ligand H4tptc. The fluorescent lifetime of 1 (1.46 \u03bcs) was increased, compared to that of free ligand (1.03 \u03bcs); in ethanol solution, the quantum yield (\u03d5PL) is 23.50%.\n\nThermal Properties\n\nAs for 1 (), the first weight loss of 3.2% within 90 \u00b0C can be assigned to the loss of terminal apy or H2O molecules. The second weight loss of 31.41% (calcd: 28.92%) is attributed to the removal of tptc4- ligand below 270 \u00b0C, following the decomposition of the framework. The ultimate residue for 1 (23.84%) is close to the percentage of zinc oxide (calcd 26.18%). 1@I  2  displayed an obvious larger mass loss than 1 from RT to 500 \u00b0C, corresponding to the release of I2 and the collapse of the framework.
