According to this mechanism, in the final step, the HOMO of *UO2 2+ will be reoccupied by a electron of \u03b1-H from substrate, but its excited electron is still in the LUMO and further captured by electronegative species such as O2 in solution. Furthermore, O2 will transform into highly active peroxide anions, which are responsible for the oxidation and total degradation of RhB. It is universally accepted that viologens are good electron acceptors with excellent redox behavior, so in this situation, MV2+ can stabilize these highly active peroxide anions and contribute to high degradation performance. In order to verify the reusability of four compounds as photocatalysts, the samples were recovered from reaction systems with the filtration method. Among the 40 mg catalysts, the recovered amounts of four samples are about 37 mg (about 92%). Because of the unavoidable solubility, a small amount of loss can be observed. The PXRD patterns of four recovered samples are nearly identical with those of the as-prepared samples (Figure s6 in the ), indicating that four catalysts can be reused.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 12, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig3\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Concentration change of RhB irradiated under\na xenon lamp as a function of irradiation time with or without the\npresence of <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>4</bold>, <italic toggle=\"yes\">C</italic>\n<sub>t</sub> and <italic toggle=\"yes\">C</italic>\n<sub>0</sub> stand for the RhB\nconcentrations after and before irradiation.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr3\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cg-2014-01252x_0004.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 3  Concentration change of RhB irradiated under a xenon lamp as a function of irradiation time with or without the presence of 1-4, C t and C 0 stand for the RhB concentrations after and before irradiation.
