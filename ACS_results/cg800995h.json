In order to make clear the relationship between the intertube channel and the water-helix, it is necessary to investigate the conformation of HL ligands in the MONT. In the crystal structure of HL ligand, the rotation of pyridyl ring around the aryl-aryl bond is greatly hindered for coordination of carboxylate groups to Cd(II) ions, and the dihedral angle of two pyridyl groups is ca. 80\u00b0. Two carboxylates (denoted as C23 and C22) on the pyridyl (N2) are located in different chemical microenvironments (Figure a). And the chemical environment of C13 carboxylate is also different from that of C14 carboxylate on the pyridyl (N1) ring. According to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog sequence rule, the Cd2 atom has priority to the Cd1 because the Cd1 is coordinated with H2O (O9), namely, Cd2 > Cd1 (Figure a). Then, the C23 is prior to the C22 (C23 > C22). Similarly, the C13 is prior to the C14 since the C14 carboxylate is free. Consequently, two distinct asymmetric subunits exist in the same MONT, that is, R-Cd3(HL) and S-Cd3(HL) (Figure ).
