Also, the moment of saturated magnetization is found to be ~0.35 \u03bcB/Cu2+, which approximately corresponds to 1/3 of the full moment of Cu2+ ions (S = 1/2) with 1 \u03bcB/Cu2+. Such a slightly large value of spin moment indicates magnetic anisotropy in the system, agreeing with a slightly larger effective moment of Cu2+ ions seen in the magnetic susceptibility. Further, the magnetization can be fitted well using the spin-1/2 Brillouin function, confirming one-third of the spins with a paramagnetism at low temperature.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "Cu3(CH3COO)4(OH)2\u22c55H2O"}, "crystal system": [{"value": "monoclinic", "condition": ""}], "space group": [{"value": "P21/c", "condition": ""}], "lattice parameters": [{"value": {"a": "12.423", "b": "14.583", "c": "10.784", "alpha": "", "beta": "102.395", "gamma": ""}, "condition": ""}], "magnetic susceptibility": [{"value": "1.907", "unit": "emu\u22c5mol-1\u22c5K", "temperature": "above 60 K", "condition": "fitted by the Curie-Weiss law"}, {"value": "0.639", "unit": "emu\u22c5mol-1\u22c5K", "temperature": "below 50 K", "condition": "typical Curie-Weiss behavior"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["crystal_system", "space_group", "lattice_parameters", "magnetic_susceptibility"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['crystal_system', 'space_group', 'lattice_parameters', 'magnetic_susceptibility']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"\",\n            \"symbol\": \"1\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"Cu3(CH3COO)4(OH)2\u22c55H2O\"\n        },\n        \"crystal system\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"monoclinic\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"space group\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"P21/c\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"lattice parameters\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": {\n                    \"a\": \"12.423\",\n                    \"b\": \"14.583\",\n                    \"c\": \"10.784\",\n                    \"alpha\": \"\",\n                    \"beta\": \"102.395\",\n                    \"gamma\": \"\"\n                },\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"magnetic susceptibility\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"1.907\",\n                \"unit\": \"emu\u22c5mol-1\u22c5K\",\n                \"temperature\": \"above 60 K\",\n                \"condition\": \"fitted by the Curie-Weiss law\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"0.639\",\n                \"unit\": \"emu\u22c5mol-1\u22c5K\",\n                \"temperature\": \"below 50 K\",\n                \"condition\": \"typical Curie-Weiss behavior\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 8, "type": "table", "classification": ["Bond & Angle"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Cu\u2013Cu Lengths\n(\u00c5) and Corresponding Cu\u2013O\u2013Cu Bond Angles (deg)\nin Cu<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>\u00b75H<sub>2</sub>O</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"4\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>d1</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.978(1)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u2220Cu1\u2013O9\u2013Cu3</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>98.25(4)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u2220Cu1\u2013O10\u2013Cu3</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>98.85(4)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>d2</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>3.069(8)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u2220Cu2\u2013O10\u2013Cu1</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>102.75(3)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>d3</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>3.270(1)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u2220Cu2\u2013O10\u2013Cu3</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>113.07(3)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>d4</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>3.258(1)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u2220Cu2\u2013O9\u2013Cu1</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>112.04(3)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>d5</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>3.182(8)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u2220Cu2\u2013O9\u2013Cu3</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>107.46(3)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "Table 1.
