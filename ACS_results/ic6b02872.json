Four Zn(II) atoms, except for Zn(1) and Zn(3), localize in special positions (mirror plane) and thus have site occupancies of 1, 0.5, 1, and 0.5, respectively. Each Zn(II) atom adopts a tetrahedron geometry, coordinated by two oxygen atoms from two qptc4- ligands and two nitrogen atoms from different triazole molecules. The Zn-O distances are in the range of 1.929-2.034 \u00c5, whereas the Zn-N lengths are in the range of 2.01-2.07 \u00c5. The L-Zn-L (L\ue5fbO, N) bond angles are in the scope of 93.4(4)-129.6(3)\u00b0 (Table S1). Each carboxylate group adopts \u03bc1-\u03b71:\u03b70 monodentate mode, and thus, the qptc4- ligands connect Zn(II) centers to form a twisted H-shape (Figure S2). Four Zn(II) atoms are alternately ligated together by \u03bc1,2,4-bridging triazole ligands giving rise to an infinite wavy Zn4(trz)2 chain (c). The adjacent chains are further linked through two different directions of qptc4- ligands to form a 1D channel (9.89 \u00d7 11.22 \u00c52) along the c axis (d) and finally created a 3D anionic framework (b). The charge is balanced by the in situ-generated [Me2NH2]+ from the decomposition of DMF solvent, which is consistent with elemental analyses and TG analyses (Figure S3). Calculations with PLATON program reveals that the accessible pore volume of 1 is 8547.1 \u00c53 per unit cell volume 14387.1 \u00c53 (59.7% of the total volume). Each rod-shaped Zn4(trz)2 chain as SBUs is bridged by four terphenyl-carboxylates ligands, and each ligand is linked by four Zn4(trz)2 chain SBUs, thus forming a atn topological 3D framework with a 1D channel. For zigzag ladder SBUs, there are four four-connected nets (sra, irl, umr, and atn) depending on whether the SBUs are parallel or vertical. In sra net, all of the linked ladders are parallel while the ladders are twisty in irl net. However, the ladders are vertical to each other in atn and umr nets. Each ladder of 1 is slanted perpendicular to its four neighbors, and thus, the net of 1 is atn rather than sra, irl, or umr topology, which is rarely reported by the literature (Figure S4).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 9, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Coordination environments\nof Zn (II), (b) view of 3D framework of <bold>1</bold> along <italic>c</italic> axis, (c) a rod-shaped [Zn<sub>4</sub>(trz)<sub>2</sub>] chain, and (d) 1D channel along <italic>c</italic> axis.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2016-02872b_0001.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  (a) Coordination environments of Zn (II), (b) view of 3D framework of 1 along c axis, (c) a rod-shaped [Zn4(trz)2] chain, and (d) 1D channel along c axis.
