This study shows that the reactivity of either the reduced HSPhCO2H or the oxidized dimeric (SPhCO2H)2 form of the ligand is ruled by the mild or harsh synthetic conditions in play. Under lower temperature and acidity conditions, the coordination of the carboxylates to Cu(II) and the S-S bond formation/preservation are observed when an in situ reduction of Cu(II), cleavage of the S-S bond, and coordination of the thiolates with Cu(I) are happening under harsher conditions of temperature and acidity. Compounds 1 and 2 are polymorphs built up with {Cu2(COO)4} paddle wheel inorganic units with different dimensionalities: 1 is a 1D structure, and 2 is a 2D network. 3 is a copper-thiolate compound with a lamellar structure of Cu3S3 inorganic layers linked through hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic acids. Among those three compounds, the Cu(I)-thiolate solid shows considerably higher chemical and thermal stabilities than the Cu(II)-carboxylates.
