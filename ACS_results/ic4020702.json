The main peak position displays slight frequency dependence. Similar broad dielectric anomaly was reported for powdered [NH4][Zn(HCOO)3] at about 180 K. It is worth mentioning that the temperature dependence of \u03b5' under an applied electric field E || c of the single-crystal [NH4][Zn(HCOO)3] showed a narrower dielectric anomaly at T c = 191 K with a much larger \u03b5' value at the peak position when compared to the powdered [NH4][Zn(HCOO)3]. This anomaly was attributed to onset of a ferroelectric ordering in the low temperature phase, and ferroelectricity of [NH4][Zn(HCOO)3] was confirmed by the presence of a very clear dielectric hysteresis loop. Pronounced similarity between dielectric anomalies observed here for [NH4][Mg(HCOO)3] and reported for [NH4][Zn(HCOO)3] indicates that they have the same origin; that is, they can be attributed to onset of a ferroelectric ordering in the low temperature phase.

T c is also influenced by the type and size of the cation located in the large cavities, as evidenced by different effects of Mg2+ on T c in the ammonium and dimethylammonium formates. Thus, the mechanism of the phase transition can be rationalized as follows. Upon cooling, the lattice shrinks, leading to a decrease of the framework space volume for accommodating NH4 +. This in turn results in changes of the N\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O bond distance as well as the N-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O bond angle to maintain optimal hydrogen bonding between N-H and formate groups, leading to slowing down of the NH4 + movement and consequently to ordering of NH4 + at low temperatures.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 39, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results indicate that [NH<sub>4</sub>]\u00ad[Mg\u00ad(HCOO)<sub>3</sub>] crystallizes in the <italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>6<sub>3</sub>22 structure,\nin which the NH<sub>4</sub>\n<sup>+</sup> cations are orientationally\ndisordered.
