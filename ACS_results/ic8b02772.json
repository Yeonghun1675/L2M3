These {Cd2[(C4H2O6)2B]}- anions are able to further interconnect to form 2D layers (1 and 3) or 3D networks (for 2) through bridging carboxylate groups. The 2D layers are divided by K/Li cations in 3 or further interconnected by Cd2O10 dimers into a 3D network in 1. The number of aqua ligands present also has a strong effect on the structures of the compounds as they change the coordination sites of center metals available for the [(C4H2O6)2B]5- ligand; hence, the coordination mode of the [(C4H2O6)2B]5- ligand is adjusted accordingly. In compound 1, the [(C4H2O6)2B]5- ligand connects with Cd1 and Cd3 in a tetradentate fashion, another Cd3 by using a bidentate chelating carboxylate group (O5-C5-O6) and one Cd2 bidentately by using two carboxylate oxygens (O2 and O4), two additional Cd2 ions in a unidentate fashion (a). In compound 2, the [(C4H2O6)2B]5- ligand connects with 6 Cd2+ ions and 4 K+ ions (b), whereas in compound 3, the [(C4H2O6)2B]5- ligand connects with 3 Cd2+ ions and 7 K+/Li+ mixed sites (c).

The weight loss between 70 and 300 \u00b0C in 1 corresponds to the loss of 16.0 H2O (Figure S5a). The observed weight loss matches with the calculated ones (14.60% vs 15.60%). The weight loss between 300 and 600 \u00b0C can be assigned to the further decomposition of compound, which is also supported by its DSC curves. The peak around 100 \u00b0C goes to the release of H2O molecules, whereas the sharp exothermic peaks at 400 \u00b0C are equivalent to the inflammation of the organic units. TGA experiments revealed that compounds 2 and 3 can be stabilized to 126 and 152 \u00b0C, respectively, and then they display two steps of weight losses (Figure S5b,c). The small weight losses at 126-280 \u00b0C for compound 2 and 152-346 \u00b0C for compound 3 correspond to the release of aqua ligands. The observed weight losses (5.30 and 8.18% for compounds 2 and 3, respectively) are near to the calculated ones (about 3.07 and 6.47%). The second step covering 280-650 and 346-650 \u00b0C for compounds 2 and 3 corresponds to the burning of the organic groups, which also agrees with their DSC curves. Upon calcination, compounds 1-3 transform into amorphous materials.\n\nUV and IR Spectra\n\nCompounds 1-3 are wide band gap semiconductors with optical band gaps of 5.31, 5.45, and 5.40 eV, respectively (Figure S6); hence, their UV cutoff edges are at 233, 227, and 229 nm, respectively.\n\nAll compounds display broad absorption peaks centering at 3541 and 3339 cm-1 associated with water molecules. The bands from 2875 to 2959 cm-1 are originated by C-H stretching vibrations. Absorption bands from 1223 to 1594 cm-1 could be ascribed to the asymmetric stretching of C\ue5fbO and C-O. The bands around 962-1087 and 709-816 cm-1 are due to asymmetric and symmetric stretching of B-O, respectively. The peaks at 521, 527, and 529 cm-1 come from B-O deformation vibrations (Figure S7). \n\nLuminescent Properties\n\nThe solid-state luminescent properties of compounds 1-3 were measured at room temperature (). Compounds 1-3 emit blue luminescence. Compounds 1 and 2 show two broad emission bands at about 445 and 468 nm when excited at 360 nm, respectively, whereas compound 3 shows an emission maximum at 492 nm under excitation at 419 nm. However, understanding of the luminescence mechanism for metal borates is still limited, and further experimental or theoretical explorations are desired. According to refs  and , Cd coordination polymers usually display similar luminescence. We deem that the blue luminescence of 1-3 may be due to the LMCT within the borate framework.
