The simplest way to describe the dynamics of magnetic chains relies on stochastic models. In 1963, Glauber reported the first time-dependent statistics of an Ising chain using stochastic functions of time to model interacting spins in contact with a large thermal bath that spontaneously provokes spin flips. Glauber's approach leads to an exponential decay of the magnetization and thus a single relaxation time (\u03c4):  5   \u03c4 =      \u03c4   0     1 - tanh (   \u0394   \u03be   /   k   B   T )       where \u0394\u03be = 4|J|S 2 and \u03c40 represents the characteristic flipping time for a magnetically isolated spin unit. In the low-temperature approximation and for ferromagnetic interactions along the chain, the relaxation time can be simplified as  6   \u03c4 =      \u03c4   0     2     exp ( 2   \u0394   \u03be   /   k   B   T )    In Glauber's model, \u03c40 is a simple adjustable parameter, while indeed it is temperature-dependent in a more general case and especially when the theory is compared to the real magnetic data. In most of the experimental cases, the anisotropic Heisenberg model in the large anisotropy limit (|D/J| > 4/3) has been used to describe the SCMs. In this approach, \u03c40 describes the characteristic flipping time of a single anisotropic spin inside a narrow domain wall, where it sees no local field. According to eq (), the energy to reverse this spin is  7     \u0394   A   = \u2223 D \u2223   S   2      inducing that \u03c40 also obeys an Arrhenius law:  8     \u03c4   0   ( T ) =   \u03c4   i    exp (   \u0394   A   /   k   B   T )    where \u03c4 i  is the characteristic time of the spin in contact with the thermal bath, in the absence of an energy barrier.

Here, we take advantage of the present Forum Article to foresee the dependence of the SCM behavior on the anisotropic energy by introducing two new compounds: [MnIII 2(saltmen)2NiII(pao)2(L)](PF6)2 with L = bpy (1) and phen (2). Considering the series of [MnIII 2NiII] SCMs (Figure ), these two systems have a similar bridging motif, which consists of [-MnIII-ON-NiII-NO-MnIII-(OPh)2-] motifs, but a zigzag [MnIII 2NiII] chain is observed as a result of the NO-cis-coordination mode of the [Ni(pao)2(L)] moiety that \"bent\" the [Mn-Ni-Mn] trinuclear S = 3 unit. Consequently, these compounds do not exhibit SCM behavior at temperatures above 1.8 K. It is very interesting to analyze the reason for the change of magnetic properties that contrast with the linear-type compounds. The chain motifs of 1 and 2 are depicted in Figure , and the packing features of 2 are given in Figure . Except for the geometry around the NiII ion, the bridging feature is analogous to the one for [MnIII 2NiII] SCMs. Because of the crystal symmetry of 1 and 2, the [MnIII 2NiII] units exhibit two kinds of Mn-Ni bonds, Mn(1)-Ni(1) and Mn(2)-Ni(1), but only one Mn\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Mn bridging mode: Mn(1)-(OPh)2-Mn(2). It should be noted that the values of the Mn-OPh* distance (a parameter that strongly affects the exchange interaction between MnIII ions, i.e., the exchange interaction between the S = 3 unit spins) are 2.689(4) \u00c5 [Mn(1)-O(5)*] and 2.714(4) \u00c5 [Mn(2)-O(1)*] for 1 and 2.5911(18) \u00c5 [Mn(1)-O(5)*] and 2.6202(19) \u00c5 [Mn(2)-O(1)*] for 2.
