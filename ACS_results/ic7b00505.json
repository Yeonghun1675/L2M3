As shown in a, the Mg(1) adopts an octahedral coordination geometry surrounded by four O atoms coming from four different 1,4-NDC ligands in the equatorial plane and two O atoms of \u03bc-H2O and disordered terminal methanol/H2O molecules in the apical sites. While the Mg(2) atom residing in an inversion center forms a nearly perfect octahedron with six O atoms, four of which in the equatorial plane also come from four different carboxylate groups and two of which are from two \u03bc-H2O molecules. Subsequently, two Mg(1) and one Mg(2) are interlinked by four bridging COO- groups and two \u03bc-H2O molecules to form a centrosymmetric linear trinuclear unit of [Mg3(COO)8(\u03bc-H2O)2] acting as the SBU for compound 1. Such linear SBU has been commonly reported. The Mg-O bond distance fall in the range between 1.9934(12) and 2.138(12) \u00c5.

Our group recently reported the first photochromic Mg-CP constructed from non-photoactive ligands. Still, photochromic Mg-CPs have rarely been explored. In this investigation, the dpb was in situ reacted with methanol to form a photochromic cation being incorporated into the host Mg-CP, implying that 1 might own photochromic behavior. Indeed, under the irradiation of Xe lamp for ~10 min, the light-yellow color of crystals of 1 obviously changed to dark brown, inset of . The ESR spectra of the irradiated sample confirmed such photochromic behavior. The irradiated compound showed a single-peak radical signal (g = 2.004), comparing with a weak ESR signal of 1 before irradiation (). Here [CH3-dpb]+ is a viologen-typed guest that is favorable for the photoinduced reduction, and the g value of the irradiated sample of 2.004 is very close to 2.0023 for typical one free electron. Thus, the paramagnetic center of photochromic 1 should be a radical. UV-vis diffuse reflectance analyses further demonstrated the photochromic property of the title compound clearly. As seen in Figure S13, compared with the original spectrum of 1, a new absorption band around 550 nm appeared, and its intensity enhanced responding to the increase of the irradiation time. As a result, the fluorescence intensity of compound 1 was decreased under different irradiated time (Figure S14, Supporting Information). The dark brown irradiated sample could be returned to its original color after several hours, which indicated a reversible process. The PXRD patterns of the original and coloration samples (Figure S4, Supporting Information) indicated they had the identical crystal structures. All the results mentioned above demonstrate that the photochromic property should be generated from the [CH3-dpb]+ cation within well-defined inner cavities of host Mg-CP.
