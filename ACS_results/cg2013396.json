Drum-like subunit A is formed by PMo12 a cluster, pytz, and silver atoms (Figure a and b). First, Ag1 exhibits distorted octahedral geometry that is completed by four nitrogen atoms from two pairs of different pytz- ligands, two terminal oxygen atoms from two PMo12 a (selected bond length and angle in ), so that six Ag1 atoms surround the equatorial ring of every PMo12 a via its six terminal oxygens forming the barrel of the drum. Second, the Ag2 and Ag3 show a similar triangular coordination environment that is completed by three nitrogen atoms of two different pytz ligands (selected bond length and angle in ) in building units A. Further, pytz links Ag2 and Ag3 alternately forming a {Ag2-ptz-Ag3-ptz-Ag2}3 closed toroidal ring shown in Figure c. The interesting part is that the closed toroidal rings cap on the upper and lower portions of the barrel of the drum forming the drumhead. So an integrated drum-like subunit A is obtained. Because of the bridging of Ag1, subunit A is extended to the 2D layer on the ab plane, in which Ag4 atoms further stabilize the 2D structure shown in Figure d and e. Subunit B is constructed only by the PMo12 b. The B acting as hexad-dentate (Figure a) ligands pillars the 2D sheets to form a 3D POM-pillared framework via Ag3 ions along the c axis (Figure b).
