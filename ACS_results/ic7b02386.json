The results for complex 4 clearly reveal that the high dielectric state exists in the paraelastic phase (P3\u03051 c), while the low dielectric state is in the ferroelastic phase (P1\u0305; ), which should be attributed to the motional transitions of the polar DEtA cations, suggesting the occurrence of an order-disorder phase transition between LTP and HTP. The dielectric response \u03b5' of 4 exhibits little frequency dependence in the measuring frequency range of 5 kHz to 1 MHz, indicating that the polar motions are much faster than 1 MHz. Plots of \u03b5' versus T reveal an obvious broad hysteresis between cooling and heating at about 200-240 K. The drastic change of \u03b5' is consistent with the DSC measurement. Inconsistent with complex 4, complexes 1-3 display relaxation and dielectric dispersion. The tan \u03b4 versus T traces displayed a strong frequency (f) dispersion, and the tan \u03b4 peaks correspond to the fall in the \u03b5' traces due to the Kramers-Kro\u0308nig relationship ( and Figure S1). The tan \u03b4 peaks went smoothly from HT-HF (high frequencies) to LT-LF (low frequencies). The f versus T P (the peak temperature in tan \u03b4) data of 1-3 could be fitted by the Arrhenius law of \u03c4 = \u03c4 0 exp(E a/k B T)[\u03c4 = (2\u03c0f)-1], resulting in activation energy E a/k B values of 3.50 \u00d7 103 K (0.30 eV; 1), 2.60 \u00d7 103 K (0.22 eV; 2), and 3.80 \u00d7 103 K (0.33 eV; 3), respectively, and the preexponential factors \u03c40 = 1.74 \u00d7 10-15 s (1), 2.03 \u00d7 10-14 s (2), and 2.24 \u00d7 10-15 s (3).
