The SQUEEZE function in PLATON gave an estimated 42% accessible pore space\ue5f8a value that is significantly greater than that for 1, presumably due to the influence of the steric bulk afforded by the extra methyl groups in the BDPPTzTz ligand. The TGA of 2 showed a mass loss of 15% under 200 \u00b0C due to liberation of the DMF solvent from the pores of the framework (Supporting Information Figure S2).
