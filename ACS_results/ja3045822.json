A fast mass loss from room temperature to ca. 125 \u00b0C was observed, followed by a plateau under further heating up to 250 \u00b0C, where decomposition started (). The mass loss of ca. 30% at 125 \u00b0C corresponds to 60 H2O molecules per formula unit, indicating that all of the water molecules were removed, resulting in the anhydrous compound  iso  1. Vapor adsorption/desorption isotherms for  iso  1 showed a considerable adsorption of water (17.1 mol kg-1) and methanol (10.4 mol kg-1), corresponding to 60 (H2O) and 37 (CH3OH) molecules per formula unit (). Under similar conditions, no vapor adsorption was observed for other solvents such as ethanol and acetonitrile. This fact indicates a large selectivity for the sorption of small molecules by  iso  1 and suggests that both the kinetic diameter and the interaction with the network play key roles in the sorption process.\n\nThe accessible porosity of the anhydrous compound  iso  1 was also estimated by means of gas adsorption isotherms at room temperature. CO2 and CH4 can enter the pores of  iso  1 with loadings of 3.46 and 0.95 mol kg-1, respectively, at 23 bar, which approximately correspond to 12.2 CO2 and 3.3 CH4 molecules per formula unit, respectively, indicating a moderate CO2/CH4 gas selectivity (the ideal selectivity is ca. 4; ). This situation clearly contrasts with that earlier found for 1, where no gas or vapor sorption loadings were observed. This dramatically different sorption behavior can be attributed to the larger size of the channels present in  iso  1 and/or the possible collapse of the structure in 1 upon removal of the solvent water molecules. Other gas molecules such as H2 or N2 were not adsorbed by  iso  1 at room temperature, suggesting that they do not interact with the host network and thus confirming the large selectivity of this system for the separation of small molecules. We also measured the N2 adsorption at 77 K to evaluate the surface area of  iso  1 ().
