X-ray-quality red single crystals of [3]catenane 5a\u22c54PF6\u22c54OTf were grown by vapor diffusion of ethyl acetate into an acetone solution of 4a\u22c54PF6\u22c54OTf (5 mM) with excess DB24C8 (20 mM). The solid-state structure of 5a\u22c54PF6\u22c54OTf revealed that the two units of 1 are threaded through two DB24C8 molecules and stabilized by hydrogen bonding and face-to-face \u03c0-stacking interactions. The configuration of DB24C8 and 1 is similar to the previously reported solid-state structure of the [2]pseudorotaxane DB24C8\u22c51: the pyridinium rings of the SCC ligands are held roughly parallel to the phenyl rings of DB24C8.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 13, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig4\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Crystal\nstructure of the [3]catenane <bold>5a</bold>\u00b74PF<sub>6</sub>\u00b74OTf.\nSolvent molecules, counterions, and H atoms except\nfor the ones involved in hydrogen bonding have been omitted for clarity.\nColor code: green = Pt; orange = P; gray = C; red = O; blue = N; the\ntwo crown ethers are also shown in red.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr5\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ja-2012-118812_0005.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 4  Crystal structure of the [3]catenane 5a\u22c54PF6\u22c54OTf.
