It is noted that 1\u03b2 shows an antiferromagnetic interaction between Co(II) ions in the dimeric unit due to negative J value, which is comparable to the previously reported compounds consisting of Co(II) dimers; whereas the positive J value suggests a very weak ferromagnetic coupling between Co(II) ions in the pseudodimeric unit in 2.
