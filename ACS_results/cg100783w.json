In this research field, the extensive exploration of crystalline inorganic\u2212organic hybrid compounds has successfully created new classes of microporous compounds such as metal\u2212organic frameworks (MOFs) and porous coordination polymers (PCP). One of the main synthetic strategies for these compounds is based on the diversity of secondary metal oxide clusters that can be linked with numerous organic linkers. Polyoxometalates (POMs), as one kind of unique metal oxide cluster, have been considered as promising secondary building units for the construction of porous frameworks because of their nanosize, adjustable compositions, and abundant topologies as well as their oxygen-rich surface with strong coordination abilities. Moreover, porous frameworks based on POM building blocks lead to the combination of porosity with diverse electronic, magnetic, catalytic, and photochemical properties of POMs, which makes them an attractive perspective for applications as highly selective catalysts and multifunctional materials. Although continuous efforts are being devoted to the design of POM-based porous materials owing to their promising applications, only a few of such materials have hitherto been obtained. Thus, rational design of these materials remains a great challenge. One main strategy used for fabricating POM-based porous frameworks is to construct open frameworks with POM clusters as nodes and transition metal (TM) ions as linkers (Scheme a). Following this strategy, quite a few of such frameworks have been synthesized, but they are usually less thermal-stable and/or easily disassembled in solution. Further, the internal cavities of these frameworks are small owing to the presence of interpenetration (Scheme b). Therefore, it is very important to explore new ways to avoid interpenetration so as to keep large cavities within these frameworks. Our approach is to modify partial porous windows with appropriate organic ligands via connecting two adjacent TM cations on the same plane (Scheme c). After modification, a part of the windows is small or even closed, which can effectively prohibit interpenetration and retain large and accessible cages and channels.
