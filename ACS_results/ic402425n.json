The 187.0 K phase transition temperature upon heating is in very good agreement with the DSC data reported in the literature. The nearly symmetric shape of this anomaly and the relatively large thermal hysteresis of 6 K indicates a reversible, first-order phase transition. The DSC data for DMMnD show a very similar heat anomaly at 187.5 K upon heating and 180.3 K upon cooling. As can be noticed, the isotope effect for the Mn compound is very small. Similar behavior was reported for [(CH3)2NH2][Co(HCOO)3] and its perdeutero analogue [(CD3)2ND2][Mn(DCOO)3], for which \u0394T c ~ 1 K. The DSC data for DMNi (DMNiD) show a heat anomaly at 178.7 K (173.1 K) upon warming and 171.9 K (166.3 K) upon cooling. These anomalies are less sharp than those observed for DMMn and DMMnD, but the observed thermal hysteresis is also relatively large (about 6 K), indicating a first-order phase transition. Interestingly, in the case of the Ni-compounds, the isotopic effect is clearly observed; that is, T c decreases by 5.6 K after deuteration. It is well-known that most of the H-bonded ferroelectrics, especially those belonging to the KDP type (KH2PO4, NH4H2PO4, etc.), show large upward shifts of their lower T c when D is substituted for H. This behavior is related to the ordering of protons in the hydrogen bonds, and to account for this large isotopic effect the tunneling proton model was introduced. However, there are some instances where T c is weakly affected by deuteration. For instance, in LiNH4SO4 for which the phase transition mechanism is associated mainly with transition into a state of free rotation of NH4 + ions at high temperatures, the T c increased only by 4.5 K upon deuteration. On the other hand, for purely order-disorder phase transition in KNO3, the 15N-enriched KNO3 showed a slight decrease of T c when compared to the natural 14N isotope. The very weak H-atom isotopic effect for DMMn and negative effect for DMNi exclude the possibility of proton (deuteron) movement along N-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O (N-D\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O) bonds as the microscopic origin of the first-order phase transition in these MOF.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 15, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<title>Dielectric Properties</title><p>The temperature\ndependences of\nreal (\u03b5\u2032) and imaginary (\u03b5\u2033) part of the\ncomplex dielectric function as a function of frequency for DMNi and\nDMNiD are presented in Figures  and .

The observed temperature dependence of the discussed modes proves that the phase transition in the studied compounds has an order-disorder character and is governed by dynamics of the DMA+ cations. The band broadening in molecular crystals is mainly due to anharmonicity and reorientation of molecules or ions. When dynamic disorder prevails over the phonon decay process, the width of a band is usually defined as 3  FWHM = A + BT + C  exp  ( -   E   a   / kT )   where E a is the activation energy, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. The constant A accounts for the broadening arising from factors other than the phonon decay, such as structural and compositional defects.
