KHCO3 (100 g, 0.99 mmol) was separately pulverized and dried under reduced pressure. The two powders were mixed together thoroughly and placed in a glass jar, which was sealed in a Parr reaction bomb equipped with an internal thermocouple and a pressure gauge. The reaction bomb was evacuated under vacuum, and then CO2 was dosed to a pressure of 40 bar. The bomb was heated to 250 \u00b0C (as measured by the internal thermocouple) in a sand bath for 24 h and then slowly cooled to room temperature. The pressure was vented; 1 L of water was added to the solid, which was broken up mechanically, and the mixture was sonicated. The resulting suspension was filtered, and the filtrate was acidified with 12 M HCl until a pH < 2 was achieved and a white solid had precipitated. This solid was collected by filtration and dried in air to yield 53.2 g (79%) of product. 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6 ) \u03b4 9.22 (br, 4H), 8.28 (s, 1H), 6.22 (s, 1H); 13C NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6 ) \u03b4 172.0, 167.7, 134.3, 107.3, 103.0.\n\nSynthesis of Co2(m-dobdc)\n\nAliquots of 310 mL of methanol and 310 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were added to a 1-L three-neck round-bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser and sparged with N2 with stirring for 1 h. The solids H4(m-dobdc) (2.00 g, 10.1 mmol) and CoCl2 (3.27 g, 25.2 mmol) were added under N2 pressure, and the reaction mixture was vigorously stirred and heated at 120 \u00b0C for 18 h. The mixture was then cooled to ambient temperature and filtered, affording a pink microcrystalline powder. The powder was soaked in 500 mL of DMF for 24 h, then soaked in three successive aliquots of 500 mL of methanol for 24 h each. The resulting pink powder was collected by filtration and heated at 180 \u00b0C under dynamic vacuum until the outgas rate was <1 \u03bcbar/min, yielding 1.71 g (54.3%) of activated product.\n\nSynthesis of Ni2(m-dobdc)\n\nAn identical procedure was used as for Co2(m-dobdc) above, except that the solvent consisted of 220 mL of methanol and 405 mL DMF, and NiCl2 (3.27 g, 25.2 mmol) was used in place of CoCl2. The reaction yielded 1.69 g (54.4%) of activated product.\n\nSynthesis of M2(dobdc) (M = Co, Ni)\n\nThese materials were synthesized using identical procedures to their M2(m-dobdc) congeners above, with the substitution of like amounts of the isomeric H4(dobdc) ligand for the H4(m-dobdc) ligand. These reactions yielded 2.06 g (65.4%) of activated Co2(dobdc) and 2.25 g (80.1%) of activated Ni2(dobdc).\n\nPowder Neutron Diffraction Measurements\n\nPowder neutron diffraction data were collected on the high resolution neutron powder diffractometer, BT-1, at the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) Center for Neutron Research (NCNR), with a Ge-(311) monochromator using an in-pile 60' collimator corresponding to a wavelength of 2.077 \u00c5. Measurements were performed on 1.11 g of activated Co2(m-dobdc). The activated sample was transferred into a He-purged glovebox equipped with oxygen and water monitors. The sample was loaded into an aluminum can equipped with a valve for gas loading up to pressures of 100 bar and loaded into a top-loading closed-cycle refrigerator. Data collection was performed at 77 and 198 K for the activated sample. At 77 K, one loading of 78 bar of D2 was measured. At 198 K, the sample was initially exposed to 79 bar of D2 and allowed to reach equilibrium. Additional measurements were performed at reduced pressures of 54 and 36 bar of D2.
