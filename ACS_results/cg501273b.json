When the temperature of crystallization\nis further elevated, the crystal symmetry of the formed Ca(BDC)(DMF)(H<sub>2</sub>O) is increased from triclinic to orthorhombic by slight rearrangement\nof benzene ring planes, change of DMF molecule orientation (rotation\nof methyl groups over the N atom center for approximately 60\u00b0),\nand partial subsiding of the channels. This transformation seems to\nbe the rate-determining step of the Ca-BDC-<italic toggle=\"yes\">orth</italic> crystallization\nmechanism, and it is governed and tuned by the presence and the amount\nof triethylamine agent.

The CTC transformations are schematically represented on Figure . When combining Ca2+ cations in aqueous medium with terephthalate ions dissolved in DMF, these species are bonded instantly at room temperature forming Ca(BDC)(H2O)3. At this stage DMF is not yet involved in the crystallization process. However, only modestly elevated temperature is required for DMF to coordinate to Ca2+ cations via the ligand exchange process with a water molecule, thus forming Ca-BDC-tric. When the temperature of crystallization is further elevated, the crystal symmetry of the formed Ca(BDC)(DMF)(H2O) is increased from triclinic to orthorhombic by slight rearrangement of benzene ring planes, change of DMF molecule orientation (rotation of methyl groups over the N atom center for approximately 60\u00b0), and partial subsiding of the channels. This transformation seems to be the rate-determining step of the Ca-BDC-orth crystallization mechanism, and it is governed and tuned by the presence and the amount of triethylamine agent. Triethylamine is an organic base that is not directly involved in the framework formation, but its primary role in the crystallization process is obviously the tuning of pH value. Figure  shows how pH of the initial reaction mixture changes with the amount of added TEA agent. Ca-BDC-tric \u2192 Ca-BDC-orth transformation requires higher temperatures when pH of the initial reaction mixture is stabilized over the narrow buffer region between 4.5 and 5 (TEA/Ca2+ = 0.63-1.30). When approximating to the equivalence point (pH > 6) and at pH below 4.0, the CTC transformation occurs at lower temperatures. It seems that triclinic phase is more stable in the narrow pH region around 4.5. In more acidic conditions (pH < 4) this process is less controllable, resulting in the simultaneous formation of both phases at lower temperatures and the formation of the pure orthorhombic phase at appropriately elevated temperatures. Similar phase occurrences can be observed when adjusting pH of the initial gel to 4.5 with aqueous solutions of NaOH or NH3 instead of TEA and treating at the same synthesis conditions as described in the . This implies that structural dynamics of CTC transformation is not governed by the presence of species that are a result of the dissociation process (Et3NH+ or OH-), but are most likely related to the thermodynamic state that is established at buffer conditions. In other words, Ca-BDC-tric is more stable at the solution conditions where the dissociation reaction of base is in equilibrium and the Gibbs free energy of the system is at its minimum.
