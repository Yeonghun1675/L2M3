The two solutions diffused slowly into each other. Several days later, yellow plate-like crystals of X-ray quality were obtained.  IR and PXRD data of the crystals matched that of powdered 10 (, Figure S5).\n\n[Mn(terpy)Pt(SCN)4] (11) and [Mn(terpy)2][Pt(SCN)4] (12)\n\nTo 5 mL of an aqueous solution of MnCl2\u22c54H2O (0.020 g, 0.10 mmol) was added 5 mL of a methanolic solution of terpyridine (terpy; 0.022 g, 0.094 mmol).

Crystals of [Mn(terpy)2][Pt(SCN)4] (12) were grown from the filtered mixtures after several days at 5-8 \u00b0C or from the reaction mixture of 11 after disturbance of the layers.

Then, the resulting mixture was layered over 10 mL of an aqueous solution of K2[Pt(SCN)4] (0.050 g, 0.10 mmol). After 24 h, a cocrystallized 65:35 mixture of red plates (13) and red blocks (13b) was obtained.
