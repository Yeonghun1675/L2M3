The relaxation time can be deduced from the frequency-dependent ac data at different temperatures using the generalized Debye model and is plotted as ln \u03c4 vs 1/T as shown in  (also see Figure S5; Tables S3 and S4). Generally speaking, the relaxation process of a lanthanide molecular nanomagnet is a combination of the Orbach process, Raman process, and quantum tunneling process. However, different relaxation processes dominate in different temperature ranges. For example, at high temperatures, the relaxation is dominated by the Orbach process (\u03c4Orbach -1 ~ \u03c40 -1 exp(-U eff/k B T)), whereas, at low temperatures, gradual transitions are observed as a result of the Raman process (\u03c4Raman -1 ~ CT  n , where C is the coefficient of the Raman process) and the quantum tunnelling process (\u03c4QTM -1). The fitting of the ln \u03c4 vs 1/T plots with the consideration of all relaxation processes gives a good agreement with the data over the whole temperature range, generating the following parameters: U eff = 88.4 K, \u03c40 = 2.65 \u00d7 10-7 s, C = 0.35 s-1 K-3.18, n = 3.18, and \u03c4QTM = 0.028 s.

Ab initio calculation demonstrates that the larger energy barrier obtained for 2 is related to its stronger Dy3+-Dy3+ coupling. The different behaviors of 1 and 2 are both affected by the geometry of single lanthanide centers and linkers, while the latter can provide an alternative to manipulate the exchange interactions. Our finding thus provides a promising strategy for the rational design of novel lanthanide-based magnetic materials.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 29, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting\nInformation is available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at\nDOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b02276\">10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b02276</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Some experimental\nand computational details; selected bond lengths and angles for <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>; relaxation fitting parameters from least-squares\nfitting of \u03c7\u00ad(<italic>f</italic>) data; crystal structure of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>; XRD spectra of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>; and magnetic data for <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b02276/suppl_file/ic6b02276_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>X-ray\ncrystallographic data of compound <bold>1</bold> (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b02276/suppl_file/ic6b02276_si_002.txt\">TXT</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>X-ray crystallographic data\nof compound <bold>2</bold> (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b02276/suppl_file/ic6b02276_si_003.txt\">TXT</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b02276.
