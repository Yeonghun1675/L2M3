For the first pathway, singlet-triplet energy gap (J) values near -300 cm-1 have been reported for the complexes [Cu2(\u03bc-Hade)4Cl2]Cl2\u22c56H2O, [Cu2(\u03bc-Hade)4(H2O)2] (ClO4)2\u22c52H2O, and [Cu2(\u03bc-ade)4(H2O)2]\u22c52H2O. With respect to the superexchange magnetic coupling through bidentate \u03bc-N7,N9 purine nucleobases, to date, the available magnetic data for complexes based on this type of bridge indicate very weak antiferromagnetic coupling between the Cu(II) ions.
