The emissions for the complexes are found to be lower than that of each free ligand (L1 , \u03bbem = 355 nm; L2 , \u03bbem = 355 nm) except complex 3. Upon complexation, slightly red-shifted emissions compared with those of free ligands [\u03bbem = 356 (1), 357 (2), 357 (3), 359 (4a), and 361 (4b) nm] are observed. Because no emissions originating from metal-centered excited states are expected for the d10 metal ion species such as HgII, the emissions of 1-4b seem to attributed to the \u03c0-\u03c0* intraligand fluorescence. The emission intensity of the complex is found to be dependent on the anion used, Cl > Br > I, which can be explained by a heavy-atom quenching effect.
