It should be mentioned that, as supposed from the ac data, no field hysteresis of the magnetization was observed at 1.8 K for both compounds (). Further investigation was performed at 0.5 K on a field-oriented single crystal that was restrained in n-eicosane with an applied field of 70 kOe at 325 K, followed by cooling in the field (Figure ). In the measurement, data were collected by applying fields at a scanning rate of 2 Oe s-1 parallel to the averaged easy axis direction of the [Mn4] units in the crystals (see Experimental Section). 1o showed a weak hysteretic response (butterfly-type hysteresis feature) with no coercive field (Figure a). On the other hand, 1c showed a more distinct hysteresis loop with a small coercive field (~ 100 Oe) and several steps (Figure b). Some of these steps, for example at -1.3 and 1.1 kOe, can be indicative of QTM, although the imperfect alignment of the crystal can cause a false step, such as that at H = 0. The step at ca. 3.5 kOe may be due to thermal activation. The steps at -1.3 and 1.1 kOe could be due to QTM between m s = 9 and m s = -9 and -8, respectively. From the field interval between the steps (\u0394H = 2.4 kOe), a |D|/k B value of 0.32 K (\u0394H ~ |D|/g\u03bc B) was determined, which agrees with the value obtained from the reduced magnetization. It is noteworthy that the first step (-1.3 kOe) corresponding to QTM between m s = \u00b1 9 was observed before the external field was decreased to zero.

Similar to the \u03c7T vs T data in Figure , the values of \u03c7' of 1c-vis at low temperatures were smaller than the corresponding ones of 1c; however, they were strongly frequency-dependent showing an increase in \u03c7'' (Figure a). Furthermore, the maxima of \u03c7'', which were not observed for 1c, were observed above 1.8 K at ac frequencies in the range 200-1500 Hz. However, they were not single component values, indicating the existence of multiple relaxation processes. To determine the origins of the relaxation processes, ac susceptibilities were measured as a function of the ac frequency (1-1500 Hz) at several temperatures (Figure b). The \u03c7'' vs \u03bd data clearly showed the presence of two modes of relaxation: high-frequency and low-frequency modes. This has been observed for antiferromagnetically coupled [Mn4] SMMs. Only in the low-frequency mode were peak tops observed in the frequency and temperature ranges measured (indicated as arrows in Figure b), and from an Arrhenius plot, \u03c40 = 2.68 \u00d7 10-14 s and \u0394eff/k B = 46.7 K.
