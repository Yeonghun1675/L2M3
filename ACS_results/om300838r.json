Each Ag4 segment is consolidated by five trifluoroacetate ligands, four of which each span a Ag\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Ag edge in a \u03bc2-O,O' coordination mode. The fifth trifluoroacetate (O9-O10), which is located on the opposite side of the C1\ue5fcC2 moiety, connects the silver quadrangle (Ag1-Ag2-Ag3-Ag4) to an external silver atom (Ag13) in a \u03bc4-O,O,O',O' coordination mode. A similar coordination scenario also applies to ethynide C3\ue5fcC4. As shown in Figure a, the two external silver atoms Ag13 and Ag14 are each linearly coordinated by two imidazole ligands. In addition to this pair of ordered \"external\" (imid)2Ag units, there is a pair of disordered \"internal\" (imid)2Ag units that lie between the planar Ag4 segment. The latter set of bis(imidazole)-bound silver atoms (Ag9, Ag10, Ag11, and Ag12, each having a site occupancy factor of 1:2) connect to the outer Ag4 quadrangles by Ag\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Ag interactions in the range 3.166(2)-3.372(2) \u00c5. The imidazole ligands attached to the disordered silver atoms exhibit orientational disorder such that each heteroaromatic ring possesses an apparent C 2h  axis about the N-H bond with its ligating N atom and a CH unit occupying equivalent positions with half site occupancy (Figure a, upper part). Centrosymmetric silver aggregate B is isostructural with aggregate A, except for minor differences in molecular geometry (Figure a, lower part). These two kinds of silver aggregates are arranged in an AABAA... pattern along the [011] direction and interconnected through hydrogen bonding between the imidazole-NH and trifluoroacetate-O atoms to form a layer parallel to the bc plane (Figure b). Adjacent layers are packed and further linked by multiple intermolecular F\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5F interactions to form a three-dimensional supramolecular network (Figure d).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 23, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig5\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>5</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Atom labeling and coordination modes\nof the C<sub>4</sub>\n<sup>2\u2013</sup> dianion of silver aggregates <bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold> in <bold>6</bold>.
