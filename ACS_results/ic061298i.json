It would be interesting to investigate the strength of the longer Cu-O bonds in 1 through intercalation studies involving long alkyl chain amines and also to explore the possibility of breaking the \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and increasing the interlayer distances. The use of other metal ions and different stoichiometries of H2bpa could lead to other interesting possibilities. We are currently investigating these aspects.
