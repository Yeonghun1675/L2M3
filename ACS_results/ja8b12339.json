Mo\u0308ssbauer spectroscopy was used to further characterize the reduced materials (Figures S33-S37). For both 1 and 2, the spectra of the reduced materials show no additional signals attributable to free Fe2+ or Fe3+, indicating that the Fe4S4 clusters remain intact. Mo\u0308ssbauer spectra of monomeric Fe4S4 clusters show small increases in isomer shift and quadrupole splitting upon reduction from [Fe4S4]2+ to [Fe4S4]+. With 1, no significant changes are seen in the Mo\u0308ssbauer spectra, consistent with the small degree of reduction estimated from ICP-MS. In contrast, the spectrum of 2 shows small changes in shape (Figure S37). This suggests an additional, unresolved contribution from a species with higher isomer shift than the as-synthesized 2. Subtraction of the spectra of the as-synthesized and reduced materials reveals a broad additional signal in the same region as literature spectra of [Fe4S4]+ compounds (Figure S38). This contribution can be approximated in fits to the spectrum of reduced 2 by addition of a third site with similar \u03b4 and \u0394E Q to literature [Fe4S4]+ spectra (full treatment of the [Fe4S4]+ species with two Fe sites was not possible given the low intensity of this feature and overlap with signals from [Fe4S4]2+ sites). These changes are reversible by brief exposure to dry air, further supporting their attribution to reduced [Fe4S4]+ clusters. While interpretation of the Mo\u0308ssbauer spectra is complicated by the presence of overlapping signals, these data support that the reversible redox-activity of the Fe4S4 clusters is preserved.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 26, "type": "table", "classification": null, "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Li and Co Content\nof <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> before and after Reduction in\nthe Solid State</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"3\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">molar ratio</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">compound\nreduced <bold>1</bold> (%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">compound\nreduced <bold>2</bold> (%)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>Li/Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>before reduction</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>3(1)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>14(5)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>after\nreduction</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>9(1)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>28(4)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>increase amount</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>6(2)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>15(6)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>Co/Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>before reduction</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.14(4)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.08(2)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>after reduction</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.2(3)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>9.0(6)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>increase\namount</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.1(3)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>9.0(6)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>reduction degree</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>7(2)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>24(6)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 27, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>Finally, we\nhave also investigated chemical reduction of <bold>2</bold> in the\nsolution phase.
