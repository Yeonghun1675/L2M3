The observed optical phenomena depends on the relative position between the triplet state of Box and the emissive state of LnIII. In 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, and 12, at least one emissive state of LnIII is within or below the range of Box 3T1 energy level, and thus, the energy transfer (ET) from Box to LnIII can be observed. For 2, PrIII has two possible emissive levels, but 3P0 is located too high for Box donors, and the emission from only 1D2 can be detected. In NIR-emitting 3 and 12, the NdIII and YbIII emissive states are situated below the 3T1 state, and ET is preferred. The emissive states of SmIII and EuIII are located in similar positions, both reasonably good for ET, which results in vis-NIR, or only vis emission, respectively. HoIII is a special case, possessing three too closely positioned emissive states, and all of them are within the range accessible for ET, so the complex vis-NIR luminescent characteristics are observed in 9. The potentially emissive states of GdIII, TbIII, DyIII, and TmIII, are situated too high for ET from Box. For GdIII-based 6 and TbIII-based 7, it results in ligand phosphorescence because the energy is not lost, as no other energy levels overlap with the 3T1 state of Box. It gave also the selective excitation of TbIII by using higher energy light. There is lack of even Box emission in 8 and 11, which is due to overlap between nonemissive states of DyIII and TmIII, with Box, inducing the nonradiative relaxation. The ET giving the emission could be also found for ErIII-containing 10; however, there is no signal, which is due to relaxation through the vibration modes, crucial for a small gap ErIII NIR emitters. The lack of emission in 1 is due to the overlap between 3T1 state of Box, and CeIII-MoV MMCT band of 1, and energy can be transferred from Box, but MMCT levels involving [MV(CN)8]3- are not emissive. There is no contribution from [MoV(CN)8]3- ions to the emission, which means that energy absorbed by their LMCT states are relaxed, not influencing on the equilibrium between LnIII and Box.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 42, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig6\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>6</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Schematic energy level\ndiagram explaining the mechanism of luminescent effects in <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>12</bold>.

On cooling, the \u03c7M T gradually decreases to 0.86 cm3 mol-1 K at 12 K, which is followed by abrupt increase to 0.99 cm3 mol-1 K at 1.8 K (Figure ). The steady decrease of the \u03c7M T is ascribed to the thermal depopulation of the Stark levels arising from the splitting of the 2F5/2 ground state of CeIII, whereas the further increase can be assigned to magnetic interactions within CeIII-NC-MoV linkages. The magnetization at T = 1.8 K increases with increasing magnetic field to 1.83 N\u03b2 at 50 kOe, which is close to the range of 1.85-2.07 N\u03b2 expected for combined contributions from CeIII and MoV, assuming a spin of S = 1/2 with g = 2 for MoV, and an effective spin of S eff = 1/2 with g within the range of 1.71-2.15 for CeIII. The M at 50 kOe in 1 is higher than 1.61 N\u03b2 found for one example of CeIII-MoV system for which positive J value of 1.4 cm-1 was proved. All these suggest a ferromagnetic type of CeIII-MoV coupling in 1. However, these interactions are weak, and FCM curves do not show abrupt increase of the signal, and ac signal is negligible (not shown), indicating the lack of magnetic ordering.\n\nCompound 4 \n\nUpon cooling, the \u03c7M T-T curve reveals almost linear decrease from the value of 0.82 cm3 mol-1 K for {SmIII MoV} unit at 300 K to 0.50 cm3 mol-1 K at 13 K (Figure ). The room-temperature \u03c7M T is higher than 0.46 cm3 mol-1 K expected for the isolated SmIII (J = 5/2, g  J  = 2/7) and MoV (S = 1/2, g = 2). These characteristics are related to the special properties of SmIII for which not only Stark multiplets of the 6H5/2 ground state but also the low-lying 6H7/2 excited state can be populated at high temperature. At low temperatures, the abrupt increase of the \u03c7 M T product up to 0.95 cm3 mol-1 K at 1.8 K is observed, and this can be ascribed to the SmIII-MoV interactions. They are relatively strong as the fast increase of magnetization in the M-H plot is observed. The value of M at 50 kOe is equal 1.22 N\u03b2, which is close to 1.28 N\u03b2 expected for ferromagnetically coupled SmIII-MoV pair, assuming a spin of S = 1/2 with g = 2 for MoV and an effective spin of S eff = 1/2 with the average g value of 0.57 for SmIII. At the same time, it is much higher than 0.72 N\u03b2 calculated for the antiferromagnetic alignment of SmIII and MoV magnetic moments. This indicates a ferromagnetic character of coupling, similar to other SmIII-[MV(CN)8]3- systems. Moreover, FCM curves show the abrupt increase at low temperatures and further saturation, indicating a ferromagnetic ordering in 4. The critical temperature of T c = 2.0 K was estimated from the first derivative of FCM. The onset of magnetic ordering was confirmed by ac magnetism, however, the peak in \u03c7\"M T(T) plot was not clearly formed due to low T c ().\n\nCompound 6 \n\nThe \u03c7M T product for {GdIII MoV} unit at 300 K reaches 8.26 cm3 mol-1 K, which agrees well with the isolated pair of GdIII (S = 7/2, g = 2) and MoV (S = 1/2, g = 2). On cooling, the \u03c7M T is stable up to 100 K and later decreases to 7.81 cm3 mol-1 K at 11 K, which is followed by the abrupt increase to a maximum of 15.2 cm3 mol-1 K at 2 K (Figure ). As GdIII has no first-order orbital contribution, the minimum on \u03c7M T-T plot indicates the GdIII-MoV antiferromagnetic coupling, which is later spread within the layers giving the large  increase of \u03c7M T. This interpretation is supported by the M-H curve showing a fast increase to 6.2 N\u03b2 at 50 kOe, close to 6.0 N\u03b2 expected for the antiferromagnetically coupled GdIII-MoV pair. The maximum on \u03c7M T-T plot at low temperatures can suggest the transition to the ordered state. In fact, FCM curves show a fast increase of signal at low T, but the saturation is not reached, indicating that T c is on the border of the measurement range, which is also observed in ac magnetism ().\n\nCompound 7 \n\nAt room temperature, the \u03c7M T value of {TbIII MoV} unit is 12.2 cm3 mol-1 K, which is the same as calculated for the uncoupled TbIII (J = 6, g  J  = 3/2)-MoV (S = 1/2, g = 2) pair. Upon cooling, \u03c7M T is stable to 100 K and later decreases to minimum of 11.2 cm3 mol-1 K at 11 K, which is followed by the increase to 19.5 cm3 mol-1 K at 2.5 K. At the lowest T, a further decrease of \u03c7M T is observed (Figure ). The minimum on the \u03c7M T-T curve is related to the thermal depopulation within the multiplets of 7F6 ground state of TbIII, whereas the increase below 11 K is due to TbIII-MoV magnetic coupling. Its character is suggested by the M-H plot showing the value of 5.6 N\u03b2 at 50 kOe without saturation, which is close to 6.0 N\u03b2 calculated for the ferromagnetically coupled TbIII (S eff = 1/2, g eff = 10)-MoV (S = 1/2, g = 1/2) unit. The very low T maximum on \u03c7M T(T) plot suggests the onset of magnetic ordering, which is easily visible in the FCM curves revealing an abrupt increase below 2.5 K, followed by saturation of M. The T c value of 2.2 K was determined by the first derivative of FCM. Compound 7 reveals narrow magnetic hysteresis with small coercive field of 12 Oe. The ac magnetic signals reveal also peaks typical for the magnetic phase transition. However, there is a weak frequency dependence, suggesting the contribution of spin glass behavior coexisting with ferromagnetism in 7. The similar dependences, but at lower temperatures, were observed also in 4 and 6, supporting the interpretation of a 3-D spin glass effect rather than the role of magnetic anisotropy ().\n\nCompound 8 \n\nThe \u03c7M T for {DyIII MoV} unit reaches at 300 K the high value of 14.4 cm3 mol-1 K, close to the expected 14.5 cm3 mol-1 K for the isolated DyIII (J = 15/2, g  J  = 4/3)-MoV (S = 1/2, g = 2) pair. On cooling, the \u03c7M T-T plot is flat, while the gradual decrease is detected below 50 K, with the minimum of 12.7 cm3 mol-1 K at 9 K, which can be assigned to the depopulation of numerous multiplets within DyIII 6H15/2 ground state (Figure ). On further cooling, the rapid increase of signal is observed, and after the maximum at 2.2 K, the \u03c7M T finally decreases. These features relate to magnetic interactions within DyIII-NC-MoV. The M-H plot shows fast increase of magnetization to the value of 6.6 N\u03b2 at 50 kOe without saturation. This high value can suggest the ferromagnetic type of DyIII-MoV coupling, consistent with the previous report, but the contribution from DyIII to the M strongly depends on detailed distribution of its Stark levels. Taking the average value of g Dy = 9.3 from simple inorganic salts, the prediction for ferromagnetic DyIII (S eff = 1/2)-MoV pair is 5.7 N\u03b2, while for antiferromagnetic case only 3.7 N\u03b2, suggesting the ferromagnetic interactions in 8. The maximum on \u03c7M T-T plot at very low T indicate the transition to the ordered state. FCM curves show fast increase of signal at low T, but the saturation is not reached up to 1.8 K, indicating that T c is at the limit of the measurement range, which is also observed in ac magnetism
