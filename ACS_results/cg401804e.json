The selectivity of the framework toward MeOH vapor over CH3CN and H2O might be due to the well fit of MeOH molecules inside the pore, which causes stronger interactions with the MOF. Similar solvent vapor adsorption studies were also carried out for complex 2. The results illustrate that complex 2 also shows selectivity toward methanol vapor (). The lower uptake of methanol (201.2 cm3 g-1) for complex 2 compared to complex 1 may be due to a lower amout of solvent accessible pore volume available in complex 2 compared to that of 1 (6226.5 \u00c53 for complex 1 and 5766.2 \u00c53 for complex 2).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 35, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig11\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>11</label>\n<caption>\n<p>CO<sub>2</sub> isosteric\nheat of adsorption using adsorption data\nfor complex <bold>1</bold> collected at 273 and 298 K.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr11\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cg-2013-01804e_0012.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 11  CO2 isosteric heat of adsorption using adsorption data for complex 1 collected at 273 and 298 K.

Single crystal structure analysis shows that the 3D framework originates from the self-assembly of lanthanide metallomacrocycles made of dumble-shaped basic secondary building units and having channels of sizes 17.427 \u00d7 15.163 \u00c5 (for 1) and 14.58 \u00d7 17.23 \u00c5 (for 2), respectively. In both the complexes, two eight-coordinated lanthanide centers are connected with six pamoate groups to give a paddle-wheel type building block. The arrangement of pamoates and lanthanides in the framework provokes both right- (P) and left-hand (M) helicity around the 21 screw axis. The magnetic measurements show that complex 1 acts as a cryogenic magnetic refrigerant having magnetic entropy change, -\u0394S m, of 17.25 J kg-1 K-1(\u0394H = 7 T at 3 K), and complex 2 shows slow relaxation of magnetization. The adsorption studies reveal that complexes 1 and 2 show selectivity toward CO2 sorption over other gases and exhibit high methanol vapor uptake (227 cm3 g-1 for 1 and 201 cm3 g-1 for 2). Solid state photoluminescence properties reveal that they are photoluminescent materials.\n\nMagnetic Property Studies\n\nThe bulk purity of both complexes 1 and 2 were confirmed by comparing the corresponding simulated and experimental PXRD patterns (Figure S2 of the ). The DC magnetic susceptibility data for 1 and 2 were collected in the temperature range of 1.8-300 K at 1KG (Figures  and ). The room temperature \u03c7M T (\u03c7M = molar magnetic susceptibility) value was found to be 15.36 cm3 mol-1 K for 1 (calculated \u03c7M T = 15.6 cm3 mol-1 K for two noninteracting Gd3+on (8S7/2, g = 1.99). The small difference between the calculated and experimental \u03c7M T value is due to the antiferromagnetic coupling between the Gd3+ centers. Upon cooling, this value remains almost constant up to 30 K and decreases down to reach a value of 14.11 cm3 mol-1 K at 1.9 K. The shape of the plot indicates the presence of weak antiferromagnetic interactions between the Gd3+ centers. With consideration of the dimeric core found in 1 (Figure S9(a) of the ), it can be assumed that the magnetic coupling was occurring between two nearby Gd3+ ions through the bidentate carboxylate bridging group. The above observed antiferromagnetic coupling in complex 1 might be because of Ln\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Ln separation in the dimeric unit [Gd3+\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Gd3+, 4.229(1) \u00c5]and the chelating bidentate bridging mode of the carboxylate group in the dimeric unit. For complex 2, the obtained room temperature \u03c7M T (\u03c7M = molar magnetic susceptibility) value is 27.63 cm3 mol-1 K [Calculated \u03c7M T = 28.33 cm3 mol-1 K for two uncoupled Dy3+ (6H15/2, g = 1.33)].\n\nThe molar magnetic susceptibility data of 1 and 2 were fitted according to the Curie-Weiss equation, \u03c7M = C/(T - \u03b8), which afforded the Curie constants (C) = 15.35 cm3 mol-1 K for 1 and 27.63 cm3 mol-1 K for 2 and Weiss constants (\u03b8) = -0.064 K for 1 and -3.97 K for 2 (Figure S11, panels a and b, of the ). For complex 1, negative value of \u03b8 further confirms the presence of antiferromagnetic (AF) interaction between Gd3+ centers. But for complex 2, small negative \u03b8 values do not imply the existence of antiferromagnetic interaction between Dy3+ centers due to the presence of large orbital angular momentum and strong spin-orbit coupling for Dy3+. In case of complex 2, the \u03c7M T value slowly decreases down to 70 K and then decreases rapidly to a value of 20.66 cm3 mol-1 K at 1.8 K, which is probably due to the thermal depopulation of excited Stark sublevels in Dy3+.Magnetization data for complex 1 was measured in the temperature range from 2 to 10 K [Figure  (inset)], which shows a steady increase with increasing field (H) and saturation values of 13.93N\u03bcB at 7 T and 2 K, whereas for complex 2, complete saturation was not achieved at 7 T and 2 K [Figure  (inset)]. The magnetization value reachs up to 10.07N\u03bcB for 2.\n\nGas Adsorptions Studies\n\nIn order to evaluate the porous property, both complexes were activated under vacuum at 100 \u00b0C for 10 h. The PXRD pattern of the activated samples (Figure S2 of the ) of both the complexes supports the stability of the framework after activation. The activated samples were introduced with different gases and solvent vapors. Adsorption analyses of 1 and 2 with N2 show almost no uptake at 77 K. The calculated BET and Langmuir surface areas of complexes 1 and 2 from the N2 adsorption data were 5 and 11 m2 g-1 and 3.2 and 5.3 m2 g-1, respectively. Considerable amount of uptake (8.4 wt % or 43.5 cm3 g-1) was obtained for CO2 gas at 195 K; this suggests the selective porous nature of the framework (Figure ). The Henry's Law selectivity for CO2/N2 separation at 273 and 298 K was calculated using the equation S ij = K H(j)/K H(i) (where K H is Henry's constant). The calculated selectivity of the framework toward CO2 over N2 is 19 [KH(CO2) = 1.4078 \u00d7 10-8 mol g-1 Pa-1 and K H(N2) = 7.2627 \u00d7 10-9 mol g-1 Pa-1; Table S3 of the ). Such adsorption selectivity of CO2 over N2 may be due to the fact that CO2 molecules have a larger quadrupole moment than N2 and has a smaller molecular size (CO2, 3.4 \u00c5; N2, 3.1 \u00c5) but bigger kinetic diameters (CO2, 3.3 \u00c5; N2, 3.6 \u00c5). \n\nPhotophysical Properties\n\nThe \u03c0-conjugated organic ligands, which usually have strongly absorbing chromophoric properties, were used effectively as sensitive reagents for tailoring lanthanide luminescence. Although pamoate exhibits extended \u03c0-conjugated naphthalene moieties, the solid state photophysical properties of its lanthanide complexes are not known so far. The photoluminescence spectra of the pamoic acid and complexes 1 and 2 were measured in the solid state at room temperature (Figure ). On excitation at 430 nm (Figure S18 of the ), complexes 1 and 2 exhibit a sharp emission peak at ~467 nm and a broad peak at ~555 nm, respectively. To get an insight into the nature of emission of complexes 1 and 2, the emission spectra of ligand \"pamoic acid\" was measured. The sharp emission peak at around ~464 nm (\u03bbex = 430 nm) was observed. The sharp emission peak at ~467 nm for 1 and 2 were similar to that of the ligand, indicating that they were attributed to the emission from the ligand. For complex 2 (Dy3+), the broad emission peak observed in the region of 470-670 nm might be due to the overlap of two peaks originating from the transition 4F9/2\u2192 6H15/2 and 4F9/2\u2192 6H13/2, which corresponds to the characteristic blue emission of the Dy3+ ion. The observed luminescence intensity of complexes 1 and 2 are similar in the 470-670 nm region, which might be due to the similar framework arrangements. So, the aforementioned photoluminescent behavior of both complexes demonstrates that they may be potential candidates for photoluminescent materials.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "1",
