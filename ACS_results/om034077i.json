Most important is the fact that no weight loss was observed between 131 and 230 \u00b0C, probably suggesting the formation of stable, solvent-free 2 (a polycrystalline sample of 2 can be obtained through a freshly ground sample of 2\u22c5EtOH being subjected to vacuum at ca. 90 \u00b0C for 1 day). The EPR spectrum of 2\u22c5EtOH is silent, confirming that the oxidation state of Cu ions in the solid complex is +1.
