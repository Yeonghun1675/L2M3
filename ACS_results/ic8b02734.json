So, the Imol-Ianion bond strength is weak and can dissociate easily, and, furthermore, the dissociation and formation Imol-Ianion bond is reversible. Therefore, during the adsorption/release process, I2 molecules were adsorbed onto the bridged I of the Cu2I2 cluster to generate a stable Cu2I-I3 - clusters (Figure S14).
