(2) After 35 electrochemical cycles, we recollected the CV of the electrolyte solution by changing 5-CPE to a bare CPE (Figure S7a) and a bare glassy carbon electrode (Figure S7b) and compared them with the CV of the blank electrolyte solution. The CVs of the blank electrolyte solution and that of the electrolyte solution after 35 cycles are very similar (Figure S7c), which suggests that there are no additional active species dissolved into the solution from 5-CPE. We also compared the CV of 5-CPE with the above results, and the characteristic redox peaks of 5-CPE were not observed in them (Figure S7d).

The emission intensity of emulsion of 6 linearly decreased upon increasing the Ag+ concentration from 0 to 0.6 mM (Figure S15). The limit of detection (LOD) was determined to be 114 \u03bcM for probe 6 on the basis of the signal-to-noise ratio, S/N = 3. The pH values of the suspension are 6.31 and 5.81 before and after the fluorometric titrations, respectively. The decreased pH value after the addition of Ag+ ions is induced by more acidic AgNO3 aqueous solution (pH = 5.47 for 10 mM AgNO3 aqueous solution). We also checked the recyclability of this sensor; unfortunately, it cannot work in the second cycle, which may be caused by strong interaction between silver ions and the nitro group (Figure S16). The UV-vis spectrum for the emulsion of 6 was measured by adding different concentrations of Ag+ (Figure S17), and the red shift from 425 to 485 nm was detected with the addition of Ag+ ions from 0 to 0.25 mM, implying that the mechanism of the quenching effect of 6 by Ag+ may be a ligand-to-metal charge-transfer process, induced by the specific coordination interaction of Ag+ and the peripheral NO2 groups. We also considered the halogen effects on the sensing behaviors of Ag+ by the fluorescence titration for 4 and 5 under the same conditions (Figure S20). On the basis of the calculated LOD (Figure S21), we found that 4 and 5 have the much lower LOD of 65.6 and 74.4 \u03bcM, respectively.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 32, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, we have isolated and structurally\ncharacterized a series\nof 12-MC<sub>Cu(I),pz</sub>-4-based triple-decker complexes with different\ntrapped alkali halides acting as templates.
