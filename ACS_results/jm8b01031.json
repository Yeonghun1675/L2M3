As can be seen for electrochemical reduction of 2 in nBu4NPF6/DMSO in the region of the first one-electron reduction step (see inset in b), a significant decrease of EPR signal was observed in accord with the formation of a diamagnetic Cu(I) d10 complex. For aqueous solutions, the reversibility was significantly reduced, implying a more complex mechanism involving the release of the proligand. However, by decreasing the scan rate and going to the more positive potentials upon reverse scan, a partial recovery of the initial optical bands was also observed in aqueous solutions as shown for 2 in Figure S12. Thus, electrochemical data indicated a likely reduction of Cu(II)-TSC complexes to Cu(I) species with the subsequent release of the proligands.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 22, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig4\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Spectroelectrochemistry of <bold>2</bold> in <italic>n</italic>Bu<sub>4</sub>NPF<sub>6</sub>/DMSO in the region of the\nfirst cathodic\npeak.

To further investigate the potential biomolecular targets of Fe-chelating compounds of interest, we studied the phosphorylation of ERK protein, which belongs to the MAPK family. The MAP kinases occupy the central position in cell growth and apoptosis, and each MAP kinase member plays a different role in cellular responses. It was reported that some Fe chelators induced cancer cell death associated with the activation of p38 MAPK and ERK. Moreover, the MAPK-mediated cell death was characterized by the decreased expression of cyclin D1.
