The field dependence of the magnetization does not follow a Brillouin curve. As shown in Figure b, the curves rise sharply to saturation values of 4.8 N\u03b2 for 1 and 5.0 N\u03b2 for 2, in agreement with an uncompensated S = 5/2 per one unit. It is consistent with a less common form of ferrimagnetism, namely, homometallic ferrimagnetism, where equal spins are antiparallel but do not cancel overall. The possibility of magnetic transitions suggested by the sharp peaks in the \u03c7m T curves was further investigated by measuring the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) magnetizations in the 1.8-8 K temperature range (Figure b, inset). The ZFC/FC measurements were carried out at a very low field of 10 Oe for 1 and 2. The two curves are superposed at higher temperatures for both compounds (Figure b, inset). They increase abruptly below 5 K and then diverge at around 3.2 and 4.0 K for 1 and 2, respectively. To further probe the long-range ordering in 1 and 2, the ac magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed with different ac frequencies (Figure ). The ac susceptibility measurements of 1 in an oscillating field 3 Oe at 10, 100, and 997 Hz also indicate a magnetic phase transition occurred below 3 K because both in-phase \u03c7m' and out-of-phase \u03c7m'' were observed around this temperature. A peak at 3.3 K of the in-phase \u03c7m' was observed, but no peak of the \u03c7m'' curve was present, indicating the phase transition temperature is lower than 2 K (Figure a). Different from 1, the ac magnetic susceptibility measurements of 2 were performed with ac frequencies between 50 and 1000 Hz in an oscillating field 2.5 Oe (Figure b). The in-phase \u03c7m' and out-of-phase \u03c7m'' curves all show peaks that indicate a magnetic phase transition occurred below this temperature. The peaks in ac susceptibilities are sharper for 2 than for 1, which might be due to a disorder effect. Both the in-phase \u03c7m' and out-of-phase \u03c7m'' have a small frequency dependence, but the positions of the peaks \u03c7m' corresponding to the temperature are constant in the ac measurements, indicating that the single-chain magnetic behavior is not significant in 1 and 2. Similar examples have also been found in recently reported heterometallic ferrimagnetic systems. No significant hysteresis was found in 2 at 2 K ().
