The selectivity obviously arises from the rigidity of the Cu(II)-2,2',4,4'-bptc mother framework, which does not allow for significant changes in channel dimensions. Bpa and bpe are selected because they have the right size (N\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5N ~ 9.3 \u00c5 for the trans conformation), well matching the Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu distance (~13.2 \u00c5 in both 2 and 3) across the channels of the rigid frameworks. The channel is also suitable for the inclusion of coordinated py molecules without significant dimensional changes (the Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu distance across the channel in 1 is ~13.0 \u00c5). By contrast, bpy is too small and bpp too long to connect the opposite metal ions across the channel (bpp also has mismatching coordination orientation). The selective incorporation reflects the templating effects of the bpa, bpe, and py ligands in the assembly processes. It must be noted that all the compounds have been synthesized in the presence of py. We have been unable to obtain these compounds without py.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 13, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>In summary, three MOFs have been obtained from the tetracarboxylate ligand 2,2\u2032,4,4\u2032-bptc in the presence of different auxiliary pyridyl ligands.
