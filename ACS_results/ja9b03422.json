Indeed, 1a is remarkable at separating Xe from other inert gases. Single-component adsorption isotherms of Xe, Kr, N2, Ar, and O2 were collected at 298 and 313 K (c and S6). The results show exceptional performance of 1a for capturing Xe at low pressures, which is needed for actual industrial processes. The Xe adsorption isotherms present a typical type I profile with a very steep slope and approach saturation at very low pressure (~20 kPa at 298 K), indicative of high affinity for Xe. It is interesting to note that at 1.0 bar 1a takes up 66.1 and 58.9 cm3/cm3 at 298 and 313 K, respectively, corresponding to the gas occupancy of 1.18 and 1.05 Xe atoms per unit cell. At 298 K and 0.05 bar, the Xe uptake in 1a reaches 50.0 cm3/cm3, significantly higher than all previously reported state-of-the-art MOFs under the same conditions (e and ). The highest Xe uptake capacity of 1a under low pressure (\u22640.05 bar) (e) indicates that Xe atoms are packed much more efficiently within its pore landscape compared with other materials. In addition, the very high Xe/Kr selectivity over other materials (d) signifies the true potential of 1a for use as a sorbent material in separating Xe and Kr at extremely dilute concentrations.",
