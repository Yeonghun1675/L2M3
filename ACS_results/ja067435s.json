In contrast, both HTB MOFs collapse upon guest solvent removal presumably owing to the instability of the larger open channels in the two HTB MOFs. The N2 adsorption isotherm of PCN-6\u2018 (Figure a) indicates typical Type-I sorption behavior, with a Langmuir surface area of 2700 m2/g (pore volume 1.045 mL/g). This is lower than the Langmuir surface area of PCN-6 (3800 m2/g, pore volume 1.453 mL/g), although PCN-6\u2018 has a higher solvent-accessible volume (86%, calculated using PLATON10) than that of PCN-6 (74%). Thus, catenation has led to 41% increase in Langmuir surface area. This counter-intuitive increase can be attributed to that the new adsorption sites are formed by the catenation as well as the small pores formed as a result of catenation may strengthen the overall interaction between gas molecules and the pore walls therefore increase the apparent surface area, as predicted by a recent theoretical simulation. If open channels are blocked as a result of catenation, however, the overall surface area may drop significantly.  \n\nHydrogen adsorption studies revealed that PCN-6\u2018 activated at 50 \u00b0C can adsorb 1.35 wt % (volumetric uptake of 3.94 kg/m3, calculated density: 0.292 g/cm3) hydrogen at 760 Torr and 77 K (Figure b), significantly lower than that of PCN-6 activated at the same temperature (1.74 wt %; volumetric uptake of 9.19 kg/m3, calculated density: 0.528 g/cm3). Hence, catenation has led to a 133% of enhancement in volumetric (29% in gravimetric) hydrogen uptake. Previously we have reported that after activation at 150 \u00b0C, PCN-6 can adsorb 1.9 wt % hydrogen (at 760 Torr and 77 K), a 10% improvement over that of PCN-6 activated at 50 \u00b0C (Figure ). Similarly, after activation at 150 \u00b0C, PCN-6\u2018 can adsorb 1.62 wt % hydrogen, a 20% increase from that of PCN-6\u2018 activated at 50 \u00b0C (Figure ). These further improvements upon activation at 150 \u00b0C can only be attributed to UMCs.
