On the basis of the photoluminescence of other CuI compounds such as [CuI(\u03bc2-pyrazolate)]10b,d,e and [CuI(\u03bc2-S)] type complexes, the emissions of the two isomers are ascribed to a mixture of ligand-to-metal charge transfer (S \u2192 Cu) and metal center 3d94s1 modified by a Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu weak interaction.
