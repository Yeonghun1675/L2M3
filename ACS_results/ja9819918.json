The latter can be fully identified on the basis of its IR, 1H NMR, X-ray powder diffractions (XRPD; Figure b- vs 4b-1), and TG (Figure b, lines 2 vs 1) behaviors in comparison with those of an authentic specimen. Upon this transformation, the material apparently loses chirality and is rendered CD-silent. When the material is then allowed to be in contact with the ethanol vapor for several minutes at room temperature, a rapid ethanol/water exchange takes place to regenerate adduct 2, thereby restoring not only the original IR and 1H NMR spectra, XRPD (Figure a- vs 4a-1), and TG thermogram (Figure a, lines 2 vs 1) but also the CD spectrum with the same sign as that of the starting adduct 2 (see Experimental Section for details). Thus, the present ligand-induced chiral-achiral-chiral (2 through 3 back to 2) transformation in the solid state proceeds with a retention of chirality (helicity). This may represent a kind of memory of chirality, since there is no chiral induction when authentic achiral adduct 3 undergoes a similar transformation to adduct 2. The latter, identified on a similar IR, 1H NMR, XRPD (Figure a-), and TG (Figure a, line 3) basis, is obtained as a racemate without net chirality (see Experimental Section). Even in this case, however, homochiral helix winding can be seeded. Thus, achiral adduct 3 can be converted to P-2 or M-2 as desired when the former is first coground with a small amount (5 mol %) of P-2 or M-2 as a chiral seed and then exposed to the ethanol vapor. Material 3 derived from chiral P-2 or M-2 also serves as a seed to induce homochiral transformation of virgin achiral 3 to 2.
