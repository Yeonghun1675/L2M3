Dynamic CO2 adsorption experiments on DMF@InOF-1 exhibited a CO2 capture of 8.06 wt % [1.5-fold higher than that of a fully activated InOF-1 (5.24%)]. DMF@InOF-1 can reversibly adsorb/desorb 8.09% CO2 with no loss of CO2 capacity after 10 cycles, and the desorption is accomplished by only turning the CO2 flow off. Static CO2 adsorption experiments (at 196 K) demonstrated a 1.4-fold CO2 capture increase (from 5.5 mmol\u22c5g-1, fully activated InOF-1, to 7.5 mmol\u22c5g-1, DMF@InOF-1). Therefore, these CO2 capture properties are the result of the presence of residual-confined DMF molecules within the InOF-1 framework and their interactions via a very strong hydrogen bond with the In2(\u03bc-OH) groups, which prevent DMF leaching. The stability of this hydrogen bond is given by a perfect fit of the DMF molecule in the \"dent\" around the OH group that allows a nearly ideal orientation of the DMF molecule towards the OH group.\n\nCO2 Capture Studies\n\nDynamic and isothermal CO2 experiments (kinetic) were carried out on InOF-1 (see Activation Methods in the Supporting Information).  (InOF-1) shows the kinetic CO2 uptake experiment at 303 K. At this temperature, the material showed the maximum weight percentage gain, which indicates the maximum amount of CO2 captured. This amount corresponded to 5.24 wt %, and it was rapidly reached after only 5 min, remaining constant until the end of the experiment (10 min; , InOF-1).\n\nLater, we decided to investigate the stability of DMF@InOF-1 towards H2O by running a H2O adsorption isotherm on a freshly synthesized DMF@InOF-1 sample at 303 K (). The adsorbed amount of H2O slowly augmented with increasing pressure up to %P/P 0 = 20. Then, a rapid H2O uptake was observed in the pressure range from %P/P 0 = 20 to 30. Finally, from %P/P 0 = 30 to 80, there was a steady H2O weight increase, and the maximum H2O uptake at %P/P 0 = 80 was approximately 33.3 wt %.\n\nAdditionally, after the H2O adsorption experiment was finished, we decided to evaluate the maximum CO2 capture on this sample (DMF@InOF-1) by running a kinetic CO2 uptake experiment (see Figure S9 in the Supporting Information). The total CO2 capture was equal to 7.4 wt %, which indicated that the total CO2 uptake for the DMF@InOF-1 sample was slightly reduced (from approximately 8.1 to 7.4 wt %) after being exposed to high amounts of H2O (80% relative humidity). Therefore, high amounts of H2O can replace some of the DMF molecules in the DMF@InOF-1 material and, thus, reduce the CO2 adsorption capacity. However, when the DMF@InOF-1 sample was left for 7 days under ambient conditions (20 \u00b0C and 50% relative humidity), the total CO2 capture (determined by a kinetic CO2 uptake experiment) was equal to ~8.1 wt %.\n\nPerhaps the most important parameter for CO2 postcombustion applications for PCPs is the CO2 uptake at 0.15 bar and 40 \u00b0C and the N2 uptake at 0.75 bar and the same temperature (40 \u00b0C). Then, CO2 and N2 adsorption experiments were performed. The CO2 uptake of DMF@InOF-1 at 0.15 bar and 40 \u00b0C was equal to 0.22 mmol\u22c5g-1, whereas for the fully activated sample (InOF-1), this value was 0.19 mmol\u22c5g-1. Later, with these experimental measurements, we were able to calculate the adsorption selectivity for CO2 (\u03b1) for both materials. Thus, the uptake values of N2 at 40 \u00b0C and 0.75 bar for the DMF@InOF-1 and InOF-1 samples were 1.4 and 1.8 mmol\u22c5g-1, respectively. The CO2 selectivities for these materials were estimated to be \u03b1 = 0.79 and 0.53 for DMF@InOF-1 and InOF-1, respectively. Certainly, these selectivities are very low in comparison to those of other representative PCPs. \n\nA CO2 sorption experiment at 196 K was performed on a fully activated sample of InOF-1 (see Activation Methods in the Supporting Information), exhibiting a total CO2 uptake of 5.5 mmol\u22c5g-1 (24.2 wt %; see , InOF-1). Later, a newly as-synthesized InOF-1 was placed in a high-pressure cell (Belsorp HP) and activated (453 K and 10-3 bar for 1 h) \"in situ\" to prepare DMF@InOF-1. The CO2 uptake was measured from 0 to 1 bar at 196 K, and the resultant CO2 capture was 7.5 mmol\u22c5g-1 (33.2 wt %; , DMF@InOF-1).

The assessment of the BET surface area of DMF@InOF-1 was equal to 628 m2\u22c5g-1 with a pore volume of 0.32 cm3\u22c5g-1 (lower values than those for the fully activated InOF-1 vide supra, and see ). When these values are compared to those of different PCP materials, DMF@InOF-1 consistently showed, at 196 K, a CO2 uptake of 7.5 mmol\u22c5g-1, which is (in comparison) approximately half of the value for a microporous PCP material entitled PCM-15 (14.1 mmol\u22c5g-1).
