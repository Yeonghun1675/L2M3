However, each hexacoordinated Cd2 with a CdO4N2 environment is coordinated to three carboxylate oxygen atoms (O4, O5 a , and O6 a ) from two different 3,4-pyrdc ligands, one pyridyl nitrogen atom from another 3,4-pyrdc ligand (N1 b ), and an oxygen from a coordinated water molecule (O2W). The sixth coordination site is occupied by a N atom from a 4,4'-bipy linker (N4) (a). Here the Cd-O and Cd-N bond lengths around Cd2 are in the ranges of 2.225(4)-2.436(3) and 2.305(4)-2.356(3) \u00c5, respectively (Table S1). The bond angles around Cd1 and Cd2 are in the ranges of 53.69(10)-168.07(12) and 53.38(12)-167.68(12)\u00b0, respectively (Table S1). Here one 3,4-pyrdc ligand bridges three different Cd(II) centers through two chelating carboxylate groups and the pyridyl nitrogen atom, whereas the other 3,4-pyrdc ligand also connects three metal centers via a chelating carboxylate group, a monodentate carboxylate group, and the pyridyl nitrogen atom (Figure S4). Thus, two geometrically different Cd(II) centers connect with each other via two different 3,4-pyrdc ligands to form a wavelike 2D arrangement in the crystallographic ac plane (b). The 4,4'-bipy linkers connect the 2D metal-carboxylate sheets in a criss-cross and canted fashion to create a 3D arrangement (c) with two types of 1D channels (hexagonal and rectangular) along the crystallographic a axis that are occupied by guest water molecules. The dimensions of the hexagonal and rectangular channels are about 5.3 \u00c5 \u00d7 3.5 \u00c5 and 4.7 \u00c5 \u00d7 2.0 \u00c5, respectively, which provides a void space of ~29.3% of the total crystal volume. The 3D structure is also stabilized by intermolecular \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions () with centroid-cetroid distances in the range of 4.112-4.434 \u00c5.

Moreover, the water adsorption profiles show stepwise adsorptions in all three cases, which are attributed to their structural transformation on the basis of the very strong coordination affinity of water molecules with the unsaturated metal ions and the hydrogen-bonding affinity of water molecules with the free O atoms of the carboxylate groups in the framework. Therefore, it may be concluded that the close monitoring of the reversible structural transformation in all three cases will enlighten us for the understanding of crystal-to-crystal and crystal-to-amorphous transformations, which are essentially useful for the design of frameworks having the ability to interconvert in the presence of external stimuli. There is no doubt that such smart materials will serve the purpose of sensing and detection in the future along with several other interesting applications.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 39, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting\nInformation\nis available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.cgd.6b00610\">10.1021/acs.cgd.6b00610</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>IR spectra, crystallographic\nfigures and tables, TGA\nprofiles, PXRD patterns, FESEM images, UV\u2013vis spectra, adsorption/desorption\nisotherms, and CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> selectivities (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.cgd.6b00610/suppl_file/cg6b00610_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.cgd.6b00610.

The water isotherm of <bold>3\u2032</bold> displays the highest water uptake among the three compounds at <italic>P</italic>/<italic>P</italic>\n<sub>0</sub> \u2248 0.9, whereas in\nthe low pressure region (<italic>P</italic>/<italic>P</italic>\n<sub>0</sub> \u2248 0\u20130.5) the water uptake of <bold>3\u2032</bold> is lower than those of <bold>1\u2032</bold> and <bold>2\u2032</bold>.

It crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c. The asymmetric unit of 1 comprises two crystallographically independent Cd(II) metal centers (heptacoordinated Cd1 and hexacoordinated Cd2), two 3,4-pyrdc ligands, one 4,4'-bipy ligand, and two coordinated water molecules along with four guest water molecules. Each heptacoordinated Cd1 with a CdO5N2 environment is surrounded by two pairs of oxygen atoms (O1, O2 and O7 b , O8 b ) coming from two 3,4-pyrdc ligands, one oxygen from a water molecule (O1W), and two nitrogen atoms, one from a 4,4'-bipy ligand (N3) and one from a 3,4-pyrdc ligand (N2), composing a distorted pentagonal-bipyramidal geometry (a). The Cd1-O and Cd1-N distances around Cd1 are in the ranges of 2.297(3)-2.472(3) and 2.318(3)-2.400(3) \u00c5, respectively (Table S1). However, each hexacoordinated Cd2 with a CdO4N2 environment is coordinated to three carboxylate oxygen atoms (O4, O5 a , and O6 a ) from two different 3,4-pyrdc ligands, one pyridyl nitrogen atom from another 3,4-pyrdc ligand (N1 b ), and an oxygen from a coordinated water molecule (O2W). The sixth coordination site is occupied by a N atom from a 4,4'-bipy linker (N4) (a). Here the Cd-O and Cd-N bond lengths around Cd2 are in the ranges of 2.225(4)-2.436(3) and 2.305(4)-2.356(3) \u00c5, respectively (Table S1). The bond angles around Cd1 and Cd2 are in the ranges of 53.69(10)-168.07(12) and 53.38(12)-167.68(12)\u00b0, respectively (Table S1). Here one 3,4-pyrdc ligand bridges three different Cd(II) centers through two chelating carboxylate groups and the pyridyl nitrogen atom, whereas the other 3,4-pyrdc ligand also connects three metal centers via a chelating carboxylate group, a monodentate carboxylate group, and the pyridyl nitrogen atom (Figure S4). Thus, two geometrically different Cd(II) centers connect with each other via two different 3,4-pyrdc ligands to form a wavelike 2D arrangement in the crystallographic ac plane (b). The 4,4'-bipy linkers connect the 2D metal-carboxylate sheets in a criss-cross and canted fashion to create a 3D arrangement (c) with two types of 1D channels (hexagonal and rectangular) along the crystallographic a axis that are occupied by guest water molecules. The dimensions of the hexagonal and rectangular channels are about 5.3 \u00c5 \u00d7 3.5 \u00c5 and 4.7 \u00c5 \u00d7 2.0 \u00c5, respectively, which provides a void space of ~29.3% of the total crystal volume. The 3D structure is also stabilized by intermolecular \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions () with centroid-cetroid distances in the range of 4.112-4.434 \u00c5. Network analysis using TOPOS showed that the overall structure consists of (3,4)-connected trinodal nets with the point symbol (Schla\u0308fli symbol) {63}{65.8} (d).\n\nStructural Transformation: Thermogravimetric Analysis, Powder X-ray Diffraction, and Morphology Analysis\n\nTo check the thermal stability of the compounds reported in this paper, TGA of 1-3 was carried out. The TGA profile of 1 (Figure S6) indicates a gradual weight loss of 13.5% below 120 \u00b0C, which corresponds to the release of the four guest and two coordinated water molecules (calcd 13.18%) in a single step. No further weight loss was observed for this compound up to 240 \u00b0C, and after that the framework gradually decomposed. For compound 2, a weight loss of ~8.3% was observed up to 120 \u00b0C, which can be assigned to the loss of the one coordinated water and the half of a guest water molecule (calcd 7.98%) per formula unit. After this, it remains without any weight loss up to 270 \u00b0C followed by gradual decomposition (Figure S7). The TGA curve for compound 3 shows a gradual weight-loss step of 16.3% at 30-65 \u00b0C, corresponding to escape of all of the coordinated and guest water molecules (calcd 15.95%), and after that it gradually decomposes into unidentified products (Figure S8).\n\nAdsorption Properties\n\nEncouraged by the single-crystal X-ray structure and structural flexibility of 1-3, we determined the gas uptake capacities of the desolvated (activated) frameworks. Before the measurements, powder samples of 1-3 were evacuated at 120 \u00b0C for 4 h to obtain their activated forms 1'-3'. The N2 adsorption isotherms of the activated compounds 1'-3' at 77 K show type-II adsorption profiles with very low uptake, suggesting only surface adsorption (). Surprisingly, even though these compounds are nonporous toward N2, we found that they are porous toward CO2 at 195 K, for which these compounds reveal reversible type-I isotherms. The adsorption isotherms of compounds 1'-3' with CO2 at 195 K show uptakes of 39 cm3 g-1 (7.7 wt %), 19 cm3 g-1 (3.7 wt %), and 47 cm3 g-1 (9.2 wt %), respectively (). It is interesting to note that the desorption curve does not coincide with the adsorption curve, instead showing a large hysteretic sorption profile. The presence of the huge hysteresis in the adsorption-desorption isotherms indicates that the quadruple moment of CO2 molecules interacts strongly with the framework. The stronger interaction can be attributed to the presence of unsaturated M(II) sites within the host network and free oxygen atoms of carboxylate groups in desolvated states on the pore walls, which can effectively interact with the CO2 molecules as the carbon atom in CO2 is electron-deficient (Lewis acidic) in nature. This interaction provides extra energy for adsorption, to which the higher uptake of CO2 in the said compounds is attributed (). In comparison to compounds 1' and 3', a lower CO2 uptake in the case of 2' is observed, which is possibly due to the lower solvent-accessible void space.\n\nTo understand the interactions of water molecules with the flexible frameworks, we also performed water vapor adsorption measurements on activated samples of 1'-3' under ambient conditions (). All three compounds exhibit interesting water sorption profiles. Compound 1' shows very high H2O uptake (~37 cm3 g-1) at lower P/P 0 values (0.0-0.05), and the final uptake amount reaches 177.5 mL g-1, which corresponds to 5.6 molecules of H2O per formula unit (). For 2', the H2O adsorption profile exhibits a nice gate-opening-type profile: almost no uptake occurs at low pressure (P/P 0 ~ 0.1), but after this a steep rise leads to a final uptake of 121.5 cm3 g-1 (~3.4 molecules of H2O per formula unit) (). In the case of 3', up to a relative pressure of P/P 0 ~ 0.2 there is almost no uptake, and after that there is a gate opening leading to an uptake that reaches 243 cm3 g-1 (~7.2 molecules of H2O per formula unit) (). The water isotherm of 3' displays the highest water uptake among the three compounds at P/P 0 ~ 0.9, whereas in the low pressure region (P/P 0 ~ 0-0.5) the water uptake of 3' is lower than those of 1' and 2'. The low water uptake of 3' in the low-pressure region illustrates the amorphous nature of the framework along with the orientation of the hydrophobic -CH2 moieties of the bpp ligands toward the pore surface. The sharp uptake after that at higher partial pressures indicates the probable diffusion of H2O molecules in the pore surfaces. Moreover, the strong hysteresis and retention of water molecules even at very low pressure at the end of desorption signifies a strong interaction of water molecules with the unsaturated metal sites on the pore surface, which may also be responsible for the large water uptake by 3' at higher pressure.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula":
