Thermal decomposition starts in air in the thermal range of 200-300 \u00b0C, and a weight loss of 41% was detected.\n\nIn a nitrogen atmosphere, the decomposition path is, of course, different, and it occurs in three different thermal ranges: 250-300, 300-350, and 350-400 \u00b0C.\n\nIn these conditions, at 800 \u00b0C the residual mass was 25.7% in agreement with the formation of ZnS.\n\nComplex Zn2 exhibits a four-step decomposition path in air (see , Figure 6SM). The first one is between 100 \u00b0C up to 200 \u00b0C and corresponds to the loss of the water molecules present in the complex. A second loss is in the range of 200-400 \u00b0C, and it is ascribable to thermolysis of the ligand. The other two steps are comprised between 400 and 500 \u00b0C with a remaining weight of 21.8%, corresponding to the final formation of ZnO.", "data": [[[{"value": "200-300", "unit": "\u00b0C",
