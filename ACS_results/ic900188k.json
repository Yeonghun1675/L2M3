Upon cooling, the \u03c7M T product decreases continuously down to a value of 0.48 cm3 K mol-1 at 2.0 K, indicating an overall, moderate antiferromagnetic behavior. The compound exhibits a complicated pattern of interactions along the chain, and a fit of the data by means of analytical equations is not possible.
