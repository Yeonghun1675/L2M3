The H4L ligand with a 120\u00b0 space angle from the bilateral isophthalate moieties may induce the fabrication of a Cu(II)-paddlewheel threshold that has been found in the well-known MOP-1.

Fascinatingly, 1 preserves the porous characteristic with the alignment of open metal sites and functional sites, shows a high performance for H2 capture (193 cm3 g-1 at 77 K), and also shows selective separation of CO2 over N2 and CH4.\n\nThermogravimetric Analysis\n\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for 1 indicates a rapid weight loss of 41.3% from room temperature to 285 \u00b0C, which accords with the departure of disordered solvents and H2O molecules (calcd: 46.1%).

The powder XRD pattern for 1 after adsorption-desorption tests is also in good agreement with the simulated one, indicating the stability of the material (Figure S1). Also, the powder XRD patterns of different solvent exchanged samples are similar to the simulated one, which proved the stability of the structure. The IR, PXRD, and TGA of desorbed samples can also confirm its stability (Figures S1-S3).\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nThe structure of 1 contains one crystallographically distinct L ligand bridging two distinct types of carboxylate dimer SBUs (Figures S4 and S5). One of the SBUs contains the Cu1 and Cu2 ions, while the other contains two symmetry related Cu3 atoms. Each ligand coordinates to four of these SBUs, two of each type, while each SBU connects four ligands. While all of the carboxylate oxygen atoms of each ligand are coordinated, the pyridyl nitrogen is uncoordinated. Unlike most MOFs bearing isophthalate moieties, 1 does not have cuboctahedral SBUs. Instead, it only shows 1D channels along the a and b axes and the free pyridyl groups oriented to the pores (a,b and Figure S6). Hence, there is a three-dimensional (3D) channel in the whole structure (c), and the channel has a maximum pore diameter of 7.65 \u00c5 and pore limiting diameter of 6.05 \u00c5 calculated by Poreblazer. This phenomenon is also found for PCN-305. The topology of the structure can be simplified to a trinodal 4-c net, where the nodes represent the 4-connecting ligand and the two 4-connecting SBUs (d). This net has (44.62)(43.62.8)2(42.82.102) topology. Compared to PCN-305, it adopts the 4-nodal net with a topological symbol of (4.64.8)2(42.64)(64.82)2(66). The different topology can be ascribed to the distinct SBU. The calculation by PLATON with the probe radius of 1.8 \u00c5 illustrates a total solvent accessible volume amounts to 8592.7 \u00c53 per unit cell, which accounts for 63.9% of the cell volume, offering possibilities for gas adsorption.\n\nGas Adsorption\n\nThe permanent porosity of 1 was confirmed by the nitrogen adsorption studies at 77 K (a). The nitrogen adsorption of 1 exhibits a reversible type I isotherm and reaches saturation at 526 cm3 g-1 at 1 bar, indicating the microporous nature of the sample. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Langmuir specific surface areas of 1 are 1860 and 2256 m2 g-1, respectively. The experimental total pore volume of 1 is 0.80 cm3 g-1. The PSD based on NLDFT adsorption models using the nitrogen adsorption data at 77 K exhibits a narrow distribution of micropores at 5.9-22 \u00c5, which is consistent with the internal structural features of cages (Figure S7).\n\nMeanwhile, H2, CO2, and CH4 uptake capacities were also measured. At the temperatures of 77 and 87 K, we investigated the gravimetric H2 uptake in 1 (b). Both the H2 isotherms show good reversibility without hysteresis, showing that the interaction between H2 and the framework of 1 is physisorption. The H2 uptake capacity is up to 193 cm3 g-1 (1.78 wt %, 8.9 mmol g-1) at 1 atm and 77 K, and 133 cm3 g-1 (1.18 wt %, 5.9 mmol g-1) at 1 atm and 87 K, respectively. Although the value of H2 uptake capacity is less than that of the record MOFs, such as [Cu(Me-4py-trz-ia)] (3.07 wt %) and PCN-12 (3.05 wt %), it is still comparable with many famous porous MOF materials reported in the literature at the same conditions. The high H2 uptake capacity could be due to the alignment of open Cu(II) active sites in 1. Additionally, the Q st for H2 is about 7.5 kJ mol-1 at zero coverage, and then slightly decreases to 5.4 kJ mol-1 at high coverage (Figure S8). The value of the Q st is higher than those of reported MOFs, such as UMCM-150 (7.3 kJ mol-1), PCN-46 (7.2 kJ mol-1), MOF-5 (4.7-5.2 kJ mol-1), and MOF-177 (4.4 kJ mol-1). \n\nIn addition, single-component low pressure gas adsorptions of CO2, CH4, and N2 were also measured. As shown in a, the maximum adsorbed amounts of CO2, CH4, and N2 on 1 are up to 102, 28, and 9 cm3 g-1 at 273 K and 1 bar, respectively. In the meantime, CO2, CH4, and N2 uptake capacity at 293 K and 1 bar were also measured (Figure S9). The reason for preferential adsorption CO2 can be attributed to its much higher quadrupole moment. The significant difference of gas uptakes caused us to explore the CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 separation performance. Here, the IAST method was used to predict binary mixture selectivity. To mimic the composition of the flue gas, IAST calculations were carried out assuming a CO2/N2 binary mixture with a molar ratio of 15:85. As shown in b and Figure S10, the values of IAST CO2/N2 selectivity reach 55 and 25.8 at 273 and 293 K, respectively, which indicated that 1 could serve as a potential candidate for postcombustion CO2 capture. The column breakthrough curves of 1 were also measured using a binary 15:85 CO2/N2 mixture at 293 K and 1 bar to simulate more practical CO2 capture applications (Figure S11). The CO2 uptake of 1 in the columns was calculated as 1.1 mmol g-1 for the 15:85 CO2/N2 mixture at 293 K and 1 bar, which is lower than the values obtained from the single-component adsorption isotherms (2.9 mmol g-1 at 293 K and 1 bar). The reason could be attributed to the weak CO2/N2 selectivity and low adsorption rate under gas mixture conditions. On the other hand, the calculated CO2/CH4 selectivity ratio is up to 13.3 and 6.8 under 273 and 293 K from equimolar mixtures (b and Figure S10), which is higher than those from the reported comparable structures (PCN-305, PCN-306, PCN-307, PCN-308).
