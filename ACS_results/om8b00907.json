Complexes 1 and 2 possess an electron-rich platinum center which provides the possibility of preparing new bi- or multinuclear complexes containing Pt-M dative bond units. Thus, we decided to examine the reactivity of bis-cyclometalated complexes 1 and 2 toward AuI and TlI species and to carry out comparative structural and photophysical studies. While reactions of 2 with TlPF6 and [Au(PPh3)]+ did not yield products that could be characterized, the reaction of 1 with 1 equiv of TlPF6 at room temperature in acetone led to the production of PtII-TlI complex [Pt(ptpy)2Tl]PF6, 3, in good yield by the formation of a Pt-Tl dative bond ().", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 8, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Molecular structures of complex <bold>1</bold> (a) and <bold>2</bold> (b).</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"om-2018-00907a_0001.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Molecular structures of complex 1 (a) and 2 (b).

No <sup>195</sup>Pt NMR\nsignals was found for <bold>4</bold> at 298 or 323 K because of the\nfast dissociation equilibrium.</p>", "clean_text": "The 31P{1H} NMR of complex 4 (Figure S16) at 323 K showed a singlet signal at \u03b4 25.1. 1H,1H-COSY DQ and 1H NMR spectra of 4 (Figures S17 and S18) at the same temperature showed four sets of correlations in the aromatic region (8.87, 7.65, 8.16, and 8.18 ppm for pyridyl rings; 7.81 and 7.18 ppm for p-tolyl ring protons, 8.17 ppm for CH groups adjacent to coordinated C atoms; and 7.13, 7.43, and 7.58 for the phenyl protons of the PPh3 group). The methyl signal was found as a sharp singlet at \u03b4 2.40. Lowering the temperature to 273 K splits the phosphorus singlet signal into two singlet signals at \u03b4 22.8 and 33.0 without platinum satellites (). These observations revealed that 4 undergoes a dynamic process in solution. Thus, the 31P{1H} NMR spectrum of complex 4 was monitored as a function of temperature in the acetone-d 6 solution (). A change in the relative intensities and broadness of two phosphorus signals was observed upon cooling from room temperature to 213 K. As the temperature was lowered, the phosphorus resonance at \u03b4 22.8 became more broadened and shifted to upfield, while the phosphorus resonance at \u03b4 33.0 became sharp and did not show any coupling with the platinum atom. Consistently, the 31P{1H} EXSY NMR spectrum of 4 (a) at 213 K in acetone-d 6 showed cross-peaks between two phosphorus resonances. Thus, we suggest that Pt-Au bond in 4 is labile and both of the free and platinum-coordinated forms of [Au(PPh3)]+ are in a dissociation-association equilibrium (), and the phosphorus resonances observed at \u03b4 33.0 and 23.8 ppm can be assigned to the P atoms of the free and platinum-coordinated fragment [Au(PPh3)]+, respectively. This is in contrast to the previously reported heterobinuclear Pt-Au(PR3) complexes that showed only dynamic intramolecular rearrangements. A second dynamic process was observed at lower temperature with a platinum-coordinated fragment [Au(PPh3)]+. When the temperature was decreased to -193 K, signals due to the platinum-coordinated fragment [Au(PPh3)]+ shifted to downfield and appeared as a singlet signal at \u03b4 18.7 ppm which was coupled to platinum atoms to give satellites with 1 J PtP = 785 Hz. It is important to note that this resonance does not show correlation with the resonance of the phosphorus atom of the free fragment [Au(PPh3)]+ in the 31P{1H} EXSY NMR spectrum of 4 at 193 K (b). These NMR data, therefore, show that platinum-coordinated fragment [Au(PPh3)]+ at 193 K rearranges to a new Pt-Au bond complex that does not dissociate to platinum and gold fragments and persists in solution at this condition. On the basis of the represented NMR data, the crystal structure of 4 and the previously reported cyclometalated PtII-AuI complex that exhibited persistent of Pt-Au bond in solution, we proposed that Pt-coordinated fragment [Au(PPh3)]+ forms a strong Au-C ipso  bonding interaction in solution at 193 K, as shown in . Inspection of  reveals that the 31P NMR signal of 4 at 193 K is not as sharp as one might expect if a blocked conformation for the Pt-Au adduct 4 were present in solution. A possible reason for this can be the migration of the platinum-coordinated fragment [Au(PPh3)]+ between two C ipso  atoms of two ptpy ligands. We have completed the NMR study of 4 in solution by recording 1H and 195Pt{1H} NMR spectra at various temperatures. The dynamic 1H NMR spectra of 4 () showed that at 298 K the PPh3 proton signals are very broad, while the tolylpyridyl proton signals are relatively sharp. Interestingly, recording the 1H NMR spectrum at 193 K showed very broad signals for the coordinated tolylpyridyl protons and relatively sharp signals for the PPh3 protons. This is in accord with our hypothesis on the formation, at low T, of a relatively strong Pt-Au bond and a relatively labile C-Au bond, possibly because of a \"walking\" of the Au from one coordinated C to the other. Consistently, the methyl group protons of the coordinated ptpy show, at 193 K, a broad 1H signal which is compatible with the presence of two unequivalent (albeit almost isochronous) methyl groups in mutual exchange (b). The 195Pt{1H} NMR spectrum of 4 at 193 K showed a very broad signal at \u03b4 -3589 ppm (Figure S20) which is slightly upfield shifted in comparison with that of the starting complex 1 (\u03b4 -3553 ppm, Figure S21).

The solid-state structure of 4 displayed two different short and long PtII-AuI bonds. The length of the short bonds were in the range of Pt0-AuI bonds, while the long bonds were supported by strong Au-C ipso  bonds. In contrast to the previously reported PtII-AuI(PR3) complexes that show less labile PtII-AuI bond and undergo intramolecular dynamic processes, NMR spectroscopy showed that complex 4 has a PtII-AuI labile bond at room temperature and undergoes a dissociation-association equilibrium in solution and a second dynamic process at low temperature between supported and unsupported Pt-Au bond forms of 4. The heterobinuclear complexes 3 and 4 exhibit bright red and orange emissions in solid state, respectively.
