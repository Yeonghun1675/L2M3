The corresponding energy-dispersive spectroscopy also verified the encapsulation of Cu2+ in 1a (Figure S13). The X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) spectrum of Cu2+@1a was monitored (Figure S14). In the XPS spectrum, the peak at 933.16 eV can be ascribed to Cu2+ 2p3. The XRD pattern and IR curve for Cu2+@1a showed peaks similar to those of 1a, suggesting that the main framework remains in its original structure even after metal-ion immobilization in aqueous solution (Figures S15 and S16). As for the reason for the quenching by Cu2+, we speculate that it might be attributed to the fact that Cu2+ can rapidly diffuse into the adaptable channels or interlayer of 1a and be recognized by the terminal Lewis basic sites and/or the carboxylate group. The interaction between the Cu2+ ions and ligands minimizes the energy-transfer efficiency, thus decreasing the luminescent intensity.
