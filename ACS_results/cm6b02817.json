This observation would support the idea that, at higher pressures, i.e., loadings above 2 H2 per Fe, some higher energy binding sites become occupied so that the average decrease in binding energy is not as much as that for the first two loadings. These differences are, however, rather small and not reflected in an obvious way in the values of Q st at higher loadings since the binding energies for all the sites in this region are very similar in magnitude.
