The room temperature \u03c7T value of 5.78 emu K mol-1 is consistent with that expected for three isolated S = 3/2 spin centers (i.e., 5.63 emu K mol-1). The close agreement between the experimental and expected room temperature \u03c7T(T) values suggests that there is very little spin-orbit coupling in this system. This observation is corroborated by a poor fit to an equation for 4T1g ions, which accounts for spin-orbit coupling. Instead, the data can be fit by an expression for S = 3/2 systems with dominant zero field splitting effects, D, eq 1-4:                where N is Avogadro's number, \u03bc B , the Bohr Magneton, k B, Boltzmann's constant, g, the Lande g value, and D, the zero field splitting, with g = 2.01 and D = 38.9 cm-1. There are surprisingly few quantitative reports of D in octahedral CoII complexes. However, D = 82.7 cm-1 was found for the highly tetragonally distorted six-coordinate complex Co(acac)2(H2O)2 (acac = acetylacetonate), while D = 53 cm-1 was observed for Co(pyridine-N-oxide)6[ClO4]2, which exhibits a slight (crystallographically unobservable) trigonal distortion.
