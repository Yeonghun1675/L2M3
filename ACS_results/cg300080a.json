Four novel CPs (2a,b, 4, and 5) and a hexanuclear complex forming a porous 3D supramolecular assembly (3) have been obtained from compound 1a by exchanging monotopic neutral ligands with bpy. While the coordinative flexibility of CuII makes difficult to forecast the structures of the reaction products, on the other hand the use of this particular SBU makes possible achieving a large panel of new products through simple reactions. Actually, the quite stable 3D CP 2 was obtained by using low bpy/1a reaction ratios, while a large excess of bpy led to the formation of the hexanuclear complex 3, a porous material self-assembled simply through relatively weak noncovalent interactions. In this compound two perpendicular hydrophobic channels are present and guest bpy molecules are hosted in one of them, while the other one is empty. This particularly interesting crystal structure seems to be largely dependent on the presence of guest bpy. In fact, the attempt to remove guest bpy under a vacuum and dissolution in protic solvents demolishes the supramolecular porous assembly. Moreover, attempts to recrystallize 3 in MeOH in the absence of an excess of bpy lead also to a partial decomposition of the trinuclear triangular structure, with formation of a 3D CP, obtained through interpenetration of flat porous sheets, (4) and of a waved 2D CP (5). On the other hand, 3 is instead quite stable in several aprotic solvents (where it is insoluble), and by soaking it in these solvents the guest bpy molecules can be removed and the porous crystal structure remains intact. Solvent molecules do not occupy the \"holes\" left by bpy, but are present in the crystal lattice at the intersection of the perpendicular channels, as a few, disordered molecules. These facts suggest the possibility that 3, in suitable conditions, may act as a sorbent species for gases and other organic or inorganic molecules, a potentially interesting feature from catalytic and environmental points of view. Work is in progress in our laboratories to examine these possibilities. Finally, compounds 2 and 3 are valuable catalyst precursors for the r.t. peroxidative oxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone by aqueous H2O2.
