In contrast, the HOMO-1s primarily comprise a d\u03c3* orbital (55%), with considerable contribution from a \u03c0* orbital (37%); moreover, the d\u03c3* orbital is significantly destabilized because of a strong \u03c3* interaction between the 4d z 2  orbitals due to the significantly short Rh-Rh distances. The energies of the HOMOs and HOMO-1s are similar (\u0394E ~ 0.25 eV), indicating the pseudodegeneracy of these orbitals. The HOMO-LUMO gap is 1.76 eV. Third, in the trimer model 2-1-8, the d\u03c3* orbital with a large overlap of the d z 2  orbitals is further destabilized because of the strong \u03c3* Rh-Rh interaction, leading to the HOMO. In contrast, the energy levels of the semiquinonato \u03c0* orbitals are almost unchanged due to lack of direct interactions among them, resulting in the HOMO-1 and HOMO-2, i.e., the interesting SOMO-HOMO energy-level conversion has occurred, and the HOMO-LUMO gap is decreased to 1.37 eV. Hence, on the basis of these results, the 1D d band formed from the d z 2  orbitals in the solid state is expected to further expand due to the effect of the 1D chain, leading to a further approach of the upper levels of the filled d band to the LUMO levels composed of the vacant \u03c0* orbitals. As a possible explanation of the origin of the phase transition observed in the magnetic susceptibility under applied pressures above 3.6 kbar, the upper levels of the d band can be considered to interact with the LUMO levels as the Rh-Rh distance decreases under the applied pressure. This interaction would lead to the mixed-valence state due to the charge transfer from the filled d band to vacant \u03c0* orbitals because the application of pressure primarily results in a decrease in the Rh-Rh distance.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 27, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>To estimate the effective exchange\nintegral <italic toggle=\"yes\">J</italic>, we calculated the energies of the high-spin\n(HS) triplet state and the low-spin (LS) spin-singlet state of the\ndimer units in the intra- and interchains using the unrestricted hybrid\nfunctional DFT method (UB3LYP).

The observed bistability is due to a thermal hysteresis across a first-order phase transition that accompanies the exchange of the interchain C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen-bond partners between the semiquinonato ligands. The strong overlaps of complex molecules lead to strong ferromagnetic interactions in the LT phase; moreover, the magnetic interactions in the 1D chain drastically change from strongly ferromagnetic in the LT phase to antiferromagnetic in the RT phase with the hysteresis. DFT calculations for the dimer and trimer models could not reproduce the strong ferromagnetic interaction observed for the compound 3; however, the result for the dimer model is consistent with the large negative J value observed for a dimer complex. Therefore, the spin state of the coordination polymer 3 is considered to be completely different from that of the dimer complex. The reproduction of the very strong ferromagnetic interaction of 3 by theoretical calculation is an important future issue to understand the electronic structure of this type of coordination polymer. The electrical conductivity at 300 K is 4.8 \u00d7 10-4 S cm-1, which is relatively high despite Rh not being in a mixed-valence state. This relatively high conductivity can be attributed to the reduction of the energy gap between the upper level of the filled 1D d band and the vacant semiquinonato \u03c0* levels because of the remarkable expanse of the d band due to the strong Rh-Rh interactions. The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity also demonstrates a clear hysteresis across the first-order phase transition, indicating that the present compound exhibits bistability with respect to its magnetic and conductive properties. Reflecting a characteristic of the bistability, the ferromagnetic LT phase can be easily stabilized up to RT by the application of a relatively weak pressure of 1.4 kbar, thereby demonstrating that simultaneous control of the multifunctionality through external perturbation is possible.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 34, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The nature for the remarkable difference in the electronic states\nin the RT and LT phases could not be explained clearly on the basis\nof our experimental results.
