The desolvated CSMCRI-1 (hereafter 1') does not reveal any plateau up to 370 \u00b0C and decomposes thereafter. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of the as-synthesized crystals reveals complete agreement with that of the simulated pattern, indicating high crystallinity and phase purity of the sample (a). Desolvation leads to a slight shift of Bragg's reflections (a) that may result because of the release of solvent guests from the porous channel. Interestingly, the low-angle peaks were restored upon exposure of 1' to DMF (a). It is worth mentioning that such a modification in the PXRD patterns upon desolvation and resolvation is not unique and has been realized in the interpenetrated pillar-layer frameworks. In addition, stability of CSMCRI-1 was checked in diverse organic solvents as well as in water and open air. As displayed in b, the characteristic peaks in PXRD remain unchanged in all cases up to 24 h, whereas slight broadening of peaks occurs upon exposure to water for a prolonged time. Variable temperature PXRD up to 250 \u00b0C reveals sufficient stability of the framework (Figure S4). To assess the permanent porosity, nitrogen gas sorption isotherm was attempted. Prior to measurement, the guest solvents in the as-synthesized crystals were exchanged with dichloromethane and degassed overnight under vacuum at 120 \u00b0C to generate 1'. The framework shows 86 cm3/g of N2 gas uptake at 77 K up to 1.0 relative pressure (P/P 0) that corresponds to a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of 112.69 m2/g.

Following the typical procedure (vide supra), changes in the luminescence spectra were monitored by the incremental addition of selected nitro analytes (1 mM in DMF) up to 200 \u03bcL to a dispersion of 1 mg of guest-free crystals of CSMCRI-1 (Figures S32-S37). As shown in a, the fluorescence intensity of 1' radically decreased with the incremental addition of TNP solution. To our delight, 1' showed a quenching efficiency of 94 and 86% toward TNP and 2,4-DNP, respectively. However, other NACs as well as nitro-aliphatic DMDNB show a minor quenching effect (b,c). The quenching efficiencies were in the order TNP > 2,4-DNP \u226b 4-NP > 3-NP > 2-NP > 4-NT > 2,4-DNT > DMDNB (Figure S31), which firmly validate the selective recognition of TNP. To quantify the quenching constant (K SV) and identify the nature of quenching process (static vs dynamic), S-V plots were obtained by plotting the relative fluorescence intensity [(I 0/I)] with [A] molar concentration of TNP. The curve deviated from linearity at higher concentration (Figure S38), indicating the presence of dynamic and static quenching processes. However, the S-V plots for all other NACs remain linear in nature. The quenching constant for TNP, calculated from the linear region of the above-mentioned curve at lower concentration range (0.0-0.04 mM), was found to be 4.6 \u00d7 104 M-1 (Figure S39), which ranks among the highest values to most of the TNP sensory MOFs and comparable to the famous MOFs for TNP detection (Table S10). Essentially, such an extraordinary quenching value further necessitates quantification of LOD, which was calculated by monitoring the quenching effect via incremental addition of 10 \u03bcM TNP solution to the dispersion of activated CSMCRI-1 (Figure S42). The LOD was found (Table S4) to be 0.53 ppm (0.4 \u03bcM), which is superior to most of the reported MOFs till date (Table S10). Encouraged by its extreme luminescence quenching and coupled with the utmost importance for selective detection of superiorly explosive TNP in the presence of other nitro congeners, we next examined the competitive analytes test of 1' toward TNP.
