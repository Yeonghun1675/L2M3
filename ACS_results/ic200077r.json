The conductance value (\u03c3) of 1 is 1.36 \u00d7 10-6 S cm-1 at 318 K. With an increase of the temperature, the conductance value decreases and reaches 0.84 \u00d7 10-6 S cm-1 at 328 K, 0.44 \u00d7 10-6 S cm-1 at 338 K, 0.16 \u00d7 10-6 S cm-1 at 348 K, and 0.04 \u00d7 10-6 S cm-1 at 358 K. The Nyquist plot almost becomes a beeline at 368 K. A powder X-ray diffraction study at different temperatures and thermogravimetric analysis (Figure S3 and S4 in the ) reveal that the 3D framework of 1 is maintained during the ac impedance measurements. Thus, a decrease of the conductance value is attributed to the removal of guest water molecules. The origin of conductivity may be derived from transfer of a proton, where guest water molecules act as suppliers of protons.
