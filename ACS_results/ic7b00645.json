The final residue of both compounds 1 and 2 is Zn2P2O7 (JCPDS 72-1702). Recently, softer ligands and metal ions were used in the formation of a hybrid zinc phosphate and two zinc imidazolate frameworks, which exhibited high thermal stability up to 500 \u00b0C (in air) and 550 \u00b0C (under a N2 atmosphere), respectively. The low thermal stabilities for 1 and 2 can be attributed to the decomposition of diprotonated amines in the channels of the structures.\n\nThe authors declare no competing financial interest.\n\nCrystal data for 1: orthorhombic, space group Pnma, Z = 8, M r = 309.53 g mol-1, a = 9.7585(2) \u00c5, b = 27.6003(7) \u00c5, c = 8.4144(2) \u00c5, V = 2266.31(9) \u00c53, D calc = 1.814 g cm-3, \u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5, \u03bc = 2.322 mm-1, 3668 unique reflections with I > 2\u03c3(I), GOF = 1.097, R 1 = 0.0378, and wR 2 = 0.0778.
