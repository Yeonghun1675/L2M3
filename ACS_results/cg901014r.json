The phenomenon of structural diversification in 1-10 may mainly arise from two sources: (i) These dicarboxylate anions exhibit several coordination patterns, in which the carboxylate groups can adopt the unidentate, chelating, and bridging modes, respectively. ii) Although the bpt isomers always behave as the bidentate connectors in these coordination networks (partial monodentate in 9 and 10), the differently oriented pyridyl N atoms in these isomers may play significant roles in the formation of different topological structures. Fom the viewpoint of crystal engineering, we can generally discover that in all these structures the dicarboxylate isomers link the metal centers to form 1-D chains (for MOFs 1-5 and 7-10) or 2-D layer (for MOF 6), and their final structural discrepancies mainly come from the further extension of these arrays by the isomeric bpt connectors in different directions, which however cannot be accurately forecasted.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 29, "type": "text", "classification": ["property"], "content": "<title>Magnetic Properties</title><p>The magnetic properties of <bold>1</bold>\u2212<bold>8</bold> were investigated in the 2.0\u2212300.0 K range at 1000 Oe.

For 1 (Figure a), the thermal evolution of \u03c7M -1 obeys Curie-Weiss law, \u03c7M = C/(T - \u03b8) over the whole temperature range from 300 to 40 K with Weiss constant, \u03b8, of -21.14 K and the Curie constant, C, of 3.30 cm3 K mol-1. The \u03c7M T value at 300 K is 3.07 cm3 K mol-1 (4.96 \u03bcB), which is much higher than the expected value (1.88 cm3 K mol-1, 3.87 \u03bcB) of one magnetically isolated spin-only Co (II) ions (S = 3/2, g = 2.0) but close to the value expected when the spin momentum and orbital momentum exist independently [5.20 \u03bcB; \u03bcLS = [L(L + 1) + 4S(S + 1)]1/2; L = 3, S = 3/2]. This indicates that an important contribution of the orbital angular momentum typical for the 4T1g ground term is involved.

This was further confirmed by the observed featureless FC/ZFC curve obtained at a very low field of 50 Oe (Figure S11 in the ).\n\nFor 2, which has structural and magnetic properties similar to those of 1, the \u03c7M T value at 300 K is 3.15 cm3 K mol-1, which is much higher than the expected value (1.88 cm3 K mol-1) of one magnetically isolated spin-only Co(II) ion (Figure a).

The magnetic behavior of 2 is unusual and interesting, indicative of a strong single-ion behavior admixture with a weak ferromagnetic interaction caused by spin-canting. The fit of the curve for \u03c7M -1 versus T plot of 2 to the Curie-Weiss law gives a good result in the temperature range of 40-300 K with C = 3.30 cm3 K mol-1 and \u03b8 = -14.84 K. The combined magnetic interactions can be approximated with the eq  over the temperature range about 16-300 K, give A + B = 3.30 cm3 K mol-1, E 1 /k = 50.82 K and E 2 /k = -0.82 K (corresponding to J = 1.64 K).\n\nFor 3, unlike 1 and 2, the magnetic properties of this compound are quite ordinary (Figure ).

The Curie-Weiss fit of \u03c7M -1 above 20 K results in a Curie constant C = 3.023 cm3 K mol-1 and \u03b8 = -2.565 K. As for many Co2+ compounds, substantial spin-orbit coupling contributes to the high \u03c7M T and C values. The decrease at high temperature is related to the depopulation of the higher energy Kramer's doublets of the Co(II) centers with a 4T1 ground state. The increase in the values of \u03c7M T below 16 K must be attributed to the presence of intramolecular ferromagnetic interactions between the Co(II) ions mediated by the syn-anti carboxylate bridge.

As T is lowered, \u03c7M T decreases continuously to a value of 0.68 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K. This behavior indicates a dominant antiferromagnetic interaction between the Co(II) ions in the structures. In 6, the Co\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Co distance through the 3,3'-bpt bridge is 11.902 \u00c5, and it is 7.707 \u00c5 through the m-BDC bridge. The long Co\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Co distances exclude an efficient direct exchange between the Co(II) ions. Therefore, the overall antiferromagnetic interaction should be mainly attributed to the magnetic exchange coupling within the [Co(CO2)2Co] dimeric unit. The \u03c7M -1 versus T plot of 6 is in correspondence with the Curie-Weiss law in the range of 30-300 K with C = 3.22 cm3 K mol-1 and \u03b8 = -21.191 K.\n\nFor 7, the \u03c7M T value at 300 K is 3.16 cm3 K mol-1, which is much higher than the expected value (1.88 cm3 K mol-1) of one magnetically isolated spin-only Co(II) ions (Figure ). As T is lowered, \u03c7M T continuously decreases and reaches a local minimum of 2.16 cm3 K mol-1 at about 16 K and then increases to a value 2.62 cm3 K mol-1 at 9 K, before dropping quickly to 1.88 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K. The fit of the curve for \u03c7M -1 versus T plot of 7 to the Curie-Weiss law gives a good result in the temperature range of 50-300 K with C = 3.38 cm3 K mol-1 and \u03b8 = -21.25 K. The magnetic behavior of 7 is unusual and interesting, substantial spin-orbit coupling contributes to the high \u03c7M T and C values. The combination of negative \u03b8 and increasing \u03c7M T below 16 K suggests a strong single-ion behavior admixture with a weak ferromagnetic interaction. In 7, the nearest Co\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Co distance through the interlayer H-bonds is 5.052 \u00c5; the long Co\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Co distances exclude an efficient direct exchange between the Co(II) ions. Therefore, we believe that the weak ferromagnetic interaction is caused by spin-canting, which arises from the antisymmetric 3,4'-bpt bridge. The presence of the bifurcation point between the FC/ZFC magnetization curves below 9 K (Figures S17) indicates the occurrence of the phase transition near 9 K. The reduced molar magnetization (M/N\u03b2 value per Co(II) ions) at 2 K tends to 2.41 N\u03b2. Indeed, there is a rapid and abrupt increase of M/N\u03b2 at low fields (Figure S19, ). This is the signature of long-range order commented on above when dealing with the FC and ZFC magnetization curves at low temperature.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "1", "chemical
