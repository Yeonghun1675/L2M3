In contrast, ligand repulsion may actually be at work in preventing the triangles from becoming fully eclipsed to give three M-M contacts. That ligand effects are not responsible for the pairing is amply demonstrated by the crystal structure of [3,5-Me2pzH]3 which, although it retains the planar trimeric association via hydrogen-bonding, does not display a \"packing\" arrangement consisting of a dimer of trimers as in [Cu(3,5-Me2pz)]3.
