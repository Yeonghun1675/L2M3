As anticipated, compounds {1   x   6  1-  x   }dry (x = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75) do not adsorb any nitrogen at 77 K in the pressure range of 0-1 bar, while CO2 is adsorbed in a two-step manner at 195 K. A comparison of the obtained CO2 isotherms with the sorption data of the pure compounds 1dry and 6dry shows remarkable results (Figure ). As already discussed 1dry and 6dry possess a very different sorption behavior. 1dry undergoes the  np  \u2192  lp  transition at a CO2 pressure of approximately 0.23 bar and features a small hysteresis, whereas 6dry has a phase transition pressure of ca. 0.65 bar and a very large hysteresis. We expect that the transition pressure of the MOF solid solutions is linearly increasing with increasing amounts of DB-bdc and can therefore be accurately adjusted by the ratio of the two linkers. As displayed in Figure  compound {1  0.75  6  0.25  }dry undergoes the phase transition at approximately 0.32 bar, while {1  0.50  6  0.50  }dry shows the framework expansion at approximately 0.50 bar. At the same time the width of the hysteresis is increasing and the reverse  lp  \u2192  np  transition is shifting to lower pressures. However, the sorption capacity at saturation (p(CO2) = 1 bar), which is very different for the pure compounds (104 cm3 g-1 for 1dry; 55 cm3 g-1 for 6dry), is almost unaffected in {1  0.75  6  0.25  }dry and {1  0.50  6  0.50  }dry and amounts to approximately 100 cm3 g-1. Hence, the sorption capacity is non-linearly scaling with the applied linker ratio.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 36, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>Remarkably, in compound <bold>{1</bold>\n<sub>\n<bold>0.25</bold>\n</sub>\n<bold>6</bold>\n<sub>\n<bold>0.75</bold>\n</sub>\n<bold>}dry</bold> the phase transition occurs at a much higher\nCO<sub>2</sub> pressure (0.80 bar) than for the pure compound <bold>6dry</bold>.
