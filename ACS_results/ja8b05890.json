This peak shifts toward lower degrees after MUV-2(29) is soaked with different solvents during 24 h (). As also observed in MIL-88, the breathing behavior is very selective, and the pore opening depends on the nature of the solvent. Strongly polar solvents such as pyridine, which is coordinated to the Fe3O(COO)6 SBU replacing the water molecules, generate the largest pore opening with a PXRD pattern similar to the one simulated from the crystal structure of MUV-2(35). Otherwise, exposure to ethanol, water, toluene, and acetonitrile yields intermediate cell variations with PXRD patterns similar to the ones simulated from MUV-2(33) and MUV-2(31) crystal structures, thus showing a continuous breathing behavior. Interestingly, PXRD patterns with ethanol, water, and toluene show the presence of two principal peaks, which can be related to a decrease of symmetry. The different breathing behavior of the solvents can be explained by the coordination of the polar organic solvent molecules with the inorganic Fe3O(COO)6 SBUs (as observed in the case of pyridine) or by weak interactions with the organic linkers, a behavior which is similar to that of the MIL-88 family.

These oxidation potentials are closer to those reported for other TTF-based MOFs. The decrease of the oxidation potential of MUV-2 when using pyridine as solvent can be explained by the increased planarity of the TTFTB linkers, which significantly decreased the ionization potential as demonstrated by the theoretical calculations. Interestingly, when using a solvent such as DMF, which produces an intermediate degree of swelling and planarity of the TTFTB ligands, the formal oxidation potential is slightly higher than that in pyridine (1.40 V) ( and S21).
