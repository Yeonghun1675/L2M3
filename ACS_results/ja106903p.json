The cage-within-cage architecture partitions the pore space into small charge-separated domains that are among key desirable features needed for enhanced gas sorption through a better size match and stronger charged-induced forces. These integrated structural features (i.e., open metal sites, pore size partition, and electric field) contribute to a very high CO2 uptake capacity.
