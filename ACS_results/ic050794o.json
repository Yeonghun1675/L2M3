However, standard gas absorption experiments were performed at high pressures and room temperature using CO2, shown in Figure . Absorption of CO2 into the structure of I was relatively low at below 1500 Torr (~0.2 n CO  2 /n Cu), likely owing to the compressed gallery spaces and tilted pillars. However, a larger and reversible uptake of CO2 (~0.6-1.0 n CO  2 /n Cu) was observed at high pressure (4400 Torr), which is likely caused by a distortion of the host structure to accommodate the guest. One potential change of the host structure at high pressure is the reorientation of the pillars to more vertical positions as known for Ni(pzc)2(H2O)2AgReO4, and this would result in a square-planar coordination geometry at the Cu sites for CO2 binding. The \u03b71 binding of CO2 has been explained as arising from a strong charge-transfer interaction between a d z   2  metal orbital and the \u03c0* orbital of CO2, while, conversely, N2 is both a weaker \u03c3 donor and a poorer \u03c0 acceptor. The total measured CO2 uptake for I (33.5 cm3 g-1) at high pressure is comparable to the absorption capacity of other porous materials at mild conditions. The N2 gas absorption value is very small and exhibits no change with pressure.
