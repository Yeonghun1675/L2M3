Therefore, MUF-17 is relevant to the removal and sequestration of acetylene in practical operating situations. To investigate the elimination of highly dilute quantities of C2H2, we simulated breakthrough curves under these conditions. First, the mass-transfer coefficient used for the simulated breakthrough curves was empirically tuned to produce a match between the simulated and experimental breakthrough curves (see the Supporting Information Section 7). With this realistic mass-transfer coefficient in hand, we predicted breakthrough curves using feed compositions comprising 0.1% C2H2 in C2H4 or CO2 (e). These calculations revealed that MUF-17 eliminates vanishingly small quantities of C2H2, as often required in industrial processes.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 21, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Taken together, these data reveal MUF-17\nto be a highly effective\nmultipurpose acetylene adsorbent.
