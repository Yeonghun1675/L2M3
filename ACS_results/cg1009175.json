The CD spectra of 1-3 obviously indicate they all have chirality and the metal centers are also chiral. The homochiral LTP molecule induced the stereoselective synthesis reaction of the coordination polymers 1-3, and the chirality was transferred from the ligand to the polymers successfully. The formation of the chiral structure of 1-3 has a considerably great influence on the direction (+ or -) of the CD signals except for a slight shift of the absorption peak position compared with that of a LTP molecule, which indicates the CD chromophore mostly comes from the ligand LTP.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 22, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig4\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Solid state CD spectra of LTP (black line), <bold>1</bold> (red line), <bold>2</bold> (green line), and <bold>3</bold> (blue line) in KBr.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr4\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"cg-2010-009175_0006.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 4  Solid state CD spectra of LTP (black line), 1 (red line), 2 (green line), and 3 (blue line) in KBr.
