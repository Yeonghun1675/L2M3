In general, a higher surface area, and in particular, larger pore dimension of the MOF should facilitate faster diffusion and easier accommodation of substituents because of reduced steric hindrance. The overall trend of percent conversion observed (UMCM-1-NH<sub>2</sub> &gt; IRMOF-3 &gt; DMOF-1-NH<sub>2</sub>) is consistent with this assumption. The negligible difference between UMCM-1-NH<sub>2</sub> and IRMOF-3 for short, linear anhydrides is also consistent with this premise, because both MOFs have highly open structures that readily allow the introduction of small reagents. The extremely low conversion seen in the case of trimethylacetic anhydride with all three MOFs is largely attributed to the low reactivity of this bulky anhydride. In addition to surface area and pore dimension, framework connectivity also influences the covalent transformation of MOFs. In particular, the local environment of the NH<sub>2</sub>\u2212BDC ligands (i.e., the amount of free space immediately surrounding the amino groups) may also play an important role in modulating the modification process. This effect is likely to be critical in the modification of DMOF-1-NH<sub>2</sub>. Specifically, the plausible edge-to-edge orientation of NH<sub>2</sub>\u2212BDC rings (), which places one NH<sub>2</sub>\u2212BDC moiety in close proximity to another, potentially limits the accessibility of amino groups to anhydride molecules, thus resulting in significantly lower percent conversions, when compared with UMCM-1-NH<sub>2</sub> and IRMOF-3, even for smaller reagents. This speculation is further supported by the results based on Method 2, where DMOF-1-NH<sub>2</sub> was heated to 55 \u00b0C during postsynthetic modification, presumably facilitating free rotation of the NH<sub>2</sub>\u2212BDC rings, and resulting in a dramatic increase in the degree of modification by smaller reagents. The unexpected discrepancy of percent conversion for isobutyric anhydride-modified UMCM-1-NH<sub>2</sub> and IRMOF-3 can be explained on a similar basis.

While higher anhydride concentrations appeared to improve the percent modification of the linear alkyl chains, use of a higher anhydride concentration had no effect on the formation of UMCM-1-AM<italic toggle=\"yes\">i</italic>Pr, which may be due to the shape and sterics of the branched substituent. Although UMCM-1-NH<sub>2</sub> has a significantly higher overall porosity than IRMOF-3, examination of their structural models suggests that the size of local channels and cavities adjacent to amino moieties in UMCM-1-NH<sub>2</sub> are smaller than that in IRMOF-3 (), the effect of which appears to be more pronounced for branched anhydrides than for their linear counterparts.</p>", "clean_text": "Rationale for Modification Results\n\nWhen identical sets of modification conditions were applied to all three MOFs (i.e., Method 1), the results can be rationalized by considering two key steps involved in the heterogeneous modification process: the diffusion of reagents and the reaction with substitutents, both of which are related to the kinetics and thermodynamics of postsynthetic modification. In general, a higher surface area, and in particular, larger pore dimension of the MOF should facilitate faster diffusion and easier accommodation of substituents because of reduced steric hindrance. The overall trend of percent conversion observed (UMCM-1-NH2 > IRMOF-3 > DMOF-1-NH2) is consistent with this assumption. The negligible difference between UMCM-1-NH2 and IRMOF-3 for short, linear anhydrides is also consistent with this premise, because both MOFs have highly open structures that readily allow the introduction of small reagents. The extremely low conversion seen in the case of trimethylacetic anhydride with all three MOFs is largely attributed to the low reactivity of this bulky anhydride. In addition to surface area and pore dimension, framework connectivity also influences the covalent transformation of MOFs. In particular, the local environment of the NH2-BDC ligands (i.e., the amount of free space immediately surrounding the amino groups) may also play an important role in modulating the modification process. This effect is likely to be critical in the modification of DMOF-1-NH2. Specifically, the plausible edge-to-edge orientation of NH2-BDC rings (), which places one NH2-BDC moiety in close proximity to another, potentially limits the accessibility of amino groups to anhydride molecules, thus resulting in significantly lower percent conversions, when compared with UMCM-1-NH2 and IRMOF-3, even for smaller reagents. This speculation is further supported by the results based on Method 2, where DMOF-1-NH2 was heated to 55 \u00b0C during postsynthetic modification, presumably facilitating free rotation of the NH2-BDC rings, and resulting in a dramatic increase in the degree of modification by smaller reagents. The unexpected discrepancy of percent conversion for isobutyric anhydride-modified UMCM-1-NH2 and IRMOF-3 can be explained on a similar basis. UMCM-1-AMiPr was observed to have lower conversion than IRMOF-3-AMiPr under identical reaction conditions (Method 1). While higher anhydride concentrations appeared to improve the percent modification of the linear alkyl chains, use of a higher anhydride concentration had no effect on the formation of UMCM-1-AMiPr, which may be due to the shape and sterics of the branched substituent. Although UMCM-1-NH2 has a significantly higher overall porosity than IRMOF-3, examination of their structural models suggests that the size of local channels and cavities adjacent to amino moieties in UMCM-1-NH2 are smaller than that in IRMOF-3 (), the effect of which appears to be more pronounced for branched anhydrides than for their linear counterparts.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 39, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Conclusions</title><p>Robson suggested with the very earliest MOF-like materials that postsynthetic modification would be a promising route toward preparing novel materials with interesting properties.
