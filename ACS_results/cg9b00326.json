More interestingly, FJI-H22-desolvated exhibits good abilities for selective storage of light hydrocarbons. Single-component sorption isotherms are performed at 273 and 298 K with the pressure up to 1 bar. The experiments reveal that the uptake amounts of C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H4, C3H6, and C3H8 at ambient condition (298 K, 1 bar) are 58.27, 41.46, 44.55, 63.87, 53.48, and 48.24 cm3\u22c5g-1, respectively (a,b). It must be noted that the sorption capacity of FJI-H22-desolvated for C2-C3 hydrocarbons is higher than those of ZJNU-62, which was the only one lead organic framework for selective storage of C2 hydrocarbons in previous reports. When the temperature is lowered to 273 K, the uptake values of C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H4, C3H6, and C3H8 increase to 72.56, 58.68, 57.76, 71.92, 58.33, and 54.85 cm3\u22c5g-1, respectively (c,d). In comparison, the CH4 adsorption amounts are only 7.60 cm3\u22c5g-1 and 14.18 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 273 and 298 K respectively, which are much less than those of C2 and C3 hydrocarbons at the same conditions. More interestingly, FJI-H22-desolvated saturates with C3 hydrocarbons at lower pressures, and the slopes of adsorption isotherms are much steeper than that of CH4, indicating the stronger affinity between higher hydrocarbons and the pore surfaces. Such great difference in adsorption amounts and the interactions between higher hydrocarbons and CH4 indicates that FJI-H22-desolvated may realize highly selective separations of CH4 from C3 hydrocarbons.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 9, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig2\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<p>N<sub>2</sub> isotherms\nof <bold>FJI-H22-desolvated</bold> at 77\nK and 1 bar.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr2\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cg-2019-003267_0002.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 2  N2 isotherms of FJI-H22-desolvated at 77 K and 1 bar.
