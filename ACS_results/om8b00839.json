For this purpose,  presents selected bond angles for 7 and 8 along with corresponding values for a series of closely related CPAMX group 4 metal dichloride and dimethyl analogues. As can be seen, the M-N-CtBu and M-N-CEt bond angles are highly sensitive to the magnitude of \"buttressing\" interactions between the distal X substituent and the N-tBu and N-ethyl groups of the amidinate ligand that help to define the extent of steric crowding about the transition-metal center. Of significant importance to the current study is the observation that the distal CF3 group of 7 and 8 appears to have a steric impact within the CPAM ligand sphere that lies somewhere between those manifested by distal Ph and tBu groups and is significantly larger than that of distal CH3 and H substituents.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 11, "type": "table", "classification": null, "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Selected Bond Angles for Cp*\u00ad[N\u00ad(<sup>t</sup>Bu)\u00adC\u00ad(X)\u00adN\u00ad(Et)]\u00adM\u00ad(Y)<sub>2</sub>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"3\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">X,\u00a0M,\u00a0Y</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">M\u2013N\u2013C<sub>tBu</sub> (deg)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">M\u2013N\u2013C<sub>Et</sub> (deg)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>tBu, Zr Cl</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>136.6(2)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>131.4(2)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>CF<sub>3</sub>,\nZr, Cl (<bold>7</bold>)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>137.10(7)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>133.33(8)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>CF<sub>3</sub>, Hf, Cl (<bold>8</bold>)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>137.5(1)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>133.3(1)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>Ph, Zr, Cl</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>140.6(2)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>140.4(2)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>H, Zr, Cl</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>146.40(9)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>145.64(16)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry></oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>tBu, Zr, CH<sub>3</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>135.1(3)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>132.7(3)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>CH<sub>3</sub>,\nHf, CH<sub>3</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>139.9(3)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>138.6(3)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>CH<sub>3</sub>, Zr, CH<sub>3</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>142.5(16)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>136.4(17)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>H, Zr, CH<sub>3</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>147.30(7)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>141.20(8)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 12, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>As a final\nsynthetic consideration,  confirms that the desired group 4 CPAM<sup>CF3</sup> dimethyl preinitiators, <bold>3</bold> and <bold>4</bold>, could\nbe prepared through methylation of <bold>7</bold> and <bold>8</bold>, respectively, using two equivalents of methyl magnesium\nbromide.
