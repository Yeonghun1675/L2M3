The nature of the halide ion of the [EMI]X solvent system turned out to be a crucial factor in determining the forms of MOFs: a new MOF, [EMI][Cd2(BTC)Cl2], is obtained from [EMI]Cl solvent, while [EMI]X (X = Br and I) produced [EMI][Cd(BTC)] without any X in the structure. However, reactions using [PMI]X turned out to be insensitive to the nature of halide, all producing a new MOF, [PMI][Cd(BTC)]. The resulting compounds feature 3D structures with IL cations anchoring in the channels, in which the ILs act as structure-directing templates and charge-compensating groups, endowing the MOFs with high thermal stability.
