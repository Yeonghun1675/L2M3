The compounds are isostructural at both low and high temperatures (here after LT and HT), despite the still unavailable LT structure of 4Ni, and undergo the same structural changes during the phase transition as described previously for 5Zn. Briefly, the structural changes are as follows: First, the triplet of the unit cell occurs, in which c LT is slightly longer than c HT, a LT = (a-b)HT, and V LT = 3V HT (Figure a). Therefore, the unique channel at (0,0,z) in the HT structure becomes three unique channels at (0,0,z), (2/3,1/3,z), and (1/3,2/3,z) in the LT phase, each accommodating one array of ordered NH4 + cations. Second, the space group alternates from P6322 (HT) to the polar P63 (LT) (), indicating the broken symmetry for the occurrence of ferroelectricity. Third, the disordered NH4 + of the trigonal antiprism changes to ordered tetrahedral NH4 +, with the change from six apparent but four real N-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O H-bonds to three real strong N-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O H-bonds, each for one basal N-H, and a trifurcate acceptor-type N-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O3 H-bond for the apical N-H group, with the N-H directing along the c axis (). Finally and most importantly, in the unit cell of the LT structures (Figure a), the NH4 + cations in channels at (0,0,z), (2/3,1/3,z), and (1/3,2/3,z) shift d N1, d N2, and d N3, with the d values in the range of 0.359(7)-0.482(4) \u00c5 (), along the c direction, with respect to the anionic framework, compared to the zero d in HT structures (Figure b). These shifts or displacements in LT phases directly result in the polarization or the ferroelectricity of the materials. In fact, as the six dipoles were produced in the three channels (two per channel) within the unit cell, four in the same direction (-c) and two opposite (+c), the dipoles could not be compensated (Figure a), and polarization occurred. The P S values thus could be estimated to be 0.94-1.03 \u03bcC cm-2 () for 1Mn, 2Fe, 3Co, and 5Zn from the d data in the available LT structures (at 110 K).
