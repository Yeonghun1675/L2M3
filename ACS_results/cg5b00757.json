This disparity might be induced by the spin-orbit coupling characteristic of nickel(II) complexes with an 3A2g ground state leading to an increasing g factor. As the temperature descends, the value of \u03c7 M  T decreases sequentially to 0.64 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K, manifesting regnant antiferromagnetic interactions between the Ni(II) ions linked by carboxylate bridges within the dinuclear cluster.
