The asymmetric unit contains one molecule of L, two silver ions and their accompanying tetrafluoroborate counterions, and lattice water molecules disordered across three well-defined sites, each of 2/3 occupancy. The coordination mode of L is identical to that observed in 4, and overlaying the two structures reveals the conformations of L to be almost identical between 4 and 5, with only very slight variations in the angles around the silver ions and rotations around the unconstrained bonds within the L molecule (). The distance between pyridine-bound metal ions is increased by roughly 5% in 5 compared to 4, at 20.073(7) \u00c5.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 24, "type": "table", "classification": null, "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Crystallographic and Refinement Data\nfor <bold>L</bold> and Compounds <bold>1\u20136</bold>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"8\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col6\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col7\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col8\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">identification code</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<bold>L</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<bold>1</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<bold>2</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<bold>3</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<bold>4</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<bold>5</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<bold>6</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>empirical formula</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>C<sub>28</sub>H<sub>36</sub>N<sub>6</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>C<sub>36</sub>H<sub>40</sub>CdN<sub>6</sub>O<sub>4</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>C<sub>36</sub>H<sub>40</sub>CoN<sub>6</sub>O<sub>4</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>C<sub>30</sub>H<sub>36</sub>Ag<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub>O<sub>6</sub>S<sub>2</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>C<sub>32</sub>H<sub>42</sub>Ag<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>F<sub>8</sub>N<sub>8</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>C<sub>28</sub>H<sub>40</sub>Ag<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>F<sub>8</sub>N<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>C<sub>30</sub>H<sub>40</sub>Ag<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>F<sub>8</sub>N<sub>6</sub>O</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>fw</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>456.63</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>733.14</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>679.67</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>970.51</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>928.09</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>882.02</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>890.04</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>temp.
