However, adsorption capacities of N2 and CH4 are quite minimal at the corresponding temperature. Apparently, it displayed a selective adsorption for CO2 over CH4 and N2. This phenomenon could be ascribed to significant CO2 quadrupole moment with a value of -1.4 \u00d7 10-39 cm2, generating specific interactions with host frameworks. To better test the sorption selectivity, we applied ideal adsorption solution theory to calculate separation selectivity of CO2 versus N2 or CH4 (volume ratios, 15/85 and 50/50) at ambient pressure up to 100 kPa.
