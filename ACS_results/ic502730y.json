After cooling to room temperature, the crystals were transferred to a quartz tube, evacuated to a pressure less than 10-2 mTorr, and heated to 350 \u00b0C for 2 h under vacuum to sublime any remaining H2bdc.\n\nRedox Intercalation of Hydroquinone\n\nHydroquinone (H2Q) was intercalated into [VIVO(bdc)] by two different methods as follows:\n\nAmbient Air Method\n\nThe activated crystals of 2 were placed together with hydroquinone in a 23 mL Teflon-lined Parr stainless steel autoclave in separate small glass vessels with the molar ratio 2:H2Q = 1:47 in air. The autoclave was heated to 220 \u00b0C for 24 h and then cooled to room temperature. The dark red crystals of 2 turned black after the intercalation. The final product was determined to be [VIII(OH)(bdc)]\u22c5{(O-C6H4-O)(HO-C6H4-OH)}0.38\u22c5(H2O)0.48 (3). Anal. Calcd: V, 15.74; C, 46.60; H, 3.04.
