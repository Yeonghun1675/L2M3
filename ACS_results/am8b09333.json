Very limited water uptakes at lower\npressure before the inflection point indicate that the affinity of\nwater molecules with the surfaces of the MOFs is weak. This could be attributed to the high hydrophobicity\nof their framework surfaces derived from the large aromatic ligands\nand hydrophobic functional groups on Zr<sub>6</sub> clusters. Therefore,\nhigher water vapor pressure is required to induce the pore filling.\nFor BUT-46A, in which CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>\u2013</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O act as the terminal entries of the clusters, the condensation\nof water into the pores started at <italic>P</italic>/<italic>P</italic>\n<sub>0</sub> = 0.44, followed by an abrupt uptake before the relative\npressure reaching <italic>P</italic>/<italic>P</italic>\n<sub>0</sub> = 0.49 (575 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup>).

With terminal\nHCOO<sup>\u2013</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O on the clusters, BUT-46F\nshowed a water isotherm with the inflection point shifted to a lower\npressure compared with that of BUT-46A.

Furthermore, when HCOO<sup>\u2013</sup> was\nreplaced by more hydrophilic H<sub>2</sub>O/OH to afford BUT-46W,\nit showed further enhanced hydrophilicity and water adsorption capacity.\nThe relative pressure of water condensation into the pores of BUT-46W\ndecreased to <italic>P</italic>/<italic>P</italic>\n<sub>0</sub> = 0.27,\nand the maximum uptake increased to 785 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> (PV<sub>W</sub> = 0.63 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup>, PV<sub>N</sub> = 0.71 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup>) at <italic>P</italic>/<italic>P</italic>\n<sub>0</sub> = 0.87 (630 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup>, at <italic>P</italic>/<italic>P</italic>\n<sub>0</sub> = 0.37). The uptake of water before <italic>P</italic>/<italic>P</italic>\n<sub>0</sub> = 0.27 in BUT-46W was up to 150 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup>, almost twice higher than that in BUT-46A and -46F,\nboth of which can only capture less than 80 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> of water at their first inflection of adsorption branches. However,\nwhen the terminal H<sub>2</sub>O on Zr<sub>6</sub> clusters in BUT-46F\nwas replaced by more hydrophobic PhCOO<sup>\u2013</sup>, the resulting\nBUT-46B showed the strongest hydrophobicity among four MOFs.

All terminal HCOO- locate in window 1 (W1), and terminal H2O decorate windows 2, 3, and 4 (W2, W3, and W4). Such cages are connected with each other through sharing the faces and vertices of the cage to form a 3D framework with small open channels (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). The total solvent-accessible volume in BUT-46F was estimated to be 62.5% by using PLATON. Pore volume calculated based on PLATON is about 0.70 cm3 g-1, suggesting that BUT-46F may have a high water uptake capacity.

While in BUT-46W, three terminal HCOO- are replaced by six H2O/OH entities [1H NMR data of the decomposed sample indicated that there is almost no residual HCOO- in BUT-46W (Figure S5a,b in the Supporting Information), allowing the widows to be more hydrophilic]. For BUT-46B, the three HCOO- are still attached on the cluster, but three terminal H2O molecules are exchanged by three PhCOO-, possibly owning to the weaker acidity of PhCOOH compared with HCOOH, as well as the spatial effect. 1H NMR spectra of the decomposed BUT-46B sample revealed that besides the H6THPB ligand, both PhCOOH and HCOOH are also integrated into this framework, showing that ~1.9 PhCOO- are incorporated onto each Zr6 node within BUT-46B, with three terminal HCOO- on each node remained (Figure S5a,c in the Supporting Information). Introducing so many PhCOO- definitely makes BUT-46B have narrower and more hydrophobic pores. Clearly, the change of functional groups would affect the pore surface property of the resulting MOFs, thereby their adsorption property. The total solvent-accessible volumes in these frameworks are 61.4, 62.2, and 53.5% for BUT-46A, -46W, and -46B, respectively.\n\nPorosity and Stability\n\nThe porosities of four new Zr(IV)-MOFs were then examined by N2 adsorption at 77 K (). Saturated uptakes of 460, 458, 445, and 420 cm3 g-1 (STP) are achieved, and evaluated BET surface areas are 1565, 1563, 1550, and 1403 m2 g-1 for BUT-46W, -46F, -46A, and -46B, respectively. The experimental total pore volumes are in the range from 0.71 to 0.65 cm3 g-1, close to the calculated values by PLATON. On the basis of the N2 adsorption data, the pore size distributions of four MOFs are in the range of 1.6-3.5 nm (Figure S7 in the Supporting Information), being consistent with the results from crystal structural analysis.\n\nThe hydrothermal stability of MOFs is the primary property to be must considered for their application in most cases.

Besides, the N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K of the treated samples were found to be almost the same as those of the respective pristine samples as well, which further confirms the robustness of these MOFs (). Experimentally, we also carefully checked whether there is pendant ligand and/or framework ligand leaching after four MOFs were treated by pH 1 HCl and pH 10 NaOH aqueous solution at RT by UV-vis spectrum measurements. As shown in Figures S12 and S13, no corresponding peaks of these ligands were observed in UV-vis adsorption spectra, suggesting that there are no ligands leaching during the treatment of samples. These results, as well as the almost the same mass of MOF samples before and after treatments (Table S3) further attest the chemical stability of BUT-46. The thermal stability of the four MOFs was also checked. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves show that they can be stable up to ca. 430 \u00b0C (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information), being comparable to most of Zr(IV)-MOFs. \n\nWater Vapor Adsorption\n\nIn terms of their high porosity and excellent stability, water adsorptions were subsequently explored for four BUT-46 MOFs. All the adsorption/desorption isotherms measured at 298 K (equilibration time of 10 s) show S-shaped (sigmoidal) curves without an obvious hysteresis loop (a). To check whether the equilibration time affects the hysteresis in these measurements, water sorption with different equilibration time was performed. The isotherms measured with equilibration time of 30 s also show no hysteresis (Figure S8 in the Supporting Information), suggesting almost no influence of equilibration time on the hysteresis in water sorption isotherms of these MOFs. Very limited water uptakes at lower pressure before the inflection point indicate that the affinity of water molecules with the surfaces of the MOFs is weak. This could be attributed to the high hydrophobicity of their framework surfaces derived from the large aromatic ligands and hydrophobic functional groups on Zr6 clusters. Therefore, higher water vapor pressure is required to induce the pore filling. For BUT-46A, in which CH3COO- and H2O act as the terminal entries of the clusters, the condensation of water into the pores started at P/P 0 = 0.44, followed by an abrupt uptake before the relative pressure reaching P/P 0 = 0.49 (575 cm3 g-1). Then, water in pores underwent capillary condensation and the maximum uptake was up to 645 cm3 g-1 at P/P 0 = 0.87 (corresponding to a water accessible pore volume (PVW) of 0.52 cm3 g-1, with the N2 accessible pore volume (PVN) of 0.69 cm3 g-1). With terminal HCOO- and H2O on the clusters, BUT-46F showed a water isotherm with the inflection point shifted to a lower pressure compared with that of BUT-46A. The steep adsorption commenced at P/P 0 = 0.39 and rapidly reached 605 cm3 g-1 at P/P 0 = 0.43 and then the maximum uptake of 735 cm3 g-1 (PVW = 0.59 cm3 g-1, PVN = 0.70 cm3 g-1) at P/P 0 = 0.87. Furthermore, when HCOO- was replaced by more hydrophilic H2O/OH to afford BUT-46W, it showed further enhanced hydrophilicity and water adsorption capacity. The relative pressure of water condensation into the pores of BUT-46W decreased to P/P 0 = 0.27, and the maximum uptake increased to 785 cm3 g-1 (PVW = 0.63 cm3 g-1, PVN = 0.71 cm3 g-1) at P/P 0 = 0.87 (630 cm3 g-1, at P/P 0 = 0.37). The uptake of water before P/P 0 = 0.27 in BUT-46W was up to 150 cm3 g-1, almost twice higher than that in BUT-46A and -46F, both of which can only capture less than 80 cm3 g-1 of water at their first inflection of adsorption branches. However, when the terminal H2O on Zr6 clusters in BUT-46F was replaced by more hydrophobic PhCOO-, the resulting BUT-46B showed the strongest hydrophobicity among four MOFs. For it, the steep adsorption just started at P/P 0 = 0.51 and reached 560 cm3 g-1 at P/P 0 = 0.55 and then the maximum of 614 cm3 g-1 (PVW = 0.49 cm3 g-1, PVN = 0.65 cm3 g-1) at P/P 0 = 0.87. Clearly, compared with BUT-46F, BUT-46B exhibits a lower maximum uptake and higher step pressure because of the larger size and stronger hydrophobicity of PhCOO- relative to H2O, which led to a decrease in the pore volume and an increase of the open pressure. These results show that the slight modification of the Zr6 clusters can lead to distinct changes of water adsorption property in these Zr(IV)-MOFs.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "BUT-46F", "symbol":
