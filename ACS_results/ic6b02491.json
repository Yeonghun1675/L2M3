To obtain the guest-free phase of 1a, 1 was soaked in CH3OH for 7 days and subsequent heating at 150 \u00b0C under vacuum for 6 h, which is evidenced by the TGA curve of 1a (Figure S5). The FT-IR of 1a (Figure S6) shows that the lack of characteristic C\ue5fbO vibration of DMF reveals that the disordered solvent has been removed from the nanotubes. The structure integrity of 1a has also been verified by the PXRD experiment (Figure S8).\n\nSorption Properties\n\nThe permanent porosity of 1a has been verified by the N2 adsorption isotherm at 77 K. The desolvated solid products exhibit a type-I isotherm (Figure S9), which confirms retention of microporosity upon removal of guest solvent molecules with a saturated N2 adsorption of 23 cm-3 g-1. H2 sorption measurements at 77 K have also been experimented to check the hydrogen storage performances (Figure S10). The special nanotube-based large space in 1a has been employed to give a detailed exploration of the potential application in CO2/CH4 separation, and adsorption studies of CO2 and CH4 have been investigated on desolvated 1a at different temperatures (CO2 and CH4 at 195, 273, and 298 K). On the basis of the CO2 adsorption isotherm, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Langmuir surface areas of 1a are evaluated to be 669.3 and 800.5 m2 g-1, respectively. The experimental pore size distribution (PSD) curve based on the NLDFT model is shown in Figure S11. As shown in a, the CO2 adsorption displays a type-I isotherm and reaches 198.3 cm3 g-1 (38.9 wt %) at 195 K.\n\nHowever, the CH4 uptake is up to 89.21 cm3 g-1 (6.4 wt %), which is much lower than the value of CO2 under the same conditions. Such adsorption selectivity is more significant at high temperature. Thus, the adsorption studies of the CO2 and CH4 were carried out at the high temperature (273 and 298 K).

The CO2 uptake is nearly 4 and 5.4 times larger than that of CH4 at 273 and 298 K, respectively, which may be attributed to the great differences in diameters between the gas molecules (CO2 3.30 \u00c5 and CH4 3.80 \u00c5) and the sieving effect of the narrow apertures.  In addition, the CO2 uptake of 1a (18.8 and 11.2 wt %) at 273 and 298 K is comparable and even superior to the recently reported microporous complexes, displaying that the appropriate pore size may be
