Similarly, crystals of 3 can completely transform into 1 and 2\" by dipping crystals of 3 in DMF and DMA for 5 days and 7 days, respectively. And likewise, crystals of 2 can completely convert to 3 in NMP solvent for 10 days, while crystals of 1 cannot, probably because the NMP is too large to enter the channel supported by DMF. In contrast, no desirable results were found between 1-3 and 4 within one month even though similar attempts had been made, which may be explained by the DEF with largest size cannot access the channels freely. Moreover, it can be found that the complete transformation from 2 to 1 was observed in a short period (3 days), while that from 1 to 2 required more time (5 days) for the smaller size of DMF made it faster to enter the channels of the open framework supported by DMA. Likewise, in the DMA/NMP solvents system, similar phenomenon was also observed. Thus, among the transformations of 1-4, the situation of solvent-exchange and the time-exchange discrimination are all susceptible to the size of solvents: DEF > NMP > DMA > DMF.

MOFs 1-4 reveal rarely 3D double-walled open-frameworks with 1D parallelogram channels and have guest/coordinated carbonyl solvent molecules and water molecules. And it is indicated that the local bulkiness of carbonyl solvent molecules, especially around the coordinated carbonyl O atoms rather than the whole bulkiness, plays a crucial part in the steric effect of solvents in the structural variation of metal coordination sphere, and the coordinated water molecules showing different coordination modes: as a bridging linker in 1 and 4, but terminal solvent in 2 and 3. Furthermore, the solvent exchange transformations have been realized between MOFs 1-3. It is noted that, during the transformation processes, only guest/coordinated carbonyl solvent molecules (DMF, DMA, NMP) could be exchanged, while the water molecules cannot be, providing a good example of the competitive behavior of these two kinds of solvents. Meanwhile, it is indicated that the exchanging time is susceptible to the size of carbonyl solvent molecules, and the metal coordination sphere of SCSC regenerated samples is influenced by the joint contributions of coordinated carbonyl solvents and the nature of mother crystals. In addition, the magnetic property analyses on 1-4 reveal that these MOFs show antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between the metal centers.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 48, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting\nInformation\nis available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.cgd.6b01366\">10.1021/acs.cgd.6b01366</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Crystallographic\ndata, PXRD patterns, sorption isotherms,\nTGA curves, as well as additional tables, structural figures and magnetic\nsusceptibilities (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.cgd.6b01366/suppl_file/cg6b01366_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.cgd.6b01366.
