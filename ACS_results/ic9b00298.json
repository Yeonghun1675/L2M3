As is shown in a, the separation selectivities for C2H2/CO2 under initial pressure are slightly different, with values of 6.8 (V/Mn), 7.8 (Fe/Mn), 6.6 (Cr/Mn), and 8.1 (Mn) at 273 K, respectively. Note that the selectivity value of homometallic NbU-3-Mn is higher than those of materials such as HKUST-1 and NOTT-101a. In our opinion, the main reason for inducing the highest selective adsorption of C2H2/CO2 for NbU-3-Mn mainly due to the thermodynamics factor, consistent with the values of the adsorption heat following the trend of C2H2 \u226b C2H4 > CO2 > C2H6, suggests that the open-metal sites hanging on the Mn3 and uncoordinated N sites in the channels synergistically provide divergent host-guest interactions and C2H2 has much stronger interactions with the framework than other gases. Unfortunately, we cannot obtain the gas-loaded crystal structures because of the poor diffraction intensity of the single crystal after the removal of guest molecules. Furthermore, for the separation selectivity for C2H2/C2H4 binary mixtures under initial pressure, NbU-3-Mn/Fe has a relatively high separation ratio of 2.7, even higher than that of NOTT-300, indicating possible applications in the industrial separation of acetylene/ethylene.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 15, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig4\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<p>IAST adsorption selectivity of 50/50 C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> (a) and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> (b) binary mixtures.
