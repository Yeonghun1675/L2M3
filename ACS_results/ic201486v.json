On the other hand, a new\nrelatively strong resonance is observed at ca. \u03b4 1.9. This resonance\nis obtained reproducibly, but its line width appears quite concentration\ndependent (broader at lower concentrations). Hence, a chemical reaction\ncompletely consuming Fe(acac)<sub>2</sub> has occurred. One possibility\nthat comes to mind is oxidation to FeCl(acac)<sub>2</sub>, a known\ncompound (note that chloroform is a well-known\nCl atom donor), according to eq .

These resonance are rather close to those\nof Fe(acac)<sub>3</sub>, and it is thus possible that FeCl(acac)<sub>2</sub> is present, together with the Fe(acac)<sub>3</sub> impurity,\nin the spectrum shown in Figure . However,\nthis compound does not account for the observed band at \u03b4 1.9.\nWe have also considered the possibility that FeCl(acac)<sub>2</sub>, once formed, further reacts with Fe(acac)<sub>2</sub> to yield\na mixed-valence adduct (eq ).

As seen in Figure , the resonances of Fe(acac)2 are not present, whereas those of Fe(acac)3, identical to those of the genuine sample (Figure ), remain. On the other hand, a new relatively strong resonance is observed at ca. \u03b4 1.9. This resonance is obtained reproducibly, but its line width appears quite concentration dependent (broader at lower concentrations). Hence, a chemical reaction completely consuming Fe(acac)2 has occurred. One possibility that comes to mind is oxidation to FeCl(acac)2, a known compound (note that chloroform is a well-known Cl atom donor), according to eq . Dichloromethane is less prone to Cl atom transfer because of its stronger C-Cl bonds, and indeed Fe(acac)2 is stable in this solvent. The 1H NMR spectrum for compound FeCl(acac)2 has apparently not been reported; therefore, we have prepared it by one of the reported methods, which consists of the comproportionation of Fe(acac)3 and anhydrous FeCl3 in a 2:1 ratio. However, the 1H NMR spectrum of this compound in CDCl3 shows a strong and broad resonance at \u03b4 16.4, rather than at \u03b4 ca. 1.9, and a smaller broad resonance at \u03b4 -38.9. These resonance are rather close to those of Fe(acac)3, and it is thus possible that FeCl(acac)2 is present, together with the Fe(acac)3 impurity, in the spectrum shown in Figure . However, this compound does not account for the observed band at \u03b4 1.9.
