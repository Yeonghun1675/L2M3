However, the lack of an effective storage method hinders\nthe realization of the hydrogen economy era. During the past 2 decades,\nporous MOFs have been highlighted as promising candidates for use\nas a hydrogen storage material by virtue of their high porosity, tunable\npore size, and large internal surface area. The high porosity and stable framework with open copper(II) sites\nsuggest HNUST-3 may have an excellent H<sub>2</sub> storage property.\nIndeed, HNUST-3 exhibits a high total H<sub>2</sub>-uptake capacity\nof 2.2 wt % [wt % = 100(mass of adsorbed gas)/(mass of MOF)] at 77\nK and 1 bar (), which is larger\nthan the corresponding value of PCN-46 (1.9 wt %) and is among the highest H<sub>2</sub> uptakes at low pressure. High-pressure gravimetric H<sub>2</sub> adsorption\ndata were also recorded over the pressure range 0\u201320 bar at\n77 K (Figure ), and HNUST-3 gives a maximum\nexcess H<sub>2</sub> uptake of 5.4 wt % (37.0 g\u00b7L<sup>\u20131</sup>) at 20 bar with no hysteresis. Taking into consideration the gaseous\nhydrogen compressed within the framework void, the total H<sub>2</sub> uptake capacity of HNUST-3 can reach as high as 6.1 wt % (41.8 g\u00b7L<sup>\u20131</sup>) at 20 bar and 77 K, which is moderate compared with\nthe highest capacity MOF materials. On\nthe basis of the adsorption isotherms measured at 77 and 87 K, the\nzero-coverage H<sub>2</sub> adsorption enthalpy of HNUST-3 is calculated\nto be 6.38 kJ\u00b7mol<sup>\u20131</sup> with the virial method, which is quite large compared to other Cu(II)-based\nmetal polyhedral frameworks with average adsorption enthalpies of\n5.6\u20136.2 kJ\u00b7mol<sup>\u20131</sup>.\n</p><p>Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) has been proposed\nas a feasible\nmethod for controlling atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration.

In addition,\non the basis of the total capacity, a container filled with HNUST-3\ncan store about 16 times the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in an empty\ncontainer at 20 bar and 298 K, further indicating that HNUST-3 is\na good and efficient CO<sub>2</sub> adsorbent.</p>", "clean_text": "A microporous oxalamide-functionalized NbO-type metal-organic framework, HNUST-3, has been designed and synthesized by self-assembling [Cu2(COO)4] paddlewheel SBUs and a novel tetracarboxylate ligand with linking oxalamide groups. HNUST-3 represents the first example of a porous oxalamide-functionalized MOF, which exhibits a high BET surface area of 2412 m2\u22c5g-1, large H2 uptake (unsaturated total capacity of 6.1 wt % at 20 bar and 77 K), and excellent CH4 storage (135.8 cm3(STP)cm-3 at 20 bar and 298 K) as well as high CO2 adsorption capacity (20.2 mmol\u22c5g-1 at 20 bar and 298 K) with good selectivity for CO2 over CH4 (7.9) and N2 (26.1) at 298 K.\n\nWe are interested in the construction of porous functionalized MOF materials from large multidentate carboxylate ligands with linking functionalities (-CONH-, -C\ue5fcC-, etc.) because such an approach may facilitate the generation of expanded frameworks with high surface area and, most importantly, the gas sorption capacity of MOFs may be dramatically enhanced by strong interactions between target gas molecules and the functional groups predesigned in the frameworks. By working with this consideration, very recently we successfully inserted linking acylamide functional groups into several MOFs and realized a balance between high gas-binding ability and large gas-storage capacity. To expand our work in this area, we herein report an oxalamide-functionalized microporous NbO-type MOF, termed HNUST-3 (HNUST denotes Hunan University of Science and Technology), designed from a tetracarboxylate ligand with bridging oxalamide moiety (N,N'-bis(3,5-dicarboxyphenyl)oxalamide = H4BDPO, Scheme ). To the best of our knowledge, HNUST-3 represents the first example of a porous oxalamide-functionalized MOF. HNUST-3 exhibits a high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 2412 m2\u22c5g-1 and a large unsaturated total hydrogen-storage capacity of 6.1 wt % at 77 K and 20 bar. Additionally, this MOF material also demonstrates excellent CH4 storage of 135.8 cm3(STP)cm-3 at 20 bar and 298 K and high CO2 uptake capacity of 20.2 mmol\u22c5g-1 at 20 bar and 298 K as well as good selectivity of CO2/N2 (26.1) and CO2/CH4 (7.9).\n\nSingle-Crystal X-ray Structure Determination\n\nSingle-crystal X-ray diffraction was performed with a Bruker Smart Apex CCD diffractometer with a graphite-monochromatic Mo K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5) using the \u03c9-scan technique at 298 K. The CCD data were integrated and scaled using the Bruker-SAINT software package. The structure was solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix leas-squares techniques based on F 2 using the SHELXTL-97 program. The non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically, and H atoms were placed in calculated positions with isotropic displacement parameters set to 1.2 \u00d7 U eq of the attached atom. Disordered, independent solvent molecules inside the frameworks were eliminated in the refinement by PLATON/SQUEEZE. Structural information of HNUST-3 was deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center (CCDC reference number ). Crystallographic data for HNUST-3: C54H24Cu6N6O35.56, fw = 1707.07, monoclinic, P21/c, a = 28.180(2) \u00c5, b = 18.4040(14) \u00c5, c = 32.044(2) \u00c5, \u03b1 = \u03b3 = 90\u00b0, \u03b2 = 112.1740(10)\u00b0, V = 15389.7(19) \u00c53, Z = 4, T = 293(2) K, \u03bc = 0.857 mm-1, 116696 reflections were collected (28132 were unique) for 1.30\u00b0 < \u03b8 < 25.35\u00b0, R(int) = 0.0691, R 1 = 0.0675, wR 2 = 0.1840 [I > 2\u03c3(I)], R 1 = 0.0921, wR 2 = 0.1963 (all data), GOF = 1.001.\n\nThe framework stability of HNUST-3 was studied by both thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements. TGA of the fresh HNUST-3 sample revealed that HNUST-3 loses guest DMF solvent molecules trapped in the cages and coordinated water molecules from 30 to ~200 \u00b0C, and a further significant weight loss is observed up to 300 \u00b0C (). To obtain the fully desolvated framework, the fresh HNUST-3 sample was repeatedly soaked in anhydrous acetone for 3 days to exchange the less volatile DMF solvent followed by heating under a dynamic vacuum at 100 \u00b0C overnight. A color change from pale-blue to purple-blue occurred, indicating that open Cu(II) sites have been generated similar to those observed for other frameworks. The PXRD patterns of desolvated HNUST-3 are completely identical to those for both as-synthesized and simulated from single-crystal data (Figure ), indicating that the framework is robust and retains its crystallinity after activation.\n\nPermanent Porosity\n\nTo evaluate the permanent porosity of HNUST-3, N2 (77 K) and Ar (87 K) gas adsorption studies were performed on the activated sample. As shown in Figure , both isotherms exhibit typical type-I adsorption behavior, as expected for microporous materials. On the basis of the N2 adsorption isotherm, the surface area of activated HNUST-3 calculated from the Langmuir equation is about 2784 m2\u22c5g-1, and the corresponding BET surface area is 2412 m2\u22c5g-1. This BET value is smaller than that reported for isoreticular analoge NJU-Bai12 (3038 m2\u22c5g-1), NOTT-102 (2942 m2\u22c5g-1), and NOTT-103 (2929 m2\u22c5g-1), but it is significantly larger than that of NOTT-109 (1718 m2\u22c5g-1) and PCN-14 (1753 m2\u22c5g-1) and is fairly comparable to the values of other highly porous NbO-type MOFs such as SNU-50 (2300 m2\u22c5g-1), NOTT-101 (2316 m2\u22c5g-1), HNUST-2 (2366 m2\u22c5g-1), NOTT-105 (2387 m2\u22c5g-1), and PCN-46 (2500 m2\u22c5g-1), thus making HNUST-3 among the highest surface area NbO-type MOF series reported to date. The inset to Figure  shows the differential pore volume distributions as functions of pore width calculated by nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) from N2 isotherm data, which suggests that HNUST-3 has a narrow pore-size distributions around 1.0-1.2 nm, corresponding with the crystal model. The total pore volume of HNUST-3 calculated from the maximum amount of N2 adsorbed at 77 K reaches up to 0.99 cm3\u22c5g-1, consistent with the total framework pore volume (1.07 cm3\u22c5g-1) derived from the X-ray crystal structure of HNUST-3.\n\nGas Storage Properties\n\nBecause of its high power density of 33.3 kW h kg-1 (higher than methane at 13.9 kW h kg-1 and gasoline at 12.4 kW h kg-1), abundance, and nonpolluting nature, hydrogen is considered to be an ideal energy source candidate in the future.

Indeed, HNUST-3 exhibits a high total H2-uptake capacity of 2.2 wt % [wt % = 100(mass of adsorbed gas)/(mass of MOF)] at 77 K and 1 bar (), which is larger than the corresponding value of PCN-46 (1.9 wt %) and is among the highest H2 uptakes at low pressure. High-pressure gravimetric H2 adsorption data were also recorded over the pressure range 0-20 bar at 77 K (Figure ), and HNUST-3 gives a maximum excess H2 uptake of 5.4 wt % (37.0 g\u22c5L-1) at 20 bar with no hysteresis. Taking into consideration the gaseous hydrogen compressed within the framework void, the total H2 uptake capacity of HNUST-3 can reach as high as 6.1 wt % (41.8 g\u22c5L-1) at 20 bar and 77 K, which is moderate compared with the highest capacity MOF materials. On the basis of the adsorption isotherms measured at 77 and 87 K, the zero-coverage H2 adsorption enthalpy of HNUST-3 is calculated to be 6.38 kJ\u22c5mol-1 with the virial method, which is quite large compared to other Cu(II)-based metal polyhedral frameworks with average adsorption enthalpies of 5.6-6.2 kJ\u22c5mol-1. \n\nCarbon capture and sequestration (CCS) has been proposed as a feasible method for controlling atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration.
