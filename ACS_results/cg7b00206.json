As shown in Figure S8, the N2 uptake amount is 302.5 cm3 g-1 (STP) at 1 bar. The N2 gas adsorption shows a reversible type I isotherm without hysteresis on desorption, which is characteristic of microporous material. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Langmuir surface area of desolvated NJU-Bai33 were estimated to be 884.8 and 1072.5 m2 g-1, respectively. Furthermore, its Horvath-Kawazoe (H-K) pore diameter is 4.66 \u00c5, which is almost consistent with the pore size as determined by the crystal structure. The pore volume given by the Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) equation is 0.35 cm3 g-1, close to the theoretical value of 0.30 cm3 g-1 calculated using PLATON. \n\nFurthermore, its selective adsorption properties of CO2 versus N2 and CH4 were investigated. The CO2, N2, and CH4 adsorption measurements for NJU-Bai33 were carried out at 273 and 298 K (). At 0.15 bar, the uptake amounts of CO2 are 40.3 and 21.6 cm3 g-1, corresponding to 7.9 and 4.2 wt % at 273 and 298 K, respectively, which are lower than the uptake amounts for CO2 of NJU-Bai7, 11.8, and 8.0 wt % at 0.15 bar and under 273 and 298 K, respectively, but are substantially higher than those of the well-known MOFs, such as ZIF-78 (6.4 and 3.4 wt % at 0.15 bar and under 273 and 298 K, respectively), NH2-MIL-53(Al) (3.2 wt %, at 298 K and 0.1 bar), en-Cu-BTTri (2.4 wt %, at 298 K and 0.15 bar), Cu-EBTC (5.9 wt %, at 273 K and 0.15 bar), SNU-4 (4.9 wt %, at 273 K and 0.15 bar), and MOF-5 (2.1 and 0.75 wt % at 0.15 bar and under 273 and 298 K, respectively). In addition, at 1 bar, the uptake amounts of CO2 are 86.2 and 65.6 cm3 g-1, corresponding to 16.9 and 12.9 wt % at 273 and 298 K, respectively, which are also comparable to the values of NJU-Bai7 (13.9 and 12.8 wt % at 1 bar and under 273 and 298 K, respectively). However, it is worthy of note that at 0.75 bar, NJU-Bai33 can only adsorb limited amounts of N2, 8.3 and 4.2 cm3 g-1, corresponding to 1.0 and 0.5 wt % at 273 and 298 K, respectively, and at 1 bar, the CH4 uptake amounts are also only 32.9 and 19.4 cm3 g-1, corresponding to 2.4 and 1.4 wt % at 273 and 298 K, respectively.\n\nIn summary, on the basis of the organic ligand of 5-(pyridin-3-yl)isophthalic acid (H2L), a new distorted [Mn2(COO)4N2] cluster based MOF with (3,3,6) topology, NJU-Bai33, has been synthesized. Very interestingly, it exhibits a new point (Schla\u0308fli) symbol of (4\u22c562)2(42\u22c568\u22c585) and further enriches the library of (3,6)-connected MOFs. Moreover, it shows selective adsorption of CO2 over N2 and CH4 with the CO2 uptake amounts high up to 7.9 and 4.2 wt % at 0.15 bar and at 273 and 298 K, respectively, and may be an excellently potential candidate for CO2 capture, such as the postcombustion CO2 capture and the purification of natural gases.\n\nThe authors declare no competing financial interest.\n\nCrystal data for
