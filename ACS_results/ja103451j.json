The resultant increase in vanadium ionic radius in going from vanadium(V) to vanadium(IV) makes the oligomerization credible through bridging via V2-O3 bond formation (see Table ). The concluding step is the oxidation of an alcoholate group to an aldehyde (as revealed from the more pronounced decrease in C7-O1 bond length after the initial two weeks of exposure) by molecular oxygen, which in turn is converted to H2O2 through a mechanism as represented by eq  and elaborated in Scheme . Due to sluggish nature of this heterogeneous reaction, the detection of H2O2 remained elusive despite our best efforts.  1     RCH   2     OH + O   2   \u2192   RCHO + H   2     O   2      ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 12, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Proposed Mechanistic Pathway for the Single Crystal-to-Single Crystal Transformation</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gs1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"ja-2010-03451j_0003.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Proposed Mechanistic Pathway for the Single Crystal-to-Single Crystal Transformation   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 13, "type": "text", "classification": ["property"], "content": "<p>The progress of this reaction has been followed also by EPR spectroscopic measurements (Figure ), which provide support to the mechanism of this light-induced process.
