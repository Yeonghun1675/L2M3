To understand the magnetic behavior of 1, it is important to note the existence of two different exchange pathways in the 3D network: (i) the single long \u03bc1,5-dca bridge linking two neighboring copper(II) atoms through short Cu-Nnitrile equatorial bonds (ca. 1.98 \u00c5) and (ii) the single short \u03bc1,3-dca bridge connecting one axial position of a Cu(II) ion (ca. 2.37 \u00c5) with the adjacent Ni(II) ion. The first pathway is known to produce very weak antiferromagnetic interactions (hereafter AF) with -J < 1 cm-1. The magnetic interaction through the \u03bc1,3-dca pathway is expected to be weak as well because the Namide-Cu distance is relatively long and the spin density on the axial positions is very small (the d x   2  -  y   2  magnetic orbital is located in the equatorial plane). In principle, this latter interaction could be either ferromagnetic (hereafter F) or AF in nature. In summary, from a magnetic point of view, 1 contains AF copper(II) planes and alternating Cu-Ni chains with either F (ferromagnetic chains) or AF (ferrimagnetic chains) interactions. Although the shape of the \u03c7M T vs T curve resembles that of a ferrimagnetic chain, this can be ruled out because of the high \u03c7M T value at the minimum (1.42 cm3 mol-1 K). For such a ferrimagnetic chain, a much lower value (about 0.6 cm3 mol-1 K) is expected at the minimum. Therefore, the increase of \u03c7M T at low temperature is indicative of F interactions between copper(II) and Ni(II) ions along the chain. This agrees well with the ferromagnetic behavior observed for the recently reported dinuclear complex Cu2L(\u03bc13-dca) (L is a cryptand ligand), which, from spectroscopic data and the consideration of the steric requirements of the copper(II) cryptate, was assumed to exhibit a short \u03bc1,3-dicyanamide bridge between the copper(II) ions.
