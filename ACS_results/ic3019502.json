Compounds 1-3 are built up from M'2(COO)4 paddle-wheel SBUs bridged by M-TCPP ligands and formate pillars. According to their binding affinity, the formate pillar heterogeneously bridges Mn and M' (M' = Zn and Cd) cations in 1 and 2, whereas the formate pillar homogeneously bridges M' cations in 3. Despite the fact that compounds 1 and 2 are highly porous; however, the substrate molecules cannot access the inner MnIII metal sites because they are ligated by formate pillars. Hence, the epoxidation of olefins occurs on the exterior solid surfaces with excellent conversion and selectivity. Although the porphyrin FeIII cations are readily available for substrate molecules, the catalysts are not stable under the epoxidation conditions. We therefore probed the catalytic property by the intermolecular aldol reaction of aldehydes and ketones with excellent substrate conversions for 3. This work complements the current shortcoming on the issue of the catalysis in the inner pores or on the exterior solid surfaces of MOF catalysts.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 41, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>Additional figures, table, and crystallographic\ndata in CIF format.
