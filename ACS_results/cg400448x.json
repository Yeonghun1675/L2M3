All plots are qualitatively and quantitatively very similar to the magnetic data observed for the purely solvated Co  9  W  6  phase, reported by Song et al. This suggests that weakly bonded 4,4'-bpdo diamagnetic linkers do not play a significant role, and the magnetism of 1 is determined exclusively by the nature of cyanido-bridged clusters, being in a good magnetic isolation. However, the description of magnetic behavior of these molecules should take into account the specific character of six-coordinated high-spin Co(II) centers with the significant orbital contribution. The room-temperature \u03c7M T value for 1 is 32.1 cm3 mol-1 K, which corresponds well to the uncoupled six WV ions (S W = 1/2, g W = 2.0) and nine CoII ions (S Co,HS = 3/2) with the g-value of nearly octahedral high-spin CoII ions within the typical range of 2.4-2.7. Upon cooling, the \u03c7M T value gradually increases, suggesting the ferromagnetic coupling between CoII and WV. At 10 K, \u03c7M T reaches the maximum of 85 cm3 mol-1 K, and finally decreases to about 47 cm3 mol-1 K at 2 K, which should be interpreted in terms of single-ion effects of CoII and some intercluster AF interactions (Figure a). To correlate the maximum value of \u03c7M T with the correct ground-state spin of Co  9  W  6  clusters in 1, it is necessary to apply the effective spin approach for CoII centers, postulating the effective spin of 1/2 for CoII with the isotropic g-value of 13/3 at low temperature where only the lowest-lying Kramers doublet is populated (below 30 K). Using this approximation, the ferromagnetic ground state of Co  9  W  6  has spin S F = 15/2 and an average g-value of g av = 3.4 (calculated from g W = 2 and g Co,LT = 13/3) that allows reaching the \u03c7M T value of ca. 92 cm3 mol-1 K. This interpretation is also confirmed by the magnetization curve reaching the value of 24.9 N\u03b2 in the magnetic field H = 50 kOe at T = 1.8 K (the inset, Figure a), which is only slightly lower than the expected 25.5 N\u03b2. The field-cooled (FC) and zero-field-cooled (ZFC) magnetization curves of 1 do not diverge (Figure S2, ), which suggests that no long-range magnetic ordering is observed, indicating a good magnetic isolation of molecular clusters. The presence of strongly anisotropic CoII centers in these molecules leads to frequency-dependent ac magnetic susceptibility in the lowest temperature regime (Figure b). The relaxation time estimated from the maxima of \u03c7M\" versus T curves follows the Arrhenius law with an energy gap of \u0394/k B = 10.3(5) K and \u03c40 = 4(1) \u00d7 10-9 s, which is consistent with single-molecule magnet behavior. \n\nThe magnetic properties of 2 are presented in Figure . The \u03c7M T product at room temperature is 29.7 cm3 mol-1 K, corresponding well to the uncoupled six WV ions and nine CoII ions (see the description above). With decreasing temperature, \u03c7M T gradually increases, reaching the maximum value of 79 cm3 mol-1 K at 15 K, and later decreases to about 17 cm3 mol-1 K at 2 K (Figure a). The temperature dependence of \u03c7M T is very close to those observed for 1, and can be similarly explained by the ferromagnetic coupling between CoII and WV within the cyanido-bridged Co  9  W  6  clusters, leading to a ferromagnetic ground-state spin of S F = 15/2 and g av = 3.4. FC and ZFC magnetization curves measured at a small field of 20 Oe converge within the whole temperature range, but a smooth maximum on \u03c7(T) is present around 5 K (Figure S2, ). This is confirmed in the measurement in 1 kOe, and also ac susceptibility. The magnetization measured at 1.8 K increases to 24.5 N\u03b2 at 50 kOe, with an inflection point in the small field range, which is better visible as a maximum at H C = 4 kOe in the dM/dH curve (Figure b). These data suggest the presence of antiferromagnetic interaction between the clusters, much stronger than in the case of 1, but still no sharp transition to a long-range ordering is visible down to 1.8 K. The intercluster interaction, roughly estimated as g av \u03b2H C/S F, reaches 0.084 cm-1.
