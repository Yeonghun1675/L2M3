As illustrated in , it contains a very standard and common paddle wheel motif to assemble with the carboxylic acid groups in the ligand. Interesting, one nitrogen atom from the organic ligand is further coordinated with one Co site in the paddle wheel motif. It can be found, after analysis in detail, that there are three different microporous cages in 1 with 14.9 \u00c5 for the largest cage, 12.1 \u00c5 for the medium cage, and 8.9 \u00c5 for the small one. All of the cages were further connected by the carboxylate acids and nitrogen atoms in the organic ligands to form a 3D structure. From the angle of topology, the obtained network is a 5-node topology with the point symbol [46\u22c564]. The total accessible volume of 1 is ~49.5% without the guest and coordinated solvents in the PLATON/VOID method. Because of its distorted solvents and the weak X-ray diffraction data, all solvents cannot be located accurately by the results of the single crystal. Thus, they only can be inferred by TGA and elemental analysis.\n\nThermal and Chemical Stability\n\nMOF 1 loses ~24.68% weight before 240 \u00b0C, which is similar with the calculated result after removing coordinated and guest molecules (calcd 24.79%, Figure S5). As illustrated in Figure S6, the TGA data of 2 shows a 12.49% weight loss before 250 \u00b0C, which is similar with the calculated result after removing guest cations and molecules (calcd 12.74%). The phase purity of the experimental sample can be determined by PXRD patterns based on their characteristic diffraction peaks (Figures S7 and S8). The PXRD results demonstrated the purity of MOFs 1 and 2.\n\nGas Sorption Properties\n\nCompounds 1 and 2 both directly exchanged the high boiling point guest molecules with low boiling point CH2Cl2 for 2 days. These MOFs were heated at 100 \u00b0C under vacuum for 12 h. The N2 gas sorption measurement of activated 1 was implemented to verify the permanent pore character at 77 K. N2 sorption isotherms at 77 K featured a completely reversible type-I adsorption characteristic of microporous materials (). The BET and Langmuir surface area are calculated directly as 1014 and 1147 m2 g-1, respectively. The corresponding pore width distributions are 7.3, 11.8, and 14.8 \u00c5 through the DFT method. The structure of the activated sample can be retained well by the PXRD measurement (Figure S9). It also exhibits more excellent CO2 adsorption capacity than the adsorption amounts of CH4 at 273 and 298 K (Figure S10). However, activated 2 did not have any N2 sorption at 77 K (Figure S11), which is mainly attributed to complete framework collapse after the activation process. The reason can be confirmed by the PXRD pattern of activated 2 (Figure S12).\n\nLuminescence Properties\n\nThe luminescence behaviors of the H4BDPO ligand and ground 2 were both investigated in detail. a shows the maximum emission of the free ligand at 382 nm under 337 nm. Compound 2 showed a significant emission peak at 379 nm under excitation wavelength at 292 nm (b), revealing that the luminescence property of 2 belongs to the organic ligand. For the luminescence detection capability toward NACs to be studied, the maximum emission peak of the ground samples in DMF with different detectable substances were collected under 292 nm (c). Significantly, remarkable luminescence quenching behavior was observed in nitrobenzene (NB) DMF solution. In addition, the luminescence intensity can be kept well in DMF for 1 day (Figure S16).

The corresponding luminescence intensity quickly reduced to 81 and 24% at 1 \u00d7 10-3 and 1 \u00d7 10-2 M, respectively, which may be ascribed to the electron transfer from the host structure of 2
