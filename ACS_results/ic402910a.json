Whereas I is active under visible-light irradiation owing to a Cu(I)-to-Mo(VI) charge transfer, III is active under only ultraviolet irradiation that instead stems from the higher-energy excitation from the oxide ligands to Mo(VI). The molecular structure of III renders it more soluble in aqueous solutions, ultimately leading to the detachment of the Cu cations from the octamolybdate clusters. When tested under similar conditions, the dissolved octamolybdate clusters from III exhibit the higher photocatalytic rates per gram for hydrogen production of ~4700 \u03bcmol H2 g-1 h-1, compared to ~316 \u03bcmol H2 g-1 h-1 for I. However, III shows lower turnover frequencies per [\u03b1-Mo8O26]4- cluster at ~9 h-1, compared to I of ~142 h-1. In homogeneous photocatalysis, all [\u03b1-Mo8O26]4- clusters are dissolved in solution and can function as catalyst sites for water reduction. Therefore, although each dissolved cluster from III exhibits a relatively lower turnover frequency, the net sum of all of their individual contributions leads to a higher overall photocatalytic rate.

In the visible range of wavelengths, only I exhibited bandgap light absorption, whereas II and III only showed small absorption peaks originating from the Cu(II)-based d-to-d transitions. Accordingly, only I was found to show visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity in pure water with no sacrificial reagents or cocatalysts, with the detection of only trace amounts of hydrogen. Powder X-ray diffraction was used to confirm that I remains stable under each of these photocatalysis testing conditions (see the ). Using only visible-light irradiation (420-800 nm) at a high power density of ~1.0 W/cm2, a photocatalytic rate of ~90.0 \u03bcmol O2 g-1 h-1 was measured over the course of two 3 h testing periods, as shown in Figure c. Recovery of the photocatalytic activity was obtained after resuspending the powder of I into a fresh aqueous solution. The turnover frequency per [Mo8O26]4- cluster was calculated to be ~36 h-1, based on its measured specific surface area of 1.5 m2/g and the average density of surface clusters calculated for various planes of the crystal structure. Under both ultraviolet and ultraviolet and visible light irradiation, shown in Figure a, the photocatalytic activity of I in 20% methanol aqueous solution was measured to be ~316 \u03bcmol H2 g-1 h-1, with a turnover frequency of ~142 h-1. Moreover, the rate was significantly enhanced to ~471 \u03bcmol H2 g-1 h-1, with a turnover frequency of ~193 h-1 after loading additional 1 wt % Pt cocatalyst on the surface of I, as shown in Figure b. Each of these rates declined over the course of several hours, but which could be recovered by drying and resuspending the crystalline particles in a fresh aqueous solution. Although several polyoxomolybdate compounds have recently been reported to be active for dye degradation, only one recent example containing the octamolybdate cluster is known to be active for hydrogen production, with a reported rate of ~0.78 \u03bcmol h-1 under ultraviolet irradiation. For condensed metal-oxide photocatalysts (i.e., not containing ligands), rates for the production of oxygen and/or hydrogen under visible-light irradiation can vary significantly over the range of tens to thousands of micromoles per gram per hour, depending on the specific metal-oxide (e.g., AgNbO3 and WO3), the irradiation intensity, and the use of cocatalysts and/or sacrificial reagents. Recently, we reported the first example of a metal-oxide/organic hybrid, Mn(bpy)V4O11(bpy), that is photocatalytically active for total water splitting under visible-light irradiation with a rate of ~21 \u03bcmol H2/1/2O2 g-1 h-1. Under comparable conditions, I exhibits higher visible-light photocatalytic activities.\n\nThe precipitation of the dissolved clusters of III results in a brown powder that is amorphous by powder X-ray diffraction, as shown in Figure S13 (). Approximately 1.35 mg of this amorphous powder was redissolved into aqueous methanol and exhibited photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production of ~8670 \u03bcmol H2\u22c5g-1 h-1 with a turnover frequency of ~17 h-1, shown in Figure . More than 78 \u03bcmol of hydrogen evolved with a total turnover number of ~118 after an 8 h reaction time. During the initial dissolution of the clusters, the color of the solid powder changed from green to brown, indicating a possible change in structure or in oxidation states. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance of the brown amorphous powder shows a new broad absorption edge that emerges beginning at ~1.7 eV, shown in Figure . Mass spectrometry measurements confirmed the presence of the [Cu(o-phen)2]2[\u03b1-Mo8O26] clusters in III. However, after irradiation of III by ultraviolet light in methanol solution, the mass spectrometry data show primarily protonated [\u03b1-Mo8O26]4- species in solution. Further, the electron paramagnetic resonance data exhibit a decreased amount of Cu(II) cations in the precipitant. This suggests the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) in the solution of III while under ultraviolet irradiation, resulting in a decreased bandgap size that is similar in origin to that for I (i.e., d10-to-d0 electronic transitions). Subsequently, during the dissolution of III, a significant fraction of the Cu(I)/Cu(II) cations become detached from the octamolybdate clusters, especially as a result of the solution becoming increasingly acidified owing to the products of methanol oxidation. This is consistent with the electronic structure calculations that suggest the origin of the photocatalytic activity for water reduction is from the electrons excited within the [Mo8O26]4- clusters.",
