A SQUEEZE calculation indicated the presence of 623 e/unit cell with a solvent accessible area volume of 2723.5 \u00c53 in 1. This may be attributed to 10 water molecules in the crystal lattice. Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) also supports this finding; a weight loss of 22.0% within the temperature range 19-272 \u00b0C may be assigned to 11 water molecules (1 coordinated + 10 lattice included water molecules; calcd weight loss of 11 water = 22.5%), which is in agreement with the single crystal structure and SQUEEZE results (Figure S1 of the ).\n\nThe overall packing displays tiny channels running down the crystallographic a-axis wherein some disordered electron densities were located in the refinement cycles of 2. These electron densities were attributed to disordered water molecules and squeezed out in the final cycles of refinement. SQUEEZE calculations showed the presence of 13 e/unit cell (with a solvent accessible area volume of 57.3 \u00c53), which amounts to 6.5 e per asymmetric unit; this may be attributed to 0.65 water molecule. Since the data were collected at room temperature, loss of lattice-included solvent such as water in the present case may take place. TG data further support this assignment. In TG, a weight loss of 2.6% is observed within the temperature range 24-185 \u00b0C whereas the calculated weight loss considering 0.65 water molecule in the asymmetric unit as suggested in the SQUEEZE calculation is 2.4%, which is in agreement with the experimental results (Figure S2 of the ).\n\nReferences\n\nX-ray crystallography: X-ray single crystal data were collected using Mo K\u03b1 (\u03bb = 0.7107 \u00c5) radiation on a BRUKER APEX II diffractometer equipped with a CCD area detector. Data collection, data reduction, and structure solution/refinement were carried out using the software package of SMART APEX. All structures were solved by direct methods and refined in a routine manner. In most of the cases, non-hydrogen atoms were treated anisotropically. Whenever possible, the hydrogen atoms were located on a difference Fourier map and refined. In other cases, the hydrogen atoms were geometrically fixed.
