We speculated that NU-905, as a porphyrin-containing MOF, could also demonstrate CEES oxidation under light irradiation. To test the performance of NU-905 as a photocatalyst, we carried out photocatalysis experiments (see the Supporting Information for details) under our standard conditions. With 1 mol % catalyst used (based on porphyrin), NU-905 converted 65% of the starting material in 5 min and 100% in 10 min ( and S5 and S6). The selectivity of the catalytic reaction toward the monooxygenated product (CEESO) over toxic dioxygenated 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfone (CEESO2) was confirmed via NMR of the reaction mixture.
