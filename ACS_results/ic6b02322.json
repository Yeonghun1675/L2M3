Two different potential mechanisms were investigated in detail for each alkyl hydroperoxide containing complexes with and without a coordinating water molecule. In the first case, the catalytic cycle (see ) starts from complex 6  H  2  O  (or 20 when 4-hydroperoxy heptane is the substrate), which was isolated and characterized by X-ray crystallography in the case of the cyclohexyl hydroperoxide. Upon loss of water, the intermediate 13/21 is formed and recoordination of the peroxide to the \u03b71 binding mode results in the \"loose\" alkyl peroxido complex 14/22 that is higher in energy than the starting complex 6  H  2  O /20 (27 kJ/mol for CyOOH and 19 kJ/mol for HeptOOH). The change in coordination from the \u03b72 to the \u03b71 binding mode is critical to enter the six-membered transition states TS15 and TS23 in which the hydrogen, bound to the peroxide carbon, is transferred to the vanadium oxido group. Proton relays were also studied for this step (see the SI); however, they are higher in energy. Simultaneously, the weak O-O bond is cleaved, releasing the corresponding ketone and creating a new oxido group on the vanadium center together with the newly formed hydroxyl group. The barrier of this reaction with respect to the \"loose\" alkyl hydroperoxides 14 and 22 is 83 kJ/mol for CyOOH and 73 kJ/mol for HeptOOH, and irreversible decay into the ketone and intermediate 16 is strongly exergonic by 365 or 381 kJ/mol, respectively. The hydroxy vanadyl intermediate 16 can then add another molecule of alkyl hydroperoxide to regenerate the initial complexes 6  H  2  O  and 20 via TS17 and water. Addition of one molecule of cyclohexyl hydroperoxide to the vanadium hydroxyl complex 16 in the absence of water or alcohol can proceed through the calculated four-membered transition state TS19, which has a relatively high energetic barrier of 80 kJ/mol for CyOOH. However, this barrier can be lowered through proton relay mechanisms, and water or alcohol can act as such proton relay agents. The respective transition states are indeed lower, with a barrier of 65 kJ/mol for TS18 through water (from the solvent) and 57 kJ/mol for TS17 with cyclohexanol (from the starting vanadium complex). The overall highest energetic gap in this mechanism, namely, the hydrogen transfer in TS15/TS23, amounts to 110 kJ/mol for CyOOH and 92 kJ/mol for HeptOOH, which is around half of the homolytic bond dissociation energy of a typical O-O bond. A lower energetic gap of 101 and 86 kJ/mol is obtained for a similar mechanism in which one molecule of water remains at the catalyst during the reaction. Thus, complexes with water coordinating either cis (see Figure S64) or trans (see ) to the vanadium oxido group were calculated with the former being favorable by only 1 kJ/mol for CyOOH and 6 kJ/mol for HeptOOH. In contrast, the trans-coordinated water results in a lowering of the barrier by 9 kJ/mol for CyOOH (TS26), which can be explained by the oxido group's strong trans effect. The DFT calculations confirm the experimental results, as higher selectivity toward decomposition to the corresponding ketone is observed in the case of heptyl hydroperoxide. The lower barrier may arise from the linear alkane's capability to slightly better adapt to the transition state geometry, which is restricted in cyclic alkanes. In fact, when comparing the \"loose\" complexes 14 and 22 with the following transition states TS15 and TS23, looking at the distance between the oxido group and the hydrogen to be transferred, reveals that, for the linear alkane, the preceding intermediate 22 is closer to the transition state geometry than its cyclic counterpart. The changes in O-H distance are 0.72 \u00c5 for HeptOOH compared to 0.89 \u00c5 for CyOOH (for mechanisms with water coordinating trans, the changes are lower for both, but follow the same trend: 0.61 \u00c5 for HeptOOH, 0.76 \u00c5 for CyOOH). Additionally, a series of other mechanisms were also investigated for the dehydroperoxidation of cyclohexyl hydroperoxide to cyclohexanone (see the SI): Hydrogen transfer to the carboxyl group of the dipic ligand is unlikely to take place under the employed reaction conditions as it has an overall barrier of 162 kJ/mol compared to 110 kJ/mol for the transfer to the vanadium oxido group. Addition of cyclohexyl hydroperoxide to the hydroxido vanadium complex 16 by protonation of the ligand opens up pathways similar to the mechanism shown in Figure S66. Protonation of the carboxyl group is in fact feasible with an activation energy of 57 kJ/mol; however, both following hydrogen transfer transition states to the oxido or hydroxido group are too high in energy (117 and 135 kJ/mol, respectively). Moreover, insertion of the \u03b1-hydrogen of CyOOH into the O-O bond is disfavored with a barrier of 202 kJ/mol. This value is considerably reduced by proton relay through cyclohexanol (130 kJ/mol), which can be attributed to formation of a much less strained six-membered transition state, but is still higher in energy than hydrogen transfer to the vanadium oxido group. The formation of the corresponding alcohol most likely involves radical formation and/or homocoupling to dialkyl peroxides. The latter requires two substrate molecules binding simultaneously to one vanadium center, which might be favored by sterically less flexible moieties, like the cyclohexyl ring. Indeed, the formation of the dialkyl peroxide is only observed for the reaction with cyclohexyl hydroperoxide. Decomposition of the peroxide toward the alcohol occurs at around 60 \u00b0C for 4-HeptOOH and at room temperature for cyclohexyl hydroperoxide. This is generally not desired, and the corresponding mechanisms were thus not investigated.

The complexes were fully characterized by elemental analysis, IR, 1H, 13C, and 51V NMR spectroscopy, as well as mass spectrometry and X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, they were tested toward their catalytic dehydroperoxidation behavior and a significant difference between 4-heptyl hydroperoxide and cyclohexyl hydroperoxide was observed. In the case of 4-heptyl hydroperoxide, selectivity toward the corresponding ketone could be improved, which can be attributed, beside others, to the higher solubility of the in situ formed vanadium(V) hydroperoxido complex. Finally, DFT calculations performed on the vanadium complex showed that selective decomposition of secondary hydroperoxides with vanadium(V) to yield the corresponding ketone and water is indeed energetically feasible. The computed catalytic path, involving cleavage of the O-O bond, hydrogen transfer, release of ketone/water, and finally addition of hydroperoxide, can completely proceed without the generation of radical species. Further investigations are needed, as the demand on polyamides will increase in the future, and consequently, a more rational route to cyclohexanone is desired. From an economic point of view, avoiding the formation of cyclohexanol will decrease extra separation and oxidation steps, leading to a more efficient and straightforward process.
