New synthetic conditions using pyridine as a solvent in a Mannich-type reaction between a secondary amine and a hydrogen phosphinate ester led to an improved yield and to a significantly clearer reaction mixture, thereby enabling a simple, one-pot, gram-scale synthesis of the ligand. The thermodynamic properties of the ligand and of its complexes are similar to those of DOTA and of its monophosphorus acid analogues. The phosphorus side-arm amino group of lanthanide(III) complexes is protonated below pH = 6. The hydration break in complexes of lanthanide(III) ions appears just after gadolinium and, thus, the gadolinium(III) complex is fully hydrated in both protonation states. A small energy difference between species with coordination numbers 9 and 8 and the presence of the amino group near the IS water molecule account for the extremely fast water-exchange rate, unprecedented for gadolinium(III) complexes of DOTA-like ligands with q = 1.

The mixture was stirred at 30 \u00b0C for 1 day and thereafter at 40 \u00b0C for 2 days for full conversion (31P NMR). The excess of paraformaldehyde was filtered off, and the volatiles were evaporated in vacuo. The oily residue was dissolved in diethyl ether (Et2O; 50 mL), hexane was added until cloudy (~5 mL), and the mixture was left to stand overnight at room temperature. Then, the nonreacted excess of tBu3DO3A and some N,N'-dicyclohexylurea were filtered off. The filtrate was evaporated to dryness in vacuo, and the oily residue of full ester 3 was used directly in another reaction. Crude 3 was dissolved in trifluoroacetic acid/CHCl3 (1:1, v/v, 50 mL), and the solution was refluxed (75 \u00b0C) overnight.
