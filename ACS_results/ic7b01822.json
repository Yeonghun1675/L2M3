In order to inspect the stability of the compound, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out under a nitrogen flow, and the temperature was varied from 25 to 800 \u00b0C. The weight loss above 370 \u00b0C was attributed to decomposition of the framework. The corresponding TGA curve of the compound is illustrated in Figure S3. Afterward, Zn-MOF was soaked in an aqueous solution of Eu(NO3)3 to obtain the Eu-decorated MOF, Eu3+@Zn-MOF. The property characterization of Eu3+@Zn-MOF was investigated. The crystalline integrity of Zn-MOF remained unchanged after the incorporation of a Eu3+ ion, which can been confirmed by XRD (Figure S2). In order to explore the stability of the MOFs, the samples were treated with water. After immersion in an aqueous solution for 24 h, the XRD patterns of the MOFs show unchanged structures, which demonstrate their excellent stability (Figure S2). To obtain the number of Eu3+ ions entering into Zn-MOF, ICP-AES analysis on Eu3+@Zn-MOF has been performed. As shown in Table S3, the ratio of Zn2+ and Eu3+ is about 1:1 (1:0.81), which suggests that one noncoordinating carboxyl O atom may be interacting with one Eu3+ ion. To certify the coordination between the noncoordinating carboxyl O atom on Zn-MOF and the Eu3+ ions, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis on Eu3+@Zn-MOF was performed. As shown in Figure S4, the Eu 3d peak position of Eu3+@Zn-MOF at 1134.5 e is lower than that of Eu(NO3)3 (1136.4 eV), and the Eu 4d peak position at 136.8 eV is lower than that of Eu(NO3)3 (137.7 eV), which further confirms the successful coordination of the carboxyl O atom to the Eu3+ ion.
