Interestingly, as shown in , their fluorescence intensity was found to depend to a large extent on the type of metal ion. Fe3+ ions have a particularly obvious fluorescence quenching effect. Ag+, Al3+, Ca2+, and K+ show moderate quenching, while the other metal ions have a negligible effect on the fluorescence. Further experiments of the sensitivity were conducted by gradually adding a Fe3+ ion aqueous solution to polymer 1 dispersed in EtOH. As shown in , with a gradual increase in the concentration of the Fe3+ aqueous solution, the emission intensity of polymer 1 at 615 nm gradually decreases. The quenching percentage of polymer 1 toward Fe3+ ions was evaluated to be 91.59%. The fluorescent quenching efficiency can be explained by the Stern-Volmer equation I 0/I = 1 + K sv[Q], in which I 0 and I are the fluorescent intensities of the MOF suspensions without and with Fe3+, K sv is the quenching constant (M-1), and [Q] represents the molar concentration of Fe3+ ions (\u03bcM). As depicted in Figure S10, there is a good linear relationship (R 2= 0.997) between I 0/I and the concentration of Fe3+ ions. The K sv value of polymer 1 for Fe3+ ions was calculated to be 1.30 \u00d7 104 M-1. Compared with the K sv values of the previously reported lanthanide-based luminescent sensors, the K sv value of polymer 1 is higher than those of [Tb(L)(DMA)]\u22c5DMA\u22c50.5H2O (where L = L3 -, H3L = 3'-hydroxybiphenyl-3,4',5-tricarboxylic acid; K sv = 1.91 \u00d7 103 M-1) and [Eu(IMS1)2]Cl\u22c54H2O (where IMS1 = 1,3-bis(4-carboxylbenzyl)-imidazolium; K sv = 5.87 \u00d7 103 M-1). According to the detection limit formula 3\u03c3/K sv (\u03c3 is the standard deviation of the fluorescence intensity of the blank solution), the detection limit of polymer 1 toward Fe3+ ions was calculated to be 3.45 \u03bcM, which is much lower than that of [Eu(IMS1)2]Cl\u22c54H2O (2.3 \u00d7 10-5 mol/L).

Therefore, a tunable luminescence property can be easily obtained by combining the blue-light emission from the ligand and the red-light emission of Eu3+. Especially, the MOFs of 2.5%Eu3+@6 and 5%Eu3+@6 with near-white-light emission were prepared by reasonably combining the blue-light emission of the ligand and the red-light emission of rare-earth ions. The CIE coordinates are (0.3358, 0.3474) and (0.3371, 0.3475), and their CIE chromaticity diagrams are shown in . They are located in the white light emitting region due to the synergistic effect of Eu3+ and the H2L ligand that can be used as common lighting sources.
