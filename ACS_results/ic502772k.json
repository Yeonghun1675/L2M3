In both 4 and 6, all four arylcarboxylate groups assist in coordinating a pair of secondary M2+ ions that result in a 2D architecture running in the crystallographic b axis. Both six-coordinated secondary M2+ ions display a typical paddle-wheel structure additionally bridged by a \u03bc-OH group, however, differing by the arrangement of terminal ligands. One of the metal ions is ligated with two Ocarboxylate atoms, one bridging hydroxide, and three water molecules, while coordination sites for the second metal ion are satisfied by five Ocarboxylate and a bridging hydroxide group. Notably, in both cases, the third metal is present as {M(H2O)6}2+ cluster in the crystal lattice. Such a {M(H2O)6}2+ cluster is held in a network lattice by the operation of assorted H-bonds between M-bound water molecules, Oamide atoms, and lattice water molecules. Noticeably, when the grinded sample of either network 4 or 6 is suspended in various solvents the {M(H2O)6}2+ cluster does not come out from the crystal lattice. Further, no exchange was observed when the powdered sample is suspended in a solvent containing other divalent or trivalent metal ions. These experiments suggest the stable nature of {M(H2O)6}2+ cluster within the network and the requirement of charge balance is the primary driving force for their presence in a lattice.

In a typical epoxidation reaction, olefin and TBHP were reacted in a 1:3 ratio in the presence of 2 mol % of catalyst (networks 3, 4, 5 or 6) at 50 \u00b0C under the solvent-free reaction conditions. Under these conditions, a smooth reaction took place and the desired product, epoxide, was formed in good yield along with a small amount of byproduct (respective aldehyde). All four networks produced 92-95% styrene oxide in addition to 5-6% of benzaldehyde (entry 1; Table ). To evaluate the impact of the electronic effect on the epoxidation of olefin, several para-substituted styrenes were used. Notably, both electron-rich as well as electron-deficient styrenes were equally effective with all four networks (92-95% yield; entries 1-4; Table ). However, in the case of 4-tert-butyl-1-vinylbenzene, the yield is dropped to 69-83% (entry 5; Table ), probably due to the steric hindrance of the tert-butyl group which may have restricted its accessibility to the catalytic sites. A similar observation was noted for the diffusion and exchange studies using tert-butyl alcohol. The influence of steric hindrance is further supported by the epoxidation of sterically demanding substrates, such as 1-vinylnaphthalene, 2-vinylnapthalene, and 9-vinyl anthracene. In these cases, substrate-size-dependent catalysis was observed. For network 6, the conversion decreased in order of styrene (93%) > 4-tert-butyl-1-vinylbenzene (83%) > 1-vinylnaphthalene (68%) ~ 2-vinylnapthalene (70%) > 9-vinylanthracene (24%) in line with their sizes: styrene (7.00 \u00d7 8.45 \u00c52), 4-tert-butyl-1-vinylbenzene (7.00 \u00d7 9.93 \u00c52), 1-vinylnapthalene (7.00 \u00d7 8.81 \u00c52), 2-vinylnaphthalene (7.00 \u00d7 10.37 \u00c52), 9-vinylanthracene (8.42 \u00d7 10.34 \u00c52).
