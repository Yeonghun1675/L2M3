Thus, a further approximation was executed: both J  2  and interchain (J 3) interactions were treated as an intermolecular interaction (J\u2018 = J 2 + J 3) by mean-field theory with the magnetic susceptibility expression    The experiment data above 40 K were least-squares fit to give the best sets of parameters J 1 = -3.01 cm-1, J\u2018 = 0.32 cm-1, g = 1.88, and R = 1.9 \u00d7 10-6 for 1 and J 1 = -3.21 cm-1, J\u2018 = 0.68 cm-1, g = 1.93, and R = 4.5 \u00d7 10-6 for 2 (R = \u2211[(\u03c7M T)obs - (\u03c7M T)calcd]2/\u2211[(\u03c7M T)obs]2). The results well confirmed the intracluster AF couplings in 1 and 2 through oxo bridges, which are much weaker than those in carboxylato-MnIII 3O clusters. Because J 2 is the predominant intercluster interaction, the positive J\u2018 indicates that the couplings, though acetate bridges, are ferromagnetic. The larger J\u2018 for 2 might result from the weaker interchain AF interactions (J 3), which is in accord with the above observation. It is known that the equilateral [M3O] triangle undergoes a magnetic Jahn-Teller effect, and an isosceles model was then tried to fit the magnetic susceptibilities of 1 and 2, which, however, did not give reasonable results. It should be noted to observe ferromagnetic couplings through the anti-anti acetato bridges here, which was found to give AF couplings in [Mn(salen)(OAc)]. It would be expected to construct new single-chain magnets through further increases of the interchain distances.
