However, 1 and 2 still fall well short in terms of the brightness and temperature dependent behavior requirements that are essential for commercial viability of a phosphor. Nevertheless, our findings point to the real possibility of finding high performance inorganic-organic phosphor systems, especially if the frameworks can be rendered more rigid than those described in the present work.
