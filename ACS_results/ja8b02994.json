After deposition of the obtained mixture on filter paper, nitrogen gas was bubbled through a 6 M HCl solution. Notably, exposure to just nitrogen did not lead to any surface changes. Hydrochloric acid vapors were released through a narrow tip (i.d. = 4 mm) to localize their effect. As shown in , such treatment resulted in local framework degradation, which is accompanied by linker release, that is, formation of noncoordinated photochromic TNDS. Surface changes were monitored by photoluminescence spectroscopy and structural ones by PXRD.  demonstrates that before acid vapor exposure, the emission profile has a maximum of \u03bbmax = 680 nm (\u03bbex = 350 nm) but framework degradation causes a hypsochromic shift of more than 100 nm, and therefore the emission maximum became similar to that of a \"free\" photochromic linker. These drastic changes in emission (from purple to green) allowed detection of scaffold degradation by the naked eye. Moreover, these changes were local, that is, occurred only at the exposed area. As a control experiment, the noncoordinated linker, TNDS, was exposed to HCl vapors under similar conditions (Figure S20). In that case, we observed similar emission with \u03bbmax = 550 nm (\u03bbex = 345 nm) to that of the \"exposed\" framework. The same protonation of TNDS was observed in solution by bubbling HCl vapors (Figure S21). Furthermore, due to framework degradation (monitored by PXRD studies), the \"released\" photochromic TNDS highlighted the corroded areas permanently, which provided a pathway to use such changes as a good indicator for necessary material treatment or replacement.

The resulting mixture was stirred for 2 days at 120 \u00b0C. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was transferred in a 250 mL separatory funnel, following dilution with deionized water (75 mL). The product was then extracted with ethyl acetate (3 \u00d7 50 mL). The organic layers were combined, washed with brine (50 mL), and dried over sodium sulfate, followed by filtration and solvent removal under vacuum. The obtained red/brown oil was recrystallized several times using ethyl acetate and hexanes. The resulting orange powder was dissolved in ethyl acetate (20 mL) and hexanes (30 mL), and the solvent was removed under vacuum until a suspension formed. The suspension was filtered to collect a light-tan powder. After drying on vacuum, HDDB (50.0 mg, 625 \u03bcmol) was isolated in 15% yield. In order to obtain crystals of a specific diastereomer of HDDB, it was subjected to preparatory TLC using a 5:95 (v/v) methanol/dichloromethane, in which the product was extracted with acetone followed by slow evaporation of the solvent overnight, and crystals of HDDBin-in were isolated.
