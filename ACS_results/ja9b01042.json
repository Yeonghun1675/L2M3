This leads to a face-to-face orientation between nearby cage subunits (e.g., subunits A, B, and C in ), as well as the possibility of forming either infinite polymeric cage-containing structures or discrete dimeric cages. The addition of Cp2Co+ whose size is roughly at the limit of the open cavities results not only in a drastic change in the structural parameters (Table S2) of the constituent cages in comparison to Cage-1 but also to the formation of polymeric cages. The crystalline structural differences between PC-1 and PC-2 are also ascribed to the slight variations in the size and shape of these two cations (i.e., Cp2Co+ vs TEA+; cf. Table S2). TEA+ is too large to fit completely inside the open cavity and its alkyl substituents are too small to intrude appreciably into the voids in PC-1. As a result, the two face-to-face subunits of ligand 1 (i.e., colored the same in cage subunits A and B in c) lie parallel to one another.
