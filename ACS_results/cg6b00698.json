The linker symmetry is reduced to D 2h  and therefore a planar square model is not adequate to describe this geometry (), and a description of \"planar rectangular\" shape is preferred for this class of linkers. It should be noted that the linker shape is best reflected in the MCP structure. Whenever a crystal structure is available, the aspect ratio should be measured based on the distance between centroids of metal cluster as this is the most accurate way to describe the geometry of the linker. However, from a practical standpoint, no crystal structure will be available when designing a new MCP. Therefore, a measurement based solely on the linkers (distance between carbon atoms of carboxylate groups) is used as a surrogate tool to assess the aspect ratio of the designed linker. Attempts have been made to calculate the centroids-based aspect ratio from linker-based aspect ratio plus known carboxylate group to Zr6 cluster centroid distance. However, severe bending between the carboxylate group and the Zr6 cluster are found in certain MCPs (for example, PCN-222). No angles based solely on the linker can be correlated to this bending and thus the attempts failed. From a practical standpoint, even a slight deviation from a linker aspect ratio of 1 suggests that a rectangular shape will arise in the framework (demonstrated in Figure S3 using PCN-222 and NU-1000 as examples).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 12, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Topology representations\nof (a) H<sub>2</sub>BDC, H<sub>3</sub>BTB and (b) H<sub>3</sub>TPTC.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cg-2016-00698y_0002.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Topology representations of (a) H2BDC, H3BTB and (b) H3TPTC.
