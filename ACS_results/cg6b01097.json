We demonstrate herein two highly connected frameworks, namely, {[Cd7(BDC)6(MTAZ)2(DMF)6]\u22c53DMF} n  (SNNU-11) and {[Cd5(BDC) (PTAZ)8(DMF)2]\u22c54DMF} n  (SNNU-12) (BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid, MTAZ = 5-methyl-tetrazole, and PTAZ = 5-(4-pyridyl)-tetrazole). In SNNU-11, BDC ligands link S-shaped [Cd7(MTAZ)2] motifs to form a novel 10-connected framework, which is related to but different from the reported 10-connected bct and gpu nets. Under the similar synthesis condition, the utilization of 5-(4-pyridyl)-tetrazole produced SNNU-12, which is constructed from zigzag Cd5 clusters and exhibits a 12-connected fcu net. Notably, SNNU-12 decorated with uncoordinated nitrogen sites shows not only high CO2 uptake capacity (87.9 cm3 g-1, 1 atm, and 273 K) but also high CO2 over CH4 and C2 hydrocarbons over CH4 selectivity, which is among the highest values of highly connected MOF materials (connectivity \u226510) including famous UiO-66 and rare-earth fcu-MOFs under the same temperature and pressure.\n\nGas Adsorption\n\nPLATON calculations show that the guest-accessible volumes of highly connected MOFs SNNU-11 and -12 are 23.6% and 37.3%, respectively. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) shows that the framework of as-synthesized samples starts to collapse at above 300 \u00b0C for both compounds. Such porosity and thermal stability render them suitable candidates for gas sorption applications (Figure S4).\n\nAs shown in Figure S5, the N2 and H2 adsorption for SNNU-11 at 77 K is neglectable. One possible reason is that three terminal coordinated DMF molecules around each Cd3 centers block the pores. However, for SNNU-12, the N2 sorption isotherms at 77 K indicate typical type I sorption behavior, characteristic of microporous materials with a saturated sorption amount of N2 of 190.5 cm3/g (8.5 mmol/g). The BET and Langmuir surface areas and pore volume are 519.5 and 815.1 m2/g, and 0.28 cm3 g-1, respectively. Notably, the pore width of SNNU-12 is about 4.9 \u00c5 by Horvath-Kawazoe (H-K) method, suggesting that this framework may a suitable candidate for small molecular gas uptake and separations. Therefore, the sorption behaviors of SNNU-12 toward H2, CO2, C2H2, C2H4, and CH4 were further investigated.\n\nThe H2 sorption isotherms for SNNU-12 were given in b. The uptake of H2 is 155.4 cm3 g-1 (1.38 wt %) at 1 atm and 77 K, which surpasses the values of most highly connected MOFs (connectivity \u226510) and a lot of famous MOF materials such as MOF-5 and MOF-177 under the same conditions. The low-pressure CO2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured at 273 and 298 K for SNNU-12. As shown in , at 1 atm, the CO2 uptakes are 3.92 mmol/g (87.9 cm3 g-1, 273 K) and 2.83 mmol/g (63.4 cm3 g-1, 298 K). To the best of our knowledge, the CO2 uptake of SNNU-12 is among the highest values of reported 12-connected MOFs including famous UiO-66 and rare-earth fcu-MOFs under the same temperature and pressure. Moreover, C2H2 and C2H4 gas are selected in this work to evaluate the C2 hydrocarbons over CH4 separation ability of SNNU-12. At 273 K and 1 atm, the C2H2 and C2H4 uptakes are 98.7 and 84.0 cm3 g-1. At 298 K and 1 atm, the values are 72.0 and 71.8 cm3 g-1. The CH4 uptake capacities of SNNU-12 are 1.46 mmol/g (32.7 cm3 g-1) at 273 K and 1 atm.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "SNNU-11", "symbol": "", "chemical formula":
