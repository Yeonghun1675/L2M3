Upon completion of addition, the DMF was removed in vacuum, and the resulting yellowish residue was dissolved in CHCl3 (100 mL) and filtered. The CHCl3 solution was washed with 0.1 M NaOH and distilled water (300 mL) and then dried over anhydrous MgSO4. The solvent was removed in vacuum to obtain the crude product as a viscous oil and a solid mixture. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude product was revealed as a mixture of two isomers ( o  -bis-L and  m  -bis-L) in a 1:4 ratio. The recrystallization of the crude mixed product from dichloromethane/ethanol (1:9) yielded  m  -bis-L as a white microcrystalline solid which still contains a small amount of  o  -bis-L. The flash column chromatography (SiO2; DCM/ethyl acetate 9:1) of the recrystallized solid product afforded  m  -bis-L in pure form as a white solid. Yield 574 mg (26%).
