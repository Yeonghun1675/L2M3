Both JUC-130 and JUC-131 did not uptake N2 gas at 77 K. However, as shown in Figure , the CO2 adsorption isotherms at 195 K revealed that they are typical microporous materials, which reach the value of 129 cm3 g-1 (25 wt %) and 107 cm3 g-1 (21 wt %) at 1 bar for JUC-130 and JUC-131. The CO2 adsorption was increased to 60 cm3 g-1 (12 wt %) and 68 cm3 g-1 (13 wt %) by a sharp gas uptake at a low-pressure region (P/P 0 < 0.1) and the uptake increased as the pressure increased, which is typically observed for micoporous materials. The observed hysteresis in the CO2 isotherms was similar to the literature examples, which may be attributed to the small pore windows and pore expansion in MOFs. The Langmuir surface areas of JUC-130 and JUC-131 are 423 and 372 m2 g-1, respectively. The results may be due to the molecular sieve effect (kinetic diameter: CO2, 3.30 \u00c5; N2, 3.64 \u00c5) of the small channels. Meanwhile, the quadrupole moment of CO2 also may facilitate the penetration of gas molecules into the pores, which can be attributed to the enhanced interactions between CO2 and numerous nitrogen atoms of the framework.

As shown in Figure a, the peaks on the PXRD patterns of as-synthesized samples of JUC-130 and JUC-131 are coincident with those on their respective simulated patterns. From the thermogravimetric analyses (Figure b), JUC-130 showed a slow weight loss of 25.11% before 190 \u00b0C, which corresponds to the loss of guest H2O and terminal DMF molecules (calculated 26.27%). The framework then collapsed and decomposed with the increase of temperature. The residue was CuO (experimental: 11.33% and calculated: 13.52%). For JUC-131, it is found that there was a weight loss of 28.17% before 200 \u00b0C, which could be attributable to the loss of guest DMF and terminal H2O molecules (calculated 26.77%). The residue was CdO (experimental: 16.47% and calculated: 18.87%). The as-synthesized samples were activated via soaking in methanol and CH2Cl2 and then evacuated to obtain their activated samples. The PXRD patterns of the activated samples are shown in , which showed the activated frameworks were almost containing their structures.\n\nGas and Vapor Sorption\n\nIn order to verify their permanent porosities, gas sorption isotherms of activated JUC-130 and JUC-131 were measured. Both JUC-130 and JUC-131 did not uptake N2 gas at 77 K. However, as shown in Figure , the CO2 adsorption isotherms at 195 K revealed that they are typical microporous materials, which reach the value of 129 cm3 g-1 (25 wt %) and 107 cm3 g-1 (21 wt %) at 1 bar for JUC-130 and JUC-131. The CO2 adsorption was increased to 60 cm3 g-1 (12 wt %) and 68 cm3 g-1 (13 wt %) by a sharp gas uptake at a low-pressure region (P/P 0 < 0.1) and the uptake increased as the pressure increased, which is typically observed for micoporous materials. The observed hysteresis in the CO2 isotherms was similar to the literature examples, which may be attributed to the small pore windows and pore expansion in MOFs. The Langmuir surface areas of JUC-130 and JUC-131 are 423 and 372 m2 g-1, respectively. The results may be due to the molecular sieve effect (kinetic diameter: CO2, 3.30 \u00c5; N2, 3.64 \u00c5) of the small channels. Meanwhile, the quadrupole moment of CO2 also may facilitate the penetration of gas molecules into the pores, which can be attributed to the enhanced interactions between CO2 and numerous nitrogen atoms of the framework. \n\nLuminescent Property and Detection for Nitroaromatic Compounds\n\nLuminescent coordination complexes with d10 transition-metal clusters have been attracting intensive research interest for luminescent materials, owing to their potential applications in chemical sensors, photochemistry, and electroluminescent displays. The solid-state luminescent properties of free H  3  TTPB ligand and JUC-131 were analyzed at room temperature. As shown in Figure a, the free H  3  TTPB ligand exhibits emission at 417 nm upon excitation at 366 nm. Compared to the excitation and emission spectra of the free H  3  TTPB ligand, JUC-131 shows a similar emission at 440 nm in the solid state (\u03bbex = 366 nm), which indicates that the luminescent property of JUC-131 is mostly attributed to the emission of the organic linker. The spectral red shift (23 nm) is mainly attributed to the intraligand transition and ligand-to-metal, which are in good agreement with literature examples on this class of d10 transition-metal coordination compounds.
