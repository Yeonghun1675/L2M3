Such high conductivity at subzero temperatures endows them with the potential to work as PEMs of FCs for automotive application in cold climates.\n\nFrom the Arrhenius plots (c), their intrinsic proton conductivity increases linearly as the temperature increases. The intrinsic conductivity (\u03c3) of FJU-17 is 3.17 \u00d7 10-3 S/cm at 30 \u00b0C, close to 9 times higher than 3.64 \u00d7 10-4 S/cm for FJU-16 and higher than most reported proton-conducting materials (Table S2). As the temperature continues to rise, FJU-16 shows highest intrinsic conductivity, and its conductivity at 80 \u00b0C reaches 1.25 \u00d7 10-3 S cm-1, while FJU-17 shows the highest intrinsic conductivity and its conductivity at 100 \u00b0C reaches 1.08 \u00d7 10-2 S/cm, which is the highest among already published intrinsic proton-conductor MOFs at same conditions and comparable to that of dimethylammonium-containing MOFs (e.g., MROF-1, {[((CH3)2NH2)3(SO4)]2[Zn2(ox)3]} n , Fe-CAT-5), but the \u03c3 value is lower than that of reported humidity-dependent proton-conductive MOFs BUT-8(Cr)A and H2SO4@MIL-101(e,f). The working temperature range of FJU-17 is -40-100 \u00b0C, wider than most proton-conducting materials tested under humidity conditions, similar to other proton-conducting materials without additional humidity conditions (Table S2). Taking into account these results, the proton conductivity of FJU-17 is higher than that of FJU-16 over the whole temperature range and is proportional to the accessible void space for the guests (36.4% for FJU-16 and 73.8% for FJU-17). The larger void space can accommodate more guest molecules, leading to significant improvement of proton conductivity. To further prove guest molecules play a vital role in the proton conductor, we performed a proton-conduction study on the FJU-16 and FJU-17 sample preheated at 250 \u00b0C for 12 h. The preheated FJU-16 and FJU-17 do not display any proton-conductivity, presumably owing to the loss of guest molecules in the framework (Figure S14). Herein, we speculated the enhanced conductivity is attributed to the larger void space of framework that imparts higher capability of mobile protons hopping and forms a more extensive hydrogen-bond network for facile proton transfer (Figure S15). Moreover, we measured temperature dependent proton-conductivity during heating-cooling cycles for FJU-16 and FJU-17 (d). The proton conductivity rises at the heating regime and decreases during the cooling process. At the same temperature, the proton conductivity of two compounds almost coincides during the heating-cooling process, indicating the two compounds have good repeatability and stability in a wide temperature range. PXRD was performed to further confirm structural integrity after proton-conduction tests (Figures S1-S2).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "FJU-16", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "porosity":
