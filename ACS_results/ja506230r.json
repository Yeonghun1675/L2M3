Based on the similar framework structure, this indicates full evacuation of the pores and complete desolvation of the framework. Furthermore, the Co2(m-dobdc) BET surface area of 1264 m2/g is very close to the predicted surface area of 1297 m2/g from the geometric calculations. Achieving complete activation of the Mg analogue has proven challenging, and all efforts have thus far resulted in materials with lower than expected surface areas. As a result, the remaining data will focus only on the other four M2(m-dobdc) compounds.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "Co2(m-dobdc)", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition
