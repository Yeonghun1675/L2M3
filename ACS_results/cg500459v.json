In the light of this, solid state measurements at room temperature were carried out on species [Zn(DMPMB)], [Cd(DMPMB)], and [Cu  2  (DMPMB)]. Preliminary tests revealed that they respond differently when exposed to UV irradiation (Figure  top): when excited at 365 nm, [Zn(DMPMB)], [Cd(DMPMB)], and [Cu  2  (DMPMB)] exhibit an intense blue, near-white, and orange luminescence emission, respectively.

Finally, when excited at 365 nm, the Cu(I) species gives one broad band in the visible region, with a maximum at 597 nm.\n\nConclusions\n\nTwo novel series of thermally robust metal-organic frameworks, [M(DMPMB)] (M = Co, Zn, Cd) and [M  2  (DMPMB)] (M = Cu, Ag), were isolated by coupling the flexible, bis(pyrazolato)-based ligand 4,4'-bis((3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)methyl)biphenyl (H2DMPMB) and late transition metal ions. The ligand adopts an anti conformation and an exo-tetradentate coordination mode both in the isomorphous species [M(DMPMB)], inducing the formation of a 3-D architecture featuring non pervious 1-D channels, and in [Cu  2  (DMPMB)], in which corrugated 2-D layers are present. All the five materials are thermally stable and preserve their structural motif at least up to 300 \u00b0C, both under nitrogen and in air, the Cd(II) derivative decomposing only at 500 \u00b0C. While no adsorption of N2 is observed for [Cd(DMPMB)] at 77 K, the other MOFs possess estimated Langmuir specific surface areas in the range 142(4)-713(27) m2/g, suggesting that the flexible ligand has an active role in promoting specific structural modifications allowing the accommodation of the gaseous probe.
