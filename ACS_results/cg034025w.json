If this is true, then the chemical connectivity within the framework will remain essentially the same during the above-mentioned transformation. Indeed, the IR spectra (Figure ) in the region of the stretching vibration of the carboxylate group (1700-1300 cm-1) for 1, 2, and 3 are essentially the same. This is an indication that there is no significant modification of the coordination mode of the carboxylate groups. It is well-known that the difference \u0394 between the asymmetric stretching vibration and the symmetric one (\u0394 = \u03bdas - \u03bdsym) depends on the coordination mode of the carboxylate group. The value of \u0394 is well below 200 cm-1 (160, 139, and 178 cm-1 for 1, 3, and 2, respectively) and is compatible with the bridging or \"symmetric\" chelating coordination modes of the carboxylate group. The broadness of the two peaks suggests that both modes are present. This interpretation fits quite well with the results of the crystal structure of 1. This preference for the water seems to support the idea that the water network is closely related to the formation of the MOF. We may remark that all coordinated water molecules (Figure ) point inside the channels and may act as templates for attracting other water molecules.

However, the patterns of 1 and 3 are similar, showing that the structures of the two compounds are essentially the same. We may observe that the (020) reflection is still the predominant one, establishing with certainty the periodicity along the interlayer direction. The peaks in 2 are even broader than those of 3, but we can still recognize four low indice prominent peaks in the region 10\u00b0 < 2\u03b8 < 15\u00b0. The similarity with the patterns of 1 and 3 is obvious, albeit the first peak of 2 is displaced toward higher 2\u03b8 values. It is reasonable to suppose that upon progressive dehydration of 1, there is progressive deformation of the structure and, conversely, upon hydration there is progressive restauration of the initial structure. If this is true, then the chemical connectivity within the framework will remain essentially the same during the above-mentioned transformation. Indeed, the IR spectra (Figure ) in the region of the stretching vibration of the carboxylate group (1700-1300 cm-1) for 1, 2, and 3 are essentially the same. This is an indication that there is no significant modification of the coordination mode of the carboxylate groups. It is well-known that the difference \u0394 between the asymmetric stretching vibration and the symmetric one (\u0394 = \u03bdas - \u03bdsym) depends on the coordination mode of the carboxylate group. The value of \u0394 is well below 200 cm-1 (160, 139, and 178 cm-1 for 1, 3, and 2, respectively) and is compatible with the bridging or \"symmetric\" chelating coordination modes of the carboxylate group. The broadness of the two peaks suggests that both modes are present. This interpretation fits quite well with the results of the crystal structure of 1. This preference for the water seems to support the idea that the water network is closely related to the formation of the MOF. We may remark that all coordinated water molecules (Figure ) point inside the channels and may act as templates for attracting other water molecules. \n\n Magnetic Susceptibility Measurements. The planar conformation of the ligand and the presence of metal arrays bridged by the carboxylate groups encouraged us to proceed to magnetic characterization of compound 1 and of the evacuated compound 2. The experimental \u03c7Er [being the molar magnetic susceptibility per Er(III)] and \u03c7Er T vs T plots of 1 are shown in Figure a. The room temperature, \u03c7Er T value (10.76 cm3 K mol-1) is close to that (11.48 cm3 K mol-1) expected 30 for a free Er(III) ion. Upon cooling, \u03c7Er T decreases slightly up to ca. 45 K, where upon it decreases more rapidly, reaching 6.81 cm3 K mol-1 at 1.9 K. In the 300-1.9 K temperature range, the magnetic susceptibility data of 1 could be described by a Curie-Weiss law with Curie, C, and Weiss constant, \u03b8 values of 10.5 cm3 K mol-1 and -1.06 K, respectively. The corresponding values in the 50-300 K temperature range are 10.8 cm3 K mol-1 and -2.11 K, respectively. The situation is analogous for 2: its \u03c7Er vs T and \u03c7Er T vs T plots are shown in Figure b. The room temperature \u03c7Er T value of 10.37 cm3 K mol-1 is slightly lower than that of 1; still it declines more drastically as T decreases up to ca. 50 K, whereupon it decreases more rapidly, reaching 5.18 cm3 K mol-1 at 1.9 K. The Curie and Weiss constant values of 2 are C = 9.80 cm3 K mol-1 and \u03b8 = -2.19 K, respectively (for the 300-1.9 K temperature range), and 10.6 cm3 K mol-1 and -6.77 K, respectively (for the 50-300 K temperature range). In both cases, the average value of \u03c7Er T at room temperature is, as expected, close to what is predicted in the free-ion approximation.  Interpretation of the experimental data, however, remains difficult, due to the lack of proper theoretical fitting models for the three-dimensional structurally characterized 1, and the lack of X-ray structural data for 2. Nevertheless, both the decrease of the \u03c7Er T experimental value as T decreases, and the negative \u03b8 values calculated for both complexes, could be attributed to weak antiferromagnetic interactions, appearing stronger in 2.
