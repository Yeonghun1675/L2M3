The magnetic data of 1 is simulated based on the spin Hamiltonians in eq , using the package MAGPACK, where D is the ZFS parameter. J 1 corresponds to the interaction between the pair of metal ions bridged by two \u03bc1,1,1-azide groups, J 2 represents the spin coupling between metal centers bridged by a \u03bc1,1,1-azide and a carboxylate group, and J 3 refers to the spin coupling between Ni1 and Ni2 bridged by a \u03bc1,1-azide, a \u03bc1,1,1-azide and a carboxylate group. Using this rough model, the best-fit parameters obtained are J 1 = 11.5 cm-1, J 2 = 5.0 cm-1, J 3 = 7.0 cm-1, and D = 3.0 cm-1 with g = 2.1. The bridge angles of \u03bc1,1-azide often control exchange coupling. In 1, the ferromagnetic coupling J 1 between Ni2 and Ni2A bridged by two \u03bc1,1,1-azide groups is expected with the Ni2-N4-Ni2A angle of 94.83\u00b0. The weakened ferromagnetic contribution for J 2 and J 3 might be a small antiferromagnetic term exchanged via carboxylate groups. The reduced molar magnetization at 2 K (Figure b) corroborates the ferromagnetic coupling in tetranuclear [Ni4] entities: the M/N\u03b2 value at 7 T is close to 8.86 N\u03b2.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 10, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig3\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) \u03c7<sub>m</sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">T </italic>vs<italic toggle=\"yes\"> T</italic> plot for <bold>1</bold>.
