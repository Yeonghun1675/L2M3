The sample of Cd-L MOF was activated by exchanging the trapped solvent in the crystals with DCM followed by vacuum drying at 35 \u00b0C overnight. To begin with, the activated sample was examined for adsorption of nitrogen from very low to atmospheric pressure at 77 K, Figure ; the observed adsorption isotherm is typical of type-I behavior. The BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) surface area of the MOF was determined to be 421 m2/g on the basis of the N2 adsorption isotherm. Pore size analysis of the Cd-L MOF, based on the N2 isotherm at 77 K, reveals that the distribution is largely dominated by pores of ca. ~14 \u00c5 diameter. Likewise, adsorption of hydrogen was also carried out with the activated sample of Cd-L MOF. At 77 K, an uptake of 110 cc/g was observed at 1 bar, Figure . In the same vein, adsorption of CO2 by the Cd-L MOF up to the pressure 1 bar revealed an uptake of 163 cc/g at 195 K, Figure . As the Cd-L MOF exhibited high CO2 adsorption, CO2 uptake by Cd-L was also investigated at 273 and 298 K. Respectably high adsorptions of 99 and 79 cc/g were observed at 273 and 298 K, respectively. Clearly, the results vindicate significant uptake capacity of the Cd-MOF for CO2 at ambient temperature and pressure. The isosteric heat (Q st) of CO2 adsorption for Cd-L was calculated to be ca. 30 kJ mol-1 in the low uptake region based on the adsorption isotherms at 273, 278, and 283 \u00b0C.\n\nTo explore the potential of Cd-L MOF for separation of CO2 from a mixture under ambient conditions, N2 adsorption isotherm was recorded at 273 K, which revealed an uptake value of only 8.9 cc/g at 1 bar. The selectivity factor for CO2 capture by the Cd-L MOF over N2 was calculated on the basis of single-component isotherms at 273 K to be 18.4. Further, the CO2 storage capacity of Cd-L was investigated up to a pressure of 30 bar at 0 and 25 \u00b0C; the adsorption capacities were found to be 1000 and 420 cc/g at 273 and 298 K, respectively, cf., Figure  and the . Similarly, the CO2 uptake up to 40 bar at 50 \u00b0C indicates an uptake of 410 cc/g, cf., the .\n\nIn conclusion, we have rationally designed and synthesized a 1,2,3-triazole-functionalized semirigid tetraacid linker H  4  L to explore selective CO2 adsorption; the N-rich triazole moieties in H  4  L lie in close proximity of the carboxy groups that undergo chelation with metal ions. Solvothermal reaction of H  4  L with CdCl2 is shown to lead to 2D square-grid nets that undergo catenation into a 3D MOF, Cd-L, with channels running down the c-axis; the channels are formed by the triazole moieties of the linker L such that the interior is nitrogen rich. Remarkably, the Cd-L MOF is robust to desolvation and also stable in different polar and nonpolar organic solvents. Gas adsorption studies with N2 reveal that the activated Cd-L MOF has a BET surface area of 421 m2/g, and adsorbs CO2 with an uptake of 163 cc/g at 1 atm pressure at 195 K. The CO2 uptake capacity is quite respectable at atmospheric as well as high pressures.
