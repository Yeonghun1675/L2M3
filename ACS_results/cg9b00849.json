The metalloligand (CuL1) was also prepared according to the reported methods as written briefly here. To a methanolic solution (10 mL) of ligand (H2L1) (5 mmol), a methanolic solution of Cu(ClO4)2\u22c56H2O (1.852 g, 5 mmol, 10 mL) was added. To this mixture, triethylamine (1.4 mL, 10 mmol) was slowly added. The solution was kept in a beaker for slow evaporation of the solvent. A dark brown crystalline solid product of the precursor [CuL1] complex was isolated after 2 days by filtration.\n\nSynthesis of the Complex cis-{[(CuL1)2CdL2]\u22c5H2O} n  (1)\n\nA 10 mL methanolic solution of the metalloligand [CuL1] (0.772 g, 2 mmol) was prepared, and a 5 mL methanolic solution of Cd(ClO4)2\u22c56H2O (0.330 g, 1 mmol) was added. The solution was stirred well for 5 min for proper mixing. A 10 mL aqueous solution of biphenyl-4,4'-dicarboxylic acid (H2L2) was prepared (0.242 g, 1 mmol) separately. To deprotonate the acid, triethylamine (276 \u03bcL, 2 mmol) was slowly added and mixed well. The aqueous deprotonated acid solution, [L2]2-, was filtered, and the clear solution was poured in a layer tube.
