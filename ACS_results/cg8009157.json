Compared with <bold>1a</bold> and <bold>2a</bold>, 3D complexes <bold>1b</bold> and <bold>2b</bold> exhibit remarkable higher thermalstability. The TGA study of <bold>1b</bold> shows no weight loss from room temperature to 390 \u00b0C, suggesting that the framework is thermally stable. Above 390 \u00b0C, the weight loss is due to the collapse of the framework. Furthermore, the high density value (\u03c1 = 3.392 g/cm<sup>3</sup>) also supports the high thermal stability of the 3D framework. The TGA data for <bold>2b</bold> indicates the first weight loss occurs at ca. 239 \u00b0C and the second started at ca. 358 \u00b0C. For all complexes, complete decomposition is not achieved above 600 \u00b0C. The TGA results show that normally the 1D complexes are more unstable than 3D complexes, and the 3D complexes normally show high robustness for the coordination networks, which is consistent with the previous reported result. The simulated and experimental powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of <bold>2b</bold> are shown in a and . They are in good agreement with each other, which prove the phase purity of the as-synthesized product. The results of a series of varied temperature PXRD of <bold>2b</bold> from 100 to 300 \u00b0C exhibit no phase transformation and the coordination network variety ().</p>", "clean_text": "Thermal Properties and PXRD\n\nThermogravimeric analysis of 1a (Figure ) shows 12.3% weight loss between room temperature and 147 \u00b0C, in agreement with the corresponding calculated values of 12.5%, due to the loss of water molecules. The distinction between weight losses from the coordinated and noncoordinated water was not clearly demonstrated in TGA data. The relatively low temperature for loss of coordinated water molecules demonstrates their weak coordination. Then the continuous weight loses above 195 \u00b0C correspond to the continuous decomposition of 5-HATZ ligands and anions. For 2a, there is no weight loss from room temperature to 258 \u00b0C, and after that, it begins to decompose quickly. Compared with 1a and 2a, 3D complexes 1b and 2b exhibit remarkable higher thermalstability. The TGA study of 1b shows no weight loss from room temperature to 390 \u00b0C, suggesting that the framework is thermally stable. Above 390 \u00b0C, the weight loss is due to the collapse of the framework. Furthermore, the high density value (\u03c1 = 3.392 g/cm3) also supports the high thermal stability of the 3D framework.
