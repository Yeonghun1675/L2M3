The crystal structures, incorporating inorganic slabs and organic-bridged molecules, were determined mainly on the basis of single-crystal X-ray diffraction and PXRD along with IR and Raman data. A possible mechanism for the formation of CdE nanorods through the step-by-step elimination of the bridged organic spacers was then presented on the basis of the unique inorganic-organic hybrid structures of these precursors. Experimental facts concerning both the morphologies and the phases of the CdE products coming from the post-treatments of these precursors further evidenced the proposed mechanism.
