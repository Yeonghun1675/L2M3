There is no hysteresis of magnetization down to 1.8 K, confirming the lack of long-range magnetic order. The reduced magnetization clearly indicates some internal anisotropy; however, only a very feeble onset of slow magnetic relaxation is seen in zero field ac magnetic measurements (not shown).

Of the highest importance to this work is, however, the fact that the global skeleton deformations for the 1-3 and for the Co9W6-(4,4'-bpdo) compound are the smallest along the series. Furthermore, we used the CShM method to analyze the extent of deformation of the Co moieties along the entire series of 9 compounds involving 11 structurally independent clusters (; compare Tables S6-8). Considering the central [Co(\u03bc-NC)6]4- units, we found that the deformation from O  h  symmetry is slightly, yet systematically, increasing going from 1-3 and 4,4-bpdo group (\u0394 inaccessible), through the 2,2'-bpmo (\u0394 of 10-11 K) and mpm (\u0394 of 19 K) group, toward 2,2'-bpdo (\u0394 30 K) and MeOH (\u0394 of 10 K, 22 K, or 28 K) (a).
