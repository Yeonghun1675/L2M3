The uptakes of FJI-H23 for C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 are 168.50, 144.80, and 140.26 cm3\u22c5g-1 at ambient conditions, respectively. It is surprising that the uptakes of FJI-H23 for C3H4, C3H6, and C3H8 rise to 462.40, 350.66, and 325.76 cm3\u22c5g-1 at the same conditions, respectively. For example, FJI-H23 has a higher adsorption capacity for C2H6 than does Fe-MOF-74, UTSA-35a, UPC-21, JLU-Liu18, InOF-1, JUC-100, JLU-Liu37, JLU-Liu47, and many other MOFs (Table S3), which is only lower than that of NPC-700. To our best knowledge, FJI-H23 can take up more C2 and C3 hydrocarbons than most MOFs. Especially, the uptake amount of C3H8 is 325.76 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 298 K, which holds a new record in C3H8 storage for MOF materials. The activated FJI-H23 can absorb more energy gases when lowering the temperature to 273 K (C2H2, 258.67 cm3\u22c5g-1; C2H4, 198.30 cm3\u22c5g-1; C2H6, 267.51 cm3\u22c5g-1; C3H4, 497.55 cm3\u22c5g-1; C3H6, 397.07 cm3\u22c5g-1; C3H8, 361.89 cm3\u22c5g-1). However, FJI-H23 has a much lower capacity of CH4 storage (25.49 cm3\u22c5g-1, 273 K; 15.19 cm3\u22c5g-1, 298 K). More importantly, the uptakes for C3 hydrocarbons tend to saturation at low pressure, indicating the gases may strongly interact with the framework. Such great differences in the uptakes and the interactions indicate that FJI-H23 may possess a good ability for the separation C3 hydrocarbons and CH4.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "FJI-H23",
