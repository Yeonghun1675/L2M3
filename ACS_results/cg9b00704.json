The asymmetric unit of 1 contains two crystallographically unique Zn(II) ions, two tda2- anions, one tpt, and one lattice water (Figure S1). The Zn1 center exhibits two kinds of geometry, distorted tetrahedron (ca. 55%) and distorted tetragonal pyramid (ca. 45%), because of the disorder of carboxyl groups of tda2- anion. In the disordered tetrahedron/tetragonal pyramid, the Zn(II) center is four-/five-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two different tpt ligands and two/three oxygen atoms from two different tda2- anions. The distances of Zn-N [2.046(2)-2.067(2) \u00c5] and Zn-O [1.901(6)-2.271(13) \u00c5] are in the normal ranges of those observed in reported Zn (II) compounds. The central Zn2 center displays a distorted tetragonal pyramid, defined by four oxygen atoms [O8, O4iii, O3iv, O7v, symmetry codes (iii) 1 + x, 0.5 - y, -0.5 + y; (iv) 2 - x, -0.5 + y, 1.5 - z; (v) 3 - x, -y, 1 - z] from four different tda2- anions a least-squares plane with average deviation 0.008 \u00c5, and one nitrogen atom [N2ii; symmetry codes: (ii) 1 - x, -0.5 + y, 0.5 - z] from tpt ligand in the axial sites. the Zn-N distances and Zn-O distances are 2.061(18) \u00c5 and 2.027(2)-2.041(2) \u00c5, respectively, which are in the normal ranges of those observed in reported Zn(II) complexes. Two adjacent Zn2 atoms are bridged by four \u03bc2-\u03b71:\u03b71-carboxylate groups from four tda2- anions into a paddle wheel dimeric [Zn2(CO2)4] with C 4 symmetry, in which the Zn-Zn distance is 3.013 \u00c5. As shown in , the disordered tda2- anions are two linkers and use two carboxylate groups to bridge the Zn1 centers and the [Zn2(CO2)4] dimers. The tpt ligand is a three-way tube linker and adopts the \u03bc3-coordination mode to coordinate with two Zn1 centers and one [Zn2(CO2)4] dimers.
