The structural model having no counterions indicates that two-thirds of the tetrazole units of the ligands are protonated in order to maintain the electrostatic neutrality of the framework. Although protonation could not be observed in the difference Fourier map, it can be implied from elemental analysis and IR spectroscopy that protonation does occur. The bonding scheme as determined by the X-ray structure indicates that protonation occurs at N(2) atom. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the ligand resides in the HL -/L 2- deprotonation states. Similar deprotonation states have been formerly observed in two manganese MOFs incorporating ditopic tetrazolate-based ligands.

For all the NAEs, only surface adsorption is expected to occur due to the smaller pore apertures of the framework structure of 1'. A photoinduced electron transfer mechanism can be hypothesized for the highly selective sensing of NAEs by 1'. In spite of their extended network structures, MOFs often possess definite band gap energies due to the highly localized electronic structures (especially for MOFs with d10 metal ions). Usually, the lowest unoccupied MOs (LUMOs) of the electron-deficient NAEs reside between the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) of the luminescent MOFs. Efficient transfer of electrons can occur from the CB of 1' to the LUMO of NAEs, thus quenching the fluorescence intensity upon excitation. The HOMO and LUMO orbital energies (Table S4, Supporting Information) for the H2 L ligand and the selected analytes are depicted in . They were determined by the density functional theory (DFT) at B3LYP/6-31G* accuracy level using the Gaussian 09 package of programs. As shown in , the photoluminescence behavior of 1' is ligand-centered. The LUMO energy of the electron-rich H2 L ligand was calculated to be -1.8757 eV, which is higher than those of the tested NAEs (-2.2213 to -3.898 eV). These LUMO energy values suggest that the excited state electron transfer from 1' to the NAEs can take place effectively. The estimated LUMO energy values of the analytes increase in the order: TNP < TNT < DNB < 2,4-DNT < 2,6-DNT < DNP < NB < 4-NT < PNP. The ease of electron transfer to the electron-deficient analytes should follow the reverse trend. Thus, the lowest LUMO energy value of TNP is in good agreement with the maximum quenching observed for this analyte. However, the sequence of experimental quenching efficiencies (i.e., TNP > PNP > DNP > TNT > 4-NT > 2,4-DNT > 2,6-DNT > 1,3-DNB > NB) is not completely in agreement with the LUMO energies of other NAEs.

In the TG trace of 1', the one weight loss step below the decomposition temperature can be attributed to the removal of absorbed water molecules. The exposure of 1' to air after thermal activation presumably led to hydration of the compound.\n\nPhotoluminescence Properties\n\nMOFs based on d10 metal ions with \u03c0-conjugated aromatic ligands are well-known for their excellent luminescence behavior and thus considered as potential candidates for applications as sensors. Since 1' is constructed from d10 (Cd2+) metal ions and \u03c0-electron-rich conjugated organic ligand, it was hypothesized to be a potential fluorophore with tremendous photoluminescence (PL) properties. The solid-state fluorescence emission spectrum of the H2 L ligand () shows an emission maximum at 456 nm upon excitation at 344 nm, which can be assigned to the intraligand \u03c0-\u03c0* transition of the aromatic rings. On the other hand, 1' () displays an emission maximum at 470 nm in the solid state upon excitation at 356 nm. The similarity between the emission bands of H2 L ligand and 1' indicates that the photoluminescence behavior of 1' is mainly due to ligand-centered electronic excitation. However, a red shift (14 nm) of the emission band of the compound compared to the parent ligand is observed, which can be attributed to the perturbation caused by the complexation of the ligand with Cd2+ ions.
