These results were striking since it was previously reported that addition of cinchonine to the original ATF-1 synthesis (In(NO3)3, TDC, DMF) resulted in the formation of enantiomerically pure ATF-1. It is noteworthy that neither free cinchonine nor the protonated cinchonium salt are present in either ATF-1 or YCM-23. Despite the lack of presence in the final structure, we postulate that there is a distinct mechanistic difference between the neutral cinchonine as used in the ATF-1 synthesis and cationic cinchonium nitrate employed in the YCM-23 synthesis.
