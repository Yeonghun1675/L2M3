Notably, although the [A-\u03b1-GeW9O34]10- polyoxoanion was used as the starting material, the product contains the [B-\u03b1-GeW9O34]10- fragments, indicating that the isomerization of [A-\u03b1-GeW9O34]10- \u2192 [B-\u03b1-GeW9O34]10- must have taken place during the course of the reaction. Such isomerization phenomena have already been observed in previous studies. Actually, a series of parallel synthetic experiments have been conducted during the course of our exploration: (i) To further explore the effect of the organic ligands on the products, we replaced oxalic acid dehydrate with malonic acid/succinic acid/citric acid under the same conditions, but unfortunately no isostructural species but amorphous phases were obtained. It can be seen that the size and shape of organic ligands can influence the formation of the resulting products. (ii) We also attempted to investigate the effect of different TM ions on structural diversity by replacing the MnII ion by the FeII, CoII, NiII, CuII, ZnII, CrIII, or FeIII cations. However, after plenty of parallel experiments, we could not obtain the expected compounds but only amorphous precipitates or tetra-TM-substituted GTs, suggesting that the nature of TM ions played a key role in the construction of products. (iii) The reaction temperature should be in the range of 110-120 \u00b0C, when the reaction temperature is below 110 \u00b0C (80-110 \u00b0C); tetra-Mn-substituted GTs are easily obtained, while when the reaction temperature is above 120 \u00b0C (120-170 \u00b0C), only amorphous phases are obtained. (iv) When we introduced Na9[A-\u03b1-PW9O34]\u22c57H2O, Na10[A-\u03b1-SiW9O34]\u22c519H2O, or K12[\u03b1-H2P2W12O48]\u22c524H2O precursors to the {CeIV/MnII/ox2-} systems, no analogous was harvested but only several tetra-Mn-substituted POTs were isolated. (iv) Moreover, similar reactions with other 4f ions (LnIII = Eu, Sm, Tb, and Dy) were also performed, but unexpectedly, we could not obtain the expected isomorphic compounds but only amorphous precipitates, showing that the redox properties of CeIV might be crucial in the formation of 1. It is also noteworthy that there are two obvious color changes during the reaction. At the beginning of the reaction, the yellow aqueous solution immediately changed to brown when the mixed solution of Ce(NH4)2(NO3)6 and 1 M NaOH solution was added. However, the brown color changed back to yellow after heating at 120 \u00b0C for 3 days. It is presumed that the redox reactions between Mn2+ and Ce4+ ions at room temperature led to the formation of Mn3+ and Ce3+ ions, which exhibits the brown color. After sealed in a stainless steel reactor with a Teflon liner and heated at 120 \u00b0C for 3 days, the disproportionation reaction of the metastable Mn3+ ions occurred, which resulted in the transformation of Mn3+ into Mn2+; thus, the brown solution changed back to yellow. In the previous study, such transformations have been observed. The profound investigation on this reaction mechanism is in progress. The experimental PXRD pattern of 1 is in good agreement with the simulated PXRD pattern from the single-crystal X-ray diffraction, suggesting the good phase purity for 1 (Figure S1 of the ). The differences in intensity between them may be due to the variation in preferred orientation of the powder sample during collection of the experimental PXRD pattern.
