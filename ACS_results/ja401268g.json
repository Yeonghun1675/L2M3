Some imidazolates have zeolite topologies (the ZIFs); many of these particular compounds exhibit exceptional sorption behavior and thermal stabilities, finding potential application in key areas such as CO2 sequestration. Others are MOF analogues of glassy SiO2: the ability to switch between crystalline (porous) and amorphous (nonporous) forms makes these amorphous ZIFs interesting candidates for encapsulation of radioactive waste. Yet others, like Cd(im)2 itself, are analogues of dense SiO2 phases; this class is primarily of fundamental interest in developing a coherent understanding of the mechanical behavior of MOFs.

The second phase of reorganization (T > 475 K) is dominated by reduction of this second \u03c1 value toward \u221a2. The thermally activated increase in \u03c1 for the (001) system results in an NTE effect along b and PTE along a; the corresponding decrease for the (010) system results in PTE along c and a NTE contribution along a.
