Hirshfeld surface analysis was conducted for the study of intermolecular interactions and their relative contribution to the Hirshfeld surface area. The contributions of different intermolecular interactions to the Hirshfeld surface areas are illustrated as a histogram in Figure S2. It is noteworthy that, when the benzene core has been replaced with the naphthalene core, the contribution percentages of C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 and \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions increase while that of H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5H interactions decreases. As depicted in panels c and f of  and Figure S1, the L1 and L2 pillar ligands are arranged inside the honeycomb channel walls of TMU-6 and TMU-21, respectively. In these frameworks, the central benzene (for L1) and naphthalene (for L2) core of pillar ligands is mainly involved in pyC-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions as hydrogen acceptors with pyridinic hydrogen atoms on different pillar ligands. These intermolecular interactions strengthen the pore walls and therefore prevent channel collapse upon guest removal. Investigation of the intermolecular contacts and crystal packing of these two MOFs via Hirshfeld surface analysis also reveals that the contribution of C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 and \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions increases on going from TMU-6 to TMU-21 (Figure S2 and Table S1).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 13, "type": "text", "classification": ["property"], "content": "<p>Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicates that TMU-21 has\na thermal stability slightly better than that of TMU-6.

The resulting yellow crystalline solid was washed with ethanol (3 \u00d7 5 mL) and hexane (3 \u00d7 5 mL) and crystallized from a CH2Cl2/hexane mixture to give ligand L2: 76% yield; mp 242-245 \u00b0C; IR (KBr) 3034(w), 1627(s), 1594(s), 1553(s), 1500(w), 1406(s), 1319(w), 1225(s), 980(w), 704(s), 650(w) cm-1; MS m/z 336.3 (M+, base peak).\n\nSynthesis of [Zn(oba)(4-nbpy)0.5] n \u22c5(DMF)1.5 (TMU-21)\n\nFor this synthesis, 0.298 g of Zn(NO3)2\u22c56H2O (1 mmol), 0.181 g of synthesized 4-nbpy (0.5 mmol), and 0.258 g of H2oba (1 mmol) were first dissolved in 15 mL of N,N'-dimethylformamide (DMF). The mixture was then placed in a Teflon reactor and heated at 120 \u00b0C for 3 days. The mixture was then gradually cooled to room temperature over 48 h.
