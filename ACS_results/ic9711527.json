As temperature is lowered, the \u03c7m T value decreases gradually down to around 50 K and then abruptly down to 1.8 K to reach 0.32 cm3 K mol-1. In the case of the magnetic susceptibility \u03c7m, a sharp maximum at about 6 K is observed. Such a magnetic behavior is indicative of overall antiferromagnetic ordering between magnetic centers.
