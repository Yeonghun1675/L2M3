The reaction was conducted under visible-light irradiation using a 3 mmol % sample (per the CuIIN4 or NiIIN4 moiety) and 30% hydrogen peroxide as a catalyst and an oxidant, respectively (see the SI for details). It was observed that only 1-15% conversion of benzene was obtained by 1, 3, and CuI in the presence or absence of light (Table S3 and Figures S8 and S9).
