This fact can be explained in terms of the concentration quenching of the luminescence, which seems to be minor for the Tb-framework. The inorganic chains in 5 are separated by 9.1 and 9.4 \u00c5 through trans-dms conformers, whereas, in the structure of 4, such chains are separated by 5.9 \u00c5 along the b direction (via the gauche-dms ligands) and 9.5 \u00c5 along the c direction (via the trans-2,3-dms anions). In consequence, in 4 there are planes with higher concentrations of metallic centers that can favor luminescence quenching, whereas the wider spacing among chains in 5 prevents or minimizes the occurrence of this effect.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 73, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>Since the water molecules can quench the luminescence\nof the lanthanide\nions through a nonradiative mechanism involving the vibrational modes\nof the OH groups, the incidence of dehydration on the PL performance\nwas also investigated.
