This is not necessarily a given because a considerable number of silver(I) salts decompose under such conditions. To further probe the stability of these complexes, TGA of the compounds was performed. Compound 1 showed an immediate onset of mass loss corresponding to the loss of water, which continued to 75 \u00b0C. Losses of channel and coordinated water are merged into one continuous mass loss. The desolvated structure was then stable to 320 \u00b0C. For compound 2, because only coordinated water molecules are present, the onset of mass loss is a bit higher at 50 \u00b0C. All of the water molecules are lost by 125 \u00b0C, from which point no further changes are observed until decomposition at 325 \u00b0C.
