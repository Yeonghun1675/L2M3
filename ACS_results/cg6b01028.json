The dye adsorption performances of all the six complexes have been studied using cationic (crystal violet, CV) and anionic (methyl orange, MO) dyes. The aqueous dye (CV or MO) solutions are prepared with 10-5 molar concentrations and 25 mg of the CP (1-6) was immersed in the solution. These solutions are monitored by UV-vis spectrometry at different time intervals (). With CV solution, the UV spectra suggest that the concentration of CV decreases with time for all the complexes. This indicates that all complexes have an ability to adsorb the cationic dye CV. However, the complexes 3 and 4 given their bigger cavities have shown greater ability to adsorb CV. In other wards, they have shown to adsorb more amount of dye at faster rate when compared to the other complexes. In the first 30 min, the complexes 3 and 4 adsorb 57 and 40% of the dye, respectively. While the complexes 1, 2, 5, and 6 were found to adsorb only about ~25% in the same 30 min. The adsorption 88 and 71% of the CV was observed for complexes 3 and 4, respectively, in 10 h.
