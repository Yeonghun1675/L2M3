Assignments of the aromatic signals are based on the observation of a substantial decrease in the 8 ppm resonance (about 80%) upon activation. In the 13C{1H} CPMAS spectrum of the activated sample, where almost all trapped organics were removed (), the overlapped signals in the chemical shifts range of 132-138 ppm are assigned to the aromatic carbons and the resonances at 171 and 172 ppm to the carboxylate groups of framework trimesate btc. Interestingly, the carboxylates signals appeared in a relative proportion of 2:1, respectively. This corresponds to an average btc around a 2 or m symmetry axis, leading to a 2:1 ratio for every carbon of the btc.
