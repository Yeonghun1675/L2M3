See text for the description of how the structure of water-treated sample has been inferred.  \n\nThe lack of permanent long-term porosity in NU-505-Zn prompted us to consider it as a candidate for the transmetalation of the Zn(II) nodes with Ni(II), specifically to test the notion that the exchange could render the material persistently porous, as well as water-tolerant. Exposing NU-505-Zn to a concentrated NiCl2\u22c56H2O solution in DMSO (4 mol equiv, with respect to Zn in the MOF) at 100 \u00b0C for 2 days led to a stark color change from light yellow to green and replacement of 94% of the Zn(II) ions with Ni(II), as indicated by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy performed on digested MOF crystals demonstrated that the TBAPy:dabco ratio in the transmetalated daughter material remained unchanged, with respect to the Zn(II) parent (i.e., no dabco leaching had occurred during the metal exchange process ()).

The structure was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies (Scheme b). Geometrical analysis using Platon software confirmed the highly porous nature of the as-synthesized material (61% of the unit cell volume); however, attempts to desolvate the framework using commonly applied procedures (vacuum and thermal treatment) were unsuccessful. Therefore, we resorted to supercritical CO2 drying. With this method, NU-505-Zn exhibited high initial porosity, as evidenced by a pore volume of 0.63 cm3/g and a BET area of 1600 m2/g. Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations of N2 sorption performed for this MOF resulted in a predicted pore volume of 1.02 cm3/g and a predicted BET area of 2660 m2/g. The fact that the experimental values are smaller indicates that complete activation was not achieved. Furthermore, we discovered that the evacuated MOF did not display persistent porosity. When N2 isotherms were collected 24 and 48 h after activation, the BET  area decreased to 1370 m2/g and then 1280 m2/g, implying gradual structural collapse; after a week, almost all N2 porosity was lost (see the ).\n\nNU-505-Ni was activated via supercritical CO2 drying and exhibits a pore volume of 0.83 cm3/g and a BET area of 2110 m2/g, thus approaching the values predicted by GCMC simulations (Figure ). In contrast to NU-505-Zn, consecutive N2 sorption measurements performed on NU-505-Ni up to 6 days after solvent evacuation revealed no change in the surface area (). The material's surface area was unchanged, even after heating at 100 \u00b0C for 18 h, indicating a marked increase in the stability of the MOF realized by transmetalation to Ni(II). The combination of the robust Ni(II) centers with the basic dabco linkers (the pK a of the monoprotonated conjugate-acid of dabco is 10.16) has markedly enhanced the stability of the structure.\n\nSupercritical CO2 drying was performed and a N2 adsorption isotherm was collected on this material to obtain a pore volume of 0.74 cm3/g and a BET area of 1630 m2/g (Figure ). When a nitrogen isotherm was collected on the same sample 1 week after activation (), the porosity was found to be unchanged. We additionally analyzed the various isotherms to obtain estimates of pore-size distributions (see the  for plots). Untreated NU-505-Ni yielded a single pore of effective diameter of 10 \u00c5, while the version that was water-treated, supercritically dried, and then heated at 100 \u00b0C showed, in addition to the 10 \u00c5 pores, a set of pores of effective diameter of 15 \u00c5, consistent with the alternating and periodic absence of dabco pillars.\n\nBased on the lower overall stability of NU-505-Zn compared to the Ni(II) analogue, we expected its ability to withstand exposure to liquid water to be limited. To test our hypothesis, we subjected NU-505-Zn to the same water treatment process as the Ni(II)-based material. As was the case with the Ni(II) analogue, the 1H NMR spectrum of the water-treated Zn(II)-based material showed a decrease of the TBAPy:dabco ratio to 1:0.6. However, the PXRD pattern did not show an additional low-angle peak and, instead, remained largely unchanged, barring the presence of low-intensity shoulders around the main peaks at 2\u03b8 = 5.56\u00b0 and 2\u03b8 = 7.90\u00b0 (Figure ). Furthermore, there was a marked decrease in the BET area of the material (1150 m2/g, compared to 1600 m2/g attainable for the pristine NU-505-Zn), suggesting a loss of structural integrity. Again, as in the case with the pristine NU-505-Zn, the porosity of the water-treated MOF material was observed to be nonpersistent, with 20% of porosity lost within 48 h of activation ().\n\nWe next examined whether the displacement of dabco pillars by water could be reversed.

The low-angle 2\u03b8 = 4.08\u00b0 peak in the PXRD pattern disappeared and overall the pattern appeared identical to that of pristine NU-505-Ni MOF (Figure ). The pore volume and the BET area of the supercritically dried material increased to 0.816 cm3/g and 1910 m2/g, respectively, thereby approaching the values obtained for the parent (Figure ).
