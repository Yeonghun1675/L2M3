Because the framework of 1 is negatively charged and would have an electrostatic interaction with positively charged organic dye MB molecules, it thus significantly enhances MB adsorption. Compared with another cationic dye molecules (RhB), it is hard to diffuse the pores of the adsorbent due to its large size, which decreases the uptake capacity. Taking the interpenetration structural feature into consideration, the 3-fold interpenetrated frameworks reduce its porosity and prevent large molecules from entering the pores; thus, electrostatic interactions play a prominent role in dye adsorption.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "Anionic Cd(II)-organic framework", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "{[(CH3)2NH2]2[Cd(H2BIPA-TC)2]\u22c55(DMF)}"}, "topology": [{"value": "dia", "condition": "3-fold interpenetrated 3D network"}], "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "140", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "stable", "condition": ""}, {"value": "140 to 311", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "removal of five free DMF guest molecules", "condition": "weight loss of 21.5%"}, {"value": "355", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "collapse of the whole framework", "condition": "loss of organic species"}, {"value": "721", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "flat line", "condition": "less thermal stability after loss of DMF guest molecules"}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "4.44", "unit": "cm3/g", "temperature": "77K", "pressure": "P/P 0 = 1.0", "condition": "Micromeritics 3Flex analyzer"}, {"adsorbate": "Methylene Blue (MB)", "adsorbed amount": "149", "unit": "mg/g", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": "electrostatic interaction in aqueous solution"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["topology", "decomposition_temperature", "gas_adsorption"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['topology', 'decomposition_temperature', 'gas_adsorption']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"Anionic Cd(II)-organic framework\",\n            \"symbol\": \"1\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"{[(CH3)2NH2]2[Cd(H2BIPA-TC)2]\u22c55(DMF)}\"\n        },\n        \"topology\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"dia\",\n                \"condition\": \"3-fold interpenetrated 3D network\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"decomposition temperature\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"140\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"stable\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"140 to 311\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"removal of five free DMF guest molecules\",\n                \"condition\": \"weight loss of 21.5%\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"355\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"collapse of the whole framework\",\n                \"condition\": \"loss of organic species\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"721\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"flat line\",\n                \"condition\": \"less thermal stability after loss of DMF guest molecules\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"N2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"4.44\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3/g\",\n                \"temperature\": \"77K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"P/P 0 = 1.0\",\n                \"condition\": \"Micromeritics 3Flex analyzer\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"Methylene Blue (MB)\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"149\",\n                \"unit\": \"mg/g\",\n                \"temperature\": \"\",\n                \"pressure\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"electrostatic interaction in aqueous solution\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 6, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Perspective\nview of 3D structure in <bold>1</bold>; (b) simplified\nsingle <bold>dia</bold> 3D topological network in <bold>1</bold>.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cg-2018-008956_0001.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  (a) Perspective view of 3D structure in 1; (b) simplified single dia 3D topological network in 1.
