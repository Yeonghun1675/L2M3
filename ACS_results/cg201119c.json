At the same time, this compound also underwent about 3% trans-cis isomerization. The formation of the rctt-isomer as the sole isomer from crisscross aligned pairs is the result of pedal-like motion of monomeric units with respect to each other (see the ). A thorough perusal of the crystal structure reveals that one side of the C\ue5fbC-CO2H unit in each independent [Ag(4-PA)2]+ is disordered with two different orientations by 62:38. In both [Ag(4-PA)2]+ cations in the asymmetric unit, the disorder fragment is paired with the undisordered 4-PA. If we consider only the major component, it is crisscrossed by 62%, and for the minor component, 38% has parallel orientation. Therefore, a pedal-like motion of the crisscrossed 4-PA can account for the formation of the rctt-isomer as the only isomer from the pairs aligned in crisscross fashion (Figure b) during photodimerization.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 16, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<title>Crystal Structure and Photoreactivity of Coordination Polymer [Ag(3-PA)]\u00b71.5H<sub>2</sub>O (<bold>4</bold>)</title><p>Single crystal X-ray diffraction study revealed that all the donor sites in <bold>4</bold> are coordinated to Ag(I).
