While the tris-substituted 1,2-HOPO ligand, with an overall 3\u2212 charge, binds weakly to Scn, the tris-substituted CAM ligand has an overall 1\u2212 charge and is bound much more tightly. Thus, it appears that the cation\u2212\u03c0 interaction of the 2,3-catecholamide is more important to binding than the Coulombic attraction between the anionic substrate and the cationic calyx.
