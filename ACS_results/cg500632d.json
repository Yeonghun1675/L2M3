Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded in the 2\u03b8 range 5-50\u00b0 using Cu K\u03b1 radiation (Philips X'pert). The observed PXRD patterns were new, and the patterns were entirely consistent with the simulated XRD patterns generated based on the structure determined using the single-crystal X-ray studies for compounds [Cu6(Hmna)6], 1 and 3 (, Figure S1). The IR spectrum was recorded on a KBr pellet (PerkinElmer, SPECTRUM 1000) (, Figure S2). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Metler-Toledo) was carried out in nitrogen atmosphere (flow rate = 20 mL/min) in the temperature range 30-800 \u00b0C (heating rate = 5 \u00b0C/min) (, Figure S3). UV-Vis spectra were recorded at room temperature using a PerkinElmer Lambda 35 spectrophotometer. Room temperature solid state photoluminescence studies were carried out using a PerkinElmer LS 55 luminescence spectrophotometer. Magnetic studies were carried out in the temperature range of 2-300 K using a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design, USA). Proton conductivity measurements were carried out on the powdered sample for the compound 1 and 3 by impedance spectroscopy (Alpha, Novocontrol) in the frequency range 1-106 Hz (signal amplitude: 0.12 V). The sample pellets were sandwiched between two stainless steel electrodes and were exposed to a relative humidity of 98% for 24 h before performing the studies. No noticeable changes were observed in the PXRD pattern of the samples (1 and 3) after being exposed to a relative humidity of 98% (, Figure S4). Infrared (IR) spectroscopic studies have been carried out in the mid-IR region (4000 to 400 cm-1) on (PerkinElmer, SPECTRUM 1000). The IR spectra of the compounds 1 and 3 exhibited a broad band in the region of 2900-3500 cm-1, due to the presence of large water molecules (~3300-3500 cm-1) and aromatic C-H stretching (2900-3100 cm-1) (, Figure S2). For both the compound C-C skeletal stretching appeared at ~1560 cm-1. In compound 1, singly coordinated -COO- appeared at ~1580 cm-1. In compound 3, the stretching frequency for uncoordinated -COOH, singly coordinated -COO-, and doubly coordinated -COO- group appeared at ~1740 cm-1, ~1580 cm-1, and ~1540 cm-1, respectively.

In addition, we have also been successful in isolating the molecular [Cu6(Hmna)6] cluster unit as well. The use of stepwise crystallization has not been explored much in the field of coordination polymers, and the present compounds add to the growing number of compounds prepared employing such methods. The formation of metal cluster units acting as a metalloligand has been described earlier. Recently Zaworotko and co-workers have employed a sequential crystal engineering approach utilizing a number of metal clusters of different geometries as a metalloligand. The octahedral hexameric silver metal centers of the type described here have also been employed in the formation of new frameworks. It appears that the use of 2-mercapto nicotinic acid (Hmna) results in the assembly of structures involving a second metal. The molecular [Cu6(mna)6]6- cluster has six carboxylate units that are available for binding with the secondary metal ions. In the present study, we find that all the six carboxylate units are utilized in bonding with Mn2+ ions\ue5f8six in 1 and eight in 2. The use of [Ag6(Hmna)2(mna)4]4- clusters on the other hand leads to the binding with Mn2+ ions through only four carboxylate units, similar binding with secondary metal ions involving four carboxylates have been observed before though the binding modes were different (, Table S5). The present study suggests that the [Cu6(mna)6]6- cluster could be a better metalloligand compared to [Ag6(mna)6]6- as the former binds with a larger number of Mn centers. It is likely that the near van der Waals Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu distances observed in the Cu6 clusters could make the cuprophilic (Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu) interactions stronger compared to the argentophilic (Ag\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Ag) interactions in the Ag6 cluster. This in turn could be helpful for the six peripheral carboxylates to participate in binding with the secondary metal ions in 1 and 2. It may be noted that when the Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu distances are shorter, more Mn2+ ions bind with the carboxylates as observed in compound 2. This observation suggests that the short metal-metal distances within the hexameric clusters could have a distinct role toward the reactivity of the metalloligand.

The low energy emission band exhibits a small blue shift in compound 1 (640 nm) compared to [Cu6(Hmna)6] cluster (665 nm). It is likely that the incorporation of Mn2+ ions modifies the LMCT and the cluster centered emission. The luminescence performance of the partially dehydrated 1 (red colored) is striking as the low energy emission band intensity is significantly quenched (Figure ). This could be due to the possible changes in the Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu distances of the Cu6 core during the dehydration along with the possible geometry changes around the Mn2+ ions. It has been suggested earlier that the Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu interactions could be a crucial parameter in determining the luminescence behavior of compounds containing Cu1 clusters.
