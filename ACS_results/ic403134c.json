An important aspect of the mechanism proposed for the rearrangement is that the carboxylate anion is not required ever to part company with the three lithium cations with which it is initially associated. In the particular case of the demethanolation of Li(inic)\u22c50.5MeOH, it is proposed that the 8484-to-6666 rearrangement is preceded by the pivoting of inic- units whose N centers had been initially hydrogen-bonded to coordinated methanol; in the proposed mechanism for this entire demethanolation/rearrangement process every inic- anion remains associated with the same three Li+ cations throughout. Although the amounts of N2, H2, CH4, and CO2 sorbed by microporous solvent-free Li(inic) are not among the highest, the gas sorption results clearly indicate that simple salts of lightweight lithium together with appropriately chosen anions are able to provide microporous materials capable of reversibly sorbing considerable quantities of gases. The isonicotinate anion was chosen for the initial exploratory work described here, merely because it is one of the simplest monoanions imaginable that possesses an element of rigidity and that offers the possibility of associating with cations at both ends so as to generate channels. Many potentially fruitful variants on the isonicotinate building block that may afford microporous solids with bigger internal surface areas are readily envisaged. The prospect is therefore raised of a new class of essentially ionic but nevertheless microporous materials based on lightweight lithium (and elements nearby in the periodic table) possessing the sort of \"plasticity\" considered above, that arises from the nondirectional character of ionic interactions.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 63, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>\n<sup>\u00a7</sup> ANSTO,\nNew Illawara Road, Lucas Heights, NSW 2234, Australia.</p><p>Single-crystal data in CIF\nformat.
