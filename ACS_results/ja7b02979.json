Furthermore, because the azobenzene pendants are localized on the window frames (Figure S8), the diffusion event through the window might be more influenced by the isomer ratio of the azobenzene pendants. Hence, for the kinetic analysis of the adsorption profiles in a,b, we used the following double-exponential equation featuring w k d and p k d as variables, which are supposed to be the diffusion rate constants of gaseous molecules through the triangular windows and within the polyhedral pores, respectively:        M   t   /   M   e   =   A   1    [ 1 - exp  ( -     k   d       w   t )  ]  +   A   2    [ 1 - exp  ( -     k   d       p   t )  ]     1 where M  t  and M e represent the amounts of gas molecules adsorbed at time t, and equilibrium, respectively; whereas A 1 and A 2 denote relative contributions of the triangular window and polyhedral pores to the overall diffusion process, with A 1 + A 2 = 1. As summarized in Tables S2-S5, fitting each kinetic profile using forgoing equation gave a sequence of values for two diffusion rate constants w k d and p k d (Figure S17). As expected, irrespective of the cis-isomer content of AzoMOF, the w k d values for both CO2 (c,e) and Ar (d,f) are much smaller than the corresponding p k d values in the whole range of P/P 0. Of particular interest, the w k d values for CO2 in AzoMOF15% (blue) are 1 order of magnitude smaller than those in AzoMOF1% (black) (c). In sharp contrast, the p k d values for CO2 in AzoMOF15% (blue) and AzoMOF1% (black) are almost identical to one another (e). Namely, the cis-isomer content in AzoMOF influences mostly on the diffusion event through the triangular window. Meanwhile, as shown in d,f, such a site-specific effect of the azobenzene isomer content on the diffusion process (black and blue) was not observed for Ar possibly due to the lack of permanent dipole and quadrupole moment. A lower polarizability of Ar than CO2 might also be partly responsible for this tendency. Together with the facts that the kinetic diameters of CO2 and Ar are substantially identical to one another and that the azobenzene pendants are localized on the window frames (Figure S8), the marked difference in the w k d values for CO2 between AzoMOF1% and AzoMOF15% (w k d in AzoMOF1% \u226b w k d in AzoMOF15%) suggests that CO2 dominantly receives a polar effect, rather than a steric effect, from the azobenzene pendants when it diffuses through the triangular windows in AzoMOF. Consistent with this observation, the isosteric heat of the adsorption of CO2 in AzoMOF15% was estimated as 38 kJ mol-1 at zero coverage, which is larger than that in AzoMOF1% (29 kJ mol-1) (Figure S18), indicating a higher affinity of CO2 toward AzoMOF15% than AzoMOF1%.
