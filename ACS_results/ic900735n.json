The electron-density contour maps for the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of <bold>I</bold> and <bold>II</bold> are shown in Figure . In both structures, the lowest unoccupied orbitals (i.e., the bottom of the conduction band) were mainly formed by the Re 5d and O 2p orbitals (more minimally), as seen in the PDOS in Figure  and in the local orbital pictures in Figure . The highest occupied orbitals (i.e., the top of the valence band) consist of only the Cu 3d and N 2p orbitals in both <bold>I</bold> and <bold>II</bold>. The O 2p orbitals were not found to contribute to the valence band of either structures owing to the ionic Cu\u2212O interactions in <bold>I</bold> (at &gt;2.8 \u00c5) and to the lack of any close Cu\u2212O distances in <bold>II</bold>. Therefore, the optical excitation from the valence to the conduction band in both structures can be viewed as mainly a metal-to-metal charge transfer between Cu<sup>+</sup> (3d<sup>10</sup>) and Re<sup>7+</sup> (5d<sup>0</sup>), with moderate contributions from the ligand-based orbitals in each case. Considering only the stongly interacting bpy ligands, as the amount of bpy increases from <bold>I</bold> to <bold>II</bold> the Cu coordination environment changes from a linear {CuN<sub>2</sub>} to a tetrahedral {CuN<sub>4</sub>} coordination geometry, respectively. As a result, the Cu d-orbitals in <bold>I</bold> are split into two sets, with d<sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">z</italic>\n<sup>2</sup>\n</sub> at the highest energies. In contrast, the d-orbital splitting in <bold>II</bold> is separated (ideally) into two sets, the t<sub>2</sub> (d<sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">xy</italic>\n</sub>, d<sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">yz</italic>\n</sub>, d<sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">xz</italic>\n</sub>) and e (d<sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">x</italic>\n<sup>2</sup>\u2212<italic toggle=\"yes\">y</italic>\n<sup>2</sup>\n</sub>, d<sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">z</italic>\n<sup>2</sup>\n</sub>), with the former at the higher energies. Therefore the highest occupied crystal orbitals of <bold>I</bold> consist of mostly Cu d<sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">z</italic>\n<sup>2</sup>\n</sub> and N 2p orbitals, while the highest occupied crystal orbitals in <bold>II</bold> are primarily composed of the d<sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">xy</italic>\n</sub>/d<sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">xz</italic>\n</sub>/d<sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">yz</italic>\n</sub> set and the N 2p orbitals. Thus, the greater Cu-ligand orbital interactions of <bold>II</bold> result in its higher-energy crystal orbitals within the valence band and also in its greater band broadening compared to <bold>I</bold>.

Shown in Figure  is the calculated electronic Densities-Of-States (DOS) for I and II, and which is overlaid with the partial DOS contribution from each constituent atom type. The electron-density contour maps for the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of I and II are shown in Figure . In both structures, the lowest unoccupied orbitals (i.e., the bottom of the conduction band) were mainly formed by the Re 5d and O 2p orbitals (more minimally), as seen in the PDOS in Figure  and in the local orbital pictures in Figure . The highest occupied orbitals (i.e., the top of the valence band) consist of only the Cu 3d and N 2p orbitals in both I and II. The O 2p orbitals were not found to contribute to the valence band of either structures owing to the ionic Cu-O interactions in I (at >2.8 \u00c5) and to the lack of any close Cu-O distances in II. Therefore, the optical excitation from the valence to the conduction band in both structures can be viewed as mainly a metal-to-metal charge transfer between Cu+ (3d10) and Re7+ (5d0), with moderate contributions from the ligand-based orbitals in each case. Considering only the stongly interacting bpy ligands, as the amount of bpy increases from I to II the Cu coordination environment changes from a linear {CuN2} to a tetrahedral {CuN4} coordination geometry, respectively. As a result, the Cu d-orbitals in I are split into two sets, with d z 2  at the highest energies. In contrast, the d-orbital splitting in II is separated (ideally) into two sets, the t2 (d xy , d yz , d xz ) and e (d x 2-y 2 , d z 2 ), with the former at the higher energies. Therefore the highest occupied crystal orbitals of I consist of mostly Cu d z 2  and N 2p orbitals, while the highest occupied crystal orbitals in II are primarily composed of the d xy /d xz /d yz  set and the N 2p orbitals. Thus, the greater Cu-ligand orbital interactions of II result in its higher-energy crystal orbitals within the valence band and also in its greater band broadening compared to I. In II, the contribution of the bpy ligands (i.e., N 2p orbitals) to the valence band is therefore larger. The result of having two additional ligands is that the valence band, composed mainly of the Cu 3d orbitals, is pushed to higher energies in II, as shown in Figure . Therefore, the band gap of II has been decreased as a result of the additional bpy ligands.
