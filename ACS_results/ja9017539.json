The linear increase of M(H) above 2 kOe, however, can result only from the progressive closure of a spin fan in a noncollinear spin structure. The possibility of a paramagnetic contribution from a small impurity phase can be excluded readily because the slope of this linear increase is temperature independent and its value would correspond to a susceptibility of 0.05 emu\u22c5mol-1, which is unrealistic for Pauli paramagnetism.

Why would the global spin of the cluster behave as XY out of Ising like Co<sup>2+</sup> ions?

In addition, the noncollinear spin structure of the cluster implies that there is no orientation of the net moment for which all spins can lie simultaneously along their easy axis. Consequently, even if Co<sup>2+</sup> ions are Ising like the uniaxial anisotropy of the net moment is reduced with respect to that of four collinear spins. It is also possible, yet not frequently encountered, that Co<sup>2+</sup> ions are XY like, depending on the distortion of their coordination octahedron.

In addition, the existence of a BKT transition in the ac plane of 1 provides a straightforward explanation for the persistence of fluctuations even below the transition. Indeed below the transition, a BKT system remains critical down to T = 0\ue5f8there is no strict long-range order\ue5f8and the average magnetization is 0 in the absence of magnetic field and of residual anisotropy in the XY plane. There is an apparent inconsistency, however, between the value of T BKT (28.5 K) and the critical temperature indicated by the maximum of \u03c7'ac (~32.5 K). There are no theoretical studies of the ac susceptibility in BKT systems, but it is known that the specific heat peaks at a temperature that is 10-15% higher than T BKT contrary to the cases of order-disorder transitions.

In the paper, unless otherwise specified, all magnetic data refer to the asymmetric unit cell, i.e., half a cluster or a Co(1)-Co(2) pair. At room temperature, the \u03c7T product (4.4 cm3mol-1K) is lower than the value usually observed for Co2+ ions (2.5-3 cm3 mol-1 K per ion), which indicates a lower strength for the spin-orbit coupling. The observed value, however, is still larger than the spin only value of 1.9 cm3 mol-1 K.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "200-440", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "weight loss", "condition": "in oxygen atmosphere (flow rate = 20 mL/min)"}], "magnetic susceptibility": [{"value": "4.4", "unit": "cm3mol-1K", "temperature": "room temperature", "condition": "in an applied field of 50 Oe"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["decomposition_temperature", "magnetic_susceptibility"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['decomposition_temperature', 'magnetic_susceptibility']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n  {\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"name\": \"\",\n      \"symbol\": \"\",\n      \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"decomposition temperature\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"200-440\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"weight loss\",\n        \"condition\": \"in oxygen atmosphere (flow rate = 20 mL/min)\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"magnetic susceptibility\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"4.4\",\n        \"unit\": \"cm3mol-1K\",\n        \"temperature\": \"room temperature\",\n        \"condition\": \"in an applied field of 50 Oe\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 13, "type": "table", "classification": ["Crystal"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Crystal Data and Structure Refinement Parameters for (Co<sub>2</sub>(\u03bc<sub>3</sub>\u2212OH)(\u03bc<sub>2</sub>\u2212H<sub>2</sub>O)(pyrazine)(OBA)(OBAH)), <bold>I</bold>\n<xref rid=\"tbl1-fn1\"></xref>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table>\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"2\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead valign=\"middle\">\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">structure parameter</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<bold>I</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row valign=\"top\">\n<oasis:entry>empirical formula</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>C<sub>32</sub>H<sub>24</sub>Co<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row valign=\"top\">\n<oasis:entry>formula weight</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>745.866</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row valign=\"top\">\n<oasis:entry>crystal system</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>monoclinic</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row valign=\"top\">\n<oasis:entry>space group</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>2<sub>1</sub>/<italic toggle=\"yes\">c</italic> (no. 14)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row valign=\"top\">\n<oasis:entry>a (\u00c5)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>11.173(3)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row valign=\"top\">\n<oasis:entry>b (\u00c5)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>30.326(7)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row valign=\"top\">\n<oasis:entry>c (\u00c5)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>9.645(2)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row valign=\"top\">\n<oasis:entry>\u03b1 (deg)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>90.0</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row valign=\"top\">\n<oasis:entry>\u03b2 (deg)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>103.493(4)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row valign=\"top\">\n<oasis:entry>\u03b3 (deg)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>90.0</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row valign=\"top\">\n<oasis:entry>Volume (\u00c5<sup>3</sup>)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>3178.0(13)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row valign=\"top\">\n<oasis:entry>Z</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>4</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row valign=\"top\">\n<oasis:entry>T (K)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>293(2)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row valign=\"top\">\n<oasis:entry>\u03c1<sub>calc</sub> (g cm<sup>\u22123</sup>)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.559</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row valign=\"top\">\n<oasis:entry>\u03bc (mm<sup>\u22121</sup>)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.111</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row valign=\"top\">\n<oasis:entry>\u03b8 range (deg)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.99 to 28.03</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row valign=\"top\">\n<oasis:entry>\u03bb (Mo K\u03b1) (\u00c5)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.71073</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row valign=\"top\">\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">R</italic> indices (I &gt;
