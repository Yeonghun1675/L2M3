The reaction mixture was refluxed under Dean-Stark conditions for 12 h. CDCl3 (2 mL) was added to the reaction mixture and the resulting suspension was centrifuged for 1H NMR study. The quantitative analysis of the products was determined by 1H NMR.

Both MeOH and CHCl3 sorption studies of CuL-Br reveal gradual uptake with increasing pressure and final uptakes of 92 and 76 mL g-1 without saturation, corresponding to 2.7 and 2.2 molecules of MeOH and CHCl3 per copper, respectively. The amount of CHCl3 is consistent with the single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (two CHCl3 molecules per copper). The desorption curves do not trace the adsorption branches and form hysteresis loops. In contrast, the MeOH profile of CuL-PF  6  displays prominent stepwise adsorption and repeated hysteresis. It reveals a gradual uptake at the low P/P 0 region and a steep uptake as the pressure increases to 0.20 P/P 0. The isotherm reaches saturation at 111 mL g-1, corresponding to 3.6 molecules of MeOH per copper and 15.9 wt % uptake by the framework. The sudden adsorption jump of CuL-PF  6  in the isotherm may originate from the breathing effect of the framework with bigger PF6 - anions, disclosing anion-responsive dynamic behavior upon removal and readsorption of guests. Similar sorption properties have also been revealed by the CO2 profiles of CuL-Br and CuL-PF  6  at 195 K. The CO2 isotherms of CuL-Br reveal a gradual uptake (final uptake 47 mL g-1) without apparent hysteresis, while those of CuL-PF  6  show stepwise sorption (final uptake >103 mL g-1) with large hysteresis. In addition, both the MOFs favor CO2 over Ar in porous adsorption. The reasons may be that CO2 with a quadrupole moment of -1.4 \u00d7 10-39 C m2 interacts with the framework more effectively. Thus, the present MOFs have flexible porous behavior at low pressure, and the guest uptake is triggered by synergistic interactions of guest molecules and counteranions (PF6 -).
