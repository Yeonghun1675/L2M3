The ESR data of the polycrystalline and methanol solution of 16e cluster [Nb6Cl12(CN)6]4- also exhibit the same signal that may be attributed to the large temperature-independent paramagnetism of the cluster. Magnetic susceptibility (\u03c7 M) data for 1 were measured from 300 to 1.8 K at an applied field of 2 T (Figure ). At 300 K, \u03bceff = 4.92 \u03bcB indicates the presence of high-spin Mn(III) (4.89 \u03bcB for S = 2). As the system is cooled, \u03bceff smoothly increases from 300 to 50 K and then abruptly increases to reach a maximum 5.43 \u03bcB at 3.5 K. Below 3.5 K, \u03bceff sharply decreases to reach 4.98 \u03bcB at 1.8 K, most likely due to zero-field splitting (ZFS) of anisotropic high-spin Mn3+ ions. The \u03c7 M -1 versus T plot follows the Curie-Weiss law with the Weiss constant \u03b8 = 1.16 K. The positive \u03b8 value and increase of \u03bceff over the entire temperature range indicates ferromagnetic coupling. In variable-field measurements, the magnetization sharply increases to ~2.33 N \u03b2 mol-1 at fields weaker than 2 T, then gradually increases to 3.33 N \u03b2 mol-1 at 7 T, not reaching the saturation state of g\u03a3s = 4N \u03b2 mol-1, which may be because a larger magnetic field is required to reach saturation owing to the ZFS of high-spin Mn(III).
