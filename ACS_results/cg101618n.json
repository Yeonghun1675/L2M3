In depth analysis of complex 2 shows 1D tube-like channel with approximate dimensions of 7.5 \u00d7 4.5 \u00c52. By taking Co1 ions as two alternating but parallel backbones along the b-axis, 1D tube-like channel can be viewed as 2,4'-bpdc wrapped around Co1 ions in a double-stranded left-handed helix( Figure S6). Through coordinated hinge of two double-strands double helical chainssharing the cobalt sites (Co1 and Co2), the adjacent helical channels are interconnected to each other to allow the left-handed chirality to transfer uniformly along the bc plane, leading to the formation of an interesting homochiral 2D sheet shown in Figure , in which all the helical channels are left-handed chirality. The homochirality transfer within the homochiral 2D sheet has also been found in other coordination polymers. The chiral sheets are further linked by weak hydrogen bonding O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O/C(O)-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 to generate a 3D monochiral coordination framework containing 1D double-stranded left-handed helical tube-like channels().", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 14, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig3\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>2D monochiral MOF containing 1D left-handed helical nanochannels in <bold>2</bold>.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr5\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"cg-2010-01618n_0008.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 3  2D monochiral MOF containing 1D left-handed helical nanochannels in 2.

The thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) ( Figure S13) and X-ray powder diffraction experiments ( Figure S14) revealed that the coordinated water molecule in 1-3 may be removed at temperature range from 180 to 250 \u00b0C and remain the integrity of the whole framework structure with the solvent accessible volume of 2.8% for 1, 8.3% for 2 and 4.7% for 3. To further support the nonporous nature of these materials, N2 adsorption/desorption experiments were conducted at 77K, which shows ( Figure S15)the surface area of <100 m2/g.
