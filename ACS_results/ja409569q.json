If we sequentially increase the size of the amine templates, the hypothetical sheet aggregate would have to slip and further increase the inter-layer spacing to accommodate bigger guests. However, such an imaginary bilayer structure is thermodynamically unfavorable because of the increased inter-layer distance and the increased surface tension for the individual layers. As the result, the third CH2 group added onto the template becomes the last straw that breaks the bilayer-stacking aggregates, and the honeycomb sheets are forced to roll up into tubes to enhance the surface areas and optimize host-guest interactions. The H-bonding strength between the amine cation and the sulfamide confirms this tendency, with the N-O distances 2.84, 2.84, 3.15, and 2.79 \u00c5 for 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Theoretical calculations reveal the tendency toward increased surface areas from 1 to 4, with the calculated values 190.6, 221.5, 261.5, and 373.2 \u00c52 per unit cell for 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively (see ). It should be noted that there are multiple inter-tube supramolecular interactions in 4, involving CH-O hydrogen-bonds and CH-\u03c0 interactions (). The cooperation of these weak interactions can then stabilize the \"nanotube\" structure, in preference to the less-puckered 2D structure found in 1-3.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 12, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>In conclusion, three 2D lamellar compounds\nand one (4,0) zigzag\nMONT from [Mn<sup>II</sup>\n<sub>2</sub>Mn<sup>III</sup>] building blocks\nand dca linkers are successfully prepared.
