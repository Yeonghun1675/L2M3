Co-SIM additionally has increased absorption at 730 nm, possibly indicating presence of octahedral Co2+ that may arise due to coordination of atmospheric water to the metal ion. No leaching of NDC linkers was observed after metalation, encouraging us to use differential envelope density (DED) analyses to locate the newly anchored Co-oxo species. A DED analysis relies on the electron envelopes generated from high intensity, low-angle diffraction peaks using synchrotron X-ray sources. By subtracting the electron envelope generated from the parent material as the background, the additional electron density map corresponding to the newly anchored species can be obtained, affording a reliable technique to obtain their location information. DEDs of NDC-SALI-HCl and Co-SIM-NDC-SALI were analyzed to locate the NDC ligands and Co ions, respectively (). Electron density from the NDC ligands in NDC-SALI-HCl is observed exclusively between the nodes along the c-axis, aligning well with the single crystal X-ray diffraction structure. In Co-SIM-NDC-SALI, electron density attributed to the cobalt is observed pointing toward the mesopores on the Zr6 nodes, in striking contrast to Co-SIM where the Co is predominantly located in the space now occupied by NDC linker.
