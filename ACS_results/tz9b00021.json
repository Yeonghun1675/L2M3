Furthermore, the N2 adsorption isotherms of the treated samples were found to be almost the same as those of pristine ones as well, further confirming the robustness of these MOFs (Figure S8). It should be pointed out that, in pH < 5 HCl aqueous solution the frameworks of these MOFs are not so stable. The precise structures, as well as excellent porosity and stability of these Ni8-Pz MOFs would make accessible for the modification of their frameworks and diversified application exploration.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "BUT-48", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "N2", "value": "886", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": "77 K"}], "pore volume": []}, {"meta": {"name": "BUT-49", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "N2", "value": "778", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": "77 K"}], "pore volume": []}, {"meta": {"name": "BUT-123", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "N2", "value": "2206", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": "77 K"}], "pore volume": [{"probe": "", "value": "1.25", "unit": "cm3/g", "condition": ""}]}]]], "include_properties": ["surface_area", "pore_volume"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['surface_area', 'pore_volume']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"BUT-48\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"surface area\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"BET\",\n                \"probe\": \"N2\",\n                \"value\": \"886\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"77 K\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"pore volume\": []\n    },\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"BUT-49\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"surface area\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"BET\",\n                \"probe\": \"N2\",\n                \"value\": \"778\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"77 K\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"pore volume\": []\n    },\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"BUT-123\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"surface area\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"BET\",\n                \"probe\": \"N2\",\n                \"value\": \"2206\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"77 K\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"pore volume\": [\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"1.25\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 8, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Optical microscopy images of six Ni<sub>8</sub>-Pz MOF single crystals.\nThe radius of crystal centering cycle is 0.1 mm.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"tz-2019-00021y_0001.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Optical microscopy images of six Ni8-Pz MOF single crystals.
