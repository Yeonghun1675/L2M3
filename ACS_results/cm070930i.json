Europium spectra contain a greatly simplified fine structure compared to the other lanthanides making identification of the local site symmetry of the metal ion in the complex possible.

When europium cations exist in a D4 site symmetry, two  components for the 5D0 \u2192 7F1 and one component of the 5D0 \u2192 7F2 are expected to be observed and the 5D0 \u2192 7F0 transitions remains strictly forbidden.

The stacked plot of the dehydrated and hydrated structures of 2 (inset of Figure ) exhibits only small changes in the hypersensitive transition fine structure.

The reversibility of this process demonstrates the robustness of the sample to the removal and introduction of water molecules into the framework. In order to analyze the dehydrated phase by crystallography, a single crystal of 2 was heated on the diffractometer and unit cells collected after heating at 50,  100, 125 \u00b0C, and after holding at 125 \u00b0C for 8 h. Crystallinity is observed to 125 \u00b0C, but a gradual loss of order is observed over the 8 h heating period. This is consistent with the network structure being intact to ~80% of water removal. As mentioned above, at this stage and above, rehydration generates the unit cell of the nascent crystal. For the luminescence experiments, given the hygroscopic nature of the dried material, the samples would likely have partially rehydrated during the time frame of the experiment.
