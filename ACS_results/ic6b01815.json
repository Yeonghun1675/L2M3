Generally, glutathione (GSH) is one of the most common toxicides\nfor acute iron poisoning; however, it is usually digested by an enzyme\nand releases these metal ions again. Owing\nto the strong coordination ability of Eu\u2013HODA, the luminescence\nof the Fe<sup>3+</sup>-coordinated Eu\u2013HODA complex cannot be\nrecovered, even upon adding glutathione (a). Furthermore, the mesopores are able to\nbe protected against enzymatic digestion through the stable functional\ngroups, and the addition of EDTA/base also cannot recover the quenching\nfluorescence intensity (a).

Eu-HODA (20 mg) was immersed into 50 mL of the Fe3+ solution (5.4 \u03bcM, 0.35 ppm). After stirring of the mixture for 4 h, it was filtered and the filtrate was subjected to ICP to analyze the concentration of residual Fe3+. The results showed that almost no Fe3+ remained. Even when adding NH4SCN solution to the above filtrate, there was no appearance of the representative sanguine species [Fe(SCN) n ]3-n , further indicating that no residual Fe3+ was present in the filtrate. In the meantime, the amounts of Eu3+ in the filtrate also did not increase, demonstrating that Eu-HODA had upstanding stability and a strong adsorptivity for Fe3+.
