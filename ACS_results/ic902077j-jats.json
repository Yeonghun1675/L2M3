With consideration of their gravimetric gas storage capacity, some theoretical studies had been performed on models of PCPs doped by the lightest metal lithium atoms exposed on their internal surface, revealing a significant improvement of the H<sub>2</sub> uptake capacity. Experimentally, many investigations have also been carried out to immobilize coordinatively unsaturated Li<sup>+</sup> ions on the pore surface of PCPs. Eddaoudi and co-workers reported that the extra-framework cations (K<sup>+</sup> or dimethylammonium) of zeolite-like PCPs were exchangeable with Li<sup>+</sup> as aqua complexes. Nevertheless, it was found that the removal of aqua ligands of Li<sup>+</sup> would result in degradation of the frameworks. Hupp and co-workers reported that interwoven PCPs doped with Li<sup>+</sup> exhibited enhanced H<sub>2</sub> uptake, but detailed investigations revealed that the enhanced H<sub>2</sub> uptake resulted from displacement of interwoven frameworks rather than exposed Li<sup>+</sup> because more extensive Li<sup>+</sup> doping decreased the H<sub>2</sub> loading.

Champness\u2019s and Schro\u0308der\u2019s groups showed that dimethylammonium cations in an indium-based PCP could be exchanged with Li<sup>+</sup> ions.
