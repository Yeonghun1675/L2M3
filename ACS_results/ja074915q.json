The profile of water adsorption shows a steep increase in the low relative pressure (P/P 0) region, which suggests a high affinity of 1a for water. The saturated amount of water adsorption of 2.3 mol/mol in the measurement time scale (equilibrium time = 800 s) agrees with the results of TGA and EA (Table S2), that is, one water coligand and one lattice water. The desorption profile showed a large hysteresis, because of restoration of the 2D structure. In the low relative pressure region, a small and reproducible step was observed at P/P 0 = 0.08, where the adsorption amount corresponds to one water molecule per unit (Figure b). From the structural insights gained for 1 and 1a, it is assumed that the framework of 1a provides two kinds of water sorption sites, namely, (1) a chemisorption site on the MnII ion and (2) a vacancy for physisorption between the 2D sheets. By the above considerations, the anomaly at P/P 0 = 0.08 should reflect the different adsorption types. From the structural aspects, the narrow 1D channels that are formed by Cr-C2N2-Mn, Cr-C3N3-Mn, and Cr-C6N6-Mn linkages in 1a can act as an accessible gate to MnII sites upon breaking the Mn-N3 bond and expanding the intersheet space. From these results, it is a reasonable deduction that adsorption in the region lower than P/P 0 = 0.08 occurred at the chemisorption site of (1) and the subsequent adsorption is attributed to physisorption at (2) as lattice water. The isotherm was analyzed using the Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) equation to estimate the zeolitic property of 1a. The DR plot of 1a showed a linear relationship in the low P/P 0 range, which establishes the strong affinity for water (Figure S2).
