The origin of this electronic conductivity is determined to be ligand mixed-valency, which is characterized using a suite of spectroscopic techniques, slow-scan cyclic voltammetry, and variable-temperature conductivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Importantly, UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance measurements reveal the first observation of Robin-Day Class II/III mixed valency in a MOF. Pursuit of stoichiometric control over the ligand redox states resulted in synthesis of the reduced framework material Na0.9(NBu4)1.8FeIII 2(dhbq)3. Differences in electronic conductivity and magnetic ordering temperature between the two compounds are investigated and correlated to the relative ratio of the two different ligand redox states. Overall, the transition metal-semiquinoid system is established as a particularly promising scaffold for achieving tunable long-range electronic communication in MOFs.\n\nUV-Vis-NIR Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy\n\nThe electronic absorption spectra of 1 and 2 () show a broad absorbance extending across the range 4500-14000 cm-1, with \u03bdmax = 7000 and 6300 cm-1, respectively. These intense absorption features are attributed to ligand-based IVCT. Notably, a solid-state UV-vis-NIR spectrum of a molecular FeIII semiquinone-catecholate compound shows a similar, though narrower, IVCT band at \u03bdmax = 5200 cm-1. Since all of the iron centers in 1 and 2 were confirmed to be trivalent by Mo\u0308ssbauer spectroscopy, the origin of the IVCT must be the organic dhbq2-/3- moieties. Interestingly, in both cases the bands display a very sharp absorption edge at low energy (4500 cm-1), one of the best-known signatures of Robin-Day Class II/III mixed-valency. This represents the first observation of a Class II/III mixed-valency in a MOF of which we are aware, and provides a definitive signature of strong electronic correlation within these materials. A higher energy absorbance observed at 21500 cm-1 is tentatively assigned to a \u03c0-\u03c0* transition, though the feature may also be due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer (Figure S6). The observation of a low-lying IVCT band in the electronic absorption spectra of 1 and 2 is indicative of thermally activated charge transport within the lattice, and this motivated us to explore the electronic conductivity of these materials.\n\nElectronic Conductivity\n\nElectronic conductivity was investigated via two-point dc conductivity measurements performed on pressed pellets of 1 and 2. For compound 1, a room-temperature conductivity of 0.16(1) S/cm was determined and found to be Ohmic within \u00b11 V of open circuit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest conductivity value yet observed for a three-dimensionally connected MOF. While several higher values have been reported for lamellar solids, the mode of conductivity in these materials is often attributed to \u03c0-d conjugation through square planar metal centers. To date, no clear strategy of extending this mechanism to three-dimensional solids has emerged. In contrast, compound 2 was found to be considerably less conductive, exhibiting a conductivity of 0.0062(1) S/cm at 298 K.\n\nCompound 2, which is much closer to a fully dhbq3--bridged framework, was expected to show an increased magnetic ordering temperature due to the greater number of paramagnetic linkers. Indeed, a higher magnetic transition temperature of 12 K was observed, as determined using ac magnetic susceptibility measurements (Figure S10). The room-temperature product of magnetic susceptibility and temperature (\u03c7M T) for 2 is 11.2 emu\u22c5K/mol, compared to 10.9 emu\u22c5K/mol for 1. Accordingly, the difference between the two frameworks is 0.3 emu\u22c5K/mol at 300 K, close to the 0.26 emu\u22c5K/mol difference expected with addition of 0.7 equiv of an S = 1/2 spin, assuming magnetically isolated metal and radical spins. Moreover, Curie-Weiss analysis of the magnetic susceptibility data for 2 in the temperature range 250-300 K results in \u03b8 = 144 K and C = 5.90 emu\u22c5K/mol (, middle). The higher Curie temperature as compared to 1 is in keeping with the greater density of magnetic exchange interactions expected for 2.\n\nFinally, low temperature (2 K) magnetic hysteresis measurements reveal that 2 is a harder magnet than 1, with coercive fields of 350 and 100 Oe observed, respectively (, bottom). The saturation magnetization (Figure S12) of 2 is 7.11 \u03bcB/mol, lower than that of 1, as expected due to the additional ligand radical spins coupling antiferromagnetically to the FeIII centers, and close to the predicted value of 7.94 \u03bcB/mol for ferrimagnetic coupling. The lower than predicted saturation magnetization values of both 1 and 2 at low temperature are attributed to antiferromagnetic interactions between the two sublattices that comprise the framework. In general, the conflict between the high Curie temperatures observed for 1 and 2 and their comparatively low magnetic ordering temperatures can potentially be resolved by counterion changes.
