Compound 1 has a three-step weight loss. The first weight loss occurs at ~180 \u00b0C and is attributed to coordinated water molecules. The structure of the dehydrated phase was determined (1d) and is stable up to ~440 \u00b0C, where a small weight loss occurs, after which decomposition of the material occurs at 740 \u00b0C. The second weight loss may involve the loss of the acidic proton. Compound 2 has one weight loss step before decomposition (515 \u00b0C) and occurs below 100 \u00b0C. It is attributed to loss of water molecules, and the resultant structure was determined (2d). Compound 3 has two weight losses before decomposition (515 \u00b0C). The first is below 100 \u00b0C and the second occurs at ~120 \u00b0C; both are attributed to water molecules. Interestingly, full decomposition did not occur for all compounds under these conditions, indicating high thermal stability. The dehydrated phases for compounds 2 and 3 are stable to ~515 \u00b0C.\n\nTextural Properties\n\nThe textural properties of the materials have provided interesting insights into the structures (Figure ). The N2 adsorption isotherms indicate that compounds 2 and 3 have a type I isotherm suggesting uniform microporosity. Compound 2 was found to have the largest surface area (Table ), which is in contrast to general trends; an increase in the reaction temperature generally decreases porosity. The high temperature phase, 2, was found to have a larger surface area than the low temperature phase. The change in reaction solution from water for 2 to a water/acetone mixture for 3 resulted in a decrease in surface area; however, both were greater than 80% microporous. At 10-3 P/P o the volume is already at 75 and 46 mL/g respectively for compounds 1 and 2, after which there is a very shallow slope to ~0.80 P/P o. This indicates that the pores were mostly full at very low P/P o, and the pore size must be less than 10 \u00c5. The thermogravimetric analysis shows a one-step weight loss for compound 2 and a two-step weight loss for compound 3 below 250 \u00b0C, associated with loss of water. These data suggest that the pore structures are different for compounds 2 and 3.\n\nAluminum biphenylenediphosphonates were also determined to be microporous materials, but their structures were not determined due to poor powder crystallinity. A reaction with anhydrous AlCl3 resulted in a porous aluminum biphenylenediphosphonate (S BET 167.8 m2/g) with both four- and six-coordinate aluminum atoms; however, the S BET values are larger for compounds 2 and 3. Conversely, the H2 uptake was larger for the aluminum biphenylenediphosphonate (~0.8 wt % at 760 Torr) than for compound 2 (0.43 wt % at 810 Torr and 77 K) ().
