Although Co-PAA-1 shows nonporous structure, as determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and N2 adsorption isotherms, it shows moderate hydrogen uptake due to the low kinetic diameter of H2 (2.89 \u00c5) and the suitability of pores present in Co-PAA-1 for H2 adsorption. Additionally, the steep rise of the H2 uptake capacities at low pressure (>0.2 atm) in all of the MOFs reported herein suggests the utility of these MOFs for hydrogen storage. From the H2 adsorption properties of PAA- and FPAA-based MOFs, it is clear that structures of FPAA-based MOFs are porous and noninterpenetrated, which shows a consistent gas adsorption uptake performance, probably because of the rigid structures of FPAA linkers present in MOF backbones. On the contrary, the structures of PAA-based MOFs are partially or highly interpenetrated (except Mn-PAA-1) without any consistencies in porosities as well as gas uptake properties, suggesting the importance of functionalization for avoiding interpenetration as well as improving the gas uptake properties.
