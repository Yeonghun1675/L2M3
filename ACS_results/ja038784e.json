These are slightly lower than the theoretical value of 9.14 cm3 K mol-1 that is expected for 1.5 isolated Mn2+ and 1 Yb ions in the 2F7/2 ground state (g = 8/7). Although the \u03c7 M T values for 1 and 2 smoothly decrease on cooling, the nature of the magnetic coupling between adjacent Yb and Mn ions could not be interpreted as an anti-ferromagnetic interaction due to the existence of strong spin-orbit coupling for lanthanide atoms.
