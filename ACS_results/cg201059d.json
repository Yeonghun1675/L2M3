Hydrogen atoms on carbon were calculated in ideal positions with isotropic displacement parameters. In PCN-131' and PCN-132', free solvent molecules were highly disordered, and attempts to locate and refine the solvent peaks were unsuccessful. The diffused electron densities resulting from the these residual solvent molecules were removed from the data set using the SQUEEZE routine of PLATON and further refined using the data generated. The contents of the solvent region are not represented in the unit cell contents in crystal data. Attempts to determine the final formula of such compounds from the SQUEEZE results combined with elemental analysis and TGA data were not successful because the volatility of the crystallization solvents during measurements prevented accurate data from being obtained.
