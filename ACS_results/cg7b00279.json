We also notice another change of several peak positions at 115 \u00b0C revealing a slight change of unit cell parameters of the dehydrated phase.\n\nCH3OH, H2O, and NH3 Adsorption Measurements\n\nThe presence of permanent porosity in fully dehydrated [1] is confirmed by the adsorption of methanol at 298 K (Figure S7). The shape of the isotherm is characteristic of a microporous solid and the maximum adsorbed amount of methanol (0.09 g/g) corresponds to pore volume of 0.11 cm3/g. The isotherm of water adsorption on dehydrated [1] compound is presented in . The saturation uptake is close to eight molecules of water per formula unit in accordance with TGA and structure determination, corresponding to an adsorption of 0.13 g.g-1. The step in the isotherm occurring at four H2O molecules is attributed to the formation of the intermediate phase containing this number of water molecules. This step in the adsorption isotherm and a slight hysteresis are indicative of a structural rearrangement during the transition between the phase containing four H2O molecules and the fully hydrated one. Another important feature of the isotherm is a strong adsorption at a very low water pressure: the solid adsorbs a half the water below 0.01 of saturated water pressure, and nearly all the water molecules at P/P S = 0.1. Such behavior reveals a strong hydrophilic character of [1] in comparison with most of the known MOFs as reported in two recent reviews on water adsorption in MOFs. Finally, the log scale drawing of the water adsorption isotherm (, right) allows one to distinguish for the first adsorption step (four water molecules) two substeps of two water molecules each, the first substep corresponding to extremely low water pressure (P/P S < 0.001). It is also worth noting that the crystal structure of the phase we expected to be fully dehydrated has revealed the presence of two water molecules per formula unit. In addition to its strong hydrophilic character, [1] shows a remarkable stability toward water. It preserves a constant water capacity in multiple cycles of water adsorption (Figure S8). Also, its structure is fully preserved after immersion in liquid water as attested by XRPD (Figure S3).\n\n[1] adsorbs a significant amount of ammonia attaining 0.3 g/g or 17.6 mmol/g at 930 hPa (a). This important uptake is due to chemisorption of NH3 which interacts with Cd2+ cations and forms the [Cd(NH3)6]2+ complex similarly to another Cd-based PCP described in our previous work. Giving Cd content in the anhydrous material (2.6 mmol/g), this adsorption mechanism could provide the capacity of 15.6 mmol(NH3)/g. Such chemisorption should naturally result in degradation of the crystalline structure of the material, which indeed happens in [1] saturated with ammonia as confirmed by in situ XRPD (c). It should be noted, however, that degassing the sample at 298 K results in the appearance of a peak at ~9.5\u00b0 in the diffraction pattern indicative of the existence of a partial crystalline order in the degassed sample. Moreover, upon contact with air the peak shifts to ~9.2\u00b0 reflecting the swelling of the partially ordered structure upon insertion of water molecules. Even if the attribution of this peak to any crystalline plane is impossible, this behavior is similar to that of the (110) peak located at 10.4\u00b0 in the dehydrated structure and shifted to 10.0\u00b0 upon hydration. We suppose thus that the shift of the peak after contact with air indicates that despite the breakdown of the crystalline structure after NH3 adsorption the solid preserves (at least partially) its porosity. This is indeed the case as follows from MeOH adsorption isotherm by the sample exposed to NH3 (Figure S7). Even if the maximum amount adsorbed is lower than for the pristine solid (0.05 instead of 0.09 g/g) the isotherm confirms the porosity of the amorphous phase obtained after adsorption of NH3. Due to this important property [1] shows a fully reversible character of NH3 adsorption (b).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "4,4'-bipyridinium,1,1-bis(3-carboxyphenyl)", "symbol": "1", "chemical
