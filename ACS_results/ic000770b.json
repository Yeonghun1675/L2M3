The 2,3-diphenylbicyclooctene derivative (IX, 9,12-dimethyl-10,11-diphenyltetracyclo[6.4.0.04,12.05,9]dodec-10-ene) was prepared by heating a mixture of commercially available dimeric 3,4-diphenyl-2,5-dimethylcyclopentadienone (2.5 g, 10 mmol) and freshly distilled 1,4-cyclooctadiene (10 mL) in a sealed tube at 80 \u00b0C for 72 h. The excess 1,4-cycloocatadiene was removed in vacuo, and the chromatographic purification of the resulting crude syrup on silica gel, using a 1:1 mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate as an eluent, afforded the pure 2,3-diphenylbicyclooctene derivative IX in good yield (2.1 g, 62%); mp 142-144 \u00b0C (dichloromethane/ethanol); 1H NMR (CDCl3) \u03b4 0.94 (s, 6H), 1.75 (br d, 4H), 1.82 (br s, 4H), 1.95 (br d, 4H), 6.88-7.07 (m, 10H); 13C NMR (CDCl3) \u03b4 22.97, 24.86, 45.63, 47.38, 125.11, 126.86, 130.02, 141.86, 142.18; GC-MS m/z 340 (M+), 340 calcd for C26H28.
