Furthermore, PXRD patterns of samples soaked in water for six months or boiled in water for 2 weeks did not differ from that of an as-synthesized sample (), indicating that 1 is an excellent thermal- and water-stable crystalline material. In a word, the unique structural characteristics and high thermal and water stabilities of 1 make it a promising candidate as an excellent proton-conducting material under both anhydrous and humid conditions.\n\nProton Transfer from (Me2NH2)+ Cations to O3P Groups\n\nBecause high temperature induces stretching of the N-H1a bond in (Me2NH2)+, sufficiently high energy would promote H+ transfer to the O sites of PO3 groups. As the boiling point of Me2NH is only 7.4 \u00b0C, it would easily escape from 1 after its incorporation. As expected, TGA showed that 1 gives a weight loss of 9.7% from 350 to 450 \u00b0C (), which can be attributed to Me2NH molecules (calcd: 9.9%) from deprotonated (Me2NH2)+ lattice cations, finally yielding a new phase (1a), which was also verified by variable-temperature PXRD (a and ). Elemental analyses (EA) and XPS showed the absence of N atoms in 1a, implying that all Me2NH molecules have successfully escaped from 1 (a and ). Another crucial information provided by XPS is that the valence state of the Eu(III) ion in 1a is consistent with that of 1 (). Besides, compared with 1, the two strong and wide IR spectral bands \u03bd1 and \u03bd2 in 1a completely disappeared, while the 3280 cm-1 peak referring to PO-H, appeared (b and ), indicating acidification of PO3 groups and the presence of PO3H after Me2NH removal.\n\nObviously, comparison of the proton conductivities of 1a with that of 1 can be utilized to examine the role that the hydrogen-bonded chains play during proton transfer. Nevertheless, due to poor crystallinity of the large single crystals of 1a, AC impedance measurements could not be carried out.

Therefore, a conclusion can be drawn that the hydrogen-bonded chains of 1 really play a vital role on fast proton transfer.\n\nReversible Proton Transfer Verified by Luminescence Properties\n\nTo better understand the role of strongly hydrogen-bonded chains (N-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O) in the structure-property relationship of structure 1, its temperature-dependent photoluminescence properties were investigated. With increasing temperatures from 25 to 150 \u00b0C, the intensity of the characteristic red emission of Eu(III) corresponding to the 5D0 \u2192 7F2 transition (609 nm) remained steady and then showed a slight decrease before reaching 300 \u00b0C, which arises from radiative relaxation of the excited-state energy-induced high temperatures. Upon further heating, emission intensity gradually declined until it completely disappeared at 450 \u00b0C, which could not be recovered by cooling back to room temperature (a,b). These observations suggest that irreversible changes happened in the structural transformation from 1 to 1a. Besides this, room-temperature lifetime measurements of samples of 1 after different temperature treatments showed that the lifetime of the 5D0 excited state is almost unchanged (~1.60 ms) from 25 to 300 \u00b0C but drops sharply (0.39 ms) when heated continuously (c and ), which coincides with the process of Me2NH removal (a, ). Considering that vibronic coupling with O-H can effectively quench the excited state of lanthanide-based MOFs, the present observation of luminescence quenching and shortened lifetime prompted us to conclude that formation of O-H in 1a occurred after removal of deprotonated Me2NH molecules from the (Me2NH2)+ cations.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "1", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "300", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "thermal stability", "condition": ""}, {"value": "350 to 450", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "weight loss", "condition": "attributed to Me2NH molecules from deprotonated (Me2NH2)+ lattice cations"}], "proton_conductivity": [{"value": "5.29 \u00d7 10-5", "unit": "S\u22c5cm-1", "temperature": "100 \u00b0C", "RH": "98", "Ea": "1.50", "guest": ""}, {"value": "3.76 \u00d7 10-3", "unit": "S\u22c5cm-1", "temperature": "100 \u00b0C", "RH": "98", "Ea": "", "guest": ""}], "peak spectrum": [{"value": "3280", "unit": "cm-1", "type": "IR", "condition": "referring to PO-H, indicating acidification of PO3 groups and the presence of PO3H after Me2NH removal"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["decomposition_temperature", "proton_conductivity", "peak_spectrum"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['decomposition_temperature', 'proton_conductivity', 'peak_spectrum']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n{\n\"meta\":{\"name\":\"1\", \"symbol\":\"1\", \"chemical formula\":\"\"},\n\"decomposition temperature\": [\n    {\n        \"value\": \"300\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"thermal stability\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"value\": \"350 to 450\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"weight loss\",\n        \"condition\": \"attributed to Me2NH molecules from deprotonated (Me2NH2)+ lattice cations\"\n    }\n],\n\"proton_conductivity\": [\n    {\n        \"value\": \"5.29 \u00d7 10-5\",\n        \"unit\": \"S\u22c5cm-1\",\n        \"temperature\": \"100 \u00b0C\",\n        \"RH\": \"98\",\n        \"Ea\": \"1.50\",\n        \"guest\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"value\": \"3.76 \u00d7 10-3\",\n        \"unit\": \"S\u22c5cm-1\",\n        \"temperature\": \"100 \u00b0C\",\n        \"RH\": \"98\",\n        \"Ea\": \"\",\n        \"guest\": \"\"\n    }\n],\n\"peak spectrum\": [\n    {\n        \"value\": \"3280\",\n        \"unit\": \"cm-1\",\n        \"type\": \"IR\",\n        \"condition\": \"referring to PO-H, indicating acidification of PO3 groups and the presence of PO3H after Me2NH removal\"\n    }\n]\n}\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 13, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Perspective views\nof the layer anionic host framework of <bold>1</bold> along the <italic>a</italic>-axis (the uncoordinated O atoms\nof phosphonate groups are shown as red spheres) and (b) the sandwich-type\nstructure of <bold>1</bold> along the <italic>c</italic>-axis with\nthe counter cations (Me<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>)<sup>+</sup> periodically\naligned in the interlayers.
