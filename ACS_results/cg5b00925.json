The N2, CO2, and water vapor adsorption properties of 1 were studied under different conditions (Figure S2). Compound 1 assimilates a spot of N2 (17.19 cm3/g) with a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 47.83 m2/g at -196 \u00b0C as well as a low CO2 uptake (11.89 cm3/g) at 20 \u00b0C. As expected, 1 also shows very low water vapor adsorption at 20 \u00b0C (1.64 cm3/g). These results suggest that the flexible framework of 1 tends to shrink upon the activation process.
