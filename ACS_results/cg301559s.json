CO<sub>2</sub> (195 K) sorption measurements for\ndesolvated <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> gave type I isotherms\nfor microporous materials (), given calculated Langmuir surface areas of 417 and 535 m<sup>2</sup>/g for <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>, respectively.

At 273 K and 1 atm, compound <bold>1</bold> could take up\n11.0 wt % of CO<sub>2</sub> (62.94 cc/g), and at 298 K the CO<sub>2</sub> uptake by compound <bold>1</bold> is 8.4 wt % (46.8 cc/g).\nCorrespondingly, compound <bold>1</bold> could only adsorb 24.5 cc/g\nCH<sub>4</sub> at 273 K and 1 atm, which is also shown in Figure a. Compound <bold>2</bold> has similar selective\nadsorption abilities for CO<sub>2</sub> over CH<sub>4</sub>. As shown\nin Figure b, compound <bold>2</bold> could\nadsorb 8.1 wt % (44.86 cc/g) and 5.7 wt % of CO<sub>2</sub> (31.0\ncc/g) at 273 and 298 K, respectively. However, the CH<sub>4</sub> uptake\nof compound <bold>2</bold> is only 1.1 wt % (14.01 cc/g) at 273 K\nand 1.0 atm. To assess the values of the CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption\nenthalpies in these compounds, the 273 and 298 K data were then fit\nsimultaneously using a virial equation. The isosteric\nheat of adsorption curves give an initial heat of \u223c31 kJ/mol\n(). These values are comparable\nwith other reported flexible structures having similar porosity at\nsimilar temperatures, for example, MIL-53(Cr) (32 kJ/mol) and MIL-53(Al)\n(35 kJ/mol). The selective sorption capabilities\nof compounds <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> for CO<sub>2</sub> over\nCH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> could be explained by a size-exclusion\nbehavior of the small channels and special layer structures tuned\nby the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions in the structures\nof these two compounds.

For compound <bold>2</bold>, as\nshown in Figure b, the methanol and ethanol\nadsorption isotherms are similar to that of compound <bold>1</bold> and are of type I behavior with small hysteresis. At saturated vapor\npressures, compound <bold>2</bold> can adsorb the highest amounts\nof the methanol and ethanol with values of 140.8 cc/g and 76.2 cc/g,\nrespectively.

Moreover,\nthe water adsorption isotherm of compound <bold>2</bold> can be attributed\nto \u201cgate-open behavior\u201d, in which retaining a large\namount of guest molecules at very low relative pressure can arise\nfrom strong host\u2013guest interaction and/or a large diffusion\nbarrier.\n</p><title>Photoluminescent Properties</title><p>The\nphotoluminescence of\nd<sup>10</sup> metal complexes has been attracting intensive research\ninterest, owing to their potential applications in chemical sensors,\nphotochemistry, and electroluminescent (EL) displays.

Decomposition of compound 2 began near 360 \u00b0C. The residue was ZnO (experimental, 15.90%; calculated, 16.20%). PXRD studies were performed for the as-synthesized sample, and the samples were heated at different temperatures including 215, 250, and 300 \u00b0C. (). The PXRD patterns of these two compounds heated at 215 and 250 \u00b0C for 2 h were coincident with the patterns of their as-synthesized samples, which indicates that the departure of the guest molecules does not lead to an obvious phase transformation. When the sample was heated to 300 \u00b0C, coordinated solvent molecules began to depart, which causes a structural transformation with a decrease in crystallinity.\n\nSorption Properties\n\nThe permanent porosity of compounds 1 and 2 is confirmed by their sorption capacities. Before the measurement, the as-synthesized samples were soaked in methanol for 3 days and then evacuated at 215 \u00b0C for 12 h to obtain their activated samples. The N2 sorption properties of these two compounds at 77 K were measured. However, they only show very small N2 sorption volume, 17.5 and 13.3 cc/g for compounds 1 and 2, respectively (). CO2 (195 K) sorption measurements for desolvated 1 and 2 gave type I isotherms for microporous materials (), given calculated Langmuir surface areas of 417 and 535 m2/g for 1 and 2, respectively. The adsorption-desorption isotherms of compound 1 for CO2 at 273 and 298 K are plotted in Figure a. As shown, compound 1 exhibits a typical type I reversible sorption for CO2. At 273 K and 1 atm, compound 1 could take up 11.0 wt % of CO2 (62.94 cc/g), and at 298 K the CO2 uptake by compound 1 is 8.4 wt % (46.8 cc/g). Correspondingly, compound 1 could only adsorb 24.5 cc/g CH4 at 273 K and 1 atm, which is also shown in Figure a. Compound 2 has similar selective adsorption abilities for CO2 over CH4. As shown in Figure b, compound 2 could adsorb 8.1 wt % (44.86 cc/g) and 5.7 wt % of CO2 (31.0 cc/g) at 273 and 298 K, respectively. However, the CH4 uptake of compound 2 is only 1.1 wt % (14.01 cc/g) at 273 K and 1.0 atm. To assess the values of the CO2 adsorption enthalpies in these compounds, the 273 and 298 K data were then fit simultaneously using a virial equation. The isosteric heat of adsorption curves give an initial heat of ~31 kJ/mol (). These values are comparable with other reported flexible structures having similar porosity at similar temperatures, for example, MIL-53(Cr) (32 kJ/mol) and MIL-53(Al) (35 kJ/mol). The selective sorption capabilities of compounds 1 and 2 for CO2 over CH4 and N2 could be explained by a size-exclusion behavior of the small channels and special layer structures tuned by the \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions in the structures of these two compounds. Compounds 1 and 2 also have the ability to adsorb considerable amounts of H2 at low temperatures. As shown in Figure , compounds 1 and 2 show substantial H2 sorption that increased linearly as H2 pressure increased, giving the highest uptakes of 1.17 and 1.02 wt % at 77 K and 1.0 atm, respectively. The initial enthalpy of compounds 1 and 2 were calculated to be 7.6 and 7.3 kJ/mol, respectively ().\n\nThe porosity of compounds 1 and 2 also allow potential access by a variety of small solvent molecules. We examined the vapor sorption abilities including water, methanol, and ethanol of compounds 1 and 2 at room temperature. These measurements were also carried out on the actived samples. As shown in Figure a, compound 1 exhibits a hysteretic adsorption behavior to water and type I behavior with small hysteresis to methanol and ethanol. Water was gradually adsorbed onto compound 1 in the low-pressure region, and the uptake increased as the vapor pressure increased. Finally, it took up a certain amount of water, 168.8 cc/g at P/P 0 = 1. The methanol and ethanol sorption isotherms were characterized by a plateau reached at low relative pressure, which is indicative of sorption in micropores. The highest methanol and ethanol vapor adsorptions on compound 1 are 175.1 and 91.7 cc/g, respectively. For compound 2, as shown in Figure b, the methanol and ethanol adsorption isotherms are similar to that of compound 1 and are of type I behavior with small hysteresis. At saturated vapor pressures, compound 2 can adsorb the highest amounts of the methanol and ethanol with values of 140.8 cc/g and 76.2 cc/g, respectively. The water adsorption of compound 2 was different, which gradually increases to a small uptake of 87.0 cc/g at P/P 0 = 0.40, then suddenly jumps to 186.6 cc/g at P/P 0 = 0.56, and gradually reaches a saturation uptake of 257.3 cc/g at P/P 0 = 0.95 with notable hysteresis; thus, it can be classified as type V. A similar phenomenon was also reported for a number of flexible MOFs, which could result from the flexible frameworks and the interaction between the framework and the guest. Moreover, the water adsorption isotherm of compound 2 can be attributed to \"gate-open behavior\", in which retaining a large amount of guest molecules at very low relative pressure can arise from strong host-guest interaction and/or a large diffusion barrier. \n\nPhotoluminescent Properties\n\nThe photoluminescence of d10 metal complexes has been attracting intensive research interest, owing to their potential applications in chemical sensors, photochemistry, and electroluminescent (EL) displays. To study the photoluminescent properties of compounds 1 and 2, the emission spectra of 1 and 2 in the solid state were investigated at room temperature (Figure ). It is shown that compounds 1 and 2 have emission maxima at 416 nm (\u03bbex = 306 nm) and 422 nm (\u03bbex = 308 nm), respectively, whereas the H3L ligand displays the emission maxima at 554 nm upon excitation at 307 nm. In comparison with the free ligand, blue shifts of 138 and 132 nm occur in the maximum emission peaks in compounds 1 and 2. The luminescence of 1 and 2 should be ascribed as the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT). The ligand chelation to the metal center may effectively increase the rigidity of the ligand and reduce the loss of energy by radiationless decay, thus causing the blue shift in 1 and 2.", "data":
