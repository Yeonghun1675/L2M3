Upon application of a field parallel to the preferred axis of sublattice magnetization of an antiferromagnet, a competition is set up between the strength of the external field and the internal exchange field H E. For an antiferromagnet with weak anisotropy, when H reaches a critical field H SF, the antiparallel magnetizations on the two sublattices flop from the direction of the easy-axis to that perpendicular to it. A further increase of the field to H c\u2018 will totally align the spins to the direction of the field, which makes the system to the saturated paramagnetic state. In the molecular field model, the critical fields at T = 0 K, H SF(0), and H c\u2018(0) are related to H E and H A by the following equations:4,11         Furthermore, the differential susceptibility dM  a  */dH after the SF transition at 0 K can be written as4,11     dM  a  */dH can be obtained by the differential of M-H  a  * curve between H SF and H c and the zero-temperature value is obtained by the extrapolation. Thus, we have dM  a  */dH(0) ~ 0.0065 \u03bcB/kOe and H SF(0) = 12.68 kOe. The anisotropy field is then estimated as H A = 0.2 kOe and the exchange field H E = 387.8 kOe from eqs 9 and 11.

External fields along b can successfully overwhelm J  a  * and turn the system to a WF state through a first-order metamagnetic transition.
