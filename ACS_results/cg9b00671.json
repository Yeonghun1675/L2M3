The release rate was rapid during the first day, and no significant change was observed after 3 days, indicating that the release reached equilibrium (b). After 7 days, about 85.64% of the initial I2 had been released from I2@Th-TATAB, showing the adsorption process of MOF Th-TATAB toward I2 is reversible (b). We deem that host-guest interaction plays a key role in such release behavior. Strong \u03c0-electron-iodine and host-guest interactions promote I2 uptake, whereas it would also undermine the desorption of I2 from I2@Th-TATAB, leading to the incomplete delivery of iodine from the I2@Th-TATAB composite system. Because of the skeleton collapse of the sample after methanol activation (Figure S3b), the unactivated sample was used for the measurement of nitrogen adsorption.

Thorium is a chemically toxic and radioactive element; standard precautionary measures to handle radioactive substances ought to be followed. \n\nSynthesis of Ligand 4,4',4\"-s-Triazine-1,3,5-triyltri-p-aminobenzoate (H3TATAB)\n\nLigand H3TATAB was synthesized according to the literature and slightly modified. 4-Aminobenzoic acid (4.5 g, 33 mmol), NaOH (1.5 g, 37.5 mmol), and NaHCO3 (2.25 g, 27.5 mmol) were placed in 50 mL of deionized water. At 0 \u00b0C,  the mixed solution was stirred for 30 min. Cyanuric chloride (1.5 g, 8.25 mmol) was added to 1,4-dioxane (15 mL) and stirred until dissolved and then dripped into the above mixed solution. The mixed solution was then refluxed for 24 h in an oil bath at 115 \u00b0C. The obtained solution was acidified with 20% hydrochloric acid to pH = 3. The light yellow product was obtained by filtration, washed with distilled water until neutral, and dried to gain ligand H3TATAB (4.5 g, yield: 80%). 1H NMR (DMSO-d 6, 400 MHz): \u03b4 = 7.88 (d, 6H), 7.97 (d, 6H), 9.84 (s, 3H), 12.64 (s, br, 3H).
