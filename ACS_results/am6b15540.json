The first weight loss (6.7%) occurring before 95 \u00b0C is related to the removal of the lattice water (calcd 6.8%). Then the coordinated water molecules are released upon further heating to 150 \u00b0C (weight loss: calcd 4.0%, found 3.8%). The weight loss in the temperature range from 220 to 390 \u00b0C is due to azide decomposition (calcd 10.5%, found 10%). The organic moiety decomposes in the range of 390-430 \u00b0C. The IR spectrum of 2 (Figure S6) displays two absorption bands at 3487 and 3537 cm-1. Upon heating, the former band decreases in intensity and disappears at 100 \u00b0C, indicating the release of lattice water.

Because of the contacts between electron-poor viologen units and electron-rich sites (either carboxylate oxygen or azide nitrogen), 1 is photochromic, which is related to the formation of radicals via photoinduced electron transfer. 2 is not photochromic for lack of appropriate electron-transfer pathways. Nevertheless, 2 shows reversible and marked changes in color and magnetic properties upon removal and absorption of water molecules. The dual responses to water are attributed to reversible electron transfer promoted by reversible structural transformation during the dehydration-rehydration process. The solid-state solvochromism and solvotomagnetism through radical mechanisms have not yet been reported prior to our work and may find applications in snensing and switching devices. Our work could shed light on the design of new smart organic-inorganic hybrid materials using redox-active organic building blocks.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 53, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting\nInformation\nis available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsami.6b15540\">10.1021/acsami.6b15540</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Structural diagrams\nand spectral (XRD, IR, and UV\u2013vis),\nTGA, DOS, and magnetic data.

[H4L]Cl2 shows two pairs of quasi-reversible peaks with formal potentials (versus Ag-AgCl) E = -0.52 and -0.98 V, corresponding to the two successive one-electron transfer processes of the viologen moiety (V2+ \u2194 V\u22c5+ \u2194 V0). The first process occurs at less negative potential and the second one at more negative potential than the corresponding processes for MVCl2 (E = -0.64 and -0.92 V; MV2+ = dimethyl viologen). The observations suggest that the isopthalic substituent is beneficial to stabilization of the intermediate radical species. Compounds 1 and 2 show similar voltammetric behaviors, with E = -0.54 and -0.97 V for 1 and E = -0.52 and -1.0 V for 2. It is obvious that the redox activity is retained after the formation of these MOFs, with only minor changes in potentials.\n\nHydrochromism of 2 \n\nAlthough not photochromic, compound 2 undergoes reversible color change upon releasing and reabsorbing water molecules. Upon heating to above 100 \u00b0C under vacuum or nitrogen atmosphere, the yellow compound turns brownish green. To monitor the thermal effect, thermogravimetric analysis and in situ variable-temperature IR spectroscopy were performed with 2 (Figure S8). Four weight-loss steps were observed in the TG plot. The first weight loss (6.7%) occurring before 95 \u00b0C is related to the removal of the lattice water (calcd 6.8%). Then the coordinated water molecules are released upon further heating to 150 \u00b0C (weight loss: calcd 4.0%, found 3.8%). The weight loss in the temperature range from 220 to 390 \u00b0C is due to azide decomposition (calcd 10.5%, found 10%). The organic moiety decomposes in the range of 390-430 \u00b0C. The IR spectrum of 2 (Figure S6) displays two absorption bands at 3487 and 3537 cm-1. Upon heating, the former band decreases in intensity and disappears at 100 \u00b0C, indicating the release of lattice water. The latter band decreases above 100 \u00b0C and disappears at 150 \u00b0C, indicating that the coordinated water molecules are lost. The fact that the material does not change color until heated to 100 \u00b0C suggests that the chromic phenomenon is related to the removal of the coordinated water.\n\nMagnetic Properties\n\nCompound 1 \n\nThe magnetic susceptibility of 1 over 2-300 K is plotted in a. The \u03c7T product at 300 K (3.35 emu K mol-1 per Co(II)) is well above the spin-only value expected for S = 3/2 (1.875 emu K mol-1), typical of the octahedral CoII-4 T 1g term with unquenched orbital contribution. As the temperature decreases, both \u03c7 and \u03c7T increase monotonically. The susceptibility above 20 K can be fitted to the Curie-Weiss law with Weiss temperature \u03b8 = 10 K and Curie constant C = 10 emu K mol-1. The behaviors suggest ferromagnetic (FM) interactions between Co(II) ions. The magnetization isotherm was measured at 2 K (Figure S10). The very rapid increase of magnetization in the low field region confirms the FM behavior. The magnetization at 5 T (2.49 N\u03b2) is consistent with the value (2-3 N\u03b2) expected for octahedral Co(II).\n\nThe magnetic properties of the anhydrous-phase 2D were also investigated. The data are plotted in  and S11 for comparison with the original phase. The \u03c7T value of 2D at 300 K is 4.44 emu K mol-1, higher than that for 2. This is in agreement with the generation of organic radicals after dehydration. The temperature-dependent magnetic behaviors of 2D also indicate overall AF interactions. The isothermal magnetization of 2D also increases quasilinearly with field, but the values are higher than those of 2 in the whole field range owing to the contribution from radicals. The magnetization would show nonlinear variation with field if the radicals were magnetically isolated (i.e., as paramagnetic components superimposed on the AF coupled Mn(II) ions). The absence of appreciable nonlinear variation in the magnetization curve of 2D indicates that the radicals are AF coupled with each other, with Mn(II), or both. Considering the ESR signal of 2D, one can be sure of the spin exchange between Mn(II) and the radical.
