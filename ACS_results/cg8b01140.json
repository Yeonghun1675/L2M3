Five new metal acetylacetonates {[Cu(L1)2(MeOH)2] n , [Co(L2)2] n , [Cu(L2)2(MeOH)2], [Zn(L2)2(MeOH)2], and [Fe(L2)3]} were structurally characterized, and in all five cases, the heterocyclic end of the ligand is involved in some sort of structure-directing interaction, even though it is less prevalent in [Fe(L2)3]. The choice of solvent(s) is also critical. Almost all of our reactions were carried out using a \"non-innocent\" solvent, methanol.

Then, iron(III) perchlorate hydrate, Fe(ClO4)3\u22c5xH2O (4.0 mg, ca. 1 equiv) dissolved in 1 mL of acetonitrile was added and mixed well. After careful addition of two drops of triethylamine/acetonitrile (1:5 v/v) solution with minimal agitation, the vial was sealed and left undisturbed at ambient conditions to allow triethylamine to diffuse into the solution slowly. Red/orange crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction were harvested after 3 days.

Then, copper(II) perchlorate hexahydrate (4.1 mg, 11 \u03bcmol, 1 equiv) dissolved in 1 mL of methanol was added and mixed well. After careful addition of two drops of triethylamine/methanol (1:5 v/v) solution with minimal agitation, the vial was sealed and left undisturbed at ambient conditions to allow triethylamine to diffuse into the solution slowly. Dark green crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction were observed after 24 h.

ATR-FTIR (cm-1): 3025.67, 2923.55, 2801.53, 2218.52, 1662.77, 1577.47, 1506.86, 1420.72, 1380.55, 1342.62, 1311.32, 1256.86, 1214.64, 1100.02, 1031.19, 1001.10, 909.05, 827.49, 729.92.\n\nSynthesis of [Co(L2)2] n  \n\nTo grow crystals via the layering technique, L2 (6.1 mg, 22 \u03bcmol, 2 equiv) was dissolved in 1 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide, basified by adding two drops of triethylamine/methanol (1:5 v/v) solution and transferred into a narrow glass tube. After careful layering of 1 mL of neat methanol, cobalt(II) perchlorate hexahydrate (4.0 mg, 11 \u03bcmol, 1 equiv) dissolved in 1 mL of methanol was slowly added on top without disturbing it. The tube was then sealed and allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 week, during which time reddish orange crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction were appeared.
