As shown in Figure , sample treatment has a pronounced effect on the N2 sorption isotherms. Thus, desolvated samples of 1\u22c55DMF\u22c53MeOH provide Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Langmuir surface areas of 559 and 587 m2/g, respectively, while those of 1' give BET and Langmuir surface areas of 1243 and 1317 m2/g, respectively. This observation may reflect the displacement of the coordinated DMF molecules with the sterically less demanding aqua ligands. This effect is also apparent in the Horvath-Kawazoe differential pore-volume plots for 1\u22c55DMF\u22c53MeOH and 1', which give pore widths of 13.1 and 15.3 \u00c5, respectively (Figures S5-S7 in the ). Similarly, the H2 sorption curves for 1\u22c55DMF\u22c53MeOH and 1' exhibit 0.90 and 1.76 wt % sorption, respectively. While desolvated samples of 2\u22c54DMF\u22c52MeOH and 3\u22c54DMF\u22c53MeOH exhibit negligible surface areas, the methanol-soaked and desolvated 2 and 3 exhibit BET surface areas of 389 and 380 m2/g with weight percent uptake of H2 of 0.75 and 0.73 wt %, respectively (Figures S11, S12, S17, and S18 in the ).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 14, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig5\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>5</label>\n<caption>\n<p>N<sub>2</sub> sorption isotherms for desolvated <bold>1</bold>\u00b75DMF\u00b73MeOH (red) and <bold>1\u2032</bold> (blue).</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr5\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"ic-2009-003802_0004.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 5  N2 sorption isotherms for desolvated 1\u22c55DMF\u22c53MeOH (red) and 1' (blue).
