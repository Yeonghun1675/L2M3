(b) Step 1: removal of the coordinated H2O molecules from the axial positions of the Zn ions in 1 leads to a reorganization of the coordination environment of each Zn2 unit. Two of the four carboxylate groups in each Zn2 motif remain bridging within that Zn2 unit, while the other two shift to bridging positions between one Zn ion in that unit and another Zn ion in a different Zn2 unit located in an adjacent layer. (c) Step 2: the formation of Zn-O bonds (colored in sky blue) leads to the connection of neighboring Zn2 units, thus forming 1D Zn-O chains. The Zn ions in 1' have tetrahedral geometry.

Upon desolvation, the structure undergoes a significant and reversible structural adjustment with a corresponding reduction in crystallinity. The combination of computationally assisted structure determination and experimental data analysis of the desolvated phase revealed a structural change in the metal coordination geometry from square-pyramidal to tetrahedral. Simulations of desolvation showed that the local distortion of the ligand geometry followed by the rotation and displacement of the pyrene core permits the breakup of the metal-paddlewheel motifs and the formation of 1D Zn-O chains that cross-link adjacent layers, resulting in a dimensionality change from the 2D layered structure to a 3D structure. Constrained Rietveld refinement of the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of the desolvated phase and the use of other analytical techniques such as porosity measurements, 13C CP MAS NMR spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy strongly supported the observed structural transformation. The 3D network is stable up to 425 \u00b0C and is permanently porous to CO2 with an apparent BET surface area of 523(8) m2/g (p/p\u00b0 = 0.02-0.22). Because of the hydrophobic nature, size, and shape of the pores of the 3D framework, the adsorption behavior of the structure toward p-xylene and m-xylene was studied, and the results indicated that the shape of the isotherm and the kinetics of the adsorption process are determined mainly by the shape of the xylene isomers, with each xylene isomer interacting with the host framework in a different manner.\n\nBulk Characterization\n\nThe bulk phase and analytical purity of as-made 1 were confirmed by PXRD, elemental analysis (section 5 in the ), TGA, and SEM. The Le Bail fit of [Zn2(TBAPy)(H2O)2]\u22c5(dioxane)1.5(DMF)0.5(H2O)1.1 (1) gave the refined cell parameters a = 6.8229(2) \u00c5, b = 15.7670(5) \u00c5, c = 11.1900(3) \u00c5, \u03b1 = \u03b3 = 90\u00b0, \u03b2 = 102.922(2)\u00b0, and V = 1173.36(3) \u00c53 with excellent fit indicators (R wp = 4.13%, R p = 3.23%, \u03c72 = 1.31) (), in good agreement with the parameters obtained from the single-crystal structure determination. SEM images confirmed the homogeneity of 1 and revealed the blocklike morphology of the crystals (). TGA showed that all of the extraframework guests and the coordinated H2O molecules (total mass loss = 22.2%) were removed over the temperature range 120-240 \u00b0C within a single step (), in agreement with the observed composition obtained from the microanalytical data (calcd 22.7%). Decomposition of the framework occurred above 425 \u00b0C.\n\nPorosity and Guest Response\n\nThe permanent microporosity of 1' was demonstrated by a type-I CO2 sorption isotherm at 195 K following activation at 110 \u00b0C under dynamic vacuum (10-6 mbar overnight) (Figure a). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area over the relative pressure range p/p\u00b0 = 0.02-0.22 was found to be 523(8) m2/g (), and Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) analysis gave a pore volume of 0.314 cm3/g (), which is in excellent agreement with the value of 0.329 cm3/g calculated from the simulated structure of 1'. This is significantly larger than the pore volume derived from the static structure of 1 after removal of the coordinated H2O molecules (0.274 cm3/g), further supporting the tetrahedrally coordinated Zn-based structure of 1' derived from the experimental/modeling approach outlined above. Framework 1' was also found to be porous to CO2 and CH4 at 273 and 298 K at 5 bar (). The isosteric heat of adsorption (Q st) of 1' for CO2 was found to be 21.0 kJ/mol at zero coverage, with an increase to 24.8 kJ/mol at high CO2 loading (). The slight increase in the strength of the interactions between 1' and CO2 may occur because the specific pore size of the framework results in interactions with the tetrahedrally coordinated Zn atoms. The Q st of 1' for CH4 was found to be 20.3 kJ/mol at zero coverage, with a slight decrease to 18.4 kJ/mol at high loadings ().

Each ligand is coordinated to eight independent Zn atoms in syn,syn mode, and all of the benzoate fragments (colored in sky blue) are equivalent. (b) Three unconnected adjacent paddlewheel units in neighboring layers in 1 (the different shades of blue distinguish the three different layers). (c) Illustration of the TBAPy ligand within 1'. Each ligand is coordinated to eight Zn ions, as in 1. However, two of the carboxylates of the TBAPy ligand (colored in green) bind to two Zn ions within the same Zn2 unit (originating from paddlewheel units in 1), while the other two (colored in orange) link two Zn ions from neighboring Zn2 units in neighboring layers, giving rise to 1D Zn-O chains. (d) Local environment of the Zn ions in 1'. The two specific carboxylate modes are colored in green/pale green and orange/pale yellow. The orientation of the TBAPy ligands around the Zn ions gives rise to a 3D network with 1D Zn-O chains connecting the 2D layers in 1. (e-h) Rotation of the pyrene cores about axes perpendicular to the plane of the page in 1 (e, g) to afford the structure of 1' (f, h), in which the rotation causes doubling of the b axis. In (e) and (g), the view is of two successive unit cells along the positive b axis of 1, while for clarity, (f) and (h) show the top and bottom halves viewed along the negative b axis of the unit cell of 1' respectively. The benzoates at one end of each ligand remain anchored to the coordinated zinc ions shown in yellow (in this view, only one of two benzoates at the anchored end of the ligand is visible, as they are superimposed on each other) while the plane of the pyrene rotates (counterclockwise in these views); in the top half of the cell (e), the ligands are anchored to the Zn ions on the right of the unit cell, while for the bottom half of the cell (g), they are anchored on the left of the unit cell. An example of a rotating ligand is shaded green in each case, with the anchoring Zn ions shown in yellow. This Zn cation remains coordinated to the carboxylate, which upon rotation bridges to the purple Zn cation from the layer below. The nonanchored end of the ligand does not remain bound to any of the cations to which it is bound in 1. Instead, it coordinates to a Zn ion in the Zn pair from an adjacent layer. The loss of translational symmetry caused by the two sets of rotating ligands results in the doubling of the unit cell perpendicular to the page.
