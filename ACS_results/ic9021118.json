This second approach requires the synthesis of a diazabutadiene (DAB) intermediate from 2 equiv of an aniline and an \u03b1-dicarbonyl such as glyoxal, before cyclization of DAB with formaldehyde. In the synthesis of the imidazolium compounds reported here, we opted for the latter method, Scheme . Thus, the reaction of the isomeric cyanoanilines (1 and 2) with glyoxal and paraformaldehyde yielded 3 and 4 in good yield (75%) for both compounds. These could be isolated as either their chloride (as synthesized, 3, and 4) or hexafluorophosphate salts. Conversion to the dicarboxylic acid derivatives 5 and 6 was achieved by treatment of dinitriles 3 and 4 with hydrobromic acid. Other acids such as sulfuric acid were ineffective in this conversion. The synthesis of 5 and 6 could also be carried out in excellent yield in a one-pot, two-stage reaction without isolating the dinitrile compounds. A closely related imidazolium dicarboxylate ligand was recently synthesized from 1,3-bis(4-iodophenyl)imidazolium chloride by a palladium-catalyzed reaction with carbon monoxide in methanol.
