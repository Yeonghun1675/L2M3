The anhydrous salt (manganese(II) butyrate) remains stable in the second and following heatings, up to a temperature of around 500 K, where it starts to decompose. This decomposition finishes at around 650 K, producing a residue of MnO, as assessed by TGA.\n\nMagnetic Properties\n\nComplex 1 \n\nThe thermal dependence of the \u03c7M T product for compound 1 [\u03c7M being the susceptibility per six manganese(II) ions for 1] is shown in Figure A. The \u03c7M T value at room temperature is ca. 24.31 cm3\u22c5mol-1\u22c5K corresponding to an effective magnetic moment per Mn(II) ion \u03c7eff = [(8 \u03c7M T)1/2] of 5.69 \u03bcB/Mn(II), which is consistent with the value of 5.92 \u03bcB/Mn(II) expected for a magnetically isolated high-spin Mn(II) (S = 5/2) ion with g = 2.00. Upon cooling \u03c7M T continuously decreases reaching a value of 3.45 cm3\u22c5mol-1\u22c5K at 2K. The decrease of \u03c7M T is indicative of a small antiferromagnetic interaction. No maximum in the susceptibility curve was observed. The magnetization curve measured at 2 K, which is shown in , exhibits a linear behavior, in all the range of applied magnetic field, which is in agreement with the antiferromagnetic response of this compound at low temperature. As previously said, the possibility of long-range antiferromagnetic order was tested involving neutron diffraction techniques, but there was not signal of magnetic phase transition above 1.5 K (see ).\n\nComplex 2 \n\nThe magnetic behavior of [Mn5(but)10(H2O)2] n  is shown in Figure B in the form of \u03c7M T versus T plot (\u03c7M is the magnetic susceptibility per five Mn(II) ions). This curve shows that at room temperature the \u03c7M T value (20.59 cm3 mol-1K) corresponds to an effective magnetic moment per Mn(II) ion \u03c7eff [=(8\u03c7M T)1/2] of 5.74 \u03bcB/Mn(II), consistent with the value expected for a magnetically isolated high-spin Mn(II) (S = 5/2) ion with g = 2.00. When the temperature decreases the \u03c7M T values decrease; a minimum (4.99 cm3 mol-1K) is observed at 7.0 K. Below this minimum, \u03c7M T rapidly increases and reaches a very high value of 73.70 cm3 mol-1K at 2 K for an external applied field of 250 Oe. The maximum value of \u03c7M T under an external magnetic field of 1000 Oe, is 26.75 cm3 mol-1K at 2 K, lower than the observed for an external magnetic field of 250 Oe (see inset Figure b). The difference is due to the competition at low temperatures between ferromagnetic interactions dominating at low fields and the antiferromagnetic ones present at higher fields. This effect is clearly depicted in the M vs H plot where at 1000 Oe the curve is far from the region of linearity, where \u03c7M is independent of H and the relation M = \u03c7M H stands ( of the ). The sudden increase of \u03c7M T value at 7.0 K indicates ferrimagnetic type behavior, due to the noncancellation of homometallic spins. On the basis of the crystal structure, the non-complete compensation of the antiferromagnetic coupling should produce a long-range ferromagnetic order. This option was studied through the dependence of the ac magnetic susceptibility, but no maximum was observed in the out-of-phase (\u03c7\") signal for temperature above 2 K.", "data": [[[{"meta":
