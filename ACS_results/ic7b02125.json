The two-electron oxidized form of the Cu complex is suggested to be the catalytically active species for water oxidation. Although the onset overpotential for water oxidation was moderate, it is valuable to shed light on the potential role of the Cu-bound carbonate group during catalytic OER. With computational evidence, this carbonate group may act as an intramolecular base to assist the removal of protons for water activation, including steps toward the catalytically active species and its subsequent O-O bond formation.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 37, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information is available free of\ncharge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications\nwebsite</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b02125\">10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b02125</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Figures S1\u2013S21;\nTables S1 and S2; Cartesian coordinates of the DFT-optimized structures\n(<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b02125/suppl_file/ic7b02125_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b02125.
