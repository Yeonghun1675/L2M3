Since the Cu ion electronic state and geometry are crucial to the hybrid structure, and their catalytic and optical properties,  the oxidation state of the Cu centers were further analyzed through XANES measurements. The XANES spectra obtained at the Cu edge for Comp1 and Comp2 (c,d) clearly indicate the existence of +1 oxidation state of Cu as evident from the shoulder peak corresponding to the 1s \u2192 4p z  transition. Thus, from the combined magnetic, XPS, and XANES studies we could clearly identify the oxidation states of the metal ions in both the hybrid POMOFs, and the general magnetic properties of the compounds were elucidated.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 16, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig2\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Spectroscopic analyses of <bold>Comp1</bold> &amp; <bold>Comp2</bold>: (a) XPS spectra of Mo energy of Comp1, (b) XPS spectra\nat Cu energy of <bold>Comp1</bold>, XANES spectra at Cu edge of (c) <bold>Comp1</bold> and (d) <bold>Comp2</bold>.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr2\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2018-01631g_0002.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 2  Spectroscopic analyses of Comp1 & Comp2: (a) XPS spectra of Mo energy of Comp1, (b) XPS spectra at Cu energy of Comp1, XANES spectra at Cu edge of (c) Comp1 and (d) Comp2.

If two parallel 1D Cu-bp chains are considered, it can be observed that each alternate Cu center has a coordinating lone 4,4'-bp perpendicular to the direction of the 1D chain, which projects out between the chains ( and S6).
