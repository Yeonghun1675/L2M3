In contrast, the C3H6 adsorption capacity of ELM-12 is relatively low (0.67 mmol/g at 0.1 bar and 298 K) with a far smaller Q st of 15.8 kJ/mol, which implies much weaker host-guest interaction compared with C3H4. These results suggest that high C3H4/C3H6 selectivity of ELM-12 for C3H6 purification is quite likely, breaking the stereotype that flexible porous materials are inferior for gas separation.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "ELM-12", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "porosity": [{"probe": "", "value": "20.5", "unit": "%", "condition": "void fraction"}], "pore volume": [{"probe": "", "value": "0.141", "unit": "cm3/g", "condition": ""}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "C3H4", "adsorbed amount": "1.83", "unit": "mmol/g", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "0.01 bar", "condition": "guest-free ELM-12"}, {"adsorbate": "C3H4", "adsorbed amount": "2.37", "unit": "mmol/g", "temperature": "273 K", "pressure": "0.01 bar", "condition": "guest-free ELM-12"}, {"adsorbate": "C3H4", "adsorbed amount": "2.55", "unit": "mmol/g", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "0.1 bar", "condition": "guest-free ELM-12"}, {"adsorbate": "C3H6", "adsorbed amount": "0.67", "unit": "mmol/g", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "0.1 bar", "condition": "guest-free ELM-12"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["porosity", "pore_volume", "gas_adsorption"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['porosity', 'pore_volume', 'gas_adsorption']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"ELM-12\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"porosity\": [\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"20.5\",\n                \"unit\": \"%\",\n                \"condition\": \"void fraction\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"pore volume\": [\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"0.141\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"C3H4\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"1.83\",\n                \"unit\": \"mmol/g\",\n                \"temperature\": \"298 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"0.01 bar\",\n                \"condition\": \"guest-free ELM-12\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"C3H4\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"2.37\",\n                \"unit\": \"mmol/g\",\n                \"temperature\": \"273 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"0.01 bar\",\n                \"condition\": \"guest-free ELM-12\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"C3H4\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"2.55\",\n                \"unit\": \"mmol/g\",\n                \"temperature\": \"298 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"0.1 bar\",\n                \"condition\": \"guest-free ELM-12\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"C3H6\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"0.67\",\n                \"unit\": \"mmol/g\",\n                \"temperature\": \"298 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"0.1 bar\",\n                \"condition\": \"guest-free ELM-12\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 3, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Schematic Illustration\nof the Representative Adsorption Isotherms\nof (a) Flexible, (b) Flexible\u2013Robust, and (c) Robust MOFs</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ja-2017-04268p_0003.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Schematic Illustration of the Representative Adsorption Isotherms of (a) Flexible, (b) Flexible-Robust, and (c) Robust MOFs   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 6, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a, b) Schematic diagrams\nof the two types of cavities (I and II)\nin ELM-12 (Cu, green; C, gray; O, red; S, yellow; F, light green).\n(c, d) Neutron diffraction crystal structure of <bold>ELM-12\u2283C</bold>\n<sub>\n<bold>3</bold>\n</sub>\n<bold>D</bold>\n<sub>\n<bold>4</bold>\n</sub> showing\nthe preferential binding sites for C<sub>3</sub>D<sub>4</sub> molecules\n(sites I and II) and their close contacts with the framework.
