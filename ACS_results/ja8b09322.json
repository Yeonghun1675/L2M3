Below this temperature it decreases and reaches 5.94 cm3\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1 at 1.8 K. The decrease is attributed to the weak antiferromagnetic interactions between the MnII centers (S Mn = 5/2) through MnII-NC-WIV-CN-MnII linkages (, green points). The paramagnetic behavior without any signs of magnetic anisotropy is also confirmed by the field dependence of the magnetization at 1.8 K (, green points) and the successful simultaneous fitting of both \u03c7T(T) and M(H) using the following Hamiltonian (PHI software):     H\u0302 = - 2   J   Mn - L - Mn   \u22c5   S   Mn   \u22c5   S   Mn   +   \u03bc   B   \u22c5   g   Mn   \u22c5   S   Mn   \u22c5 B +   \u03bc   B   \u22c5   g   Mn   \u22c5   S   Mn   \u22c5 B   1 with the best fit parameters g Mn = 2.02(5) and J MnMn = -0.07(1) cm-1 (assuming local MnII\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5MnII antiferromagnetic interactions only). The anhydrous phase 1 shows basically the same \u03c7T value as 1-8H2O (8.79 cm3 K mol-1) at room temperature as compared to the expected 8.75 cm3 K mol-1 for two isotropic MnII ions. However, the \u03c7T(T) exhibits a much stronger decrease than 1-8H2O, starting already at 90 K and reaching 2.60 cm3 K mol-1 at 1.8 K (, red points). The M(H) dependence recorded at T = 2.0 K attains the maximum value of 9.5 N\u03b2 at 7 T, approaching the saturation of 10 N\u03b2 expected for two isotropic MnII ions (, red points). Simultaneous fitting of both \u03c7T(T) and M(H) (PHI software) using  reproduces well the former, but fails for the latter due to larger magnetic anisotropy that is not taken into account in the fitting (with the best fit parameters g Mn = 2.02(5) and J MnMn = -0.12(5) cm-1). All these observations suggest that 1 is paramagnetic but cannot be considered a magnetically isotropic system. Noteworthy, the magnetic properties of 1reh (after the first and the second rehydration cycle) are identical to those of the pristine compound 1-8H2O (Figures S7b and S8b, green points). There is also basically no difference between the first and the second dehydration cycle (Figures S7b and S8b, orange and red points), which confirms the \"magnetic robustness\" of 1-8H2O against repeated dehydration/rehydration.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 10, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<title>Photomagnetic Studies</title><p>Solid state electronic spectra\nof <bold>1</bold>-<bold>8H<sub>2</sub>O</bold>, <bold>1</bold>, and <bold>1reh</bold> are shown in .
