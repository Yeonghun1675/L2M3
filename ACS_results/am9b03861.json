In the homogeneous system consisting of H2L, [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2\u22c56H2O, and TEOA, almost the same yield as that in entry 4 showed the insertion of ligand. Then, the physical mixture of Zn  4  -\u03b5-keggin and H2L was used to replace NNU-29 (entry 7). The result showed an obvious but weaker activity than that of NNU-29, revealing that the fluorine-containing network of NNU-29 promoted the effect on CO2 conversion. The participation of CO2 in the reaction was also studied by replacing CO2 with Ar (entry 8). There is no carbonaceous substance detected, which indicates that the HCOO- was transformed from CO2. Furthermore, an isotopic 13CO2 experiment was carried out. The production of HCOO- was analyzed by 13C NMR spectroscopy. As shown in d, when using 12CO2 as a carbon source, the peaks corresponding to TEOA and deuterium-dimethyl sulfoxide were easily found in the 13C NMR spectrum from the filtrate after reaction. In the range from 158 to 166 ppm, two weak peaks at 158.2 and 159.9 could be due to HCO3 - and CO3 2-, respectively, for the large solubility of CO2 and the alkaline environment due to the existence of TEOA to form these ions. When 13CO2 was employed in the reaction system, a new and obvious peak appeared at 163.9 ppm, which corresponds to the HCOO- ion, which strongly indicates that the produced HCOO- indeed transformed from CO2. Overall, these results have demonstrated the main role of NNU-29 acting as a CO2 redox promoter in the photocatalytic reduction system. For comparison, we have listed the performance of a series of other metal-organic compounds as the photocatalysts for CO2-to-HCOOH conversion in the Supporting Information (Table S6).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 20, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Upon analyzing the experimental facts and theoretical calculation\n(<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.9b03861/suppl_file/am9b03861_si_002.pdf\">Figure S21</ext-link>), a speculative reaction mechanism\nin regard to photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub>-to-HCOOH reduction over <bold>NNU-29</bold> was proposed ().
