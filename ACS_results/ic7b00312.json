For example, relatively acidic conditions only promote the formation of compound 1 with a 2D network structure, not a polycatenated framework, even in the presence of BPP. Similarly, a recently reported uranyl terephthalate compound with a noncoordinated 2,4,6-tris(2-pyridyl)striazine organic base did not form a polycatenated framework because of a lack of 2D networks as basic building blocks. Therefore, it can be concluded that the template and cavity-filling effects of organic bases (such as BPP or BPY) in combination with the specific hydrothermal conditions promote the formaion of uranyl terephthalate polycatenated frameworks.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 36, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<title>Fluorescence Properties</title><p>The fluorescence of the uranyl\ncation features five or six vibronic peaks in the range of 450\u2013650\nnm, which arise from electronic transitions between the lowest unoccupied\nmolecular orbital (LUMO) 5f nonbonding uranyl orbitals and the highest\noccupied molecular orbital (HOMO) U\u2013O hybrid \u03c3-bonding\norbital, referred to as U\ue5fbO axial ligand-to-metal charge-transfer\nbands.

The autoclave was sealed, heated to 180 \u00b0C in an oven for 3 days, and then cooled to ambient temperature. The final pH of the aqueous solution was 7.00. A mixture of small yellow crystals of compound 2 and brown crystals of compound 3, accompanied by unidentified microcrystals or powder, were produced; the compounds of interest were filtered off,
