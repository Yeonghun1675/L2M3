PXRD measurements revealed that the final residues mainly are SrB2O4 and partial SrO (see Figure S5 in the ), which accounted for a total weight of 42.5%. The differential thermal analysis (DTA) curve of SCB is consistent with the above deductions. The sharp endothermic peak at 144 \u00b0C is due to the loss of four H2O molecules. The sharp exothermic peaks observed at 439 and 751.5 \u00b0C could be attributed to combustion of the organic unit and the phase transition of the residual oxides, respectively.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "(NH4)\u22c5Sr[l-(+)-C4H2O6\u22c5B(OH)2]\u22c54H2O", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "(NH4)\u22c5Sr[l-(+)-C4H2O6\u22c5B(OH)2]\u22c54H2O"}, "crystal system": [{"value": "triclinic", "condition": ""}], "space group": [{"value": "P1", "condition": ""}], "lattice parameters": [{"value": {"a": "6.4633", "b": "7.0452", "c": "7.0745", "alpha": "85.351", "beta": "77.678", "gamma": "73.276"}, "condition": ""}], "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "100", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "stable", "condition": ""}, {"value": "100 to 150", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "release of the four molecules of H2O", "condition": ""}, {"value": "150 to 220", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "loss of a NH4 + anion", "condition": ""}, {"value": "220 to 690", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "complete loss of water and decomposition of the tartrate", "condition": ""}, {"value": "690 to 900", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "gradual volatilization of boron oxide from SrB4O7", "condition": ""}]}]]], "include_properties": ["crystal_system", "space_group", "lattice_parameters", "decomposition_temperature"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['crystal_system', 'space_group', 'lattice_parameters', 'decomposition_temperature']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"(NH4)\u22c5Sr[l-(+)-C4H2O6\u22c5B(OH)2]\u22c54H2O\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"(NH4)\u22c5Sr[l-(+)-C4H2O6\u22c5B(OH)2]\u22c54H2O\"\n        },\n        \"crystal system\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"triclinic\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"space group\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"P1\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"lattice parameters\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": {\n                    \"a\": \"6.4633\",\n                    \"b\": \"7.0452\",\n                    \"c\": \"7.0745\",\n                    \"alpha\": \"85.351\",\n                    \"beta\": \"77.678\",\n                    \"gamma\": \"73.276\"\n                },\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"decomposition temperature\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"100\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"stable\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"100 to 150\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"release of the four molecules of H2O\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"150 to 220\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"loss of a NH4 + anion\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"220 to 690\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"complete loss of water and decomposition of the tartrate\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"690 to 900\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"gradual volatilization of boron oxide from SrB4O7\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 16, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Fundamental building unit of SCB.
