As shown in Figure , upon cooling, \u03c7m T decreases slowly from 3.09 cm3 mol-1 K at 300 K to a minimum of 2.02 cm3 mol-1 K at 32 K, and then abruptly increases about 10 times at 10 K, after that it drops till 2 K. The Curie-Weiss fitting of \u03c7m -1 data above 80 K provides C = 3.55 cm3 mol-1 K and \u03b8 = -45.4 K, slightly higher than the reported 3.07 cm3 mol-1 K and -22.7 K for 1. These differences might come from the orientation of the sample during the measurements. Nevertheless, these results indicate strong AF coupling through the EE azido and the strong spin-orbital coupling of the 4Tg state, consistent with the observed AF coupling in other Co2+-N3 - compounds. The sharp peak at 10 K suggests the presence of spontaneous magnetization, which was further confirmed by the magnetization measurement at 2 K (inset of Figure ). M increases quickly at very low field, reaching 0.66 \u00b5B at 400 Oe, and then increases slowly to 1.12 \u00b5B at 50 kOe, much less than the common value of 2-3 \u00b5B for a Co2+ center (at 2 K, the effective spin is S = 1/2 with a common value of g about 4.3). Furthermore, a square hysteresis loop at 2 K and sharp peaks in both the in- and out-of-phase signals of the zero-field ac susceptibility, can also be observed and will be presented below together with the results on the single crystal of 1.
