These trinuclear clusters are further connected with the ligand to construct a 3D framework (Figure b). JLU-Liu3 displays two types of helical chains with opposite helical directions along the [001] direction (left-handed and right-handed) (), which are composed of vertex-sharing 4-rings propagating along the c axial direction.

Upon further heating, a weight loss of 50% between 280 and 350 \u00b0C occurs due to the collapse of the framework (calcd: 52%).

Prior to the sorption studies, the surface area of the activated sample was calculated using the N2 adsorption at 77 K (Figure ).

These two compounds showed very little N2 adsorption at low pressure, and an abrupt increase was observed as the specific gate-opening pressure reached nearly 0.41 and 0.26 atm, which was followed by a quick increase to a maximum uptake of 325 cm3 g-1 and 306 cm3 g-1 at 1 atm. Although the structural transformation could not be proved by the single-crystal X-ray diffraction data, the adsorption behaviors confirmed the reversible framework flexibility of the two compounds: these two sorts of MOFs appeared to be the \"closed\" form after the removal of the guest molecules and underwent a structural transformation back to the \"opened\" form above the gate opening pressure. In addition, neither of the N2 desorption branches of the two samples traced their adsorption branch and formed large hysteresis loops.\n\nTo further investigate the porosity of JLU-Liu3 and JLU-Liu4, the CO2 adsorption/desorption was carried out, and the isotherms at 195 K also displayed an uncommon step and hysteretic desorption. What is more, the two steps curve of the CO2 adsorption isotherms was more obvious. In the first step, the CO2 adsorption amount of JLU-Liu3 was 40 cm3 g-1 at 196 Torr, and in the second step it reached up to 337 cm3 g-1 at 760 Torr. The CO2 adsorption amount of JLU-Liu4 was 68 cm3 g-1 at 118 Torr in the first step, and it reached up to 333 cm3 g-1 at 760 Torr in the second step (Figure b).
