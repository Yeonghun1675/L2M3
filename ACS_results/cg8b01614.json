Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicates an obvious weight loss (7.71%) ranging from 70 to 150 \u00b0C, corresponding to the loss of two lattice water molecules per formula unit (calc. 7.76%) (Figure S7). As shown in  and Figure S6, the peaks at (1\u0305 1 0), (1 1\u0305 1), (0 1 1), (1\u0305 1 1), and (0 1\u0305 2) in the PXRD diagram are observed to gradually shift to a high degree region after dehydration, indicating crystal lattice shrinkage during the removal of water molecules. As the shift of the peak (0 1\u0305 2) proves the shortening of the interlayer spacing (Figure S8), the dehydration leads to more close packing of the D-A units located in adjacent layers. Furthermore, the peaks at (1\u0305 1\u0305 1), (1\u0305 0 1), (1 1 0), and (1\u0305 1 2) shifting to the low degree region after dehydration correspond to the sliding of adjacent layers. These structural changes favor suitable geometry and distance between the D-A units, that cause more fast photoreponsive features after dehydration. In addition, the rearrangement of the packing networks may increase exposure of the N atoms in the viologen rings, which facilitates the contact between radical and oxygen, and thus it increases the decoloration rate of the reverse reaction.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 10, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig3\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Selected\nPXRD patterns of samples calcined at different temperatures\nand being treated by water vapor.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr3\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cg-2018-01614x_0003.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 3  Selected PXRD patterns of samples calcined at different temperatures and being treated by water vapor.
