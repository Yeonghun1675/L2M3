The asymmetric unit contains three crystallographically independent CdII centers, two DBPT3- ligands (DBPT-1 and DBPT-2), four coordinated water molecules (O13, O14, O15, and O16), and five lattice water molecules, as shown in . The CdII centers display three different coordination surroundings in which Cd2 is coordinated with five oxygen atoms (O2, O4#3, O7#1, O10#4, O11) from five DBPT3- ligands, exhibiting a distorted trigonal bipyramid coordination geometry. Cd1 and Cd3 are six-coordinated with a distorted octahedral coordination geometry (a). Cd1 is coordinated by three oxygen atoms (O1#1, O8, O10#2) from three DBPT3- ligands and three oxygen atoms from three terminal water molecules (O14, O15, O16). Cd3 is coordinated by five oxygen atoms (O3#5, O3#6, O4#5, O6, O8#7) from four DBPT3- ligands and one oxygen atom from terminal water molecule of O13. The Cd-O distances are in the range of 2.189(2)-2.498(2) \u00c5. The O-Cd-O bond angles are in the range of 54.75(8)-174.30(10)\u00b0. Both DBPT-1 and DBPT-2 bridge to six CdII centers, exhibiting two kinds of coordination modes of mode I and mode II, respectively (, ). In DBPT-1, three carboxylic groups act as \u03bc1-\u03b71: \u03b70, \u03bc2-\u03b71: \u03b71 and \u03bc3-\u03b72:\u03b72 mode, respectively. In DBPT-2, three carboxylic groups act as \u03bc1-\u03b70: \u03b71, \u03bc3-\u03b71: \u03b72 and \u03bc2-\u03b70: \u03b72 mode, respectively. Four octahedra and two trigonal bipyramids share edges and corner through eight \u03bc3-O and four \u03bc2-O, respectively, forming a hexanuclear {Cd6} cluster by the virtue of eight carboxylate groups from eight DBPT ligands (b). Each {Cd6} cluster acts as basic building block, which is further linked by 12 DBPT ligands to form a three-dimensional (3D) open framework (c-d). The framework of 1 exhibits porosity in the ab plane with ca. 12 \u00c5 \u00d7 4 \u00c5 dimension, which are occupied by lattice water molecules. The solvent-accessible void factions calculated using PLATON is ~14.4% (280.7 \u00c53), of the total crystal volume of 1944.5(14) \u00c53. The accessible special surface area, which is calculated by Material Studio 5.5 software, can reach 824.3 m2 g-1 for 1. However, the activation for 1 failed, and the N2 sorption experiment for 1 gave no result for the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area, which is probably due to the partial loss of the long-range orderly structure under activation, and the weak affinity of the framework toward N2.\n\nThermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were conducted to determine the thermal stability of 1 at N2 and air atmospheres, respectively. As shown in b, the results indicate that 1 may completely release its coordinated and free solvent molecules until to 300 \u00b0C (ca. 13.0%, cal.; ca. 13.5%, exp.) in N2 atmosphere. The temperature-variable PXRD studies were performed for the as-synthesized 1 and the samples which have been pretreated at 250, 300, 330, 360, 400, 430, and 460 \u00b0C, respectively, in air atmosphere (c). The narrow diffraction peaks obtained at 300 \u00b0C indicate the good crystallinity of the desolvated sample (1a). The desolvation process does not cause the changes in peak position but causes minor changes in peak intensities. As revealed from the TGA curves, the desolvated 1a is thermally stable up to ca. 430 \u00b0C at N2 and ca. 400 \u00b0C at air atmosphere. During the heating process from 300 to 330 \u00b0C, the diffraction peak at 2\u03b8 = 6.2\u00b0 disappeared, and the diffraction peaks at 2\u03b8 = 9.6, 10.9, and 11.2\u00b0 appeared, which indicates a new phase happened. The new generated phase maintains the structural integrity as high as 400 \u00b0C. For the pattern obtained at 430 \u00b0C, two diffraction peaks at 2\u03b8 = 33.0, and 38.2\u00b0, corresponding to the (111) and (200), respectively, of the CdO phase, appeared, which indicates the collapse of the framework. The temperature-variable PXRD analyses in combination with the TGA results confirmed that 1 also has ultrahigh thermal stability.\n\nFluorescent Properties\n\nSensing of Solvent Molecules\n\nThe solid-state PL spectra of compound 1 and free H3DBPT ligand were investigated at ambient temperature.

On the basis of the similarity in the luminescence spectra between the free ligand and the constructed compound, we assigned the PL of 1 to ligand-centered electronic excitations. Moreover, blue shift of the emission peak was observed in compound 1, which is probably due to the increase of the conformational rigidity of the ligand, and reduction of nonradioactive decay because
