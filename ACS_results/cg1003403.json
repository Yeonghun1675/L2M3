For compound 1, it shows the first mass loss of 1.41% below 143 \u00b0C that can be attributed to the removal of water molecules (calcd 1.50%). Upon further heating, a two-step weight loss was observed: an initial weight loss of 24.24% from 143 to 330 \u00b0C that can be associated with the release of DMF molecules. The second weight loss occurs between 330 and 600 \u00b0C (50.02%) and is attributed to partial organic ligand decomposition (calcd 57.78%). The final release at 800 \u00b0C of 20.95% is attributed to the formation of ZnO as confirmed by XRD analysis. Compounds 2-3 show similar thermal behaviors.
