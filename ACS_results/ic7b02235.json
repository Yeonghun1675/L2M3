Thus, the photoluminescence properties of Zn-1, Zn-1', Cu-1, and Cu-1' were examined in the solid state at room temperature (). The photoluminescence properties of free ligand H3L were reported to show a maximum emission at 423 nm upon excitation at 346 nm. Compared with luminescence of the free H3L ligand, Zn-1, Zn-1', and Cu-1' have obvious red shifts and intense emissions at ca. 470 nm for Zn-1, 460 nm for Zn-1', and 437 nm for Cu-1'. The dissimilarity of the emission of Zn-1, Zn-1', and Cu-1' may be ascribed to the difference coordination of L3- to ZnII in the complexes. It should be pointed out that Cu-1 has almost no emission; however, the copper(II) and zinc(II) hybrid framework Cu-1' has intense emission. This result shows that the postsynthesis method can be used to make complexes with improved fluorescence.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "Zn-1", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition
