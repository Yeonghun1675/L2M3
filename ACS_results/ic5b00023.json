Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicates that 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system, space group I2/m. The asymmetric unit contains one crystallographically independent Zn2+ ion, half of L molecule mirrored symmetrically along the center line of the benzene ring, and three-quarters of PMC4- ligands (see ). Each Zn2+ ion is tetrahedrally coordinated by three carboxylate O atoms from three PMC4- ligands in a monodentate fashion and one N atom from an L ligand. Then two Zn2+ ions are bridged by three PMC4- ligands by a pair of carboxyl (COO-) groups in the ortho-position to form a dimer. Consequently, each PMC4- ligand links four Zn2+ ions of two dimers through four COO- groups. Thus, the dimer can be regarded as a three-way node to be connected to three neighboring dimers to form an anionic honeycomb-like 2D (6,3) network that contains large edge-sharing planar hexagonal rings with the dimers acting as corners and the PMC4- ligands as edges. On and beneath the planar hexagonal ring, each flexible L ligand adopting cis configurations is linked to two Zn atoms from two different neighboring dimers (Figure a), which neutralizes the (6,3) network and gives rise to a concavo-convex layer with 1D trapezia-shaped channels parallel to the (6,3) network. The adjacent layers are stacked in an AB sequence along the [101] direction in a non-interpenetrating mode (see ), and the L ligands are inserted into the hexagonal rings. Consequently, the large 1D hexagonal channel with a pore size of 16.84 \u00c5 \u00d7 16.84 \u00c5 (the distances have been measured between the carboxyl O atoms located on the diagonal) along the c-axis was formed as described in Figure b. Calculations using the PLATON program show that the total solvent accessible volume is ~27.6% after removing all H2O molecules. The N2 sorption at 77 K revealed a Type-I sorption behavior (Figure ) with small hysteresis. The N2 uptake around 1 atm is ~117 cm3 g-1, with BET and Langmuir surface areas of 367.1 m2 g-1 and 509.0 m2 g-1, respectively. It is interesting to note that the isotherm shows an abrupt increase at point P/P 0 = 0.02, indicating that structural transformation is probably involved during the nitrogen adsorption process.
