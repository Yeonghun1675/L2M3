The DMF molecule depicted in Figure  (left) as bound to Zn1 brings the total to Zn4Si3C81H54NO17. One disordered solvent position is shared by one full DMF and one full water molecule, contributing C3NO2 and bringing the total to Zn4Si3C84H54N2O19. Another disordered solvent position is shared by one benzene and one DMF molecule, each with half-occupancy [1/2(C3NO + C6) = C4.5N0.5O0.5], for a grand total of Zn4Si3C88.5H54N2.5O19.5, which was calculated and reported (per four Zn atoms).\n\nCrystal Structure of 6-Zn \n\nMolecular Formula\n\nHydrogen atoms of the bound hydroxide ions and water molecules were not included. Based on a cluster of four Zn atoms, there are six organic portions, each shared by three tetrazinc clusters. Each organic molecule contributes SiC27H17O6.

To these are added four water molecules and two hydroxide ions without hydrogens, to give Zn4Si2C54H34O18. This formula corresponds to the calculated formula of molecular weight 1288.5. Refinements were carried out on this unit by squeezing out 2.5 DMF molecules of solvation. The DMF atoms, (C3H7NO)2.5, then were reinstated after refinement to give the reported formula of Zn4Si2C61.5H51.5N2.5O20.5, with the reported molecular weight of 1471 (per four Zn atoms).\n\nThermogravimetric Analysis\n\nSamples of 2-Cd, 3-Zn, and 6-Zn were dried at room temperature for 3 days under vacuum (10 Torr). Samples of 4-Zn and 5-Zn were dried at room temperature for 24 h under vacuum (0.1 Torr). The crystalline materials became white powders, which were subjected to TGA under ambient atmosphere.
