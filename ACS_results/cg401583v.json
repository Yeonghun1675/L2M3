Preliminary orientation matrix and cell parameters were determined from three sets of \u03c9/\u03d5 scans at different starting angles. Data frames were obtained at scan intervals of 0.5\u00b0 with an exposure time of 10 s per frame. The reflection data were corrected for Lorentz and polarization factors. Absorption corrections were carried out using SADABS. The structures of 1-3 were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares analysis using anisotropic thermal parameters for non-hydrogen atoms with the SHELXTL program. Guest molecules in 1 and 2 are significantly disordered and could not be modeled properly; thus, the program SQUEEZE, a part of the PLATON package of crystallographic software, was used to calculate the solvent disorder area and remove its contribution to the overall intensity data. For 1, the Zn atoms were disordered over two sites (0.71:0.29) for Zn1A and Zn1B, respectively, by using PART. Anisotropic displacement parameters of the disordered Zn atoms were restrained by SIMU. All hydrogen atoms except for hydrogens bound to water oxygens were calculated at idealized positions and refined with the riding models.

Preliminary orientation matrix and cell parameters were determined from three sets of \u03c9/\u03d5 scans at different starting angles. Data frames were obtained at scan intervals of 0.5\u00b0 with an exposure time of 10 s per frame. The reflection data were corrected for Lorentz and polarization factors. Absorption corrections were carried out using SADABS. The structures of 1-3 were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares analysis using anisotropic thermal parameters for non-hydrogen atoms with the SHELXTL program. Guest molecules in 1 and 2 are significantly disordered and could not be modeled properly; thus, the program SQUEEZE, a part of the PLATON package of crystallographic software, was used to calculate the solvent disorder area and remove its contribution to the overall intensity data. For 1, the Zn atoms were disordered over two sites (0.71:0.29) for Zn1A and Zn1B, respectively, by using PART. Anisotropic displacement parameters of the disordered Zn atoms were restrained by SIMU.

The obtained pore volume is much smaller than that (0.604 cm3/g) calculated from X-ray data, which is due to the reduced volume of the activated phase of 1a after the lattice solvents were eliminated. The desolvated 1a also adsorbs H2, and the maximum uptake amounts to 62 cm3/g at 1 atm and 77 K ().
