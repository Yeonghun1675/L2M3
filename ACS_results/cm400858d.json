This value is more consistent with that of the parent MnMnBTT structure, 19.009(1) \u00c5, than with the all iron analogue, FeFeBTT, which has a cell parameter of 18.824(1) \u00c5. The small difference between the unit cell dimensions of FeMnBTT and MnMnBTT suggests that Fe2+ exchanged minimally into the intraframework C 4v  site after soaking for 7 days because the unit cell dimensions of MMnBTT are sensitive to changes in the metal-nitrogen bonds of the C 4v  site, not changes in the C  s  site. In contrast, CuMnBTT and ZnMnBTT prepared by week-long soaks showed unit cell parameters of 18.4852(5) \u00c5 and 18.8285(4) \u00c5, respectively. The former value is closer to that of all-copper CuCuBTT, 18.595(7) \u00c5, which indicates the significant incorporation of Cu2+ at the C 4v  sites, as had been previously proposed on the basis of elemental analysis.
