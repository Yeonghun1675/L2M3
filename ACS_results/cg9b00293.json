TG measurements of compounds 1-Gd and 2-Gd were performed up to 800 \u00b0C with N2 as protective gas to assess the thermal stability of these lanthanide phosphonate CPs. As shown in Figure S5, the TG curves revealed that compound 1-Gd displays a 7.25% weight loss (calculated 7.05%) in 25-140 \u00b0C, in agreement with the loss of five free water molecules per formula. The main host can remain its stability to 315 \u00b0C and then begins to collapse with the loss of organic components. Compound 2-Gd displays a weight loss of 9.93% (calculated 9.85%) between 25 and 187 \u00b0C for all the water molecules.

After a slow decrease with lowering temperatures, the \u03c7T values sharply drop to the minimum value of 10.81 and 7.25 cm3 K mol-1 for the two compounds at 2 K. This phenomenon is mainly due to the depopulation of excited Stark levels of Gd3+ ions, or the antiferromagnetic magnetic interactions between intrachain Gd3+ centers.
