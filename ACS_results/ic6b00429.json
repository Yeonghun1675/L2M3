The solid framework maintains its blue fluorescence under compression up to 8 MPa. The blue fluorescence mainly comes from its ligand conformation and no-\u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0-interaction packing modes. Therefore, we have successfully demonstrated that MOF can restrict organic ligands into a specific conformation and packing modes to control their PL properties and protect them under high pressures.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 15, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting\nInformation is available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at\nDOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00429\">10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00429</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Single-crystal\ndata (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00429/suppl_file/ic6b00429_si_001.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Materials and instruments, synthetic methods,  spectroscopic data,\nand DFT calculations (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00429/suppl_file/ic6b00429_si_003.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00429.
