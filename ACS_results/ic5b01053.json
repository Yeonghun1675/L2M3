The solid ZrOCl2\u22c58H2O (1.2 g, 3.7 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of DMF (100 mL) and HCOOH (4 mL) under a 5 min sonication. The 4,4'-biphenyldicarboxylic acid (1 g, 4.1 mmol)) was added and the mixture was sonicated for an additional 5 min. The jar was then stored undisturbed for 24 h in a temperature-controlled oven preheated to 120 \u00b0C. At this point, a part of the supernatant solution was decanted, and the remaining resulting precipitate was separated by centrifugation, washed with DMF (4 \u00d7 50 mL). Each washing cycle consisted of adding the DMF, stirring (with spatula) to achieve a homogeneous suspension, allowing the mixture to repose for 30 min, and then isolating the precipitate by centrifugation. The same procedure was then repeated with acetone washes (5 \u00d7 50 mL). To remove solvents from pores, the material was evacuated for 12 h at room temperature, and then for 6 h at 120 \u00b0C (ramp = 1 \u00b0C/min). Yield: 0.95 g. See the  for product characterization.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nAcid Modulation for UiO-67\n\nDeparting from the recently published small-scale synthesis (~50 mg) of UiO-67 modulated by the formic acid, we began by identifying more practical conditions allowing for a 20-fold increase of the initial synthesis scale and 4-fold decrease in reaction time, while retaining material's high quality. Thus, a controlled solvothermal reaction of ZrOCl2 hydrate with H2bpdc in the presence of ~30 equiv of formic acid in DMF, followed by thorough washings and evacuation, affording ~1 g batches of the activated UiO-67. The powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD) pattern and the BET SA of the newly synthesized UiO-67 (2600 m2/g) match the literature data for the smaller-scale preparation, confirming the reproducibility and scalability of the method. At this point, the presence of the formic acid modulator in the final structure was confirmed by the characteristic formate 1H NMR resonance (8.1 ppm) in the acid-digested samples of the activated UiO-67. From the relative peak area, the material was formulated as Zr6O4(OH)4L5.6(form)0.8 (L = H2bpdc), i.e., with ~1 out of 12 linkers missing on each Zr6 node (entry 1 in ).", "data": [[{"meta": {"name":
