In 1972, Dubicki and Day studied and published the electronic spectrum of B, the absorption spectrum was measured at 4.2 and 295 K, and the conclusion was made that B loses its C3 axis at low temperature. A similar phenomenon was found with a copper(II) triangle. In this case, a Jahn-Teller distortion occurs, and at very low temperature, the unpaired electron orbital is found to localize on only one of the three nuclei of the Cu3-trimer, with concomitant loss of the 3-fold symmetry. These two examples found in the literature reinforce the idea that the breakdown on the magnetism curve can be due to the loss of the 3-fold rotation axis at low temperature.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 47, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig11\" position=\"float\">\n<label>12</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Magnetic measurement\nof complex <bold>4</bold>.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr13\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cg-2015-01084m_0007.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 12  Magnetic measurement of complex 4.
