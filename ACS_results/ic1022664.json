A current research interest in this field is modification to the surface of POMs with various organic and/or transition-metal complex moieties. These kinds of modified POM derivatives can be regarded as ideal molecular materials because they combine the properties of the POM and those of the metal or the organic ligands. So, the compounds can be molecularly fine-tuned and provide potentially new types of catalyst systems as well as interesting functional materials with optical, electronic, and magnetic properties. During the preparation, two strategies have been exploited to increase the surface charge density and activate the surface O atoms of heteropolyoxoanions: (1) reduce the metal centers from high oxidation state to low oxidation state, for example, from Mo<sup>VI</sup> to Mo<sup>V</sup>, by introducing strong reducing regents; (2) replace high-valence metal centers with lower-valence ones, for instance, from Mo<sup>VI</sup> to V<sup>IV</sup> or TM<sup>2+</sup> (TM = transition metal).

Under hydrothermal conditions, many factors may effect the crystal growth and structure of the products, including the kind and stoichiometry of the starting materials, temperature, pH value, filling volume, and reaction time. During our exploration on the new polyoxomolybdates in the {Mo/TM/P} system, a series of new organic\u2212inorganic hybrids have been hydrothermally made. Most of these are based on the Keggin-type {PMo<sub>12</sub>} unit, Dawson-class {P<sub>2</sub>Mo<sub>18</sub>} cluster, {P<sub>4</sub>Mo<sub>6</sub>} fragment, {P<sub>2</sub>Mo<sub>5</sub>} anion, the basket-like {P<sub>6</sub>Mo<sub>18</sub>} cage, and the {Mo<sub>16</sub>TM<sub>16</sub>P<sub>26</sub>} wheel. We are interested in inorganic\u2212organic hybrids based on the {Mo<sub>16</sub>TM<sub>16</sub>P<sub>26</sub>} wheel because these systems have not been systemically explored. Two important factors must be fully considered during the synthesis: (1) The proper reductive reagent must be introduced into the reaction system for reducing the Mo<sup>VI</sup> center to Mo<sup>V</sup>. (2) The formation conditions of the wheel must be satisfied, i.e., to enable TM and phosphate groups to connect to Mo fragments, forming large clusters. So, it is necessary to select suitable acidity and reaction temperature. In the initial stages of the reaction, although various molar ratios of Na<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>4</sub>:H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>:TM<sup>2+</sup>:L have been applied, the initial pH values, reductive reagent, and reaction temperature seem to be vital to the reaction. It is worth mentioning that the wheel-type {Mo<sub>16</sub>TM<sub>16</sub>P<sub>26</sub>} clusters were generally made above 160 \u00b0C within the pH range of 2.0\u22124.0. Furthermore, the use of the Mo metal, amino acid (<sc>dl</sc>-\u03b1-alanine), and chelate ligands with carboxyl groups (H<sub>4</sub>EDTA) as the reductive reagent is an effective method. In our case, the py and 4,4\u2032-bpy ligands plays three roles in the formation of the hybrid wheel during the self-assembly process: (1) they can substitute the surface O atoms of the polyoxoanion; (2) they act as the reductive reagent to promote the reduction of Mo<sup>VI</sup> to Mo<sup>V</sup>; (3) they also serve in structure-directing roles. Through careful exploration, the optimal reaction conditions for <bold>1</bold> is found to be a mixture of Na<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>4</sub>\u00b72H<sub>2</sub>O, Co(Ac)<sub>2</sub>\u00b74H<sub>2</sub>O, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, py, and 4,4\u2032-bpy in a molar ratio of 6:2.52:30:2.7:4.42 in water (pH 2.5) at 165 \u00b0C for 5 days.

Under hydrothermal conditions, many factors may effect the crystal growth and structure of the products, including the kind and stoichiometry of the starting materials, temperature, pH value, filling volume, and reaction time. During our exploration on the new polyoxomolybdates in the {Mo/TM/P} system, a series of new organic-inorganic hybrids have been hydrothermally made. Most of these are based on the Keggin-type {PMo12} unit, Dawson-class {P2Mo18} cluster, {P4Mo6} fragment, {P2Mo5} anion, the basket-like {P6Mo18} cage, and the {Mo16TM16P26} wheel. We are interested in inorganic-organic hybrids based on the {Mo16TM16P26} wheel because these systems have not been systemically explored. Two important factors must be fully considered during the synthesis: (1) The proper reductive reagent must be introduced into the reaction system for reducing the MoVI center to MoV. (2) The formation conditions of the wheel must be satisfied, i.e., to enable TM and phosphate groups to connect to Mo fragments, forming large clusters. So, it is necessary to select suitable acidity and reaction temperature. In the initial stages of the reaction, although various molar ratios of Na2MoO4:H3PO4:TM2+:L have been applied, the initial pH values, reductive reagent, and reaction temperature seem to be vital to the reaction. It is worth mentioning that the wheel-type {Mo16TM16P26} clusters were generally made above 160 \u00b0C within the pH range of 2.0-4.0. Furthermore, the use of the Mo metal, amino acid (dl-\u03b1-alanine), and chelate ligands with carboxyl groups (H4EDTA) as the reductive reagent is an effective method. In our case, the py and 4,4'-bpy ligands plays three roles in the formation of the hybrid wheel during the self-assembly process: (1) they can substitute the surface O atoms of the polyoxoanion; (2) they act as the reductive reagent to promote the reduction of MoVI to MoV; (3) they also serve in structure-directing roles. Through careful exploration, the optimal reaction conditions for 1 is found to be a mixture of Na2MoO4\u22c52H2O, Co(Ac)2\u22c54H2O, H3PO4, py, and 4,4'-bpy in a molar ratio of 6:2.52:30:2.7:4.42 in water (pH 2.5) at 165 \u00b0C for 5 days.
