Significantly, site I is located just 2.27 \u00c5 from the Mn2+ ions in the framework skeleton, providing the first neutron diffraction evidence for a metal-H2 interaction within a metal-organic framework. To our knowledge, this is the first example of H2 binding to a Mn2+ ion, although many examples of H2 binding to Mn+ complexes and other transition metal species exist. The D2 molecules at site II are situated inside the sodalite-like cages and exhibit van der Waals contacts of 3.47 and 3.66 \u00c5 with a chloride anion and four equidistant tetrazolate rings, respectively. The sum of the five corresponding attractive interactions is likely responsible for a significant adsorption enthalpy at this site as well.
