The resulting dimensions of the channels are 6.9 \u00d7 5.09, 6.0 \u00d7 5.09, and 8.1 \u00d7 5.13 \u00c5\u0301 (from atom to atom) along the [1 0 0], [0 1 0], and [0 0 1] directions, respectively, with a solvent-accessible volume of 38.9% calculated with PLATON.\n\nIn order to check the permanent porosity of complex 5, various gas-adsorption studies have been performed (Figure ). The gas-adsorption behaviors of the activated complex 5, which had been vacuum-dried at 120 \u00b0C after soaking in methanol, have been studied for N2, Ar, and H2 at 77 K and for CO2 at 195 K. The N2 and Ar (kinetic diameter: 3.64 \u00c5 for N2 and 3.54 \u00c5 for Ar) sorption isotherms did not indicate any appreciable amount of adsorption, presumably because of the limited pore size. However, the activated complex 5 can adsorb a moderate amount of CO2 (51 cm3 g-1) and H2 (56 cm3 g-1, 0.49% wt%), with type I behavior. Derived from the CO2 adsorption data, complex 5 has a Langmiur surface area of 141 m2 g-1. Considering the kinetic diameters of 2.89 \u00c5 for H2, 3.3 \u00c5 for CO2, and 3.54 \u00c5 for Ar, it can be speculated that the pore opening of activated 5 should fall into the range from 3.3 to 3.54 \u00c5, which only allows CO2 and H2 to enter the channels.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "complex 5", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "porosity": [{"probe": "PLATON", "value": "38.9", "unit": "%", "condition": "methyl groups of TBDC and the coordinated phen ligand pointing toward the pores"}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "51", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "temperature": "195 K", "pressure": "", "condition": "activated complex 5, vacuum-dried at 120 \u00b0C after soaking in methanol"}, {"adsorbate": "H2", "adsorbed amount": "56", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "", "condition": "activated complex 5, vacuum-dried at 120 \u00b0C after soaking in methanol"}], "surface area": [{"type": "Langmuir", "probe": "", "value": "141", "unit": "m2 g-1", "condition": "Derived from the CO2 adsorption data"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["porosity", "gas_adsorption", "surface_area"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['porosity', 'gas_adsorption', 'surface_area']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n  {\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"name\": \"complex 5\",\n      \"symbol\": \"\",\n      \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"porosity\": [\n      {\n        \"probe\": \"PLATON\",\n        \"value\": \"38.9\",\n        \"unit\": \"%\",\n        \"condition\": \"methyl groups of TBDC and the coordinated phen ligand pointing toward the pores\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"gas adsorption\": [\n      {\n        \"adsorbate\": \"CO2\",\n        \"adsorbed amount\": \"51\",\n        \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n        \"temperature\": \"195 K\",\n        \"pressure\": \"\",\n        \"condition\": \"activated complex 5, vacuum-dried at 120 \u00b0C after soaking in methanol\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"adsorbate\": \"H2\",\n        \"adsorbed amount\": \"56\",\n        \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n        \"temperature\": \"77 K\",\n        \"pressure\": \"\",\n        \"condition\": \"activated complex 5, vacuum-dried at 120 \u00b0C after soaking in methanol\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"surface area\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"Langmuir\",\n        \"probe\": \"\",\n        \"value\": \"141\",\n        \"unit\": \"m2 g-1\",\n        \"condition\": \"Derived from the CO2 adsorption data\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 4, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Schematic Representation of the Interpenetrating Net (Left) and the Noninterpenetrating Net Constructed with an Organic Ligand with a Large Steric-Hindrance Group (Right)</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"ic-2010-00822s_0001.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Schematic Representation of the Interpenetrating Net (Left) and the Noninterpenetrating Net Constructed with an Organic Ligand with a Large Steric-Hindrance Group (Right)   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 6, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Single net (left) and the 2-fold interpenetrating net (right) of complex <bold>1</bold> along the [1 0 1] direction.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"ic-2010-00822s_0002.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Single net (left) and the 2-fold interpenetrating net (right) of complex 1 along the [1 0 1] direction.
