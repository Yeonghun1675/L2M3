At room temperature, distributions of both on- and off-intervals were found to be statistically different between KAP and DKAP, as evidenced by p-values \u226a 0.05. SM emission energies of both VR- and VRH further support the proton-transfer model. The on-interval distributions become statistically equivalent at elevated temperatures, whereas the off-intervals remain statistically different. This was interpreted as evidence for different proton-transfer mechanisms for dark state production and decay. We have proposed that formation of the colorless isomer, VRL, is responsible for the nonemissive events observed in the PI data. Opening of the lactone ring corresponding to the conversion of VRL to VR- is mediated by proton-tunneling. Evidence of this mechanism is found in the temperature evolution of the off-intervals, where the average duration increases with increasing temperature consistent with an increase in the tunneling barrier accompanying expansion of the crystal lattice.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 48, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The <italic toggle=\"yes\">on</italic>-and <italic toggle=\"yes\">off</italic>-intervals\nare\nnot consistent with a power-law distribution as previously assumed\nand are instead well modeled by a log-normal distribution.
