The results have shown that <bold>2d</bold> selectively adsorbs H<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>, rather\nthan N<sub>2</sub> (a).

To the best of our knowledge, this adsorption heat is comparable\nto those of the reported MOFs.\n</p>", "clean_text": "Two metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) {(Me2NH2)[ZnLi(PTCA)(H2O)]} n \u22c5n{3DMF\u22c5C4H8O2\u22c54H2O} (1) and {(Me2NH2)[ZnLi(PTCA)]} n \u22c5n{3DMF\u22c55H2O} (2) have been constructed from Li-Zn clusters and pyrene-1,3,6,8-tetracarboxylic acid (H4PTCA) under solvothermal conditions. Gas sorption measurements have revealed that the pore of desolvated 2 (2d) can strongly interact with H2 and CO2, with high H2 and CO2 adsorption heats of 15.3 and 51.9 kJ/mol, respectively. Furthermore, 2d can selectively adsorb CO2 over N2 and CH4, with high adsorption selectivity of CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4.\n\nA solvothermal reaction of Zn(NO3)2\u22c56H2O and LiCl with H4PTCA in DMF/dioxane/H2O (2:1:1) at 110 and 140 \u00b0C for 48 h led to the formation of yellow crystals of 1 and 2, respectively (Supporting Information). The result of single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis has revealed that 1 crystallizes in a monoclinic crystal system, with a space group of P21/c (Table S1). The asymmetric unit of 1 contains one crystallographically independent Zn(II), one independent Li(I), and one PTCA4- ligand, as well as one Me2NH2 + counterion, three DMF, one dioxane, and four H2O molecules. Zn1 is four-coordinated by four carboxylate O atoms from four individual PTCA4-, forming a tetrahedral coordination geometry; Li1 is also four-coordinated with a tetrahedral coordination geometry. The coordinated atoms around Li1 are three carboxylate O atoms from three individual PTCA4- and one O from one coordinated H2O (a). PTCA4- employs two types of coordination modes. One bridges four pairs of Zn1 and Li1 by four carboxylate groups (Scheme S2, Mode I), and the other coordinates with four Zn1 and two Li1, where two pairs of Zn1 and Li1 are bridged by two carboxylate groups and the other two Zn1 are bonded to the other two carboxylate groups (Scheme S2, Mode II). Zn1 and Li1 are bridged by three \u03bc2-COO from two PTCA4- in Mode I and one PTCA4- in Mode II to form a heterobimetallic cluster of [ZnLi(CO2)3]. The distance of Zn1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Li1 is 3.411(3) \u00c5. Each [ZnLi(CO2)3] cluster connects with four PTCA4-, and each PTCA4- links to four [ZnLi(CO2)4] clusters, generating a 3D (4,4)-connected framework with 1D channels along the c axis (b and ). The size of the channel is 6.24 \u00c5 \u00d7 9.63 \u00c5 (the distances of Li1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O8 and Zn1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O6, respectively). The Me2NH2 + counterions, originating from the decomposition of DMF molecules, fill in the pore together with the disordered DMF, dioxane, and H2O molecules, which is confirmed by 1H NMR analysis (Figure S2a). About 42.2% of the solvent accessible volume is estimated by the PLATON procedure. \n\nCompound 2 crystallizes in the space group of C2/m (Table S1). As shown in a, the crystallographically independent Zn(II) and Li(I) also assume four-coordinated tetrahedral coordination geometries. All the coordinated atoms around Zn1/Li1 come from the carboxylate O atoms of PTCA4-. The PTCA4- also adopts two coordination modes. One coordinates with four Zn and six Li through four carboxylate groups (Scheme S2, Mode III), and the other only bonds to four Zn by four carboxylate groups (Scheme S2, Mode IV). Six carboxylate groups of six PTCA4- in Mode III connect two Zn1 and two Li1 together to form a planar heterotetranuclear cluster of [Zn2Li2(CO2)6]. The distance of Zn1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Li1 is 2.953(2) \u00c5, much shorter than that in 1. Each [Zn2Li2(CO2)6] cluster is surrounded by eight PTCA4-, and each PTCA4- is encircled by four [Zn2Li2(CO2)6] clusters, resulting in a 3D (4,8)-connected porous framework with 1D trapezium channels (b and ). The size of the channel is 8.58 \u00c5 \u00d7 7.63 \u00c5 (the distances of C20\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O4 and Zn1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O5, respectively), which is filled with counterion Me2NH2 +, disordered DMF, and lattice H2O molecules, confirmed by 1H NMR analysis (Figure S2b). The calculated porosity per unit cell volume is 43.8%. \n\nThe TG curve of 1 shows a weight loss of 19.5% in the temperature range from 30 to 180 \u00b0C (Figure S5), corresponding to the removal of one dioxane and five water molecules (Calcd. 20.0%). Then from 180 to 360 \u00b0C, a weight loss of 23.3% is observed, corresponding to the removal of three DMF molecules (Calcd 24.6%). Upon further heating, the desolvated 1 begin to decompose. From 30 to 100 \u00b0C, the TG curve of 2 shows a weight loss of 10.5%, corresponding to the removal of five lattice H2O molecules (Calcd 11.2%). Further heated to 360 \u00b0C, the three DMF molecules lose (Calcd 27.3%), then followed the decomposition of the rest of 2 (Figure S5). To examine the framework stabilities of 1 and 2, freshly prepared 1/2 was soaked in methanol/acetonitrile to exchange the guest molecules in the channels of 1/2. The results of the XRD measurements have revealed that the framework of 1 collapses after being exchanged by methanol/acetonitrile (Figure S4a); the framework of 2 can remain stable after being exchanged by acetonitrile (Figure S4b). Even with further activation by removal of acetonitrile, the framework of 2 can remain stable (Figure S4b). The variable-temperature PXRD for 1 and 2 have given similar results. The diffraction peaks of 1 disappear when the sample is heated to 120 \u00b0C (Figure S6a), illustrating the collapse of the framework; the diffraction peaks of 2 show no obvious change from 30 to 200 \u00b0C (Figure S6b), demonstrating that the framework of 2 is stable up to 200 \u00b0C. Although both 1 and 2 are constructed from Li-Zn clusters and the PTCA4- ligand, they show obviously different framework stabilities. This may be ascribed to the different structures of the Li-Zn clusters within 1 and 2. The tetranuclear [Zn2Li2(CO2)6] clusters in 2 are stronger than the bimetallic [ZnLi(CO2)3] clusters in 1 to strut such large frameworks after removing the guests inside the cavities.\n\nTo further evaluate the permanent porosity in desolvated 2 (2d), N2, H2, and CO2 sorption measurements were carried out (Supporting Information). The results have shown that 2d selectively adsorbs H2 and CO2, rather than N2 (a). The isotherm of the CO2 adsorption at 195 K shows a typical I curve, with the amount of CO2 adsorption increasing abruptly at low pressure and gradually approaching 133 cm3 (STP)/g at 1.0 atm (a). Fitting the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation to the sorption isotherm at 195 K gives the estimated surface area of 602.5 m2/g. The H2 adsorption isotherm for 2d shows an adsorption capacity of 135 cm3 g-1 (~1.2 wt %) at 77 K and 1 atm (a). Moreover, the adsorption isotherms present rare steep slopes at low pressure at either 77 or 87 K, suggesting that the pores in 2d can strongly bind with H2, which is supported by the high adsorption heat of 15.3 kJ/mol at the initial pressure, calculated using the modified Clausius-Clapeyron equation (c and Supporting Information). To the best of our knowledge, this adsorption heat is comparable to those of the reported MOFs.

The calculated initial value reaches as high as 51.9 kJ/mol, larger than those of HKUST-1 (23.3 kJ/mol), MIL-53 (32-35 kJ/mol), and Ni-MOF-74 (41 kJ/mol) (c). This strong interaction of 2d with CO2 may be attributed to Me2NH2 + in the channels and the charge framework of 2d. Considering the strong interaction with CO2, detailed investigations for 2d on the separation of CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 have been performed. Therefore, besides the two CO2 sorption isotherms mentioned above, the N2 and CH4 sorption isotherms have also been respectively recorded at 273 and 298 K (b). The results have shown that under 1 atm, 2d can adsorb 79.4 and 60.9 cm3/g of CO2, 5.8 and 3.6 cm3/g of N2, and 24.5 and 15.9 cm3/g of CH4, at 273 and 298 K, respectively. On the basis of the above sorption data, the selective adsorption performances of 2d to CO2 over N2 and CH4 have been given by Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST, Supporting Information). The results of IAST calculations have shown that under 1 atm, the selectivity of 2d for a 15:85 CO2/N2 mixture is 277 at 273 K and 126 at 298 K; the selectivity for a 50:50 CO2/CH4 mixture is 35 at 273 K and 26 at 298 K (d and S7). To the best of our knowledge, these values are higher than those of most previously reported MOFs (Table S3).
