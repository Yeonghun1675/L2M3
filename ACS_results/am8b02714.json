As a consequence, 1 displays moderately high C2H n  hydrocarbon uptake and good selective capture of C2H n  and CO2 from CH4 under ambient conditions. Given that the binding enthalpies of C2H n  and CO2 are all considerably low, undoubtedly, 1 could be a potential candidate for natural gas purification. Importantly, this work reveals that the incorporation of mild binding sites could be a promising approach to finely tune pore environments in MOFs for enhancing gas adsorption and separation with a lower regeneration energy. In addition, submicro-1 has excellent durability and solvent stability as well as a long lifetime and biocompatibility, and it especially shows excellent extraction selectivity toward 3-OH-PHEN and 1-OH-PYR. Thereby, a validated \u03bc-SPE-LC-MS method capable of determining trace OH-PAHs in human urine was established, conferring sensitivity, accuracy, and automation advantages. To our knowledge, this work provides the very first study of a mixed-ligand MOF being employed as an efficient sorbent for \u03bc-SPE. Further explorations on new robust MOFs with in-pore functionality for highly selective gaseous and liquid-phase separation applications are ongoing in our laboratory.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 33, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information is available\nfree of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications\nwebsite</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsami.8b02714\">10.1021/acsami.8b02714</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Crystallographic\ndata of <bold>1</bold> (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.8b02714/suppl_file/am8b02714_si_001.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Additional figures, thermogravimetric\nanalysis, PXRD, isotherm fitting, optimization of experimental conditions\nfor liquid-phase separation (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.8b02714/suppl_file/am8b02714_si_002.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b02714.
