Interestingly, the color change was localized at several discrete domains of the crystal, and the size and number of domains increased as the soaking continued for a month for complete exchange of all of the framework metal ions of 2. The crystal morphology remained intact even after the complete exchange of the framework metal ions. However, the diffraction study of a metal-exchanged single-particle-like sample on a single-crystal diffractometer using synchrotron radiation only showed the diffraction pattern of a powder crystalline sample. The 2D PXRD pattern obtained from the single-particle-like sample using a CCD detector was converted to a 1D powder pattern using the FIT2-D program, which is the same as that of the bulk sample (Figure ). In short, the ZnII-based 3D network of the srs net topology transformed to the CuII-based 3D network of the tbo net topology, Cu-HKUST-1. Although the morphology of the single-particle-like sample looks intact during the transformation, it is not a single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation but is a single-crystal-to-microcrystal transformation. Transformation of the 3-connected Zn2(COO)3 SBU in the ZnII-based srs network into a 4-connected Cu2(COO)4 SBU in the CuII-based tbo network led to significant structural reorganization of the building components. The crystal-to-crystal transformation localized at several discrete domains rather than throughout the whole crystal caused severe strain at the interfaces of the crystalline domains to generate an aggregate of Cu-HKUST-1 microcrystals.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 36, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig8\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>8</label>\n<caption>\n<p>PXRD patterns of <bold>2</bold> soaked in Cu<sup>II</sup>-DMF solutions: (a) Simulated PXRD\npattern from a single-crystal structure of <bold>2</bold>; (b) as-synthesized\nsample obtained by soaking bulk crystals of <bold>2</bold> in 20 mL\nof a 0.1 M Cu<sup>II</sup>-DMF solution for 14 days; (c) PXRD pattern\nof a single crystal soaked in 1.5 mL of a 0.2 M Cu<sup>II</sup>-DMF\nsolution for 30 days;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref25\"></xref> (d) simulated PXRD\npattern from a single-crystal structure of Cu-HKUST-1.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr8\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2012-02641v_0008.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 8  PXRD patterns of 2 soaked in CuII-DMF solutions: (a) Simulated PXRD pattern from a single-crystal structure of 2; (b) as-synthesized sample obtained by soaking bulk crystals of 2 in 20 mL of a 0.1 M CuII-DMF solution for 14 days; (c) PXRD pattern of a single crystal soaked in 1.5 mL of a 0.2 M CuII-DMF solution for 30 days; (d) simulated PXRD pattern from a single-crystal structure of Cu-HKUST-1.
