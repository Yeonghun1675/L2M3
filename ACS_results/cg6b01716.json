Although some structural details are different from MOF-Mn  4  Cl, MOF-Mn  4  also has octahedral and cuboctahedral cages consisting of the linkage of [Mn4(COO)8] SBUs and BTTC3- ligands (g,h). The close packing of these octahedral and cuboctahedral cages is also similar to that of MOF-Mn  4  Cl, resulting in the 3D framework of MOF-Mn  4  with  the  topology (d,i,j). Interestingly, there is an isolated [Mn(OH)2(H2O)4] unit inside each twisted octahedral cage (g). The solvent accessible volume of MOF-Mn  4  is about 62.5% of the total crystal volume, which is slight lower than that of MOF-Mn  4  Cl. Thus, it can be considered as successful tuning of the coordination environment of SBUs in MOF-Mn  4  Cl. Meanwhile, the original anionic framework turns into a neutral one. In the previous work, Zhou's group presented a neutral meso-MOF-2, which was constructed by connecting square-planar tetranuclear Cd(II) SBUs with BTTC3- ligands, and retained permanent porosity upon heating activation. MOF-Mn  4  is isostructural with meso-MOF-2 because of the presence of a square-planar tetranuclear Mn(II) unit which has not been reported so far.

Although possessing same network topology, MOF-Mn4  shows a high BET surface area of 1718 m2/g, which is about an 8 times enhancement over MOF-Mn4Cl.\n\nOn the basis of the idea of regulating the coordination environment of secondary building units in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) via inducing multiplicate metal-ligand interactions, an unstable framework MOF-Mn4Cl is structurally modified into a robust framework MOF-Mn4 . Although both MOFs possess similar  the -type topologies and pore features, the neutral stable MOF-Mn4  shows a high BET surface area of 1718 m2/g, which is about an 8 times enhancement over the unstable anionic MOF-Mn4Cl.\n\nPowder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurement confirmed the phase purity of MOF-Mn  4  Cl (a,b). To examine the stability of MOF-Mn  4  Cl, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and desolvation experiments were carried out. The TGA results show that MOF-Mn  4  Cl releases guest molecules between 25 and 250 \u00b0C, leading to a weight loss of 31% (Figure S1). To completely remove guest molecules in the voids by degassing, solvent exchange is performed by soaking crystals of MOF-Mn  4  Cl in CH2Cl2 under ambient conditions for 24 h, and then the CH2Cl2-exchanged sample is degassed under high vacuum (5 \u03bcmHg) at room temperature overnight to form desolvated solid MOF-Mn  4  Cla. The PXRD pattern of desolvated solid MOF-Mn  4  Cla is distinct from that of the original MOF-Mn  4  Cl, confirming the host framework appears to undergo significant pore collapse upon guest removal (c). This phenomenon was often seen in some high porous MOFs. The TGA curve of MOF-Mn  4  shows that the guest molecules escape at a higher temperature (Figure S1). So, CH2Cl2-exchange is also performed for crystals of MOF-Mn  4 , which is further degassed under high vacuum (5 \u03bcmHg) at room temperature overnight to give the desolvated solid MOF-Mn  4  a, whose PXRD pattern is matched well with that of original MOF-Mn  4 , confirming the integrity of the framework upon guest removal (c-e). In order to deeply understand the thermostability of host framework, MOF-Mn  4  is also degassed under 220, 250, and 280 \u00b0C, giving MOF-Mn  4  b, MOF-Mn  4  c, and MOF-Mn  4  d, respectively. PXRD pattern results indicate that the host framework of MOF-Mn  4  is stable under 250 \u00b0C and high vacuum. It is noted that high porous MOFs with such excellent thermostability are rarely reported. Once the activated temperature rises to 280 \u00b0C, the collapse of most host framework can be verified by PXRD patterns and gas sorption shown as below.\n\nSince both MOF-Mn  4  Cl and MOF-Mn  4  possess a similar porous structure and same topology, it provides a platform to comparatively study that how slight structural changes influence gas sorption performance. The N2 sorption isotherms reveals that MOF-Mn  4  Cla has a very low N2 uptake of 64.5 cm3/g at 77 K and 1 bar, giving low Langmuir and BET surface areas of 225 and 194 m2/g, respectively (a). The surface area and porosity parameters of the activated sample MOF-Mn  4  a-d are also analyzed by standard N2 analysis at 77 K. As shown in b-e, all of the samples display Type I isotherm with a steep nitrogen gas uptake at low relative pressure (P < 0.1 bar), indicating permanent microporosity of the framework. The BET surface area for MOF-Mn4a is calculated to be 1282 m2/g. In a series of the activated sample, MOF-Mn4c shows the highest gas uptake of 427.6 cm3/g and BET surface area of 1718 m2/g, which are about an 8 times enhancement over those of the anionic MOF-Mn  4  Cl and comparable to MOFs that based on square-planar M4X (M = metal ions, X = Cl, O, or not exist) SBUs (Table S2). Being different from the isostructural meso-MOF-2, MOF-Mn  4  c shows a much higher N2 uptake than meso-MOF-2, and no terthienobenzene loss can be observed in MOF-Mn4c, further affirming its excellent thermostability. The experimental total pore volume of MOF-Mn4c is 0.66 cm3/g, which is slightly lower than that (0.76 cm3/g) estimated from the single crystal structure without all dissociative and coordinated solvent molecules. For MOF-Mn4a-c, the pore size distribution evaluated from a nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) simulation of the N2 sorption curve indicates that the average pore size increases with the increasing of activated temperature (Figure S2). Under 77 K and 800 mmHg, the H2 capacity of MOF-Mn  4  a is 109 cm3/g (0.97 wt %), which can be compared with those of many reported MOFs. (Figure S3). The enthalpy of H2 adsorption for MOF-Mn  4  a is estimated from the H2 sorption isotherms at 77 and 87 K by using the virial equation to understand the affinity of MOF-Mn  4  a toward H2, giving an isosteric heat of 5.3 kJ/mol (Figure S4).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "A", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "1500", "unit": "m2/g",
