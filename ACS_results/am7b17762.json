Especially, 2 exhibits superior sensitivity for Al3+ with the detection limit as low as 3.73 ppb, which is significantly lower than the higher limit of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommendation of Al3+ ion for drinking water (200 ppb). The fluorescence turn-on mechanism can be proposed to the complexation of HTABDC with Al3+ through the chelation of oxygen atoms from carboxylate and uncoordinated hydroxyl groups to Al3+, which results in the dissociation of 2 with eliminating the PET process from HTABDC to Bpy; hence, the AIE process is reactivated. The mechanism can be evidenced by the red shift of fluorescence maxima from 460 to 486 nm, which could be ascribed to the emission of new HTABDC-Al3+ complex in origin. The titration experiments for ligand HTABDC and compound 1 with addition of Al3+ and other metal ions were also performed.
