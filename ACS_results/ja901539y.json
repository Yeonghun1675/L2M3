On cooling, the \u03c7<italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic> values decrease more and more rapidly, finally reaching a small value, 0.76 cm<sup>3</sup> K mol<sup>\u22121</sup>, at 2.0 K.

Neither the real component nor the imaginary component of <italic toggle=\"yes\">ac</italic> susceptibility shows a maximum (), indicating no long-range antiferromagnetic ordering, and hence short-range interactions.

On cooling, the \u03c7<italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic> values increase more and more quickly, reaching a very sharp maximum of 14.9 cm<sup>3</sup> K mol<sup>\u22121</sup> at 11.0 K (Figure ) and then quickly decrease to low values of 1.79 cm<sup>3</sup> K mol<sup>\u22121</sup> at 2.0 K.

The Neel temperature <italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic>\n<sub>N</sub> determined by the peak of the real component of <italic toggle=\"yes\">ac</italic> susceptibility is 7.0 K, and no peak was found for the imaginary component ().

The sigmoidal shape of the field-dependent magnetizations at 2 K exhibits a field-induced transition from an antiferromagnetic to a ferrimagnetic state. Below 4 kOe, the magnetizations are small, whereas from 5.0 to 12.0 kOe they increase quickly. Above 12.0 kOe, the increase in magnetization slows, and its dependence on field strength is nearly linear. Given the proposed structure, strong intrachain interactions and weak interchain interactions are expected. It is reasonable to say that the intrachain interactions are ferrimagnetic, and antiferromagnetic interactions come from the weak interchain interactions. The crossover between an antiferromagnetic hexanuclear cluster and a ferrimagnetic double zigzag chain may be caused by the variation of the Fe<sup>II</sup>\u2212N\u2212C angle and accidental orthogonality (see Supporting Information).\n</p>", "clean_text": "An important characteristic of 1 is that the hexanuclear units are linked to each other to form a chain through hydrogen bonding interactions of the terminal CN- on the [Fe(Tp)(CN)3]- moiety and the weakly coordinated solvent molecules on FeII on two diagonal sides of the square core FeIII 2FeII 2. Hence, it is expected that the solvent molecules are removed on heating, and concomitantly, CN- coordinates to the free sites of FeII of a neighboring cluster, allowing a solid state reaction that forms a one-dimensional polymer structure. We performed thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) () and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) () measurements to verify the solid state reaction. The TGA of 1 displays a weight loss of 20.7% from 40 to 90 \u00b0C, corresponding to the loss of 12 water molecules and 4 acetonitrile molecules (19.9%). After the weight loss, a long plateau is observed up to the point where decomposition occurs at ca. 250 \u00b0C, suggesting the formation of a new phase of [FeIII(Tp)(CN)3]4FeII(H2O)2FeII (2), as shown by the powder XRD patterns.\n\nAs the structure changes drastically, significant changes in magnetic properties are to be expected. At room temperature, the \u03c7T values (Figure ) of 1 are 10.95 cm3 K mol-1 per FeIII 4FeII 2, being larger than the spin-only value for four FeIII with S = 1/2 and two FeII with S = 2, due to the orbital contribution of FeIII and FeII. The magnetic susceptibility data above 30 K fit the Curie-Weiss law well, providing a Curie constant of 11.12 cm3 K mol-1 and Weiss temperature of -2.95 K, indicating the dominant weak antiferromagnetic interactions within the material. On cooling, the \u03c7T values decrease more and more rapidly, finally reaching a small value, 0.76 cm3 K mol-1, at 2.0 K. The maximum of \u03c7 is observed at 10.0 K (). Neither the real component nor the imaginary component of ac susceptibility shows a maximum (), indicating no long-range antiferromagnetic ordering, and hence short-range interactions. The field-dependent magnetizations, even at 2 K and 50 kOe, being 4.29 N\u03b2, far from the saturated values of 12.0 N\u03b2 for g = 2.0, confirm the significant antiferromagnetic interactions in 1 (Figure  insert). According to the proposed structure, the intrahexanuclear interactions should be strong, and the interhexanuclear interactions should be weak. Hence, the hexanuclear unit should be intrinsically antiferromagnetic.\n\nFor 2, the \u03c7T values at room temperature are 9.75 cm3 K mol-1 per FeIII 4FeII 2, smaller than that in 1 due to the different orbital contribution between tetrahedral FeII and octahedral FeII. On cooling, the \u03c7T values increase more and more quickly, reaching a very sharp maximum of 14.9 cm3 K mol-1 at 11.0 K (Figure ) and then quickly decrease to low values of 1.79 cm3 K mol-1 at 2.0 K. The high temperature data fit the Curie-Weiss law well and provide Curie and Weiss constants C = 9.46 cm3 K mol-1 and \u03b8 = 7.43 K, suggesting dominant ferromagnetic interaction in 2. Further magnetic investigation reveals that 2 is a metamagnet. Upon increasing field strength, the maxima in its magnetizations moved to lower temperatures and became less prominent and finally disappeared at 9.0 kOe for 2, indicating a metamagnetic transition induced by the external field (). The Neel temperature T N determined by the peak of the real component of ac susceptibility is 7.0 K, and no peak was found for the imaginary component (). The field-dependent magnetizations, 8.50 N\u03b2 per FeIII 4FeII 2 at 2 K and 50 kOe, suggest a ferrimagnetic ground state with S = 4 for g = 2.125 (Figure  insert).
