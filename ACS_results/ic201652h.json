Its characteristic basketlike shape is well preserved in both [1]8- and [Na4 1]4- model species, but is calculated to be slightly more open than that in the solid state (e.g., the distance between the two MoVI centers is 8.35 \u00c5 in [1]8- and 8.49 \u00c5 in [Na4 1]4- versus 8.12 \u00c5 in the crystal structure of 1). Interestingly, during geometry optimization of [1]8-, significant rotation of the two pyridine groups takes place and is associated with a change of the dihedral angle between the pyridine plane and the plane defined by the two adjacent aliphatic C atoms (Figure ) from 274.6\u00b0, reflecting the crystal structure, to 218.6\u00b0 in the minimized solution structure (movie S1 in the ). The pincerlike stacking pattern of the pyridine moieties is preserved in general, but the orientation of the aromatic rings with respect to the rest of the molecule is alternated in such a way that the distance of the two N atoms in [1]8- is almost twice as large as that in 1, whereas that of the aromatic C atoms in the para position is ~1.5 times shorter (cf. Figures  and a). In contrast, the inclusion of Na+ ions in the vicinity of polyanion 1 when modeling its solution state stabilizes almost the same orientation of the pyridine rings as the one characterizing the crystal structure (Figures  and b). For instance, the calculations predict 274.2\u00b0 for the above-mentioned dihedral angle, 3.97 \u00c5 for the distances of the N centers, and 7.44 \u00c5 for the p-C atoms in [Na4 1]4-, versus 274.6\u00b0, 3.19 \u00c5, and 6.03 \u00c5, as determined respectively in the solid state.

The pH of the solution was then adjusted to 6.7 with a 8 M NaOH solution. Guanidinium chloride (1.0 g, 10.4 mmol) was added to the above mixture, which was stirred at room temperature for 15 min, and then the precipitate was filtered off. The resulting filtrate was left for 3 days in an open vial for slow evaporation, leading to yellowish-red needle-shaped crystals of 3a together with deep-red blocks of 1b. 31P{1H} NMR (400 MHz, D2O):
