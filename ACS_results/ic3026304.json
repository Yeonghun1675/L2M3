The amount of lattice water that resides in 1 cannot be determined from TGA measurements since MOF 1 loses the excess water very quickly at room temperature to give 1'. Immediate removal of 1 from a water bath results in a TGA trace shown in Figure . The initial weight loss can be attributed primarily to surface water. MOF 1', on the other hand, loses 8.9% of its mass at 86 \u00b0C, which is consistent with four water molecules in the pores (Figure ). From the weight loss, we can deduce the formula for 1' is [Cu2(L)2(SO4)(Br)2]\u22c54H2O (Scheme ). Notably, the TGA trace for 1 shows additional weight loss at the same temperature, leading us to conclude that by 86 \u00b0C we  already formed 1'.\n\nDespite having the same topologies, several structural differences between 1 and 1' are observed.
