In comparison to most of the known MOFs which possess good CO2/CH4 selectivity under similar conditions (Table S3 in the Supporting Information), the values are even higher. The excellent CO2 sorption selectivity over CH4 and N2 in 1' and 2' may be caused by a few factors. First, the smaller kinetic diameter of CO2 (3.3 \u00c5) in comparison to CH4 (3.8 \u00c5) and N2 (3.64 \u00c5) makes it easy to enter the pore. Then, the different electrostatic interactions between gas molecules and frameworks, in which the quadrupole moment of CO2 (-1.4 \u00d7 10-39 C m2) is larger than those of CH4 (0 C m2) and N2 (-4.7 \u00d7 10-40 C m2), can induce the framework to interact with CO2 molecules and thus increase the CO2 binding. Significantly, this can be mainly attributed to the stronger interaction of CO2 with N-oxide functional ODSs and vacant carboxyl O sites in the pores. The remarkable selectivities for CO2 over CH4 and N2 render 1' and 2' as promising materials in postcombustion CO2 capture and landfill gas purification.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 27, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig7\" position=\"float\">\n<label>7</label>\n<caption>\n<p>IAST adsorption selectivities of <bold>1\u2032</bold> (a) and <bold>2\u2032</bold> (b) for equimolar\nmixtures of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr7\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2017-028442_0007.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 7  IAST adsorption selectivities of 1' (a) and 2' (b) for equimolar mixtures of CO2 and CH4.

This stepwise sorption\nbehavior of <bold>1\u2032</bold> at 273 K may be caused by the slight\ndeformation of the flexible bpa ligand with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> pressure.

The differences in intensity may be due to the preferred orientation of the powder samples. To evaluate the thermal stabilities of 1 and 2, TGA experiments were conducted from 30 to 700 \u00b0C under a nitrogen atmosphere (Figure S8 in the Supporting Information). The TGA curve of 1 indicates a weight loss of 16.93% in the temperature range of 30-122 \u00b0C, and for 2, a weight loss of 16.94% between 30 and 120 \u00b0C was observed, which is consistent with the release of three lattice H2O molecules per formula unit (calculated 17.14% for 1 and 17.19% for 2). The desolvated samples 1' and 2' were prepared by heating the as-synthesized samples of 1 and 2 at 110 \u00b0C under vacuum for 6 h. Interestingly, the color changes from blue to purple during the desolvation process, while once the desolvated samples are exposed to moist air for a few minutes, they can be completely reversibly restored with the color reverting from purple to blue (); the recovery speed of 1' is slightly faster than that of 2'. The solvent removal and readsorption can all be verified by PXRD patterns (Figure S7) and TGA (Figure S8). The PXRD patterns and TGA curves of 1' and 2' have been tested at once, and their changes indicate the removal of guest molecules and framework shifts. However, due to the moisture in the air, the desolvated samples will reabsorb water molecules gradually, and thus, the TGA curves of desolvated 1 and 2 display a slight weight loss. In addition, because the readsorption speed of 1' is slightly faster than that of 2', purple 1' has partially turned blue after an immediate PXRD measurement, while 2' is still almost purple, and thus, the PXRD pattern of 1' shows more semblance to that of the as-synthesized species in comparison to that of 2'. Ultimately, the TGA curves and PXRD patterns of resolvated 1 and 2 are almost the same as those of as-synthesized 1 and 2, indicating complete resolvation.\n\nSorption Properties\n\nTo estimate the porosities of 1 and 2, gas adsorption measurements (N2, H2, CO2, and CH4) were performed. The Langmuir (BET) surface areas calculated according to the sorption of CO2 at 195 K from the first step adsorption isotherms are 592 (410) and 629 (441) m2 g-1 for 1' and 2', respectively. The curve analyses reveal that 1' and 2' hardly adsorb N2 and H2 (Figures S11 and S12 in the Supporting Information) but adsorb CO2 and CH4, and the uptake amount of CO2 is much more than that of CH4. In particular, 1' and 2' exhibit intriguingly comparable temperature-dependent CO2 sorption behaviors. As shown in , at 195 K, both MOFs show uncommon stepped adsorption of CO2, but the isotherms display some differences. For 1', the first step shows a typical type I isotherm and the adsorption saturation occurs at 0.021 atm, where the uptake amount reaches 41.7 cm3 g-1 (8.2 wt %), and then the second step starts at 0.034 atm with the uptake amount reaching 192.8 cm3 g-1 (37.9 wt %) at 1 bar. However, for 2', though it has the same type I first stepped isotherm, the adsorption saturation occurs at 0.10 atm where the uptake amount reaches 50.2 cm3 g-1 (9.9 wt %), and the second step starts at 0.15 atm with the adsorption amount attaining a value of 195.5 cm3 g-1 (38.4 wt %). It is noted that their desorption curves also exhibit steps at the corresponding inflection points of the adsorption curve but do not retrace the adsorption pathways with a large hysteresis, revealing the strong affinity of the host framework for CO2. \n\nWhen the measured temperature changed to 273 and 298 K, further interesting results of CO2 isotherms were observed (). At 273 K, the CO2 adsorption for 1' still shows a stepwise curve, which stores up to 41.6 cm3 g-1 (8.2 wt %) at P = 400 Torr, and at P > 400 Torr exhibits a small increase with the adsorption amount attaining 58.2 cm3 g-1 (11.4 wt %) at 1 atm. The CO2 desorption curve also shows steps at the corresponding inflection points of the adsorption curve but does not retrace it with a hysteresis loop. This stepwise sorption behavior of 1' at 273 K may be caused by the slight deformation of the flexible bpa ligand with increasing CO2 pressure. However, for 2' at 273 K, the CO2 isotherms show no steps with an adsorption amount of 52.8 cm3 g-1 (10.4 wt %). Once the temperature is increased to 298 K, the CO2 isotherm for 1' also does not show steps in the profiles, the same as the nonstepped CO2 isotherms for 2' at 298 K, which indicates that the thermal energy of the frameworks and CO2 molecules reduced their interactions. The CO2 uptakes for 1' (36.8 cm3 g-1, 7.2 wt %) and 2' (40.4 cm3 g-1, 7.9 wt %) at 298 K are moderately high and are similar to those of MIL-47 (8.1 wt %), IRMOF-9 (7.8 wt %), and ZIF-81 (7.2 wt %) and outperform those of most MOFs, such as MOF-177 (3.4 wt %), SNU-30 (4.9 wt %), SNU-70 (3.5 wt %), UCY-1 (4.1 wt %), IRMOF-3 (4.7 wt %), and MOF-205-OBn (4.1 wt %). Thus, overall, 1' and 2' display distinct CO2 sorption behaviors dependent on the temperatures (195, 273, and 298 K), which indicate their different threshold temperatures and pressures of channel expansion for 1' and 2'.\n\nFurthermore, the CH4 sorption properties at 195 K for 1' and 2' were studied with the amounts of 43.2 cm3 g-1 (3.09 wt %) and 47.1 cm3 g-1 (3.36 wt %) at STP (), respectively, much lower than that of CO2 under the same conditions. The multistep adsorption was not observed. The probable reason for the different adsorption behaviors between CO2 and CH4 at 195 K could be attributed to the stronger interaction of CO2 with N-oxide ODSs and vacant carboxyl O sites in the pores, which may enlarge the phase transformation energy and decrease the pressure required by the phase transition.
