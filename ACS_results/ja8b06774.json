The structure of 2a belongs to the hexagonal space group P3\u03051m. While the 2D network in 2a is isostructural to that in 1, metal substitution results in a shortening of the M-O bonds. Specifically, the mean Co-O distance in 2a of 2.074(7) \u00c5 is 3.9% shorter than that of 2.158(3) observed for Mn-O in 1 (see ), and this value is indicative of high-spin CoII. All other bond distances within the 2D network of 2a are identical to those of 1, indicating the absence of redox chemistry upon metal exchange. Since L2- is a relatively short bridging ligand compared to most reported MOFs, this change in the M-O distance results in a considerable contraction of 2.7% in each of the crystallographically equivalent a and b axes. In addition, upon metal exchange, the original Et4N+ counterion was replaced by half of an equivalent of [Co(DMF)6]2+, leading to a contraction of the c axis by 4.9%, from 10.248(2) \u00c5 for 1 to 9.745(1) for 2a. This contraction is largely due to the placement of the [Co(DMF)6]2+ within the 1D channel, rather than between two Co atoms of adjacent layers as observed for Et4N+ in 1.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 13, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The observation of such large\nchanges in the unit cell lengths upon metal exchange is unusual, and provides an opportunity to monitor the exchange\nprocess using ex situ PXRD analysis.
