At 77 K, the H2 adsorption data for 1 indicate a fully reversible uptake of 1.6 wt % at 1 bar, with an initial isosteric heat of adsorption of -5.5 kJ/mol. At pressures up to 100 bar, the data show the compound to serve as an exceptional hydrogen storage material, reaching a total uptake of 9.2 wt % and 44 g/L at 77 K and of 2.3 wt % and 11 g/L at 298 K. It is expected that reaction conditions similar to those reported here may enable the synthesis of a broad new family of beryllium-based frameworks with extremely high surface areas.\n\nLow-pressure N2 adsorption measurements performed on 1 at 77 K afforded a type I isotherm characteristic of a microporous solid. Fits to the data gave a BET surface area of 4030 m2/g and a Langmuir surface area of 4400 m2/g. These values lie slightly above the accessible surface area of 3600 m2/g calculated from the crystal structure, indicating complete evacuation of the pores. Although the BET surface area of 1 exceeds the 3800 m2/g observed for MOF-5, it is still somewhat below that obtained for Zn4O(BTB)2 (MOF-177; 4750 m2/g) and at least two other frameworks with larger pore openings. Nevertheless, it represents the highest value yet reported for a main group metal-organic framework or covalent organic framework.\n\nConsistent with its high surface area, compound 1 shows excellent performance as a hydrogen storage material at higher pressures (see Figure ). At 77 K, the excess H2 uptake reaches a maximum of 6.0 wt % at 20 bar, while the total uptake climbs to 9.2 wt % and 43 g/L at 100 bar. Although these capacities are among the highest recorded to date for a metal-organic framework, the volumetric storage density is still considerably below the 66 g/L achieved in MOF-5. This is due to the larger pores of 1, wherein a significant amount of H2 gas can reside far from the influence of the framework walls. Interestingly, while the H2 storage capacity is dramatically reduced at 298 K, reaching 2.3 wt % and 11 g/L at 95 bar, the combined values are arguably better than those of any other metal-organic framework. To our knowledge, only Mn3[(Mn4Cl)3(BTT)8(MeOH)10]2 (BTT3- = 1,3,5-benzenetristetrazolate), which possesses open metal coordination sites, has a higher volumetric capacity of 12 g/L at 90 bar and 298 K, although its gravimetric uptake is just 1.5 wt %. Here, the relatively good performance of 1 is likely a consequence of its structure, which contains many rings near the 7 \u00c5 diameter calculated as ideal for achieving a high storage density at 298 K.
