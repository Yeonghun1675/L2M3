Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area measurements (N2, 77 K) after activation of the crystals by heating at 150 \u00b0C under dynamic vacuum gave only low values (16, 98 m2/g; 17, 125 m2/g; 18, 58 m2/g; 19, 26 m2/g; 20, 32 m2/g). The low N2 adsorption is likely due to the 2-fold interpenetration of the networks and due to the presence of NEt4 + cations, resulting in a drastically reduced accessible void volume. Digestion 1H NMR of 16-20 after the gas sorption measurement revealed the presence of residual DMF despite the activation process (Figures S27-S31). Digestion 1H NMR experiments also unambiguously confirmed the presence of NEt4 + cations within the network pores. Attempts to activate the crystals by solvent exchange with methanol or acetone gave even lower values for the BET measurements because of collapse of the networks during the exchange process. The sensitivity of the network structure was confirmed by powder XRD analyses of 16 and 18-20, which revealed complete loss of crystallinity upon drying of the materials.\n\nWe also studied the formation of networks using our tritopic clathrochelate 12. The reaction of 12 with [Zn(H2O)6](NO3)2 in a mixture of DMF and DMSO resulted in the formation of transparent block-shaped crystals of 22 (). Crystallographic analysis of 22 showed a 3D network in which all carboxylic acid units of 12 are coordinated to a Zn4O cluster (). As was observed for 17, the zinc cluster is composed of three tetrahedral and one octahedral Zn2+ ion (shown as blue and green polyhedra, respectively). The octahedral ion is coordinated by the central \u03bc4-oxygen atom, three oxygen atoms from the deprotonated carboxylate groups, and two DMSO molecules. Several examples of tritopic carboxylate ligands connected by Zn4O clusters have been reported so far, but to the best of our knowledge, the presence of one octahedral zinc within the Zn4O cluster is unprecedented. Consequently, 22 displays a connectivity slightly different from that observed for MOFs constructed from tritopic carboxylate ligands. The network of 22 is 2-fold-interpenetrated and anionic and, hence, contains NEt4 + cations, as verified by digestion NMR (Figure S32), leading to a material with very low porosity (BET surface area of 21 m2/g).\n\nIn order to assess the versatility of our clathrochelates in the synthesis of other types of MOF, we turned to Zr-MOFs. In 2008, Lillerud and co-workers reported the synthesis of a new inorganic building unit, namely, Zr6O4(OH)4(CO2)12. The solvothermal reaction between ZrCl4 and terephthalic acic or terphenyldicarboxylic acid resulted in the formation of porous materials with specific surface areas of 1187 and 4170 m2/g, which were designated as UiO-66 and UiO-68, respectively. Subsequent work has shown that the 12-fold-coordinated cluster Zr6O4(OH)4(CO2)12 can be reduced to 8-fold and even 6-fold SBUs by using appropriate polycarboxylate ligands.

BET (N2, 77 K) measurements revealed specific surface areas of 410 m2/g (23), 955 m2/g (24), 535 m2/g (25), and 546 m2/g (26). It is worth noting that the surface area of 24 is more than twice that of 23. Both 23 and 24 are based on the same type of ditopic metalloligand, differing only in terms of the equatorial group R (bromo vs tert-butyl). This result suggests that it is possible to use the lateral oximato ligands for modulating the porosity of the MOFs. CO2 (273 K) physisorption experiments revealed high capacities for all Zr-MOFs, with the MOF 24 being able to take up 85 cm3/g at 1 bar. This value is slightly higher than that observed for UiO-66 derivatives.
