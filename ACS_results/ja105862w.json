Unlike structural polymer chains, magnetic chains consist solely of spin triads of nitroxide-copper(II)-nitroxide without alternation with one-spin copper(II) ions, which is vital for theoretical consideration of spin-Peierls-like phenomena. We have also found that the abruptness of spin transitions in breathing crystals correlates with the magnitude of intercluster exchange. This reveals the connection of interchain exchange coupling between spin triads with the cooperativity and is possibly an important step toward the target of designing breathing crystals with desired character of magnetic anomalies.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 27, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Complete ref ; crystallographic data in CIF format for the structures used in quantum-chemical computations; description of EPR results proving the absence of saturation effects in all experiments presented in this work.
