In the trinuclear Cu3 cluster, Cu1 and Cu2 were four-coordinated and connected to two pyrazoles, one \u03bc3-OH, and one BDC ligand, respectively. However, the Cu3 was five-coordinated and linked to two pyrazoles, one \u03bc3-OH, one BDC ligand, and a terminal DMF. The water molecule interacted with the uncoordinated oxygen atoms in BDC by O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bonds (O1W\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O3: 2.80 \u00c5, \u2220DHA = 162\u00b0, O1W\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O7: 2.78 \u00c5, \u2220DHA = 135\u00b0). One guest DMF molecule also interacted with the \u03bc3-OH moiety by O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bond (O1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O10: 2.74 \u00c5, \u2220DHA = 163\u00b0). Interestingly, the guest DMA molecule was protonated and interacted with the water molecule by O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bond (O11-H2O\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O1W: 1.85 \u00c5, \u2220DHA = 167\u00b0) (b). Each Cu3 cluster connected to three BDC ligands, forming a 2D honeycomb sheet (c). Each sheet interacted with guest DMF or DMA molecules by hydrogen bonds and then DMF or DMA interacted with another sheet by weak C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions between the -CH3 groups and the pz moeities, thus forming a 3D supramolecular structure (d). Adjacent two sheets formed 9 \u00c5 \u00d7 13 \u00c5 cavities, which were filled with four guest DMF molecules (e). The phase purity was confirmed by the similarity between the simulated and experimental PXRD patterns (Figure S4). For further investigating the stability of HBNU-1, PXRD were conducted after the sample was treated under different temperatures and in different solvents, respectively. HBNU-1 could be stable to about 80 \u00b0C, and when heated to 100 \u00b0C, the crystallinity got very poor, indicating collapse of framework (Figure S5). In addition, HBNU-1 could be stable in common organic solvents such as DMF, DMA, MeOH, EtOH, and MeCN but could not sustain in water (Figure S6). TGA showed that HBNU-1 had a continuous weight loss before 450 \u00b0C, indicating the unstability nature of HBNU-1 (Figure S7). The N2 adsorption test was tried but failed as the sample of HBNU-1 was collapsed after activation in vacuum at 50 \u00b0C which was confirmed by PXRD (Figure S8).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 15, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Asymmetric unit of\nHBNU-1.
