The Sr1-O4A (2.396(2) \u00c5) and Sr1-O3 (2.411(2) \u00c5) bond lengths corresponding to the bridging ligands are slightly shorter than those for the nonbridging Sr1-O bonds (average 2.509(2) \u00c5). The P-N-P angles for the bridging ligands (139.1(1)\u00b0) are more obtuse than those for the nonbridging ligands (127.6(1)\u00b0). Similar to 4, compound 5 is a dimeric centrosymmetric species with two heptacoordinated barium atoms displaying highly distorted pentagonal-bipyramidal environments (Figure ). Two \u03bc 3 -O atoms (O1 and O1A) from two equivalent molecules of the ligand bridge the barium atoms and form a planar Ba2O2 core with a Ba\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Ba distance of 4.254(7) \u00c5. The second oxygen atoms of these ligand molecules (O2 and O2A) coordinate each to one barium atom. Each barium atom is further coordinated to another molecule of the ligand (O3 and O4) and the oxygen atoms of the hydroxy (O7B) and carbonyl (O5) groups from two molecules of \u03b3-hydroxybutyric acid. The equatorial sites around Ba1 are occupied by O1, O4, O5, O7B, and O3. The first four oxygen atoms and Ba1 are located within the same plane with a mean deviation of 0.049 \u00c5, while O3 lies 0.969 \u00c5 out of the plane. The axial positions are occupied by O1A and O2, giving an axial angle of 155.6(1)\u00b0. In both compounds, the COOH and OH protons are involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonding. On the basis of the coordination environment of the barium, compound 5 is best described as a polymeric chain of inorganic cores linked by molecules of \u03b3-hydroxybutyric acid and surrounded by phenyl groups.
