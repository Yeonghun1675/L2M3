The DFT calculation reveals\na direct band structure, but it should be careful to accept a direct\nband gap of 1.7 eV. In coordination compounds, weak absorption can\nalso be caused by interligand or intraligand charge transfer. The\nweak absorption of <bold>1</bold> from 750 to 1000 nm may be caused\nby the enhanced charge transfer from the dithiocarboxylate group to\nthe nitrogen donor of the pyridine ligand, namely, CSS \u2192 N.\nSuch a charge transfer scheme is presented along with DFT simulated\ncharge density contour plot for <bold>1</bold>.

Compound 1 has an obvious narrower energy gap compared with Py-4-CSSNa, compound 2 and some other silver dithiocarboxylate compounds with Ag-S chains.

After cooling down, 4-(chloromethyl)pyridine hydrochloride (3.28 g, 20 mmol) was added. The mixture was then stirred for 9 h in a 90 \u00b0C oil bath. Then methanol was removed from the resulting mixture under reduced pressure, leaving a yellow solid. Dry tetrahydrofuran (THF; 50 mL) was added to dissolve the yellow solid, and the mixture was filtered with cannula capped with filter paper under nitrogen. Orange solid (2.48 g, 70% yield) was left after THF being removed from the filtrate under reduced pressure, and the product was used without further purification.

Py-4-CSSNa (354 mg, 2 mmol) was dissolved in methanol under N2. The solution was added to an aqueous solution of AgNO3 (340 mg, 2 mmol in 50 mL of degassed water) in an ice bath under N2. Dark green precipitate appeared immediately. The mixture was stirred for 2 h and the solid was isolated by filtration. The solid was washed with water and THF and then dried under N2 (419 mg).
