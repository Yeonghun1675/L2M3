Compound 1 shows a three-dimensional architecture with a  sqc  topology net where the [Cu2(COO)4] unit was viewed as a node. Magnetic studies indicate that strong antiferromagnetic coupling with J = -159.0(9) cm-1 dominates in the compound. As a sensor, the compound based on quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) exhibits good linearity humidity sensing properties after being exposed to various relative humidity environments at room temperature. The resulting sensitivity is about 28.7 Hz/%RH with a good linearity coefficient of 0.993.\n\nMagnetic Properties\n\nTemperature-dependence molar susceptibility measurements of the crystalline sample of 1 were carried out on a Quantum Design MPMS-XL7 SQUID magnetometer in an applied magnetic field of 1 kOe over the temperature range 2-300 K. Plot of \u03c7M T versus T for compound 1 is depicted in . At room temperature, the \u03c7M T value of 1 is 0.52 emu K mol-1, much lower than the spin-only value of 0.75 emu K mol-1 based on two uncoupling copper(II) ions (S = 1/2 and assuming g = 2.0). When the temperature is lowered, the \u03c7M T value decreases rapidly to 0.03 emu K mol-1 at 70 K, suggesting the presence of a strong antiferromagnetic exchange interaction in 1.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this work, a novel Cu(II) coordination polymer [Cu3L2(H2O)2.75]\u22c50.75H2O\u22c51.75DMA based on a semirigid V-shaped tricarboxylate ligand has been successfully synthesized under hydrothermal conditions. The magnetism and humidity sensing properties of 1-based QCM sensor have been investigated. Compound 1 shows a 3-D framework with a  sqc  topology net where the [Cu2(COO)4] unit was viewed as a node. Magnetic studies indicated that compound 1 presents strong antiferromagnetic interactions with J = -159.0(9) cm-1 between the Cu ions.
