As shown in a,b, the Cd(II) atom shows the CdO4N2 octahedral geometry, completed by four carboxylate O atoms from three 1,3-BDC ligands plus two N atoms of two 5-F-1,3-bpeb or syn-dftpmcp ligands. In 1 or 2, two carboxylate groups of the 1,3-BDC ligand exhibit two different coordination modes: linking two Cd(II) atoms via \u03bc-\u03ba1O:\u03ba1O' and bidentate-chelating one Cd(II) center. Two Cd(II) ions in both 1 and 2 share two bridging 1,3-BDC ligands to form a centrosymmetrically dimeric unit of [Cd2(1,3-BDC)2]. These dinuclear secondary building units (SBU) are further interconnected by 1,3-BDC ligands, resulting in a one-dimensional (1D) [Cd2(1,3-BDC)2] n  double chain along the c axis (1) or b axis (2) (Figure S6). Such 1D chains are further linked by 5-F-1,3-bpeb or syn-dftpmcp ligands to yield a 2D network (c,d). In the crystals of 1 and 2, each 2D sheet is bridged by C-F\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions between F and the phenyl rings (3.465 (1), 3.273 (2) \u00c5) of 5-F-1,3-bpeb or syn-dftpmcp, forming a three-dimensional (3D) net with 1D channels (Figure S7). In 2, the Cd-O and Cd-N bond distances are in the normal ranges of 2.245(4)-2.408(4) \u00c5 and 2.296(5)-2.310(4) \u00c5, which are close to the corresponding values in 1 (2.234(3)-2.416(3) \u00c5 and 2.293(3)-2.319(3) \u00c5). The Cd\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cd distance in 2 is 4.288 \u00c5, which is slightly longer than the corresponding value in 1 (4.271 \u00c5). The two 5-fluorophenyl rings of two adjacent 5-F-1,3-bpeb ligands in 1 are almost parallel. After [2 + 2] cycloaddition, the two 5-fluorophenyl groups of syn-dftpmcp in 2 open like a trumpet and their dihedral angle is 31.148(176)\u00b0. PLATON calculation gave the solvent accessible volume of the channel in 1 as 32.1% of the total volume (1033.7 \u00c53 out of the 3225.0 \u00c53 per unit cell volume), while that for 2 was 34.2% of the total volume (1101.1 \u00c53 out of the 3218.3 \u00c53 per unit cell volume). The porosity of MOFs 1 and 2 was also investigated. As-prepared samples were first soaked in MeOH for 3 days and activated at 120 \u00b0C under vacuum for 24 h. We observed no obvious N2 absorption at 77 K, but notable CO2 uptake at 273 K (Figure S8).
