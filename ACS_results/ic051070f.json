However, introduction of the bridging amidinate (N\ue5fbC(Ar)\ue5f8N-) group drastically changes the orbital overlap picture. One important change is the destabilization of the \u03b4*(Re2) orbital by the donation from \u03c0(N\ue5fbC\ue5f8N) orbitals and an increase in the HOMO(\u03b4)-LUMO(\u03b4*) gap. This increase is reflected in the blue shift of \u03bbmax(\u03b4\u2192\u03b4*) from 710 nm for (Bu4N)2[Re2Cl8]1 to 440 nm for 4, as verified by both X\u03b1 and density-functional theory (DFT) calculations of related Re2 species. Understanding the triplet energies requires very high quality calculations such as time-dependent DFT and represents an important challenge.
