The major weight loss step occurs over the range of about 385 to 425 \u00b0C and then slows considerably until the end of the measurement range. The rate of weight loss decreases and almost plateaus at about 600 \u00b0C where about 77% of the original weight remains. The loss is likely due to the removal of 79% of the trifluoromethanesulfonate anions (theoretical 26.1% for all triflates). The product obtained after heating to 600 \u00b0C is Bi2O3 (ICDD PDF # 41-1449). After ex-situ heating to 1000 \u00b0C in ambient atmosphere, the final product is bismuth metal (ICDD PDF # 44-1246).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "SLUG-9", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""},
