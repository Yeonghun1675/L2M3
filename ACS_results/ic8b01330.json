JLU-MOF52 is constructed by a rare 4 + 4 strategy from 4-connected tetrahedral [In(O2C)4]- SBUs and tetrahedral ligands, which can be described as a (4, 4)-connected and forbidden interpenetrated zeolite-like MOF with GIS topology. The framework exhibits significant advantages in terms of chemical stability. N2 adsorption study of the activated JLU-MOF52 material reveals a Langmuir and a BET surface area is 1302 and 966 m2 g-1, respectively. Furthermore, the adsorption amount of CO2 for JLU-MOF52 is studied under 1 atm, which exhibits the highest CO2 capture ability at 273 K among the ZMOFs materials with GIS topology. These characteristics make JLU-MOF52 promising candidate materials for application in moderating increasing atmospheric CO2 levels.\n\nStability Study of JLU-MOF52 \n\nTo assess the thermal stability of JLU-MOF52, we performed TGA in atmosphere. As seen from Figure S3, 82% weight loss is observed over the temperature range of 28-530 \u00b0C because of the elimination of [(CH3)2NH2]+ counterions and DMF molecules, accompanied by collapse of structural framework. It is further proved from variable-temperature PXRD experiments on the as-synthesized samples, and the diffraction peaks show no obvious change and indicate that the structure of the samples can be stable up to 250 \u00b0C (Figure S5a). Meanwhile, the as-synthesized samples were immersed in aqueous solutions of various pH to evaluate the chemically stability for JLU-MOF52. PXRD data obviously demonstrated that the crystallinity and structural framework of JLU-MOF52 can be well retained in pH 5 to pH 9 for 2 days (Figure S5b).\n\nGas Adsorption Properties\n\nTo assess the permanent porosity of desolvated JLU-MOF52, we explored the N2 adsorption isotherm at 77 K. JLU-MOF52 exhibited the typical type-I adsorption isotherm as shown in , which indicated the presence of permanent micropores. Additionally, the calculated total micropore volume of 0.46 cm3 g-1 is smaller than the theoretical value. It can be described that the cavity was occupied by the disordered [(CH3)2NH2]+ counterions, which decreased the space of the pores. On the basis of the N2 adsorption data, a Langmuir and a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area is 1302 and 966 m2 g-1, respectively. Pore size distribution curve through nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) method exhibits a sharp micropore distribution, which is corresponding to the channel diameters in the crystal structure.\n\n JLU-MOF52 is appraised its potential application in adsorption and selective separation of small hydrocarbons, which are mainly derived from natural gas and petroleum. For CH4, C2H6 and C3H8, single-component gas adsorption isotherms for JLU-MOF52 are tested at 1 atm. b shows the uptake capacity for CH4 reaches 40.9 at 273 K and 23.2 cm3 g-1 at 298 K. It is noteworthy that the value at 273 K is much larger than many reported InOFs including (In2X)(Me2NH2)2(DMF)9(H2O)5 (22.5 cm3 g-1), FJI-C1 (15.1 cm3 g-1), InOF-15 (24 cm3 g-1) and InOF-8 (16.6 cm3 g-1). The sorption amount of C2H6 and C3H8 at 273 K for JLU-MOF52 are 119.5 and 110.6 cm3 g-1, whereas that of C2H6 and C3H8 at 298 K are 100.9 and 98.7 cm3 g-1.
