A higher M-water bond distance (2.76-3.00 \u00c5) could be attributed to the easy removal for water molecule in complex 2 compared to the other two complexes (Na-water = 2.299 \u00c5 in complex 1\u22c5H2O; Ca-water = 2.413-2.428 \u00c5 in complex 3\u22c5H2O). Upon further heating a sharp change in weight, 43-45%, occurred. This decrease in weight was related to the loss of ligand-centered carboxylate groups and hence, implied the decomposition of [FeIIIbedik]- unit.
