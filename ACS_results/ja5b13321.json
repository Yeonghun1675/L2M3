In line with this notion, no carbene signal was detected by 13C NMR in the reaction of [Cp*RhCl2]2 with aryldiazoester 9 (), but a new resonance appeared at 70.6 ppm. It was not clear at the outset whether this observation reflected inherent chemical issues or was simply caused by the instability of the complex, which decomposes in solution in <1.5 h at -50 \u00b0C. An X-ray structure clarified the point: As can be seen from , push/pull carbene 19a generated in situ has inserted into one of the Rh-Cl bonds, resulting in the formation of chloroalkyl species 20. This species can be viewed as a functionalized C-metalated rhodium enolate, chiral at metal and at the metalated C atom; it is formed as a single diastereomer. To compensate for the loss of an anionic ligand, the now formally 16-electron Rh(III) center engages with the aromatic ring, as evident from the short contacts to the ipso C atoms and one of the ortho C atoms. This interaction likely persists in solution as suggested by the high-field shift of the corresponding C atoms (broad signals at ~94 and ~116 ppm). The comparatively long Rh1-C1 (2.1226(12) \u00c5) and C1-C4 (1.4666(17) \u00c5) bonds clearly reflect the loss of true carbene character. (Note that 20 is still \"carbenoid\" in the sense that it contains a carbon atom carrying at the same time a metal and a leaving group.)", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 32, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch5\" position=\"float\">\n<label>5</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Preparation of Rh\u00ad(III) Half-Sandwich Carbene Complexes<xref rid=\"s5fn1\"></xref>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr5\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ja-2015-133216_0003.tif\"></graphic>\n<p>\n<fn id=\"s5fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>Reagents and conditions: (a) <bold>9</bold>, FC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>/CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, 0 \u00b0C \u2192 \u221220\n\u00b0C; (b) 2 AgSbF<sub>6</sub>,\nMeCN; and (c) <bold>9</bold>, MeOH, 0 \u00b0C \u2192 \u221220\n\u00b0C</p>\n</fn>\n</p>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 5  Preparation of Rh(III) Half-Sandwich Carbene Complexes      a Reagents and conditions: (a) 9, FC6H5/CH2Cl2, 0 \u00b0C \u2192 -20 \u00b0C; (b) 2 AgSbF6, MeCN; and (c) 9, MeOH, 0 \u00b0C \u2192 -20 \u00b0C   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 33, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>\n<fn id=\"s5fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>Reagents and conditions: (a) <bold>9</bold>, FC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>/CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, 0 \u00b0C \u2192 \u221220\n\u00b0C; (b) 2 AgSbF<sub>6</sub>,\nMeCN; and (c) <bold>9</bold>, MeOH, 0 \u00b0C \u2192 \u221220\n\u00b0C</p>\n</fn>\n</p><p>The formation of <bold>20</bold> is\nthought to illustrate the exceptional\nelectron demand of the transient Rh\u00ad(III) carbene <bold>19a</bold>,\nwhich engenders the halide shift at low temperature.
