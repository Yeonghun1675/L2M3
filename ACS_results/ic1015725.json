For example, Kitagawa et al. recently reported the synthesis of a cyanide-based magnet that displays a reversible change in its structural dimensionality between a two- and a three-dimensional coordination network upon solvent absorption/desorption.

The concerted reorganization of the coordination bonds and hydrogen bonds in the manganese coordination sphere is accompanied by other modifications in the hydrogen bond network in the crystal lattice. Indeed, the coordinated water molecule, which forms a second hydrogen bond with the peripheral uncoordinated nitrogen atoms of the bpym ligand, switches from one peripheral nitrogen atom to the other as this water molecule undergoes a displacement (Figure ) [N(10)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O(1) = 2.978(5) and 2.977(7) \u00c5 in 1b and 2b, respectively]. The N-O-N angles in the two phases are compatible with the coexistence of both hydrogen bonds [N(6)O(1)N(10) = 124.97(13) and 125.20(15)\u00b0 in 1b and 2b, respectively]. This topo-chemical reaction can also be described as a \"complex-as-ligand\" exchange: while one [Fe(2){HB(pz)3}(CN)3]- bridging unit of the hexanuclear molecule is disconnected to become a pending group of the final chain, the [Fe(1)[HB(pz)3](CN)3]- pending units of the neighboring hexanuclear molecules (located in trans position) get coordinated to the manganese(II) ion to become a bridging unit along the chain. This results in the formation of a zigzag chain where one [Fe(1){HB(pz)3}(CN)3]- unit acts as a bis-monodentate ligand toward the manganese site and another one, [Fe(2){HB(pz)3}(CN)3]-, acts as a monodentate ligand toward the manganese(II) ion. Finally, the intramolecular metal-metal distances are slightly longer in 1b/2b than in 1a/2a [Fe(2)-C(1)N(1)-Mn = 5.294(1)/5.293(1) \u00c5; Fe(1)-C(2)N(2)-Mn = 5.181(1)/5.182(1) \u00c5, Fe(2)-C(4)N(4)-Mn = 5.194(1)/5.196(1) \u00c5].", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 28, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>The properties of the compounds have been investigated using spectroscopic, optical, and magnetic techniques.
