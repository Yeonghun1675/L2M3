All four cyanide ligands are involved in side-on binding to varying numbers of K+ ions: for the cyanide ligands containing N atoms N(3), N(4), N(5), and N(6), the number of such side-on interactions to different K+ ions is two, two, three, and one, respectively [Figure a]. The cyanide group containing N(5) is also involved in an end-on Ru-CN-K cyanide bridge.
