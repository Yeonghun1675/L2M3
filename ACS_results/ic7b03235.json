Their channel windows are shifted from square forms with dimensions of 19.9 \u00c5 \u00d7 19.9 \u00c5 in NTOU-1 to rhombus-shaped types with dimensions of 23.3 \u00c5 \u00d7 12.3 \u00c5 in NTOU-2 and 31.5 \u00c5 \u00d7 12.8 \u00c5 in NTOU-3 (). The nonframework space within the structure was estimated to be 61.2% (through PLATON calculation) of the unit-cell volume for NTOU-1 (55.6% for NTOU-2 and 58.0% for NTOU-3).
