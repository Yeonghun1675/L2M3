To characterize the surface properties, isosteric heats of adsorption were calculated using CO2 at 263 and 273 K and CH4 at 268 and 278 K (Figure S4 in the ). The zero-loading heats of adsorption were found to be 23.9 kJ mol-1 for CO2 and 14.5 kJ mol-1 for CH4, both of which are low values comparable to those of some hydrophobic MOF materials, suggesting a weakly polarizing pore surface despite the acidic nature of the material.
