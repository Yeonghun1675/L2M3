Gas sorption data in conjunction with computational studies validate a strong affinity toward CO2 across all loadings in the case of fsc-1-NDS as expressed by a nearly steady Q st value. The use of longer linkers obliterates that synergy, and as a result, both binding sites behave independently, thus causing a significant drop in the CO2 Q st at higher loading due to the weaker interactions. We have also successfully demonstrated the effect of pillar geometry on tuning the UMCs through the substitution of an angular NDS pillar with a linear SiF6 2- pillar that tunes the alignment of the unsaturated copper paddlewheel moieties with a short Cu-Cu distance of 5.86 \u00c5. This space represents a single-molecule trap, which closely fits one CO2 molecule. Our gas sorption data reveals the strong affinity of fsc-2-SIFSIX toward CO2, as exemplified by a high Q st value at low loading and a high CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivity at 298 K and 1.0 atm. Computational studies attribute this behavior to the dual interaction of CO2 with the unsaturated Cu2+ centers from the adjacent [Cu2(CO2R)4] moieties. We therefore anticipate that other fsc nets containing SiF6 2- and other inorganic pillars will further improve Q st and selectivity, and studies to address this matter are currently underway in our laboratory. This study therefore offers a prototypal model that demonstrates the crucial role of tuning the UMCs, the pore chemistry, and pore size for highly selective gas adsorption in porous materials.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 45, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information\nis available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.cgd.5b01632\">10.1021/acs.cgd.5b01632</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Additional gas\nadsorption isotherms, crystallographic\ntables, and modeling details.

The CO2 uptakes of fsc-1-NDS, fsc-2-NDS, fsc-4-NDS, and fsc-5-NDS at 298 K and 1.0 atm were observed to be 88 cm3 g-1 (99 cm3 cm-3), 55 cm3 g-1 (47 cm3 cm-3), 62 cm3 g-1 (46 cm3 cm-3), and 73 cm3 g-1 (61 cm3 cm-3), respectively ( for fsc-1-NDS, fsc-2-NDS, and fsc-5-NDS; Figure S18 for fsc-4-NDS). The isosteric heats of adsorption (Q st ) of CO2 were calculated using adsorption data collected at 273 and 298 K according to the virial equation (see SI, Figures S24-S28).  shows that the CO2 Q st for fsc-1-NDS is nearly steady across all loadings and is greater than that of fsc-2-NDS and fsc-5-NDS even though all three MOMs exhibit the same functionality. We attribute the higher affinity of fsc-1-NDS toward CO2 to the synergy between the primary and secondary binding sites, which is available only for fsc-1-NDS as a result of the shorter distance between the oxygen atom of the sulfonate group and the copper paddlewheels ().  Similar observations for the impact of pore size on CO2 adsorption has been reported by us and others, in particular Q st and CO2/N2 selectivity (see SI, Figure S43). Note, the experimental CO2 Q st values reported herein for fsc-1-NDS, fsc-2-NDS, and fsc-5-NDS are in good agreement to those produced from molecular simulation in the respective variants (see SI, Figures S39, S41-S42). Because of the small pore size for fsc-1-NDS, this MOM was also found to exhibit a sharp increase at low loading for H2 at 77 K (see SI, Figure S20).\n\nPermanent porosity was confirmed via CO2 adsorption measurements at 195 K, which reveal Langmuir surface areas of 833 and 757 m2 g-1 for fsc-2-SIFSIX and fsc-2-NDS, respectively (see SI, Figures S14-S15). CO2, CH4, and N2 adsorption isotherms were collected at 298 K, and it was discovered that fsc-2-SIFSIX displayed high affinity toward CO2, as exemplified by the higher CO2 uptakes at the low-pressure regions compared to CH4 and N2 (see c). The CO2 uptakes in fsc-2-SIFSIX and fsc-2-NDS at 298 K and 1.0 atm were measured to be 69 cm3 g-1 (54 cm3 cm-3) and 55 cm3 g-1 (47 cm3 cm-3), respectively, whereas the CH4 and N2 uptakes are 15.5 and 16.3 cm3 g-1, and 4.8 and 6.0 cm3 g-1, respectively. fsc-2-SIFSIX therefore outperforms fsc-2-NDS with respect to CO2 sorption.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "fsc-1-NDS", "symbol": "", "chemical
