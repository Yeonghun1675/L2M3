The association of these polymer chains, through host-guest synthons and \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 stacking interactions, leads to an infinite interwoven 2-D sheet topology in the solid state. This structure represents an elegant example whereby the solid state structure of one of the building blocks (3) is echoed in the resulting supramolecular assembly.
