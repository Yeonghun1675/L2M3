Although the porous coordination cages retain crystallinity upon solvent removal, it is decreased during activation to the point of precluding the use of diffraction studies to interrogate binding sites. PCN-81, however, remains highly crystalline upon degassing. Refinement of data collected on an activated sample reveals it is significantly less distorted upon evacuation () compared to its solvated state. At a CD4:Cu loading of 1:1, three main adsorption sites are apparent. Although the framework is composed of three types of pores, the methane is exclusively adsorbed in the M12(cdc)12 cage. A primary adsorption site is the open copper(II) center with a Cu-C distance of 2.777(5) \u00c5 and an occupancy of 0.63(3). A site with similar occupancy (0.64(3)) is at the edge of a carbazole ligand with Cmethane-Cligand distances of 3.27 and 3.69 \u00c5. This methane molecule is only present in six of the eight triangular windows of the Cu12(cdc)12 building unit. Together, these two adsorption sites form the basis for the lowest occupancy site (0.28(3)) in a triangular pocket between two of the metal-bound CD4 and a carbazole-bound CD4 with methane-methane distances of 2.79-4.13 \u00c5 (). At double the methane loading, a number of additional sites are populated. The occupancy of the first two sites are essentially unchanged while the occupancy of the third site increases to 0.37(3). At this loading, the final two triangular windows of the cage are populated at their three corners. An additional adsorption site on the inside of the cage and the copper on the exterior bind methane at this loading. Increasing the methane dose to 4.0/Cu reveals no additional CD4 binding sites, although the overall occupancy increases. Interestingly, at this loading the small cage in PCN-81 remains the only one that is occupied. Furthermore, the concurrent population of multiple adsorption sites in PCN-81 is consistent with the shallow nature of the adsorption isotherm, which indicates a lack of very strong methane binding sites. Eight methane adsorption sites are related by symmetry to afford a total methane capacity of 49 molecules per cage. This corresponds to a methane adsorption capacity of approximately 260 cm3/g, a value PCN-81 reaches by 35 bar. At this pressure, the two additional pores in the material remain unoccupied but would allow for additional storage at higher pressures. At lower pressures, the two other pores are essentially empty space that is detrimental to the density, and thus volumetric capacity of the material. This is consistent with the nearly equal volumetric adsorption capacities of PCN-81, Cr12(cdc)12, and Mo12(cdc)12 at 35 bar and 298 K.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 13, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig4\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(Upper) Structure of activated PCN-81.\n(Lower) CD<sub>4</sub> adsorption\nin PCN-81 as determined by powder neutron diffraction.
