To investigate the anion's effect, a noncoordinating anion was used to synthesize coordination polymers. Using the reaction of L and Zn(NO3)2\u22c56H2O, instead of CuCl2\u22c52H2O and CoCl2\u22c52H2O, under the same reaction conditions, new complex 5 was successfully prepared. Cobalt(II) complex with an identical composition was reported recently. X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed that 5 crystallized in the monoclinic form with space group P21/n. The coordination environment around the cobalt atom in complex 5 is exhibited in Figure a. The asymmetric unit of 5 contained one zinc(II) center sitting on an inversion center with one L and one nitrate anion. Each Zn(II) was coordinated by four N atoms from four different ligands L with a N-Zn-N bond angle from 87.45(14)\u00b0 to 180.0\u00b0 and Zn-N bond distances of 2.148(3) and 2.172(3) \u00c5 (). Two additional positions were occupied by two O (water) atoms with a Zn-O bond distance of 2.126(3) \u00c5, which were comparable to those of reported Co(II) complexes. Therefore, the local coordination geometry around Zn(II) in 5 can be regarded as compressed octahedron with an N4O2 donor set, which was somewhat similar to coordination geometry in 2 but with a N4O2 rather than a N4Cl2 chromophore. The compositions in 5 were somewhat similar to that in 2 due to an identical metal to ligand ratio. There were coordinating water molecules in 5, which were different from the coordinating chloride in 2 and 4. Similar to that in 2 and 4, L in 5 served as a bidentate ligand connecting two Zn centers. However, the conformation of the ligand in 5 is different from that in 2 and 4. L in 5 was in trans configuration (Figure a). The two coordinating triazoles were trans relative to each other. N6 was free and cis to N3-containing triazole.

These three crystalline water molecules were divided into two categories. The first two water molecules were lost under 112 \u00b0C, and the remaining one was lost from 112 to 150 \u00b0C. The framework remained stable up to 190 \u00b0C. The weight loss of 7.50% from 190 to 247 \u00b0C corresponded to release CO2 from the coordinated malonate (7.52%). Complex 8 exhibited a total weight loss of 10.17% from room temperature to 150 \u00b0C, which agreed with the departure of water molecules (calcd 10.22%). The framework was stable in temperature ranges from 150 to 280 \u00b0C. The framework started to decompose L from ~290 \u00b0C. The 72.46% weight was lost up to 690 \u00b0C, which corresponded to the loss of all ligand L (calcd. 68.17%). The percentage of the remnant was 17.37% corresponding to ZnO (calcd 17.36%).\n\nThe mixed inorganic-organic hybrid coordination polymers were investigated for fluorescence properties and for potential applications. The photoluminescence properties of complexes 5-8 were studied in the solid state at room temperature. The measurements were carried out under the same experimental conditions and excited at a wavelength of 375 nm. As shown in , the maximum emission wavelength of complexes 5-8 was at 446 nm, 423 and 443 nm, respectively, which was close to that of the free L (emission maximum at 424 nm upon excitation at 375 nm). The emissions observed in complexes 5-8 were tentatively assigned to the \u03c0-\u03c0 intra ligand fluorescence due to their close resemblance of the emission bands. \n\nReferences\n\nAr adsorption experiments at 77 K indicate that 8 has a very small surface area. The Quantachrome experts in Beijing say that this often happens. This possibly because the sample is air or moisture sensitive.
