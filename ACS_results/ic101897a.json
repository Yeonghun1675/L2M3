This situation should give only two ordered phases, but we observe three, indicating that the relationship between J and D is not straightforward. In this particular case, we postulate that all four parameters in the Hamiltonian; D 1, D 2, J 1, and J 2 have similar magnitudes. This allows us to tentatively suggest the following mechanism for the transitions to phases A, B, and C. At 8 K, the moments order according to the symmetry as determined by single ion effects of Co2. As the temperature is lowered, the effect of the exchange interaction is to perturb the ordered structure; initially this causes the observed incommensurability, however, at 6.2 K this becomes critical and phase B is observed. The final phase transition is caused by the ordering of the moments of Co1; the temperature of this transition is suppressed because of the frustration inherent in the ordering of Co2. This exchange topology has been studied theoretically in the case of mixed S and mixed anisotropy systems. Depending on the ratio of anisotropy to exchange interactions, different ground states are predicted.
