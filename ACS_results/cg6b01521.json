After 40 min the temperature was set to 15 \u00b0C for 2 h. Then, the stirring was reduced to 30 rpm, and the solution was stirred for 3 days and 16 h at 15 \u00b0C. Stirring was halted and the suspension filtered over a glass frit under reduced pressure (borosilicat glass, porosity: 1). The solid product was dried at 40 \u00b0C for 1 day and 609 g (1.45 mol) of the cocrystalline sucrose\u22c5NaCl\u22c52H2O were obtained as a white powder (yield: 58%).\n\nSynthesis via Seeding Crystallization\n\nA total of 210 mL of deionized water was placed at room temperature in a 1.5 L thermostated glass reactor equipped with mechanical bottom stirring (IKA LR 1000), internal temperature control, and a water condenser. While stirring 91 g (1.56 mol) of sodium chloride and 504 g (1.47 mol) of d-(+)-sucrose were added over a period of 10 min. Then, the temperature was set to 85 \u00b0C, and a colorless, homogeneous solution was obtained after stirring for 45 min. Afterward, the temperature was set to 25 \u00b0C and the solution was cooled to 25 \u00b0C within 105 min. At this point, the stirring was reduced to 30 rpm, and 500 mg (1.14 mmol) of seeding crystals (sucrose\u22c5NaCl\u22c52H2O) were carefully added to the solution. Crystallization (formation of a suspension) occurred within the next minutes. Stirring was continued for 24 h at 25 \u00b0C. The suspension was subsequently filtered over a glass frit under reduced pressure (borosilicat glass, porosity: 3). The solid product was dried at 40 \u00b0C for 15 h, and 250 g (0.572 mol) of the cocrystalline sucrose\u22c5NaCl\u22c52H2O was obtained as a white powder (yield: 39%). The identity and phase purity of the obtained sucrose\u22c5NaCl\u22c52H2O crystals were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction methods.", "data": [["(SyntaxError('invalid syntax', ('<unknown>', 2, 1, \"['chemical_synthesis', 'filtration', 'washing', 'drying']\\n\")), \"['chemical_synthesis', 'filtration', 'washing', 'drying']\\n['chemical_synthesis', 'filtration', 'washing', 'drying']\\n['chemical_mechanical_polishing']\\n['chemical_synthesis']\\n['chemical_synthesis', 'filtration', 'washing', 'drying']\\n['chemical_synthesis', 'filtration', 'washing', 'drying']\\n['chemical_synthesis']\\n['chemical_synthesis']\\n['chemical_synthesis', 'filtration', 'drying']\\n['chemical_synthesis', 'filtration', 'washing', 'drying']\\n['chemical_synthesis', 'filtration', 'washing', 'drying']\\n['chemical_synthesis', 'filtration']\")"]], "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"text-synthesis-type": "['chemical_synthesis', 'filtration', 'washing', 'drying']\n['chemical_synthesis', 'filtration', 'washing', 'drying']\n['chemical_mechanical_polishing']\n['chemical_synthesis']\n['chemical_synthesis', 'filtration', 'washing', 'drying']\n['chemical_synthesis', 'filtration', 'washing', 'drying']\n['chemical_synthesis']\n['chemical_synthesis']\n['chemical_synthesis', 'filtration', 'drying']\n['chemical_synthesis', 'filtration', 'washing', 'drying']\n['chemical_synthesis', 'filtration', 'washing', 'drying']\n['chemical_synthesis', 'filtration']"}}, {"idx": 4, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Examples\nof Carbohydrates Forming Ionic Cocrystals with Sodium Chloride</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cg-2016-01521e_0009.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Examples of Carbohydrates Forming Ionic Cocrystals with Sodium Chloride   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 9, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Fit of the calculated powder X-ray diffraction pattern (red) to\nthe observed one (blue) for <sc>d</sc>-ribose\u00b7NaCl.
