The pores might have been formed by the confinement of liberated coordinating guest molecules and organic ligands. These phenomena were also supported by the variable temperature XRPD patterns (see ). The XRPD pattern of as-synthesized Mg-aph-MOF showed strong reflections in the region 5-25\u00b0, which were commensurate with the simulated pattern from single crystal X-ray diffraction data (see ). Up to 160 \u00b0C the typical patterns of Mg-aph-MOF were retained, except for a slight broadening and shift of the peaks. However, above 275 \u00b0C all peaks from the crystalline Mg-aph-MOF disappeared, indicating that the MOF solid lost crystallinity as well as long-range orderings. When the temperature reached 350 \u00b0C, the pores were widely distributed over the solid, which implied the generation and confinement of large amounts of organic substances at the high temperature (Figure d). The shapes of the pores were still irregular, and the crystalline metal oxide had not yet formed. However, upon further heating to 500 \u00b0C, the size distribution of the spherical pores became narrower (Figure e), and the resultant solid started to show crystallinity (see ). Finally, after thermal treatment of Mg-aph-MOF at 500 \u00b0C for 12 h under inert atmosphere, highly crystalline 3D nanoporous MgO, np-MgO-500 was produced (Figure f). Comparison of the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) results for the cross sections of Mg-aph-MOF heated at 350 \u00b0C and np-MgO-500 also supported this evolution process; the former still possessed the organic porogens in the solid, but the latter contained a high distribution of pores and hierarchical structures (Figure g-i). To investigate the organic substances which were generated by thermolysis over each temperature range, the Mg-aph-MOF was analyzed by pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (py-GC/MS, ). As shown in , even below 300 \u00b0C, the evolution of new organic species was detected, and at higher temperature, many organic substances with high boiling points were generated. This indicated that during the thermal treatment of Mg-aph-MOF, decomposed organic fragments reacted to yield new species, which were confined in the solid until the temperatures were high enough to evaporate them.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 11, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig3\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Temperature-dependent evolution of porous structures\nduring conversion\nof Mg-<italic toggle=\"yes\">aph</italic>-MOF to nanoporous MgO.
