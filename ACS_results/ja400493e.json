The axial coordination strategy via a coordination site coplanar with the chlorophyll plane as exemplified by 2 has an intrinsic weakness in the construction of light-harvesting antennae because the chromophores organized in this coordination mode are arranged in mutually perpendicular orientations. The perpendicular orientation is unfavorable for Fo\u0308rster-type energy transfer, which relies on dipole-dipole interactions. Approximating the transition dipole moments as lying in the direction of the diagonal line connecting the nitrogen in pyrrole A bearing the pyridylvinyl group and the nitrogen in pyrrole C, we calculated the factors \u03ba2/r 6, where \u03ba2 is the orientation factor and r is the interchromophore center-to-center distance (). These factors are expected to be proportional to the energy transfer rates among the chromophores in the double helices in the crystal. As expected, energy transfer along the intrastrand pathways is not efficient, with \u03ba2/r 6 values of 7-9 \u00d7 10-9 \u00c5-6 between the nearest neighbors in the same strand due to vanishingly small orientation factors (\u03ba2 = 0.03-0.05). However, the \u03ba2/r 6 factors are 2 orders of magnitude larger (225 \u00d7 10-9 and 162 \u00d7 10-9 \u00c5-6) between nearest neighbors residing in complementary strands. Even the \u03ba2/r 6 factors between next-nearest neighbors residing in complementary strands are large (166 \u00d7 10-9 and 157 \u00d7 10-9 \u00c5-6) because of favorable orientations (\u03ba2 = 1.42 and 1.51, respectively). Thus, the double-helical architecture confers efficient, contiguous interstrand energy transfer pathways along which energy migrates among chromophores belonging to complementary strands alternatively in the double helix, even in the case that intrastrand energy transfer is slow. This analysis demonstrates that the double helices have a functional significance as a light-harvesting antennae in addition to the aesthetic beauty. In this particular crystal structure, inter-double-helix pathways should be even more efficient because of the \u03c0-\u03c0 overlap (Figure c,d) and parallel orientation.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 16, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>For the double-helical\nstructures reported herein, unlike other\nstaircase structures, isolation of each double helix may be possible\nby peripheral modification of the molecular structure.
