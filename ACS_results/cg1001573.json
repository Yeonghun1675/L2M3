A successful strategy in synthesizing novel porous MOFs with unique structures and properties is hydrothermal/solvothermal synthesis by incorporating appropriate metal ions (connectors) with multifunctional bridging ligands (linkers). In this regard, the organic ligands play crucial roles in determining the resulted polymeric structures, because the change in the type of bridging units, the flexibility of the molecular backbone, and the conformational preference can lead to a remarkable class of materials bearing diverse architectures and impressive potential functions.
