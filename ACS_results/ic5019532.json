Semiquinonate is an organic radical anion with S = 1/2 and is one of the redox series of dioxolene that can produce three redox isomers of benzoquinone (BQ), semiquinonate (SQ\u22c5-), and catecholate (Cat2-). Furthermore, metal-dioxolene complexes with very close energy levels between the frontier orbitals of the metal d and dioxolene \u03c0* orbitals can undergo intramolecular charge transfer between the metal and ligand, the so-called valence tautomerism.

Compounds 2 and 3 comprise neutral 1D chains of complex molecules stacked in a staggered arrangement with average Rh-Rh distances of 2.88 \u00c5 for 2 and 3.09 \u00c5 for 3, which are considerably shorter than that for 1 (3.28 \u00c5).

In contrast, we observed the latter compound 3 to exhibit unprecedented bistable multifunctionality with respect to its magnetic and conductive properties in the temperature range 228-207 K. The observed bistability results from thermal hysteresis arising from a first-order phase transition. The 1D chains in 3 are connected three-dimensionally by interchain C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bonds between methoxy groups of semiquinonato ligands, and the transition induces a drastic structural change accompanying the exchange of the C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen-bond partners between the semiquinonato ligands.

The results for compound 4 are shown in Figure . The electrical conductivity \u03c3 of 4 at room temperature is 7.8 \u00d7 10-5 S cm-1, which is 1 order of magnitude smaller than that of 3 measured using a single crystal (4.8 \u00d7 10-4 S cm-1) because it was measured using a compressed pellet. The temperature dependence of the resistivity of 4 in the RT phase exhibits very small temperature dependence and an unusual decrease below a maximum at 245 K before reaching a minimum at 218 K. The unusual decrease observed in the resistivity can be ascribed to the crossover from a semiconductor with a small activation energy of E a = 31 meV (280-255 K) in the RT phase to a semiconductor with a large activation energy of E a = 199 meV (192-142 K) in the LT phase, as seen in Figure .

The observed thermal anomaly indicates the presence of room-temperature (RT) and low-temperature (LT) phases. The excess enthalpy and entropy of the phase transition were determined to be 1.501(17) kJ mol-1 and 6.632(79) J K-1 mol-1, respectively. Even if the observed entropy originates from the S = 1/2 spins of the semiquinonato ligands alone, the actual entropy acquisition is larger than the maximum entropy gain \u0394S = R ln 2 = 5.76 J K-1 mol-1, which is expected for an S = 1/2 spin state. In this compound, the distinct structural disorder that would contribute to the entropy gain was not apparently observed. A similar tendency was already observed in compound 3, in which the changes in intramolecular and lattice vibrations are considered to contribute to the excess entropy, in addition to certain contribution from the S = 1/2 spins. Therefore, not only certain contributions from the S = 1/2 spins but also similar changes in the intramolecular and lattice vibrations would contribute to the excess entropy observed in 4.

The \u03c7M T value at 300 K is 0.225 emu K mol-1, which is only two-thirds of the spin-only value of S = 1/2 (0.375 emu K mol-1) and is almost constant at temperatures down to ca. 240 K. The \u03c7M T values then exhibit an abrupt increase with the first-order phase transition, which is accompanied by a very small thermal hysteresis between 232 and 231 K. As the temperature is decreased in the LT phase, the \u03c7M T value drastically increases to a maximum of 10.93 emu K mol-1 at 12 K and then decreases rapidly. The rapid increase in the \u03c7M T value suggests the presence of a very strong ferromagnetic interaction operating between the semiquinonato radicals of neighboring molecules stacked in the 1D chain. These magnetic behaviors are similar to those observed for 3; however, compound 4 does not exhibit a large hysteresis because of the absence of a significant structural change with the first-order phase transition. Although the LT phase of 3 exhibits magnetic anisotropy, where the easy axis of magnetization is parallel to the 1D chain direction, the magnetic anisotropy in 4 could not be confirmed because of its small crystal size. The \u03c7M value also shows a maximum at 11 K and again slightly increases below 5 K upon further cooling ( Figure S8). The appearance of the maximum in \u03c7M is a manifestation of an antiferromagnetic phase transition due to antiferromagnetic coupling between the ferromagnetic 1D chains. The maximum observed in \u03c7M disappears for H > 2 kOe ( Figure S9), indicating a field-induced transition from the antiferromagnetic to a ferromagnetic ground state. Furthermore, note that the increase in \u03c7M observed below 5 K after the antiferromagnetic phase transition suggests the existence of uncompensated residual spin moments.\n\nTo further clarify the magnetic ground-state characteristics of 4, we measured the field-dependent isothermal magnetization at 2 K (Figure ). The magnetization M first increases slowly with increasing magnetic field, similar to the behavior of a typical antiferromagnet, and then increases abruptly above 1 kOe, implying the onset of a field-induced spin-flip transition from the spin-canting antiferromagnetic phase of the ferromagnetic chains to a ferromagnetic phase, which is characteristic of a metamagnet. This behavior is also confirmed by the field-dependent magnetization shown in  Figure S12. The critical field H c estimated from the sharp peak in the dM/dH versus H curve is 1.25 kOe. Upon a further increase in the magnetic field above H c, M increases very slowly and reaches 0.815 N\u03b2 at 50 kOe, which is slightly smaller than the expected saturation magnetization of 1.0 N\u03b2 for S = 1/2 spin. The magnetization M smaller than expected saturation magnetization is probably a result of magnetic anisotropy, as observed for the aligned needle-shaped crystals of compound 3, where the easy magnetization axis is parallel to the 1D chain direction. The inset of Figure  indicates that 4 is a soft magnet displaying a magnetic hysteresis loop with a coercive field of 88 Oe and remnant magnetization of 42 emu Oe mol-1 (0.0076 N\u03b2) ( Figure S13), and the observed hysteresis is in agreement with the results of the ZFCM, FCM, and RM measurements.\n\n[Rh(3,6-DBSQ-4,5-(N,N'-DEN))(CO)2]\u221e (5)\n\nThe temperature dependences of \u03c7M T and \u03c7M -1 of 5 measured on a polycrystalline sample under an applied field of 5 kOe are shown in Figure . The \u03c7M T value of 5 at 300 K is 0.216 emu K mol-1, which is only two-thirds of the spin-only value of S = 1/2 (0.375 emu K mol-1). When the temperature is lowered, the \u03c7M T value gradually decreases and reaches a minimum of 0.189 emu K mol-1 at 152 K. It then slightly increases to a maximum of 0.193 emu K mol-1 at 72 K, followed by a rapid decrease to 0.0562 emu K mol-1 at 2 K. The fittings of the Curie-Weiss law in the temperature ranges 300-228 K and 152-76 K give C = 0.304 emu K mol-1 and \u03b8 = -123 K and C = 0.185 emu K mol-1 and \u03b8 = +5.4 K, respectively. These Curie constants are quite smaller than the value expected for an S = 1/2 spin. Given the slight increase in \u03c7M T with decreasing temperature despite the smaller Curie constant compared with the spin-only value of S = 1/2, this complicated magnetic behavior is attributed to a competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings and/or next-nearest-neighbor interactions, as predicted by the DFT calculations of compound 3. Therefore, we could not evaluate the magnetic interaction in 5 using a theoretical equation.\n\nElectrical Properties\n\nThe temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity \u03c1 of compounds 4 and 5 was measured on compressed pellets using a pseudo-four-probe ac method (100 Hz). The results for compound 4 are shown in Figure . The electrical conductivity \u03c3 of 4 at room temperature is 7.8 \u00d7 10-5 S cm-1, which is 1 order of magnitude smaller than that of 3 measured using a single crystal (4.8 \u00d7 10-4 S cm-1) because it was measured using a compressed pellet. The temperature dependence of the resistivity of 4 in the RT phase exhibits very small temperature dependence and an unusual decrease below a maximum at 245 K before reaching a minimum at 218 K. The unusual decrease observed in the resistivity can be ascribed to the crossover from a semiconductor with a small activation energy of E a = 31 meV (280-255 K) in the RT phase to a semiconductor with a large activation energy of E a = 199 meV (192-142 K) in the LT phase, as seen in Figure . A similar change in conductive properties from a small thermally activated behavior (E a = 88 meV) in the RT phase to a relatively large thermally activated behavior (E a = 386 meV) in the LT phase has been reported for 3. A distinct difference between the crystal structures of the RT and LT phases observed for both compounds 3 and 4 is that the thermal ellipsoids of rhodium and its neighboring coordinated atoms in the RT phase are unusually elongated along the 1D chain direction compared with those in the LT phase. This feature can be interpreted as large-amplitude thermal vibrations of these atoms. According to the DFT calculations of 3, the charge carriers are considered to be generated by the thermal excitation of electrons from a filled 1D d band formed by d z 2  orbitals to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels composed of the vacant semiquinonato \u03c0* orbitals (Figure a). When a substantial decrease in the Rh-Rh distance accompanies the large-amplitude Rh-Rh vibration, the d band widens and its upper levels are expected to approach the vacant \u03c0* orbitals as shown in Figure b. Thus, the thermal excitation of electrons would become easier with decreasing Rh-Rh distance, and unusual conductive behavior would be observed in the RT phase.
