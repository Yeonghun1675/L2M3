Compared to the performance of other MOF-based separation materials (), it is worth noting that NbU-1 exhibits the longest dimensionless breakthrough time (\u03c4break) of C2H2 for the 50/50 mixtures with a specific constant flow rate of 2 mL/min, and for the 1/99 mixtures, the \u03c4break of C2H2 is only lower than UTSA-200a and illustrates the excellent kinetic factors; especially the fastest diffusion rate of C2H2 and excellent stability promoted NbU-1 to be an extremely practical material for C2H2/C2H4 separations. There is no obvious enhancement of the separation of acetylene/ethane compared to acetylene/ethylene. For ethylene/ethane, there is no separation effect for NbU-1, which was also caused by the faster diffusion rate of ethane than ethylene ().", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 14, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig4\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Breakthrough curves for\nC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> separations\n(50/50) (a) and (1/99) (b).</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr4\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ja-2018-13463x_0004.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 4  Breakthrough curves for C2H2/C2H4 separations (50/50) (a) and (1/99) (b).
