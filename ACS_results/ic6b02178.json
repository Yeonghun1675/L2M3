For topology analysis, the organic spacers of bpy and Let/pr 2- are represented by sticks and the Zn atoms are placed at the joints. The simplification procedure allows the structure to be a 4-c uninodal diamond (dia) net with a point symbol of (66) (b and d).

The excited electrons from the conduction band of an MOF are suggested to transfer to the valence band of an electron-deficient NAC. The quenching mechanism in the current system (1 and 2) can be similarly interpreted. We speculated that the HOMO of the framework is similar to that of the ligand because the positions of the emission peaks are almost identical to each other. From the DFT calculations, the LUMO of an analyte is lower than the LUMO of the ligand used (Figure S19).
