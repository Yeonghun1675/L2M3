To investigate the water stability of these complexes, bond formation between the metal center and the entering water molecule was calculated. [Zn(mImH)4]2+ does not accept the water molecule as an additional ligand, but [Mn(mImH)4]2+ accepts it. [Mn(mImH)4(H2O)]2+ is found in a pseudo-trigonal-bipyramidal configuration (Figure S10). Distortion in the coordination geometry of the Mn2+ complex after binding with water results in collapse of the Mn-ZIF-8 framework.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 13, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig4\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Fragments employed in\nthe EDA for [Mn\u00ad(mImH)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> and [Zn\u00ad(mImH)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr4\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2017-013229_0004.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 4  Fragments employed in the EDA for [Mn(mImH)4]2+ and [Zn(mImH)4]2+.
