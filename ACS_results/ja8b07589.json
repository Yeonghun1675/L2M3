Therefore, the CO2 selectivities of the three analogues were calculated by using Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST), as shown in . Because of the flexibility of FZU, the contracted form of FZU shows a lower CO2 uptake but higher CH4 and N2 uptakes compared with NJU-Bai34. Therefore, the CO2 selectivity of NJU-Bai34 is much higher than that of FZU. NJU-Bai35 with the highest CO2 uptake exhibits the highest CO2 selectivity among the three analogues, with the values of 275.8 for CO2/N2 and 11.6 for CO2/CH4. These values are also larger than those of SIFSIX-2-Cu-I (CO2/N2, 140), Cu-TDPAT (CO2/N2, 79; CO2/CH4, 5.3), and ZIF-78 (CO2/N2, 50.1; CO2/CH4, 10.6) under similar conditions. Such high CO2 selectivities should be attributed to molecule sieving effect in NJU-Bai35, whose pore sizes are more suitable for CO2 (3.3 \u00c5) than N2 (3.64 \u00c5) and CH4 (3.8 \u00c5) molecules. The high selective CO2 capture of NJU-Bai35 was further confirmed by breakthrough experiments. The breakthrough curve at 298 K for a 2:8 mixture of CO2 and N2 (5:5 mixture of CO2 and CH4) in d shows that CO2 is completely separated from N2 (or CH4) with a considerable CO2 separation capacity (44 cm3 g-1 for CO2: N2 = 2:8; 59 cm3 g-1 for CO2: CH4 = 5:5), a value close to the uptake of CO2 (42 cm3 g-1 at 0.2 bar and 58 cm3 g-1 at 0.5 bar) from the single-component isotherms.
