VT-SCXRD analyses of MOFs 1 and 2 were performed at different temperature intervals of 25, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, and 115 \u00b0C. Before data collection, the crystallinity of MOFs was checked by taking snapshots and unit cell determination at each particular temperature to confirm that the sample's crystallinity remains intact, suitable for single-crystal data collection (). From TGA experiments, it was found that the MOFs lose lattice water molecules in the temperature range of 40-80 \u00b0C. Taking a clue from the above observations, we anticipated not only that we could possibly achieve an evacuated framework via a SC-SC transformation but also that we can monitor the dynamics of H2O inside the framework molecule over that temperature range. After carefully solving the above collected data sets, we found that 80 \u00b0C is the ideal temperature at which we could achieve a stable and solvent-free framework of 1 with reasonably good data [R 1 = 6.4%, wR 2 = 14.7%, GOF = 1.005]; below that temperature, water stays in the lattice as solvent and the framework remains intact, but high thermal vibration observed in some of the atom sites results in high refinement parameters (Figure d). A similar experiment performed on MOF 2 (-Br analogue of MOF 1) reveals that we can achieve an evacuated framework at a much lower temperature of 40 \u00b0C [R 1 = 5.7%, wR 2 = 15.12%, GOF = 1.071]. So far, the amount of water uptake of MOF 1 with respect to MOF 2 and the achievement of an evacuated framework of MOF 2 at only 40 \u00b0C clearly indicate that MOF 2 has a lower water affinity than MOF 1. It has been mentioned already that the structural arrangements of MOFs 1-4 are all similar, except for the handedness and halogen atoms in the framework [M-X, X = -Cl, -Br)]. It is well established that metal halides (M-X) are strong hydrogen bond acceptors, compared to organic halides (principally C-Cl and C-Br groups). The normalized distance function, R HX, for D-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5X-M hydrogen bonds [R HX = d(H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5X)/(r H + r X) = 0.799 and 0.820 for O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5X-M, X = Cl-, Br-)] shows the acceptor capabilities of halogens. It is anticipated that, due to the increase in polarity of the D- H bond, for a given halide ion, O-H donors can contribute stronger interaction than N-H donors. Similarly, halide ion acceptors for a given donor are compared, and the interactions follow an order H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5F > H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cl > H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Br > H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5I.
