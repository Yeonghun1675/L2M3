To achieve the latter transformation, intramolecular interaction between boron and oxygen appears to be required, which is possible when the phosphine ligand contains a pendent alkylborane. We hypothesize that the size of the ring formed by intramolecular B\u2212O interaction determines speciation, as shown in Scheme : shorter chain lengths give smaller, more stable rings, giving monomeric boroxycarbenes, while longer chain lengths give larger rings, which are destabilized, leading to either more formyl character (little interaction) or <italic toggle=\"yes\">intermolecular</italic> interactions being dominant (with the pendent borane from one molecule binding oxygen on another). The monomeric species that contain <italic toggle=\"yes\">intramolecular</italic> borane coordination appear to be readily reduced by [<bold>HPt</bold>]<sup>+</sup> (although bis(phosphine) complexes require a second pendent acid to shuttle the Pt\u2212H), while oligomeric or externally borane-coordinated species do not show reductive coupling chemistry. This could be due to a geometric change of the boroxycarbene, imposed by the rigid ring structure (Figure ). When the geometry is constrained in the P\u2212Re plane, the back-bonding is competing with three CO ligands, whereas the more favored geometry, essentially 90\u00b0 out of plane, competes with only two CO ligands. This subtle change would render the chelated boroxycarbene more electrophilic and perhaps more prone to nucleophilic attack.</p>", "clean_text": "Conclusions\n\nThe precise nature of Lewis acid additives has a large impact on the reductive coupling of CO. External trialkylborane additives can facilitate reduction of [(PPh3)2Re(CO)4]+ by [HPt]+ and stabilization of the resultant formyl, but no further reduction or C-C bond formation is observed. To achieve the latter transformation, intramolecular interaction between boron and oxygen appears to be required, which is possible when the phosphine ligand contains a pendent alkylborane. We hypothesize that the size of the ring formed by intramolecular B-O interaction determines speciation, as shown in Scheme : shorter chain lengths give smaller, more stable rings, giving monomeric boroxycarbenes, while longer chain lengths give larger rings, which are destabilized, leading to either more formyl character (little interaction) or intermolecular interactions being dominant (with the pendent borane from one molecule binding oxygen on another). The monomeric species that contain intramolecular borane coordination appear to be readily reduced by [HPt]+ (although bis(phosphine) complexes require a second pendent acid to shuttle the Pt-H), while oligomeric or externally borane-coordinated species do not show reductive coupling chemistry. This could be due to a geometric change of the boroxycarbene, imposed by the rigid ring structure (Figure ). When the geometry is constrained in the P-Re plane, the back-bonding is competing with three CO ligands, whereas the more favored geometry, essentially 90\u00b0 out of plane, competes with only two CO ligands. This subtle change would render the chelated boroxycarbene more electrophilic and perhaps more prone to nucleophilic attack.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 92, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch26\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>26</label>\n<graphic id=\"gr27\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"om-2010-00638d_0016.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 26  ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 93, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig8\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>8</label>\n<graphic id=\"gr35\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"om-2010-00638d_0017.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 8  ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 94, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The number of Lewis acids is also important.
