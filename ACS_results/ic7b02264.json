This nonlinear nature can be attributed to the energy transfer mechanism that takes place during fluorescence quenching. In order to know the reason behind it, the spectral overlap between the absorbance spectra of different nitro-analytes and emission spectra of 1 and 2 were recorded (see Figures S21 and S22 in the Supporting Information). It is found that the maximum extent of overlap takes place in TNP and 2,4-DNP for 1 and in TNP, 2,4-DNP, and 4-NP for 2. This means that there is an energy transfer taking place from electron-rich MOFs 1 and 2 to the electron-deficient analytes due to the presence of electron-withdrawing nitro group(s). Notably, the fluorescence spectrum of 1 is broader in comparison to that of 2, which is attributed to effective spectral overlap and a greater extent of energy transfer with the emission band of 1 in the presence of TNP. The extent of energy transfer was evaluated by calculating the overlap integral J(\u03bb) values using the equation     J  ( \u03bb )  =   \u222b   0   \u221e      F   D    ( \u03bb )    \u03b5   A    ( \u03bb )    \u03bb   4    d \u03bb    where F D(\u03bb) is the corrected fluorescence intensity of donor in the range \u03bb to \u03bb + d\u03bb with the total intensity normalized to unity and \u03b5A is the extinction coefficient of the NACs at \u03bb in M-1 cm-1. The maximum overlap integrals for TNP were calculated as 3.8 \u00d7 1014 and 3 \u00d7 1014 M-1 cm-1 nm4 for 1 and 2, respectively, which are comparable with that for {[Cd(NDC)0.5(PCA)]\u22c5xG} n . Furthermore, this deviation from linearity indicates a combination of static and dynamic quenching processes between TNP and the host frameworks, as confirmed from the lifetime decay curves of 1 and 2, before and after addition of TNP (see Figures S23 and S24 in the Supporting Information).
