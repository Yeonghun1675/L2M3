Cd1 and Cd2 are in distorted {CdNO6} pentagonal bipyramid geometries with seven-fold coordination (Figure S1), including four oxygen atoms and a nitrogen atom in the equatorial plane from two carboxylate groups of two L2- ligands and one 4-PTZ ligand, respectively, and two oxygen atoms in the axis direction from another L2- ligand and one DMF molecule (O13). Cd3 adopts a typical {CdO6} octahedral coordination mode, in which two carboxylate oxygen atoms from two L2- ligands and two coordinated DMF molecules (O11 and O12) were in the equatorial plane with cis-formation, and two nitrogen atoms from two 4-PTZ ligands were in the axis direction. Three Cd centers were connected into a trinuclear secondary building unit (SBU) (CdII 3) via carboxylate groups and tetrazolate group. In the coordination mode of three Cd centers, the relatively long Cd-O bonds can be easily found. In order to confirm the coordinated geometries of Cd metal centers, bond valence sum (BVS) calculation was applied. On the basis of the results of BVS, Cd1 is 1.994 with a long Cd1-O3A bond of 2.566(6) \u00c5 (symmetric code A x, -y + 1, z - 1/2); Cd2 is 2.282 with two long Cd-O bonds of 2.562(6) \u00c5 for Cd2-O2 and 2.576(5) \u00c5 for Cd2-O9 (Table S2); Cd3 is 2.296. The valence state of the related oxygen atoms with long Cd-O bonds was also calculated. All detailed BVS results can be found in Table S3, which further confirm that all Cd centers are seven-fold coordination. The other bond lengths of Cd-O and Cd-N in the range of 2.166(7)-2.411(7) \u00c5 and 2.330(9)-2.392(11) \u00c5, respectively, are comparable to those of reported values. In the asymmetric unit for NBU-9, four carboxylate ligands are fully deprotonated {L2-}, in which only {L2-} containing S1, labeled as {L(S1)2-}, is completely crystallographically independent; the other three carboxylate ligands {L(S2)2-}, {L(S3)2-}, and {L(S4)2-} are a half because three S atoms (S2, S3, and S4) lie on the glide plane and thus have 1/2 occupancy, and the other half were generated through symmetrical operation. As shown in Figure S1, each of {L(S1)2-} and {L(S4)2-} is hexadentate and links four Cd atoms by two \u03bc2-\u03b71 \u03b72 carboxylate groups with two Cd-O-C-O four-membered rings. {L(S2)2-} chelated two Cd centers by two \u03bc1-\u03b71 \u03b71 carboxylate groups with two Cd-O-C-O four-membered rings. {L(S3)2-} connected four Cd centers by two \u03bc2-\u03b71 \u03b71 carboxylate groups.

In this 3D structure, Cd1 atoms were linked into a 1D chain by {L(S1)2-} carboxylate ligand along the c-axis (a), namely, Cd-L chain A. Cd2 and Cd3 atoms were linked alternatively by {L(S3)2-} and {L(S4)2-} ligands into a 1D chain, labeled as Cd-L chain B (b). Cd-L chains A and B linked each other alternatively into the 1D cubic channel of 9.59 \u00d7 10.24 \u00c52 (measured between two atoms) along the c-axis (c). The exciting finding is that the internal surface of the cubic channel was covered by a large number of open carboxylate oxygen atoms and open S-sites.

Each unique 4-PTZ as a tetradentate ligand connected four Cd centers including two Cd3, one Cd1 and one Cd2 by one N atom from the pyridine group and three N atoms from a tetrazolate group, with one deprotonated noncoordinated N atom (Figure S2a). The whole porous 3D skeleton can be also regarded that those channels were extended by 4-PTZ ligands through coordinating CdII 3 SBUs (Figure S2b), in which L(S2)2- ligands as 2-connected nodes do not participate in the formation of whole 3D skeleton.

When 2-connected nodes were transformed into edges between metal nodes during simplification, a 7-connected uninodal hxg-d net with its point symbol of {415.66} was obtained (Figure S2d). Since the 2-connected L(S2)2- ligands do not participate in the formation of the whole 3D skeleton, the overall 3D topology of NBU-9 can furthermore be simplified into an 8-connected uninodal eca net with point symbol of {39.412.57}, after omitting the L(S2)2- ligand (Figure S2e).

Such porosity of NBU-9 encouraged us to use it to encapsulate lanthanide cations for tunable fluorescence. The preparation of such Ln3+-loaded NBU-9 luminescence materials is currently of interest in the fields of light display, lasers, and optoelectronic devices. Typically, freshly prepared samples of NBU-9 (5 mg) were ground and immersed in the DMF solutions (0.1 M = mol/L, 3 mL) containing different metal ions (Na+, K+, Ag+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Al3+, Eu3+, and Tb3+) for 3 days to form a metal ion-incorporated NBU-9 suspension, namely, M@NBU-9 for luminescence studies. The related photoluminescence (PL) spectra of M@NBU-9 are shown in  and Figure S8. It is obvious that the Tb3+- and Eu3+-doped NBU-9 exhibit their respective characteristic sharp emission bands, where Tb3+@NBU-9 emits four typical lines of Tb3+ emission in the visible spectrum, corresponding to transitions from the 5D4 state: 5D4 \u2192 7F6 (491 nm), 5D4 \u2192 7F5 (546 nm), 5D4 \u2192 7F4 (586 nm), 5D4 \u2192 7F3 (624 nm); among these transitions, 5D4 \u2192 7F5 is the strongest. Eu3+@NBU-9 shows very weak characteristic emissions of the Eu3+ ion at 594, 619, and 698 nm. In the emission range of 300-450 nm (Figure S8), which is assigned to the absorption of organic ligands in the NBU-9 framework, alkaline metal ions (Na+ and K+) have a clearly luminescent enhancement compared with the one for NBU-9 in DMF solvent, alkaline-earth metal ions (Mg2+ and Ca2+) have a negligible effect on luminescent intensity of NBU-9, and other transition metal ions display different levels of quenching effects, especially Fe2+, Al3+, and Cd2+ with the most significant quenching effects. These results indicate that the photoluminescence properties of M-loaded NBU-9 are greatly influenced by the metal cations under the excitation of 281 nm, and the microporous NBU-9 is a suitable sensitizer for Tb3+ ion and Eu3+ ion, and the former is superior to the latter. It is well-known that the luminescence of Tb3+ is much easier than Eu3+ ions in the same matrixes, since the lower excited resonance level of Tb3+, locating at 20500 cm-1 for 5D4, displays an obvious superior match with the energy state of the ligand through the ligand-to-metal energy transfer process, comparing with the one of Eu3+ at 19000 cm-1 for 5D1. Therefore, under the same excited energy (\u03bb ex  = 281 nm), the green light from Tb3+ will be more easily observed over the red light from Eu3+ for NBU-9. Its CIE coordinate for Tb3+@NBU-9 also demonstrates that it falls in the green region (0.288, 0.598) (b, H dot). These results are in accordance with the PL spectra of a solid sample for Tb3+@NBU-9 in which the crystals after soaking in aqueous solution of Tb3+ for 1 day were washed with pure DMF solution to remove the residual TbIII cations on the surface of the sample (Figure S9). ICP measurement for Tb3+ in Tb3+@NBU-9 shows that the doped amount of Tb3+ is 1.02%. The results fully demonstrate that the NBU-9 not only as a host can trap lanthanide cations into its the pores but also as an antenna can successfully realize the sensitization and detection of Tb3+. The lifetime of the Tb3+@NBU-9 solid sample exhibits an ~106-fold increase (1.38 ms) from ~6.56 ns of NBU-9 (Figure S10).
