Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed using a TGA Q500 thermal analysis system under a N2 atmosphere from room temperature to 650 \u00b0C at a ramping rate of 5 \u00b0C/min. LC-MS analyses were performed on a Shimadzu LCMS-2020 instrument using a 6 min running time with a constant 1:1 ratio of acetonitrile: water at a constant flow rate of 0.2 mL/min without passing through a column. SEM/EDS analyses were conducted using ZEISS Sigma 500 VP SEM with Oxford Aztec X-EDS. The crystal samples were washed with ethanol and drop cast on silicon wafers and dried under ambient condition before SEM/EDS analyses. Solution UV-vis absorption spectra were collected using an Agilent 8453 UV-vis spectrometer equipped with deuterium and tungsten lamps. Solid state UV-vis absorption spectra were collected on individual crystals on glass slide using a CRAIC QDI 2010 microspectrophotometer in transmission mode. The sampling area was fixed at 37 \u00d7 37 \u03bcm2. The photoluminescence properties were measured in an integration sphere using a Horiba Jobin-Yvon Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer equipped with a 450 W xenon excitation source and a visible photomultiplier tube (PMT) (220-800 nm, R928P; Hamamatsu), and a NIR PMT (950-1650 nm, H10330-75; Hamamatsu) on solid MOF samples stored under DMF in quartz capillary tubes. All spectra were corrected for the instrumental functions. Luminescence lifetimes were determined under 355 nm excitation provided by the third harmonic of a YG 980 Quantel Nd:YAG laser; emission signals were selected using a Horiba Scientific iHR-320 monochromator, detected using a Hamamatsu H10330-75 NIR PMT, fed into a 500 MHz bandpass digital oscilloscope (TDS 754C; Tektronix), transferred to a PC in which data were processed with the Origin 8 program. Quantum yields were determined with a Horiba Jobin-Yvon Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorimeter based on an absolute method (Model G8, GMP SA, Renens, Switzerland). Each sample was measured several times under comparable experimental conditions, varying the position of samples. Estimated experimental error for the quantum yield determination is ~10%.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 22, "type": "text", "classification": ["synthesis condition"], "content": "<title>General Synthesis of <bold>MOF-1114</bold>\n</title><p>2-Amino-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic\nacid (1 equiv) and RECl<sub>3</sub>\u00b76H<sub>2</sub>O (3 or 4 equiv)\nwere dissolved by DMF in a 20 mL Pyrex vial.
