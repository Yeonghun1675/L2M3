The transformation was complete, and pure Tb(H2O)4W(CN)8 was obtained at ~33 \u00b0C. So there is one additional coordination site available for each Tb center in Tb(H2O)4W(CN)8 at this temperature. In the presence of excess pyrazine, this feature allows the nitrogen atoms of pyrazine with the two ends having the same geometry to coordinate to Tb center. As a result, the coordination geometry of Tb changed again to a nine-coordinated geometry {TbO4N5}, resulting in a 3D inorganic-organic hybrid complex, 1. TG results () of 1 showed that the weight loss of 4.23% in the range from 18 to 170 \u00b0C was lower significantly than the theoretical value of the loss of the coordinated pyrazine (6.04%), which can be attributed to the partial loss of pyrazine ligands.
