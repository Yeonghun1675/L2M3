The average Ru-Oeq length (Oeq = carboxylate oxygen atoms) is typical for [Ru2 II,II] species (), because the Ru-Oeq lengths in the [Ru2 II,II] and [Ru2 II,III]+ complexes are generally found in the ranges 2.06-2.08 \u00c5 and 2.02-2.03 \u00c5, respectively. The Ru-N length in the quasilinear Ru-Ru-N linkage is in the range 2.32-2.44 \u00c5, which tends to be slightly shorter than N-capped [Ru2 II,II] complexes with no hydrogen bonding reported previously, e.g., [Ru2(CF3CO2)4(phz)] (phz = phenazine; 2.425(2) \u00c5), [Ru2(2,3,5,6-F4PhCO2)4(acridine)2] (2.450 \u00c5), and [Ru2(p-FPhCO2)4(phz)] (2.450(7) \u00c5). Except for one unit in 4 with \u03c8 = 8.6\u00b0 (vide infra), the two L planes at the axial positions almost bisect the paddlewheel arrangement, as similarly found in the phz-bridged [Ru2 II,II] chain [Ru2 II,II(CF3CO2)4(phz)], where a dihedral angle \u03c8, which is defined by an angle between L plane versus the O1-O2-O1*-O2* and/or O5-O6-O5**-O6** planes (see inset figure in ), is found with ca. 45-50\u00b0. This configuration enables hydrogen bonding between one amino group on L and two oxygen atoms of the bridging carboxylate groups with N\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O distances in the range 2.8-3.4 \u00c5 (only one unit in 4 has a one-site hydrogen bonding mode; see Figure d) (Figures  and ). The position of amino groups in dapy and imino groups of azain also enables the formation of hydrogen bonds with fluorine groups of the o-FPh moiety, so only in 1 and 4, with N\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5F distances in the range 2.90-3.54 \u00c5. An interesting aspect is that the average dihedral angle, \u03b8av, defined by the plane of the benzoate phenyl group and the plane composed of a carboxyl group and two Ru atoms (inset figure in ) is relatively small even in 1 and 4 where the steric hindrance according to o-F groups is expected (7.4\u00b0 for 1 and 16.1\u00b0 for 4), which is much smaller than the 27.6\u00b0 observed in [Ru2(o-FPhCO2)4(THF)2] that has no such characteristic intramolecular hydrogen bonds. This is probably because the fixing by the hydrogen bonds of NH2\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5F somewhat stabilizes such anomalous arrangements. As described above, the shorter Ru-N bond found in all compounds is probably due to the effect of hydrogen bonding.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 9, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Thermal ellipsoid plots\n(50% probability) showing the formula unit\nfor one unit of <bold>1</bold> (a), <bold>2</bold> (b), <bold>3</bold> (c), and one unit of <bold>4</bold> (d) (another unit for <bold>1</bold> and <bold>4</bold> is given in <xref rid=\"notes-1\">Figure\nS2</xref>), where atoms of N, O, C, F, and Ru are represented in colors\nof blue, red, gray, green, and purple, respectively, and blue dotted\nlines represent hydrogen bonds.
