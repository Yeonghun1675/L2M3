The \u03c7m T value at 300 K is 8.88 cm3 mol-1 K, which is much higher than the spin-only value of 5.64 cm3 mol-1 K for three spins with S = 3/2 and g = 2.00, owing to the significant orbital contribution of CoII in an octahedral environment. Upon cooling, the \u03c7m T value decreases monotonically, reaching a minimum of 7.11 cm3 mol-1 K at 12 K, then increases quickly to reach a maximum of 23.4 cm3 mol-1 K at 2.6 K, and finally goes down to a minimum of 19.8 cm3 mol-1 K at 2 K. The first decrease of \u03c7m T above 12 K should be due to the effect of spin-orbit coupling of the CoII ion, resulting in an effective S = 1/2 at low temperature from an S = 3/2 at high temperature. The quick increase of \u03c7m T between 2.6 and 12 K indicates ferromagnetic interactions or ferrimagnetic behavior between the CoII ions transported by \u03bc2-hydroxyl and/or \u03bc2-carboxylate oxygen bridges. The reciprocal molar magnetic susceptibility plotted versus temperature obeys the Curie-Weiss law above 10 K with a Curie constant C = 8.89 cm3 mol-1 K (Figure S3 in the ) and a Weiss temperature \u03b8 = -2.51 K. The negative \u03b8 is larger than the typical fitted \u03b8 value of ca. -14 K for the mononuclear cobalt(II) complexes and smaller than that for (C3H4NSO3)2Co\u22c54H2O (ca. -0.92 K), where the CoII ions have a CoN2O4 environment similar to that of 1. The negative value of the Weiss temperature is likely related to the effect of spin-orbit coupling that stabilizes an effective spin doublet state, also indicating possible ferromagnetic interactions between the CoII ions. In fact, it is rather difficult to really come to a conclusion about ferromagnetic couplings on the basis of the value of \u03b8. For instance, a ferrimagnetic, or uncompensated antiferromagnetic state, would also lead to a lower absolute value of \u03b8. In a fully ferromagnetic case, one would expect almost no minimum of \u03c7T. The \u03b8 value of cobalt networks depends on the exchange coupling but also reflects the single-ion spin-orbit coupling, which can vary with the ligand field.
