By activation of the used framework materials at 150 \u00b0C for 5 h, the adsorption capacities of 0.11 and 0.10 g of water/g of MOF were obtained for the second and third cycles, respectively (Table S4). The adsorption capacity of the Mn-BDC, compared to other adsorbents examined under similar condition, is presented in . At similar activation conditions, the adsorption capacity of the Mn-BDC is higher than those of activated carbon (AC), activated alumina (Al2O3), and silica gel. This may due to their large pore sizes, which can allow coadsorption of ethanol with water, leading to their poor water adsorption selectivity at the present conditions. The adsorption capacities at water contents of ca. 5 and 2.5 vol % are comparable to those of zeolite 3A (3A). To achieve higher water adsorption capacity, 3A requires an activation at much higher temperature (500 \u00b0C, 8 h) compared to the Mn-BDC needed in activation/regeneration.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 14, "type": "table", "classification": null, "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Adsorption Ability of Water by the Present Mn-BDC\nFramework Compared to Those of Other Adsorbents</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"5\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">adsorbent</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">C<sub>o</sub> water\n(%vol.)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">capacity (g of water/g of adsorbent)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">C<sub>o</sub>\u00a0water (%vol.)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">capacity\n(g of water/g of adsorbent)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<bold>Mn-BDC</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<bold>4.93</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<bold>0.13</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<bold>2.01</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<bold>0.12</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>AC</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>5.18</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>N/A</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.55</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>N/A</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>5.16</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.01</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.53</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>N/A</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>silica\ngel</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>5.19</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.01</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.59</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>N/A</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>3A</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>5.19</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.13</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.59</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.10</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>3A (ht)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>5.25</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.17</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.66</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.17</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 15, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>In summary, the structurally flexible\nMn-BDC with abundant unsaturated Mn\u00ad(II) centers was synthesized.
