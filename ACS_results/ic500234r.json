Three probable\nreasons might be considered for this nonporous nature of N<sub>2</sub>: (a) It might be associated with the low thermal energy of the adsorbate\nrelative to the high diffusion barrier at 77 K, (b) In another way, both of the frameworks contain nitrogen\nphobic pore surfaces as the presence of \u2212N\ue5fbN\u2013\ngroups on the pore walls repel N<sub>2</sub> molecules, thus they\nwould not allow to diffuse, and (c)\npore size is not sufficient enough to capture bigger N<sub>2</sub> molecules in the activated sample. On the other hand, CO<sub>2</sub> (kinetic diameter 3.3 \u00c5) adsorption measurements at 195 K for\nboth <bold>1</bold>\u2032 and <bold>2</bold>\u2032 exhibit a typical\ntype-I profile, suggesting a microporous nature of the frameworks\n(Figure ).

The hysteretic sorption profiles in both cases are attributed\nto the diffusion barrier during desorption resulting due to strong\ninteraction of the CO<sub>2</sub> molecules with the adsorptive sites\n(e.g., \u2212N\ue5fbN\u2013 and \u2212COO) of the framework.\nBoth of the frameworks reveal to be CO<sub>2</sub>-philic in nature,\ni.e., CO<sub>2</sub> selective as realized from exclusion over other\ngases (N<sub>2</sub>/Ar/O<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>) at 195 K. Such\nselective CO<sub>2</sub> uptake properties by both of the frameworks\ncan be explained from the strong interaction between CO<sub>2</sub> (quadrupole moment of CO<sub>2</sub>: \u22121.4 \u00d7 10<sup>\u201339</sup> C m<sup>2</sup>) and framework wall decorated with\npolar functional groups and aromatic \u03c0 cloud of the linkers.\nIt is also reflected in the high value of isosteric heat of adsorption\nvalues, <italic toggle=\"yes\">q</italic>\n<sub>st</sub>, \u03d5, \u223c 33.6 and\n31.5 kJ mol<sup>\u20131</sup> for <bold>1</bold>\u2032 and <bold>2</bold>\u2032, respectively, as calculated from the Dubinin\u2013Radushkevich\n(DR) equation.\n</p><p>\n<bold>MOF1N</bold>\u2032\nshows interesting sorption behavior compared to bulk <bold>1</bold>.

This\nvalue is \u223c10 wt % higher than bulk <bold>1</bold>\u2032.\nThe Langmuir and BET surface areas calculated from the CO<sub>2</sub> isotherm of <bold>MOF1N</bold>\u2032 are 412 and 385 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup>, respectively. Interestingly higher uptake\nof CO<sub>2</sub> was observed for <bold>MOF1N</bold>\u2032 compared\nto <bold>1</bold> even at 273 K (<bold>1</bold>\u2032 = 2.5 wt %\nand <bold>MOF1N</bold>\u2032 <bold>=</bold> 6.2 wt %) and 293 K\n(<bold>1</bold>\u2032 <bold>=</bold> 1.7 wt % and <bold>MOF1N</bold>\u2032 = 4.3 wt %; Figure b). The enhanced\nCO<sub>2</sub> uptake of <bold>MOF1N</bold>\u2032 under all experimental\nconditions is certainly because of higher specific surface area and\nsmaller diffusion barrier in the nanoscale.

Calculation of the void space using PLATON after removal of guest molecules suggests the presence of a void volume of ~3319 \u00c53, i.e. 45% of the total cell volume.\n\nTGA and PXRD Analysis\n\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of 1 shows a rapid initial weight loss of 4.1 wt % corresponding to two bound guest water molecules in the temperature range of 90-100 \u00b0C (). The next consecutive steps exhibit the release of two guest DMF molecules from the framework (expt., 14 wt %; calcd., 14.3 wt %) in the temperature range of 190-210 \u00b0C. The desolvated 1' is thermally stable up to 325 \u00b0C and then decomposes to an unidentified product. Similarly, 2 shows a first initial weight loss of 6.0 wt % corresponding to four water molecules within 100 \u00b0C followed by a further 15.6 wt % loss of two DEF molecules (calcd., 15.7 wt %; ). The desolvated 2' is thermally stable up to 345 \u00b0C and then decomposes. The TGA of MOF1N shows a similar trend to that of 1, first a 4.0 wt % loss corresponding to two water molecules and then the release of two DMFs within 180-200 \u00b0C, and the desolvated framework exhibits thermal stability up to 325 \u00b0C similar to 1 ().\n\nIn a similar way, we have also tried to fabricate the second framework 2 to a naoscale, but our repeated attempts did not materialize probably due to the different trinuclaer SBU in 2 compared to 1.\n\nGas Adsorption Studies\n\nN2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K are carried out for 1' and 2' for determination of the surface area for both of the frameworks. Despite having sufficient pore sizes in assynthesized frameworks, both the desolvated frameworks 1' and 2' show type-II N2 adsorption isotherms (kinetic diameter 3.64 \u00c5). Three probable reasons might be considered for this nonporous nature of N2: (a) It might be associated with the low thermal energy of the adsorbate relative to the high diffusion barrier at 77 K, (b) In another way, both of the frameworks contain nitrogen phobic pore surfaces as the presence of -N\ue5fbN- groups on the pore walls repel N2 molecules, thus they would not allow to diffuse, and (c) pore size is not sufficient enough to capture bigger N2 molecules in the activated sample. On the other hand, CO2 (kinetic diameter 3.3 \u00c5) adsorption measurements at 195 K for both 1' and 2' exhibit a typical type-I profile, suggesting a microporous nature of the frameworks (Figure ). The Langmuir and BET surface areas calculated from the CO2 isotherms are ~251 and 235 m2 g-1 for 1' and ~214 and 200 m2 g-1 for 2', respectively. The storage capacities of 1' and 2' are about 16 wt % (81 cm3 g-1, 2.8 CO2 per formula unit) and 13.5 wt % (69 cm3 g-1, 3.4 CO2 per formula unit), respectively (Figure ). The hysteretic sorption profiles in both cases are attributed to the diffusion barrier during desorption resulting due to strong interaction of the CO2 molecules with the adsorptive sites (e.g., -N\ue5fbN- and -COO) of the framework. Both of the frameworks reveal to be CO2-philic in nature, i.e., CO2 selective as realized from exclusion over other gases (N2/Ar/O2/H2) at 195 K. Such selective CO2 uptake properties by both of the frameworks can be explained from the strong interaction between CO2 (quadrupole moment of CO2: -1.4 \u00d7 10-39 C m2) and framework wall decorated with polar functional groups and aromatic \u03c0 cloud of the linkers. It is also reflected in the high value of isosteric heat of adsorption values, q st, \u03d5, ~ 33.6 and 31.5 kJ mol-1 for 1' and 2', respectively, as calculated from the Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) equation. \n\n MOF1N' shows interesting sorption behavior compared to bulk 1. The N2 adsorption isotherm of MOF1N' at 77 K shows a similar signature to that of bulk 1'. But the CO2 adsorption isotherm shows a typical type I adsorption profile with significant higher uptake, i.e., 133 cm3 g-1 corresponding to 26.2 wt % (4.7 CO2 per formula unit; Figure a). This value is ~10 wt % higher than bulk 1'. The Langmuir and BET surface areas calculated from the CO2 isotherm of MOF1N' are 412 and 385 m2 g-1, respectively. Interestingly higher uptake of CO2 was observed for MOF1N' compared to 1 even at 273 K (1' = 2.5 wt % and MOF1N' = 6.2 wt %) and 293 K (1' = 1.7 wt % and MOF1N' = 4.3 wt %; Figure b). The enhanced CO2 uptake of MOF1N' under all experimental conditions is certainly because of higher specific surface area and smaller diffusion barrier in the nanoscale. Furthermore, the adsorption profiles measured at 273 and 293 K are used for the calculation of enthalpy of adsorption (\u0394H ads) applying Clausius-Clapeyron equation which provides a value of 41 kJ mol-1, significantly higher compared to 1' (). It is worth mentioning that we could not get proper fitting for 1' using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation probably because of very poor uptake of CO2 at 293 and 273 K.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name":
