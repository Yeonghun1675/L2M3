This is consistent with the crystallographic observation that the two independent Eu(III) sites have almost identical environments. The luminescence of the free ligand was measured for comparison. While the free ligand displays a broadband centered around 395 nm, the emission is quenched in the spectra of 1-Eu, revealing an efficient energy transfer from the ligand to the metal ion. Finally, the luminescence spectrum of the desolvated material is very similar to that of the as-synthesized sample, suggesting that the ligand-to-metal energy transfer process is essentially unaffected by the loss of solvent molecules, although the material becomes amorphous upon desolvation.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 12, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig4\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<p>The solid-state luminescence spectra of the ligand and <bold>1-Eu</bold> (excited at 320 nm).</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr5\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"cg-2009-000736_0004.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 4  The solid-state luminescence spectra of the ligand and 1-Eu (excited at 320 nm).
