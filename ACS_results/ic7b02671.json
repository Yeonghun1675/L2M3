The uptake at 298 K is higher than those of reported 2D SBF-based MOFs, which may be explained by the existence of more open metal sites in the framework of activated Ca-SBF. At very low coverage, the isosteric adsorption enthalpy (Q st) of CO2 was calculated to be 16.6 kJ\u22c5mol-1 (Figure S12d), which is lower than those of reported 2D SBF-based MOFs, indicating a moderate interaction between CO2 and the framework.
