The emission bands at 552, 589, 613, 649, and 696 nm correspond to the 5D0-7F0, 5D0-7F1, 5D0-7F2, 5D0-7F3, and 5D0-7F4 transitions, respectively. As we know, the 5D0-7F0 transition is strictly forbidden by symmetry. The presence of the weak symmetry forbidden 5D0-7F0 transition at 552 nm indicates that the Eu(III) ions occupy low-symmetry coordination sites with no inversion centers, in agreement with the result of X-ray structural analysis. The 5D0-7F1 transition at 589 nm is a magnetic-dipole transition, and its intensity varies with the ligand field strength acting on the Eu3+ ion. The 5D0-7F2 transition at 613 nm is an electric-dipole transition and is extremely sensitive to chemical bonds in the vicinity of the Eu3+ ion. Among these transitions, 5D0-7F2 is the strongest. The intensity of the 5D0-7F2 transition increases as the site symmetry of the Eu3+ ion decreases. So, the intensity ratio of the I(5D0-7F2)/I(5D0-7F1) transition is widely used as a measure of the coordination state and site symmetry of the rare earth ions. For 5, the intensity ratio I(5D0-7F2)/I(5D0-7F1) is equal to about 1.3, higher than 0.67, a typical value for a centrosymmetric Eu(III) center, which further confirms that Eu(III) ions occupy sites with low symmetry and without an inversion center. In 6, the absence of the emission of Sm3+ ions may be attributed to the large energy difference between the lowest triplet energy level of the ligand and the resonant emissive energy level of Sm3+ ions.
