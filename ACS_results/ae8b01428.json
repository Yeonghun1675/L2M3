It should be noted that the peaks of N+ at C3.8 state (400.4 eV, in N.N+) and at C4.0 state (401.1 eV, in 2N+) are different in energy position, demonstrating the close relationship of the two nitrogen atoms in one DAnT. The electron-deficiency state of N+ is transferred through benzene rings to the other N atoms, leading to an increase in the oxidation potential. Besides, the reverse peak shift and peak intensity evolution in XPS spectra of D3.5 and D2.5 V samples demonstrates the reversibility of such a two-step redox process.
