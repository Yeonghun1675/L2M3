The experimental PXRD patterns of MOCs 1-3 are in good agreement with the simulated ones calculated from the single-crystal diffraction data (Figures S5-S7, Supporting Information), indicating that they are in a pure phase. Moreover, the thermogravimetric (TG) measurements were performed in a N2 atmosphere to examine the thermal stability. TG curves of MOCs 1-3 are shown in Figures S8-S11 (Supporting Information). MOCs 1-3 remained stable up to 311, 308, 318, and 274 \u00b0C, respectively. The TGA curve of complex 1a indicated that the loss of H2O and DEF molecules occurred between 85 and 286 \u00b0C (found 21.1%, calcd 21.8%), while the loss of H2O and DMA molecules in 1b occurred between 81 and 273 \u00b0C (found 20.8%, calcd 21.1%). In complex 2, a weight loss of 24.0% (calcd 24.3%) was observed with respect to the losses of water and DEF molecules between 65 and 271 \u00b0C, while a weight loss of 11.1% (calcd 10.8%) between 56 and 167 \u00b0C was observed for 3 with respect to the loss of water molecules.\n\nLuminescence Properties\n\nThe photoluminescent properties of MOCs 1-3 together with naphthalene-2,7-disulfonate were investigated under ambient temperature. Upon excitation at 276 nm, strong emission bands centered at 342 and 358 nm were detected, which were similar to the emissions of naphthalene-2,7-disulfonate. So, the emissions of 1-3 may be assigned to the intraligand charge transition of sulfonate. The external quantum yields (\u03a6f) of MOCs 1a, 1b, 2, and 3 were determined by means of an integrating sphere and found to be 20.3%, 14.3%, 19.7%, and 12.2%, respectively, which were much higher than that of disodium naphthalene-2,7-disulfonate (\u03a6f = 7.7%). The enhancement of luminescence of 1-3 compared to G1 can be analyzed from their crystal structures. In MOCs 1-3, G1 molecules were distributed orderly in the interlayer region, between polymer chains, or in the void of the 3D framework, which prohibited the aggregation-caused quenching of fluorophores. The different fluorescence intensity for MOCs 1-3 may be due to the different arrangements of G1 in 1-3. In MOC 1, naphthalene-2,7-disulfonates were confined between neighboring layers to form a flat layer through hydrogen-bonding interactions (d); G1 in 2 composed a 2D layer (Figure S2a), while in 3, G1's were connected together to generate a 3D structure (Figure S3). Hence, we provided herein an effective methodology to design and prepare luminescent materials by introducing fluorescent guest compounds into MOCs to obstruct the formation of luminophoric aggregates.
