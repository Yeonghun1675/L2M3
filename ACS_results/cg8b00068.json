Thus, a comprehensive stability investigation of the material was then carried out. The TGA data (Figure S4) demonstrate that the decomposition temperature of the framework is high up to 440 \u00b0C. The first weight loss appears in the range of ca. 30-100 \u00b0C, which corresponds to the removal of the water molecules in the pores. And the weight loss in the range of ca. 100-240 \u00b0C corresponds to the removal of the coordinated water. The X-ray thermodiffractogram of TbL was investigated to further explore the thermal stability of the framework (a). The result shows no obvious phase transition occurs when heated up to 180 \u00b0C, but some characteristic peaks become inconspicuous when we raise the temperature to 200 \u00b0C, suggesting that this framework could remain stable until heating up to 180 \u00b0C. For an air stability test, 40 mg of TbL was exposed to the open air for 7, 15, and 30 days with an average humidity of ca. 55%. The PXRD patterns were then recorded to test its air stability. The result shown in b suggests that TbL can keep its framework after exposure to the open air for more than 30 days. To test its water stability, 40 mg of TbL was soaked in 25 mL of water for 3, 7, 15, and 30 days. The corresponding PXRD results suggest that TbL possesses excellent stability to water (c). Chemical stability test was assessed by soaking the 40 mg of TbL in the aqueous solutions of pH = 1-14 for 48 h. Then, all the samples were filtered and washed 3 times and dried in air before PXRD experiments for pH stability tests.

The X-ray thermodiffractogram of TbL was investigated to further explore the thermal stability of the framework (a). The result shows no obvious phase transition occurs when heated up to 180 \u00b0C, but some characteristic peaks become inconspicuous when we raise the temperature to 200 \u00b0C, suggesting that this framework could remain stable until heating up to 180 \u00b0C. For an air stability test, 40 mg of TbL was exposed to the open air for 7, 15, and 30 days with an average humidity of ca. 55%. The PXRD patterns were then recorded to test its air stability. The result shown in b suggests that TbL can keep its framework after exposure to the open air for more than 30 days. To test its water stability, 40 mg of TbL was soaked in 25 mL of water for 3, 7, 15, and 30 days. The corresponding PXRD results suggest that TbL possesses excellent stability to water (c). Chemical stability test was assessed by soaking the 40 mg of TbL in the aqueous solutions of pH = 1-14 for 48 h. Then, all the samples were filtered and washed 3 times and dried in air before PXRD experiments for pH stability tests. The result reveals that the framework can remain stable in a broad pH range (pH = 2-12) (d). Overall, this framework shows strong stabilities toward high temperature, humid air, water, as well as acid/basic environments.\n\nGas Sorption Properties\n\nIn order to explore the porosity of 1-4, we choose the TbL as an example to investigate the porosity of the framework through gas sorption experiments. The fresh TbL first was guest-exchanged with dry CH2Cl2 for three times in 3 days, then activated at 150 \u00b0C under 10 \u03bcmHg for 10 h. The sorption isotherms for N2, CH4, and CO2 are expressed in a. The sorption isotherms of CO2 and CH4 show the typical Type-I, indicating the retention of the microporous structures after the removal of guests from the crystalline samples. At 77 K, almost no N2 absorption was observed, while CH4 and CO2 show obvious absorption at 273 and 295 K. The maximum uptakes of CO2 are 38.21 cm3 g-1 at 273 K and 33.10 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 295 K and 1.0 bar, which are much higher compared with CH4 (10.13 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 273 K and 7.61 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 295 K and 1.0 bar). For TbL, it exhibits obvious selective adsorption of CO2 over CH4, although the uptake values are not high compared with some reported results. The adsorption performance could be ascribed to the host-guest interactions and microporous structure. TbL contains open imidazolyl active sites and unsaturated metal sites in the framework, which may lead to an electric field to induce a dipole in CO2. The lowest isosteric heat (Q st) of CO2 has been estimated at more than 30 kJ mol-1 (b), which reflects a strong adsorbent-adsorbate interaction.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "TbL", "symbol": "",
