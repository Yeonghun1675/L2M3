Changing the molar ratio of Al3+ to linker lead to the discovery of a second new compound [Al2(OH)2(DPSTC)(H2O)2]\u22c50.5H2O (CAU-12). In CAU-12 the linker molecule is fully deprotonated which leads to different connectivity compared to the structure of CAU-11-COOH.

From the molecular formula [Al2(OH)2(DPSTC)(H2O)2]\u22c50.5H2O the first step (RT to 250 \u00b0C) can be attributed to the removal of coordinating and noncoordinating water molecules (measured 8.8%, calcd 8.6%) and the second (300-600 \u00b0C) to the decomposition of the framework (measrued 69.8%, calcd 71.9%) resulting in Al2O3 (measured 21.4%, calcd 19.5%). The TD-PXRD measurement (Figure , top) shows that the compound preserves its crystallinity up to 420 \u00b0C. As observed in the TG curve, the compound decomposes rapidly above 420 \u00b0C, and amorphous Al2O3 is formed. Above 270 \u00b0C a small shift of the first two reflections (001 and 002) toward lower diffraction angles is observed, and the remaining observable reflections shift to higher diffraction angles (Figure , bottom).

The uptake of 1.0 wt % of methane (100 kPa, 298 K) demonstrates the hydrophobic character of the compound.\n\nDue to the additional carboxylic acid groups in the pores, CAU-11-COOH becomes nonporous toward nitrogen, but in contrast to CAU-11, uptake of H2O is clearly observed at low p/p 0 values (Figure ). The maximum uptake is only 3.0 wt %, but this is due to the small pores. The pore size and the hydrophilicity of the pores in CAU-11-COOH can also be used to explain the very low uptake of hydrogen, only 0.02 wt %, in contrast to a CO2 uptake of 1.0 wt %, which has a bigger kinetic diameter but also a higher polarity than H2, and can therefore be better adsorbed (see  Figure S25).\n\nCAU-12 shows a similar sorption behavior toward the adsorptives as observed for CAU-11-COOH.
