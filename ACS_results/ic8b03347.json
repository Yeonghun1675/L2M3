An elevated \u03c7T at high temperature is well documented for octahedral, high-spin Co(II) ions due to unquenched spin-orbit coupling. As the temperature decreases, \u03c7T decreases slightly to attain a minimum value of 2.29 cm3 K/mol at 24 K, consistent with a combined effect from intrachain antiferromagnetic interactions and spin-orbit coupling.

This observed 1D correlation can arise from either a ferromagnetic coupling between Co centers or an antiferromagnetic coupling between canted Co spins. Given the moderate increase of \u03c7T at low temperature and the high-temperature decrease, it is likely that the intrachain coupling is antiferromagnetic with spin canting.
