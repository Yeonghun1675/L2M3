Both diffractometers had graphite monochromated Mo-K\u03b1 (\u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5) radiation. Intensities were corrected for Lorentz polarization effects, and a multiscan absorption correction was applied to the data collected at the University of Canterbury. The structures were solved by direct methods (SHELXS or SIR-97) and refined on F 2 using all data by full-matrix least-squares procedures (SHELXL 97). All calculations were performed using the WinGX interface. Crystallographic data for the four structures are listed in Table .
