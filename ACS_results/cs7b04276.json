Electrochemical measurement of\nHER on 1Co-ns was carried out in the D<sub>2</sub>O solution of tris-HNO<sub>3</sub> (pH 7.4). We find that the HER activity of 1Co-ns in D<sub>2</sub>O is inferior to that in H<sub>2</sub>O as confirmed by the\nincreased overpotential (162 vs 84 mV) and Tafel slope (76 vs 48 mV/dec)\n(). The recombination desorption/Tafel\nreaction (D<sub>ads</sub> + D<sub>ads</sub> = D<sub>2</sub>) is a\nsurface-dominated process and less dependent on the water layer, whereas\nthe electrochemical desorption process/Heyrovsky reaction (D<sub>2</sub>O + D<sub>ads</sub> + e<sup>\u2013</sup> = D<sub>2</sub> + OD<sup>\u2013</sup>) is more dependent on the diffusion process of water. In the Heyrovsky reaction, the D<sub>2</sub>O molecule diffuses to the catalyst surface, and then D<sub>2</sub>O picks up electrons together with the fixed D<sub>ads</sub> on catalyst,\nfinally generating D<sub>2</sub> adsorbed on the electrode surface.\nLarger molar mass results in slower diffusion of D<sub>2</sub>O, which\nwill largely influence the Heyrovsky process.

Three principal steps have been reported to be involved in HER: the Volmer (discharge), Heyrovsky (electrochemical desorption), and Tafel (recombination desorption) steps with Tafel slopes of 116, 38, and 29 mV/dec, respectively. The HER mechanism can be described in two pathways: (1) the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism (H2O + e- = Hads + OH- and H2O + Hads + e- = H2 + OH-) and/or (2) the Volmer-Tafel mechanism (H2O + e- = Hads + OH- and Hads + Hads = H2). The mechanisms imply that the process of adsorption/desorption of the H atoms at the surface of the catalyst is competitive, they should be balanced for facilitating HER. The Tafel slopes of 1Co and 1Co-ns derived from the early stages of the corresponding HER polarization curves are 77 and 48 mV/dec, respectively (B). Thus, a similar rection mechanism can be suggested from the Tafel slopes. The mismatch among the data and any value of the three steps (29, 38, or 116 mV/dec) for HER are attributed to the complexity of the HER mechanism of the present system, indicating that the surface coverage of the adsorbed H atoms (\u0398H) on the Co-based catalysts would be higher, and thus other reactions besides the Volmer reaction codetermine the HER rate. The deuterated effect in the HER rate is usually utilized to further clarify the contribution of the Volmer-Heyrovsky and Volmer-Tafel mechanisms. Electrochemical measurement of HER on 1Co-ns was carried out in the D2O solution of tris-HNO3 (pH 7.4). We find that the HER activity of 1Co-ns in D2O is inferior to that in H2O as confirmed by the increased overpotential (162 vs 84 mV) and Tafel slope (76 vs 48 mV/dec) (). The recombination desorption/Tafel reaction (Dads + Dads = D2) is a surface-dominated process and less dependent on the water layer, whereas the electrochemical desorption process/Heyrovsky reaction (D2O + Dads + e- = D2 + OD-) is more dependent on the diffusion process of water. In the Heyrovsky reaction, the D2O molecule diffuses to the catalyst surface, and then D2O picks up electrons together with the fixed Dads on catalyst, finally generating D2 adsorbed on the electrode surface. Larger molar mass results in slower diffusion of D2O, which will largely influence the Heyrovsky process. The observed Tafel slope of ~48 mV/dec is close to the theoretical value of the Heyrovsky step, and more importantly, it is largely influenced by the deuterated effect, which suggests that electrochemical desorption is the rate-limiting step and thus the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism is more operative in the HER catalyzed by 1Co-ns.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 25, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>Moreover, the turnover frequency\n(TOF, as the number of HER accomplished\nat each active site and per second) was measured to reveal the intrinsic\ncatalytic activity.

Triethyl phosphite (11 mmol) was added dropwise to a mixture of 10 mmol bromide and 1 mmol NiCl2 in a 100 mL three-neck bottle under the flow of N2 at 150 \u00b0C during a period of ~0.5 h. The mixture was further heated for 5 h and then cooled to room temperature. Next, HCl (50 mL, 1 M) was added to the brown mixture, which was extracted with ethyl acetate (50 mL) three times.
