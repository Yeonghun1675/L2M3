Single-crystal structural analysis reveals that 2 crystallizes in the space group C2/c. The structure of 2 is based on 1, except that the {Ni6} cluster in 2 is stabilized by two dap and one en. The asymmetric unit of 2 (Figure S5, ) contains a dimeric secondary building unit (SBU) {(Ni6(dap)2(en)(P2W15)(H2O)}2 linked by [Ni(dap)(H2O)2], one succinic acid unit, two CH3COO- units, as well as an isolated [Ni(dap)2]2+ cation. As shown in Figure a, the {Ni6P2W15} unit links with each other through a W\ue5fbO-Ni linkage to form infinite 1D chain {Ni6P2W15}\u221e SBUs along the b axis. Furthermore, the SBUs are linked interlaced by succinic acid to form a 2D layer (Figure b), and then the 2D layer is bridged by [Ni(dap)(H2O)2] through O-Ni-O to form a 3D structure (Figure S6, ). To better comprehend the 3D structure, Figure S7 () shows the 2D structural pictures viewed along the c axes. It is noted that the {Ni6P2W15} unit in 2 is different from 1, and the {Ni6P2W15} unit in 1 is stabilized by only one en. However, the unit in 2 is stabilized by two dap as well as an en (Figure S8, ). We think that the superfluous en originates probably from the impurities of dap.

The TG curve of 1 shows three steps of weight loss in the range of 30-800 \u00b0C.

For 2, the TG curve shows four steps of weight loss in the range of 30-800 \u00b0C. The first weight loss is 5.53% (calc. 5.20%) from 30 to 335 \u00b0C, assigned to the release of 15 lattice water molecules; the second weight loss is 5.32% (calc. 4.80%) from 335 to 410 \u00b0C, which can be ascribed to the release of four coordinated water molecules, the decomposition of three hydroxyl groups and carboxylate ligands. The last two steps of weight loss is 9.17% (calc. 8.99%) occurring from 410 to 800 \u00b0C, which can be attributed to the decomposition of the organic amine. These observations are also in compliance with elemental analysis. The X-ray powder diffraction patterns of 2 after being heated at 120 \u00b0C and as-synthesized are identical except that the intensity show some differences (Figure S2), revealing that 2 has good thermal stability.\n\nMagnetic Measurements\n\nThe magnetic susceptibility of 1 was measured over the range of 2-300 K. The plots of molar magnetic susceptibility \u03c7M and \u03c7M T versus T of 1 under a constant magnetic field of 1000 Oe are shown in Figure . The \u03c7M value of 1 is 0.03134 emu mol-1 at 300 K; upon cooling, the \u03c7M value of 1 slowly increases to 0.67125 emu mol-1 at 25 K, and then quickly reaches a maximum value of 7.298 emu mol-1 at 2 K. The value of \u03c7M T at 300 K is 9.40 emu mol-1 K, which is corresponding to six uncoupled high-spin Ni2+ ions with g > 2, S = 1. As the temperature decreases, the value of \u03c7M T increases to a maximum of 18.054 emu mol-1 K at 11 K. This magnetic behavior of the \u03c7M T versus T plots for 1 shows the presence of the intramolecular ferromagnetic coupling interactions between adjacent Ni2+ centers. Then, the value of \u03c7M T decreases sharply below 11 K; this may be dominantly assigned to the presence of zero-field splitting (ZFS). In brief, the behavior suggests that there exist overall ferromagnetic interactions with the presence of ZFS for Ni2+ ions. The temperature dependence of the reciprocal susceptibilities (1/\u03c7M) obeys the Curie-Weiss law above 30 K for 1 and with a positive Weiss constant \u03b8 = 12.97 K (Figure S10, ), which further support the presence of overall ferromagnetic coupling between the Ni2+ ions in 1. The magnetic property of 2 is similar to that of 1 (Figure S11, ), so we will not describe it further. Such magnetic characteristics are consistent with those reported in previous studies. \n\nAdsorption Properties\n\nThe adsorption isotherms of water, methanol, and ethanol for 2 were measured at 25 \u00b0C. The sample of 2 was heated at 120 \u00b0C for 5 h under a vacuum to remove the guest solvent molecules before the measurements. As shown in Figure , with the increasing of relative pressure (P/P 0), the distinction of the adsorption amount of water and ethanol is more obvious. The amount adsorbed for water and ethanol was 21.4 and 2.7 mg/g, respectively, when the relative pressure reached to 0.95, which is equivalent to the adsorption of 6.3 molecules of water and 0.3 molecules of ethanol per formula unit. As we all know, water and ethanol are easy to form an azeotrope and difficult to separate; the adsorption isotherms indicated that 2 can selectively adsorb water molecules over ethanol to make them separate.
