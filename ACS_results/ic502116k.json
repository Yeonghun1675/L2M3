The CO2 gas sorption isotherm at 196 K (Figure S5, ) further confirmed the permanent porous nature. The hydrogen capacity at normal pressure was assessed for UTSA-57a, with up to 1.0 wt % at 77 K (Figure b). The maximum adsorption of 1.9 wt % at 77 K can be predicted from the Langmuir-Freundlich equation (R 2 = 0.99957).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "UTSA-57", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "240", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "solvent molecules", "condition": ""}, {"value": "400", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "decomposition point", "condition": ""}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "137", "unit": "cm3/g", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": "micropores"}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "", "unit": "", "temperature": "196 K", "pressure": "", "condition": "permanent porous nature"}, {"adsorbate": "H2", "adsorbed amount": "1.0", "unit": "wt%", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "normal pressure", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "", "adsorbed amount": "1.9", "unit": "wt%", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "", "condition": "Langmuir-Freundlich equation"}], "surface area": [{"type": "Langmuir", "probe": "", "value": "330.5", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}, {"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "206.5", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}]}]]], "include_properties": ["decomposition_temperature", "gas_adsorption", "surface_area"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['decomposition_temperature', 'gas_adsorption', 'surface_area']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n  {\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"name\": \"UTSA-57\",\n      \"symbol\": \"\",\n      \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"decomposition temperature\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"240\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"solvent molecules\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"value\": \"400\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"decomposition point\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"gas adsorption\": [\n      {\n        \"adsorbate\": \"N2\",\n        \"adsorbed amount\": \"137\",\n        \"unit\": \"cm3/g\",\n        \"temperature\": \"\",\n        \"pressure\": \"\",\n        \"condition\": \"micropores\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"adsorbate\": \"CO2\",\n        \"adsorbed amount\": \"\",\n        \"unit\": \"\",\n        \"temperature\": \"196 K\",\n        \"pressure\": \"\",\n        \"condition\": \"permanent porous nature\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"adsorbate\": \"H2\",\n        \"adsorbed amount\": \"1.0\",\n        \"unit\": \"wt%\",\n        \"temperature\": \"77 K\",\n        \"pressure\": \"normal pressure\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"adsorbate\": \"\",\n        \"adsorbed amount\": \"1.9\",\n        \"unit\": \"wt%\",\n        \"temperature\": \"77 K\",\n        \"pressure\": \"\",\n        \"condition\": \"Langmuir-Freundlich equation\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"surface area\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"Langmuir\",\n        \"probe\": \"\",\n        \"value\": \"330.5\",\n        \"unit\": \"m2/g\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"BET\",\n        \"probe\": \"\",\n        \"value\": \"206.5\",\n        \"unit\": \"m2/g\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 5, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Organic Linker Mn(III)Cl-ttzpp</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2014-02116k_0006.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Organic Linker Mn(III)Cl-ttzpp   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 10, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Portions of the crystal\nstructure of <bold>UTSA-57</bold>: The four- and eight-connected nodes,\nrepresented by Mn(III)Cl-ttzpp<sup>4\u2013</sup> and {Mn<sub>4</sub>Cl(tetrazolate)<sub>8</sub>} units, respectively, combine to form\na three-dimensional structure with the scu topology.
