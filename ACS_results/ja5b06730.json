The propylene/propane separation factor of ~200 is unprecedented. The ligand treatment neither compromised the crystallinity of the ZIF-67 layer nor changed the thickness of final ZIF-8/ZIF-67 membranes (Figure S18). It is hypothesized that the surface defects of ZIF-67 layers were likely healed during hydrothermal ligand treatment, minimizing defect sites possibly at the interface between ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 layers as well as at the grain boundary, thereby stabilizing the membrane performance. 13C NMR spectra of ZIF-67 powders (Figure S19) revealed peak sharpening after the ligand treatment, implying the increased uniformity of carbon environments due to reduced defect sites.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 22, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Lastly, it was found that this ligand treatment/tertiary\ngrowth\neffect (i.e., enhancing and stabilizing membrane performance) was\nnot specific to ZIF-8 overlayers as verified by ZIF-67/ZIF-67 membranes\n(i.e., ZIF-67 membranes with ZIF-67 overlayers) exhibiting not only\nenhancement in the separation factors but also stabilization in the\nmembrane performance (see  and <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.5b06730/suppl_file/ja5b06730_si_001.pdf\">Figure S20</ext-link>).
