The compounds I and II were excited using a wavelength of 350 and 380 nm, respectively. An emission band at ~395 nm with two shoulders at ca. 490 and 530 nm was observed for compound I (Figure S4a). For II, a maximum at ~450 nm with two shoulders at ~485 and 525 nm was observed (Figure S4b). The observed emissions are due to intraligand emissions. Similar observations have been made before. \n\nThermal Stability and Gas Adsorption Studies\n\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Mettler-Toledo) of the compounds was carried out in the temperature range of 30-850 \u00b0C (heating rate = 5 \u00b0C/min) in oxygen atmosphere (flow rate = 50 mL/min) (Figure S12).

We wanted to explore the water absorption capability of the preheated samples of the compounds I and II (BELSORB aqua). The water sorption isotherm studies indicate a gradual water uptake, which reaches a value of 157 mL/g at p/p 0 = 0.9 and 104 mL/g at p/p 0 = 0.9 for compounds I and II, respectively (Figure S23). The adsorbed water would correspond to 12.5 mol of H2O/mol of I and 9.1 mol of H2O/mol of II. Compound I exhibits a higher water uptake compared to II due to the presence of more open channels.
