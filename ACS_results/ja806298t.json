In the examples exhibiting bulk magnetic properties, the insulation between adjacent layers was less efficient and subsequently the number of next-neighbors surrounding a given chain was higher. This observation suggests that the interlayer interaction might be key as well for the magnetism of these materials, even more important than in-plane direct interchain interactions. This suggests that longer interlayer distances could also promote SCM behavior in other analogous already known oxalate-bridged bimetallic chains and also in other 1D materials where the chains are supramolecularly arranged forming 2D networks.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 11, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Crystal structure file in CIF format, detailed experimental procedure, \u03c7<sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">M</italic>\n</sub> and \u03c7<sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">M</italic>\n</sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic> vs <italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic> plots, Curie\u2212Weiss fitting, FC and ZFC magnetizations, field dependence of the magnetization, hysteresis curve, ln(\u03c7<sub>M</sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">\u2032T</italic>) vs 1/<italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic> plot, Cole\u2212Cole plots at 2.4, 2.3, and 2.2 K, and study of the thermal treatment effect on the magnetic properties of <bold>1</bold>.
