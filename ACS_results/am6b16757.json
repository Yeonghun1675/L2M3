Actually, the FT-IR spectra indicate that the characteristic peak at ca. 1380 cm-1 for NO3 - ion turns weaker and that at ca. 890 cm-1 for MnO4 - ion is stronger. This may suggest that the MnO4 - anions in solution are trapped by 1\u22c5NO  3  with a partial of NO3 - anions being exchanged. However, this clue is insufficient to confirm if the two peaks for MnO4 - and NO3 - arise from the coexistence of two anions in the same crystal or from a mixture of two different crystals. Nevertheless, a sampling inspection of the crystals in different tubes with specific molar ratios of MnO4 - to 1\u22c5NO  3  (e.g., 0.12-0.05 mmol in No. 45 tube) can hit good-quality crystals () for SC-XRD tests. Notably, such reliable success will heavily depend on the quality of original crystals and cannot be accurately controlled. That is to say, the collection of qualified crystals will be random from those tubes with proper starting ratio of MnO4 -:1\u22c5NO  3 .

Further tries to isolate the two products by tuning the concentration gradient in more refined molar ratios also fail, probably due to the very quick conversion from 3\u22c5NO  3  \u22c5MnO  4  to 4\u22c5MnO  4 . Notably, 3\u22c5NO  3  \u22c5MnO  4  and 4\u22c5MnO  4  are isostructural in which coexistence of MnO4 - and NO3 - is found in 3\u22c5NO  3  \u22c5MnO  4 , while only MnO4 - is located at the same position of the lattice for 4\u22c5MnO  4 .

Of most importance, a high-throughput screening method has been developed, based on which a series of intermediates can be successfully isolated and structurally determined. This progress can evidently reveal what happens in the confined coordination space during anion exchange and why the anions could be readily trapped by such dynamic crystal materials, as shown by multistep SC-SC transformations. We hope this new strategy can be broadly applied to illustrate the mechanisms of different solid-state reactions, which is also of great significance for crystal design and material synthesis toward targeted applications.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 26, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information\nis available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsami.6b16757\">10.1021/acsami.6b16757</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Experimental,\nsupplementary structural figures, kinetic curves, crystal photographs,\nPXRD patterns, IR spectra, crystallographic parameters, structural\nfeatures during anion exchange, and UV\u2013vis data (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.6b16757/suppl_file/am6b16757_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Video for anion\nexchange (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.6b16757/suppl_file/am6b16757_si_002.avi\">AVI</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>CCDC 1049524\u20131049528 (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.6b16757/suppl_file/am6b16757_si_003.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acsami.6b16757.
