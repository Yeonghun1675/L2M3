The Mn ions are linked by the BDC2- anions of type V and L ligands to form 2D double layers (Figure b), which are further connected by the BDC2- anions of type VI to generate a 3D framework, and the free water molecules occupy some void space. As shown in Figure c, such a 3D framework is apparently different from compound 2. Although eight bridging ligands ligate the dinuclear metal unit, each dinuclear Mn2 unit is bridged to six nearest neighbors because two pairs of ligands L form a \"double-bridge\".
