Since the\nspectrum at ambient conditions consists of a broad band without vibronic\nstructure, a major contribution to the emission of the <sup>3</sup>XMCT* transition is expected. In this regard, the [<sup>3</sup>MCC*,\nd<sub>Cu</sub> \u2192 (s, p)<sub>Cu</sub>] transition has been closely\nassociated with the Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu distances in the core CuI\ncluster. Complexes with Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu distances longer than\nthe van der Waals radii (&gt;2.8 \u00c5) show poor luminescence from\n[<sup>3</sup>MCC*, d<sub>Cu</sub> \u2192 (s, p)<sub>Cu</sub>]; meanwhile, for shorter distances (&lt;2.8 \u00c5), the Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu\nbonding interaction becomes increasingly important, and most of these\ncomplexes show emissions in this interval. Therefore, the Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu distances play a key role\nin the photoluminescence of cuprous complexes, and reinforces the fact that more than one copper\u00ad(I) ion\nis involved in the excited state. In\nthis crystal there are two relevant bond distances between the copper\u00ad(I)\nions, denoted as Cu1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu1a and Cu1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu1b,\nwith bond lengths of 2.796(4) and 3.466(3) \u00c5, respectively. The\ncompression behavior in the 0.0\u20136.45 GPa pressure range, is\ndifferent for both distances. The first one decreases by \u223c0.1\n\u00c5 to 2.683(6) \u00c5 (4%) and the second one by &gt;0.5 \u00c5\nto 2.932(4) \u00c5 (15%), respectively (). Thus, both strong and weak metal\u2013metal\ninteractions are found. Moreover, the Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu distances\nin the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) have bonding character, which increases with the shortening of the Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu\ndistances; consequently, the energy level tends to lowered, and a\nred shift of the emission band is expected. The fact of the shortening\nof the Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu bonds, together with the emergence of\nvibronic structure above 0.82 GPa, suggests an increase of the contribution\nof the [<sup>3</sup>MCC*, d<sub>Cu</sub> \u2192 (s, p)<sub>Cu</sub>] transition to the total emission. Similar structured bands can\nbe found in the literature for coordination polymers based on copper\u00ad(I)\nhalides and sulfur pyrimidine ligands, where the authors localized the transitions in the Cu<italic>\n<sub>n</sub>\n</italic>I<sub>\n<italic>m</italic>\n</sub> cluster. On the other\nhand, similar mechanochromic effects obtained upon mechanical grinding\nhave been reported recently by Benito et al. in a cubane type [Cu<sub>4</sub>I<sub>4</sub>] complex where an\nadditional band was observed. Considering our complex, emission bands\nclearly shift to red when pressure is applied, which suggests that\nthe mechanochromism induced by pressure is a consequence of a decrease\nof the Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu distances.</p>", "clean_text": "The observed energy band in copper(I) halide clusters has often been related to a triplet metal cluster centered (3MCC*) excited state  involving a CuI core, and independent of the nature of the ligand. In our case, the triplet character of the transition is supported by the phosphorescent lifetimes obtained for the emission (); thus, the transitions can be described as a combination of halide-to-metal (3XMCT*), with X corresponding to iodine ions in the cluster core CuI and metal cluster centered [3MCC*, dCu \u2192 (s, p)Cu] in orbital parentage. Since the spectrum at ambient conditions consists of a broad band without vibronic structure, a major contribution to the emission of the 3XMCT* transition is expected.

The compression behavior in the 0.0-6.45 GPa pressure range, is different for both distances. The first one decreases by ~0.1 \u00c5 to 2.683(6) \u00c5 (4%) and the second one by >0.5 \u00c5 to 2.932(4) \u00c5 (15%), respectively ().
