The \u03c7m T value for 1\u22c5(2H2O) is equal to 2.80 cm3 K mol-1 at 300 K, which is in the range of values expected for HS cobalt(II) ions. As the temperature is decreased from 300 K, the \u03c7m T product remained practically constant from 300 to 225 K, then abruptly dropped around T 1/2\u2193 = 222 K. The \u03c7m T value at 150 K was 0.41 cm3 K mol-1, showing that the spin transition from the HS to the LS state was induced. The spin transition is directly related to the displacement of solvent molecules. On warming, the \u03c7m T value for the compound 1\u22c5(2H2O) was almost constant from 5 to 200 K, then abruptly increased at around T 1/2\u2191 = 223 K, showing that the LS moieties were restored to the HS state with a hysteresis loop (\u0394T = 1 K).
