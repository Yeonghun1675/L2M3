This approach has been used to observe and determine the rate of ring flipping reorientations of benzene rings in MIL-47(V) and MIL-53(Cr), and to characterize the dynamics of phenylene rotors in mesoporous p-phenylenesilica. To determine if similar processes occur in Sc2BDC3, 2H NMR experiments were performed on a static sample which was synthesized using fully deuterated benzene dicarboxylic acid. 2H wide-line NMR spectra recorded in the temperature range 298-383 K are shown in Figure a. At room temperature, the spectrum is dominated by a characteristic Pake doublet powder line shape, with a pair of singularities, or \"horns\", separated by ~130 kHz. However, a second pair of low-intensity horns, separated by approximately 30 kHz, is also observed near the center of the spectrum. With increasing temperature, pronounced changes in the line shape are observed as the central pair of horns increase in intensity relative to the outer horns. To interpret these results, simulations were performed using the EXPRESS software package. 2H wide-line NMR spectra were simulated assuming a 180\u00b0 flip around the C 2 axis of a deuterated benzene ring with deuterium C Q's of 210 kHz and \u03b7Q of 0. Simulations were performed for a range of rate constants between 0 and 5 \u00d7 107 s-1. The changes in the line shape in the simulated spectra, shown in Figure b, resemble those observed in the experimental spectra. However, at temperatures greater than 353 K, smaller changes in the experimental line shape are observed, and the spectra do not appear to exactly follow the changes in line shape predicted by the simulation. A possible explanation for the observed behavior is that one portion of the rings undergo ring flipping while another portion remains immobile or flips with a different rate constant. In this case, the observed spectrum would comprise a superposition of two powder patterns with different degrees of partial averaging, resulting in more complex changes in line shape with temperature. Indeed, given the presence of two crystallographically distinct linkers it is possible that they may each exhibit a different motional behavior. Attempts to characterize the two types of linker separately by 2H MAS NMR were unsuccessful owing to the crystallographically distinct deuterium sites in the structure having the same chemical shift (see  for further details).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 41, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig9\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>9</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Experimental <sup>2</sup>H (9.4 T) wide-line NMR spectra of fully deuterated Sc<sub>2</sub>BDC<sub>3</sub> recorded at temperatures in the range 298\u2013383 K.
