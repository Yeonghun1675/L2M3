After the flask was immersed into an ice bath, dry THF (60 mL) was placed in the flask through the branch. Then titanium tetrachloride (3.2 mL, 29.2 mmol) was slowly added with rapid stirring over approximately 30 min. The mixture was refluxed for 16 h at 90 \u00b0C. Then, the product was filtered and then vacuum-evaporated. A 50 mL portion of chloroform was added to the black oil and then recrystallized with methanol (400 mL) to give a white powder.\n\nSynthesis of cis-1,2-Bis(4-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)ethane and trans-1,2-Bis(4-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)ethane (cis-bpype and trans-bpype)\n\nThe preparation of the ligands cis-bpype and trans-bpype ( and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information) was modified from the original reported procedure. The cis-/trans-bbpe mixture (0.84 mmol, 0.411 g), pyridine-4-boronic acid (6.72 mmol, 1.209 g), tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (Pd(PPh3)4; 0.0588 mmol, 68 mg), and potassium carbonate (25.2 mmol, 3.48 g) were placed in the 100 mL flask. A 30 mL portion of dimethylformamide (DMF) and 8 mL of water were then also added, and the solution was refluxed at 130 \u00b0C for 48 h. After a Schiffs base reaction, the product was first vacuum-evaporated and then extracted three times with dichloromethane. After it was washed with water and dried with anhydrous Na2SO4, the product was recrystallized in petroleum ether to give a pale yellow powder. The final products of cis-bpype and trans-bpype were purified by column chromatography with CH2Cl2/MeOH 30/1 mobile phase; the product ratio of these ligands was 1:1. trans-bpype: 1H NMR (DMSO-d 6, 400 MHz) \u03b4 8.59 (dd, 4H), 7.69-7.62 (m, 8H), 7.23-7.05 (m, 14H). cis-bpype: 1H NMR (DMSO-d 6, 400 MHz) \u03b4 8.58 (4H, dd), 7.70-7.64 (m, 8H), 7.21-7.1 (m, 10H), 7.03 (dd, 4H) (Figure S1).\n\nSynthesis of {Cu4I4(PPh3)4} Starting Material. \n\nCuI (1.9 g, 10 mmol), triphenylphosphine (2.65 g, 0.1 mmol), and 250 mL of toluene were placed in a 500 mL flask, and the solution was refluxed at 120 \u00b0C for 16 h. Then, the product was filtered through double-layered filter paper. The precipitates were dried under vacuum at room temperature, yielding {Cu4I4(PPh3)4} as a white powder.\n\nSolvothermal Synthesis of 1 and 2 \n\nTypically, {Cu4I4(PPh3)4} starting material (19 mg, 0.025 mmol), cis-bpype (8 mg, 0.016 mmol), and acetonitrile (6 mL) were sealed in a Teflon reactor (15 mL) and heated at 120 \u00b0C for 3 days. Yellow block crystals of 1 were obtained in a 40% yield based on Cu. Anal. Calcd for C38H29N3CuI (M r = 718.08): C, 63.56; H, 4.07; N, 5.85. Found: C, 63.51; H, 4.01; N, 5.87.

Then the mixture was heated in a Teflon reactor (15 mL) at 120 \u00b0C for 3 days. Dark yellow crystals of 2 were obtained in a 50% yield based on Cu. Anal.
