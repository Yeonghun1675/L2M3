Furthermore, DFT results suggest that the {W36} clusters could themselves be utilized as building blocks for larger architectures with other electrophiles, and it appears that the cluster possess charge density \"hotspots\" that are the most likely sites of further molecular growth. Future work will aim to realize this architectural strategy as well as focus on the host-guest chemistry of the {K\u2282W36} cluster in solution.
