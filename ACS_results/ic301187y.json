A differential\nscanning calorimetry (DSC) study, performed on crystallite samples\nenclosed in an aluminum cap,  permitted us to follow the dehydration\nprocess. On the basis of  thermogravimetric analysis (Figure ), all  scans have been recorded between 10 and\n280 \u00b0C at a rate of 10 \u00b0C/min in order to avoid any decomposition\nof the sample. The first heating scan has from 100 to 230 \u00b0C\nan intense broad endothermic peak which corresponds to  dehydration\nof compound <bold>3</bold> into compound <bold>5</bold>. These temperatures\nare in good agreement with the temperature of dehydration observed\nby XRPD as a function of temperature. The enthalpy associated to this\nphase transformation is  424 J/g (163 kJ/mol). The value of the enthalpy\ncorresponds to those found in the literature for the dehydration process\nof hydrated coordination compound, and\nits importance reflects the significant structural changes that occur\nbetween the well-crystallized compound <bold>3</bold> and the disordered\ncompound <bold>5</bold>. On the time scale of the DSC experiment,\nthe dehydration process is irreversible since no peak is observed\nduring the first cooling scan. During the second heating scan, the\nDSC curve has between 100 and 150 \u00b0C a small broad endothermic\npeak with an associated enthalpy of 5.6 J/g. This small value of enthalpy\ncan probably be associated to a transition involving  rotation of\nthe thiophene rings from a \u2018glassy\u2019 state to a more\ndisordered state after 100 \u00b0C. Of note, the increase of the \u201cflexiblility\u201d\nof MOF material after  dehydration was previously observed by Loiseau\net al. Finally, this transition has been\nobserved during all  repeating heating and cooling scans recorded\nby DSC but has never been observed on the PXRD diffractogram recorded\nduring the different heating and cooling cycles.

Diffraction patterns collected from 200 to 300 \u00b0C for Mn2(O3P-C4H2S-PO3) present a series of sharp reflections evidencing a loss of crystallinity of the pristine material Mn2(O3P-C4H2S-PO3)\u22c52H2O 3. The stacking periodicity of the inorganic layers deduced from the first peak observed on the X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern in the low-angle region is of 9.3 \u00c5, a value which is in agreement with the stacking distance d 002 ~ 9.4 \u00c5 observed for 3. A differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) study, performed on crystallite samples enclosed in an aluminum cap,  permitted us to follow the dehydration process. On the basis of  thermogravimetric analysis (Figure ), all  scans have been recorded between 10 and 280 \u00b0C at a rate of 10 \u00b0C/min in order to avoid any decomposition of the sample. The first heating scan has from 100 to 230 \u00b0C an intense broad endothermic peak which corresponds to  dehydration of compound 3 into compound 5. These temperatures are in good agreement with the temperature of dehydration observed by XRPD as a function of temperature. The enthalpy associated to this phase transformation is  424 J/g (163 kJ/mol). The value of the enthalpy corresponds to those found in the literature for the dehydration process of hydrated coordination compound, and its importance reflects the significant structural changes that occur between the well-crystallized compound 3 and the disordered compound 5. On the time scale of the DSC experiment, the dehydration process is irreversible since no peak is observed during the first cooling scan. During the second heating scan, the DSC curve has between 100 and 150 \u00b0C a small broad endothermic peak with an associated enthalpy of 5.6 J/g. This small value of enthalpy can probably be associated to a transition involving  rotation of the thiophene rings from a \u2018glassy' state to a more disordered state after 100 \u00b0C. Of note, the increase of the \"flexiblility\" of MOF material after  dehydration was previously observed by Loiseau et al.

Its structure was solved by X-ray diffraction on a single crystal and can be described as alternating inorganic layers connected to organic layer via the phosphonate groups. A remarkable feature of the structure of compound 3 is the orientation of the thiophene heterocycles that adopts two different orientations in two successive layers (along c). In one layer the heterocycles are all oriented in the same direction parallel to b, while in the second layer the heterocycles are head-to-tail aligned along a. Dehydration of compound 3 produced the dehydrated material 5 after  loss of two water molecules. Of note, this dehydrated material was stable up to 500 \u00b0C, pointing out the great stability of the thiophene-2,5-diphosphonic acid moiety. Unfortunately, this material was not crystalline enough for the structure to be solved by X-ray diffraction. Nevertheless,  DSC analysis points out a reproducible low-energy exchange process/transition with an energy exchange around 120 \u00b0C that could arise from the reorientation of the thiophene heterocycle. The low crystallinity of this material did not permit  validation of this hypothesis by X-ray diffraction. After leaving this dehydrated material 5 at room temperature and ambient humidity for 1 month a polymorph Mn2(O3P-C4H2S-PO3)\u22c52H2O 4 was isolated, and surprisingly, this material exhibited  excellent crystallinity. The main difference between the structures of 3 and 4 arises from both the orientation of the thiophene rings (herringbone-type organization in 4) and the structure of the inorganic layers. It can be concluded that the thiophene-2,5-diphosphonic acid moieties engaged in materials 3 and 4 adopt different orientations (rotation around the P-C bonds) and the dehydrated state 5, which is likely more flexible than the hydrated states, allows  reorganization of the organic and inorganic network. Finally, the magnetic behavior of compounds 3 and 4 indicates the antiferromagnetic and weak ferromagnetic behavior, respectively, for these two polymorphs. These results are consistent with the structure of these materials. The dehydrated phase 5 presents paramagnetic behavior.
