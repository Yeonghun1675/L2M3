In Cu(pyz)2(ClO4)2, the titling angle of 66.1\u00b0 leads to an antiferromagnetic interaction of J = -5.3 cm-1. In 2Cu, the elongated octahedron of Cu2+ indicates that the magnetic orbital is d x   2  -  y   2 , whereas the \u03bc1,3-nitrito ligands are at the apical positions. Consequently, the interaction between two magnetic orbitals of Cu ions through \u03bc1,3-nitrito is expected to be weak. On the basis of the above analysis, 2Cu can be magnetically considered as square layers of Cu-pyz. Therefore, \u03c7 data of 2Cu above 10 K were fitted by Lines' quadratic-layer antiferromagnet model with H = JS  i \u22c5S  j  (see the Supporting Information). The best fitting produced J = -6.19(3) cm-1 and g = 2.288(7) with R = 3.4 \u00d7 10-5 (R defined as before). The J value is comparable to the aforementioned ones.
