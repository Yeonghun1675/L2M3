The peak of lower energy is attributable to the \u03c0* transition of the boron atom, whereas the other peak coincides with that of the virgin sample. The presence of the new peak is indicative of the structural change of the BF4 anions to give planar BF3 molecules during electrochemical oxidation. Notably, the presence in the XANES spectrum of the peak attributed to BF4 anions after electrochemical reduction suggests that some of these anions remained in the 1D cavity, which is in accordance with the observed charge-discharge values corresponding to 42% and 67% of the theoretical values. The XANES spectrum of the sample in which anions are inserted electrochemically after electrochemical extraction of the BF4 anions shows the peak at 200 eV, whereas that at 194 eV disappears. This result is indicative of the reaction of the planar BF3 molecule with a fluorine anion, affording the tetrahedral BF4 anion. Some batteries based on fluoride conductors attaching or detaching into or from electrode materials have been previously reported. However, these systems require working temperatures above 150 \u00b0C because they use solid electrodes. In the absence of 1 or 2, electrochemical activities are not observed, which suggests that electrochemical activation of the B-F bonds of the CPs in the cavity is required. It has been reported that the CPs could adsorb and stabilize in their frameworks toxic or explosive molecules such as BF3, CO, and acetylene. The BF3 molecule, which is a strong Lewis acid, would then be trapped in the cavity, and its reaction with other molecules would be prevented. In contrast, the van der Waals radius of the BF4 anion had been previously determined from MM2 and ab initio molecular orbital calculations as 0.227 nm. Considering this value, the size of the cavity of 1 and 2 seems too small for effective electrochemcal extraction of the BF4 anions, which provides further support to the key role of the B-F bond activation (). CPs have been applied to lithium-ion battery or capacitor materials; however, reports on their application to asymmetric anion rocking-chair-type battery materials are still sparse. This is the first example of secondary battery materials using electrochemical B-F bond activation.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 21, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig3\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Charge\u2013discharge curves of cells\nof <bold>1</bold> (green)\nand <bold>2</bold> (violet).

Figure S3 depicts the results of the TGA of 1 and 2, which are characterized by three weight losses up to 500 \u00b0C. The weight was found to gradually decrease with increasing temperature in the first step from room temperature to 200 \u00b0C, followed by an abrupt decrease. The first weight loss amounts to 1.1% and 3.4% for compounds 1 and 2, respectively, from room temperature to 170 \u00b0C, and the second weight loss corresponds to 36% at 320 \u00b0C for both compounds. The first weight loss step corresponds to the loss of water molecules in the one-dimensional (1D) channel to give the dehydrated phases of 1 and 2. The second weight loss is due to thermal decomposition and combustion of the organic ligand to form the oxide phase. Compounds 1 and 2 were heated to 170 \u00b0C in vacuo to yield the dehydrated samples, and the corresponding IR spectra were measured. Figure S4 shows the IR spectra of the as-synthesized and dehydrated samples. The IR spectra of the complexes in the 400-4000 cm-1 range, which are very similar to one another, are dominated by the vibrational modes of the ligands, BF4 anions, and water molecules. The stretching modes of the water molecules are broad and locate around 3600 cm-1. Formation of the dehydrated samples of 1 and 2 was evidenced by the disappearance of the absorption bands of the water molecules from the IR spectrum, whereas those of the bridging ligands and BF4 anions remained visible.
