The polyanions are \u223c1 nm in diameter and almost totally cram pore A. Pore B communicates with pore A through the six open square windows. It was easily observed from the crystal structure that the inside environment of channels is hydrophilic, while phenyl (BTC) increases the hydrophobicity of surface pores around the polyanions. It is thereby reasonable that the reactants with smaller sizes and higher hydrophilicity, such as methyl acetate and ethyl acetate, can diffuse swiftly through the pores. The catalytic reactions take place in the pores, and then the products diffuse into the solution. In this case, substrate accessibility for the surface pores is less important and, as a result, the methyl acetate and ethyl acetate conversions are almost independent of the number of carbon atoms. In contrast, the substrates with larger sizes and higher hydrophobicity (more phenyl) are not readily diffused through the pores, but they may adsorb onto the surface pores containing Keggin complexes, and the acidic protons on the polyanions catalyze the reaction at the surface of the pores. In this case, substrate accessibility for the surface pores is likely to dominate. Although methyl benzoate, ethyl benzoate, and 4-methyl-phenyl propionate have similar sizes in a certain dimension, they have shown different conversions, possibly due to their varied accessibility for the surface of the pore. The attribute that protected the acid sites from poisoning by water, while allowing the reactant molecules ready access to the acidic sites on POMs, is responsible for their highly catalytic activity. In addition, the high POM loading (47%) and the well-dispersed POMs at the molecular level may also serve as advantages.</p>", "clean_text": "The catalytic activity and selectivity of 3a seem to depend on the size and accessibility of the substrates for surface pores. The polyanions are ~1 nm in diameter and almost totally cram pore A. Pore B communicates with pore A through the six open square windows. It was easily observed from the crystal structure that the inside environment of channels is hydrophilic, while phenyl (BTC) increases the hydrophobicity of surface pores around the polyanions. It is thereby reasonable that the reactants with smaller sizes and higher hydrophilicity, such as methyl acetate and ethyl acetate, can diffuse swiftly through the pores. The catalytic reactions take place in the pores, and then the products diffuse into the solution. In this case, substrate accessibility for the surface pores is less important and, as a result, the methyl acetate and ethyl acetate conversions are almost independent of the number of carbon atoms. In contrast, the substrates with larger sizes and higher hydrophobicity (more phenyl) are not readily diffused through the pores, but they may adsorb onto the surface pores containing Keggin complexes, and the acidic protons on the polyanions catalyze the reaction at the surface of the pores.
