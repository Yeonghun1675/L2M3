The asymmetric unit was comprised of one Zn(II) metal center, one molecule of L3, half a molecule of L3 (located on a 2-fold axis passing through the central C\ue5fbO bond, both coordinated to the metal center), and two chloride ions also coordinated to the metal center. Structure of 3 can be best described as a dinuclear Zn(II) complex. The ligand molecule which was located on a 2-fold axis adopted a syn-syn conformation and acted as the bridge between the adjacent metal centers. Interestingly, the terminally coordinated ligand molecules displayed anti-anti conformation. The backbone of both the ligand molecules in the crystal structure of 3 was found to be rigid and planar as expected because of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding involving the >C\ue5fbO and N-H of the adjacent 2-oxoimidazolidine moieties [N\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O = 2.6952(15)-2.7393(19) \u00c5; \u2220N-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O = 129.96(10)-136.60(11)\u00b0]. While both the pyridyl moieties of the bridging ligand were in plane with the 2-oxoimidazolidine backbone, one of the metal coordinated pyridyl rings of the terminally coordinated ligands displayed nonplanarity with the 2-oxoimidazolidine backbone (the dihedral angle involving 2-oxoimidazolidine and pyridyl ring is 44.6\u00b0). Such deviation from planarity could be because of the steric requirement for the intermolecular hydrogen bonding involving 2-oxoimidazolidine moieties positioned next to the deviated pyridyl rings (vide infra). The bimetallic complex was arranged in a parallel fashion stabilized by various weak nonbonded interactions such as C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O [C\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O = 3.333(2) \u00c5; \u2220C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O = 136.47(11)\u00b0], C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cl [3.6220(17) \u00c5)], and C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 [3.566(3) \u00c5], interactions resulting in a 1D wavy tape.

SQUEEZE calculations (which showed a total solvent accessible area volume of 4903.9 \u00c53) indicated the presence of 621e in the asymmetric unit, which may be attributed to 17 MeOH (306e) and 31 H2O (310e) molecules per macrocycle. Thus, in the TG data, a weight loss of 15.0% at the temperature range of 21-77 \u00b0C may be attributed to 17 MeOH molecules (calcd. weight loss for 17 MeOH = 14%). A further weight loss of 29% at the temperature range of 77-325 \u00b0C may be attributed to 31 H2O and 2 ligand molecules (calcd. weight loss for 31 H2O + 2 L4 = 31%). The rest of the four ligands were released within the temperature range of 325-700 \u00b0C with a weight loss of 36% (calcd. weight loss for 4 L4 = 34%) ().\n\nReferences\n\nand\n\nX-ray crystallography: All structures were solved by direct method and refined in a routine manner (see  for details).
