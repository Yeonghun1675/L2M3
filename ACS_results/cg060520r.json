The TGA and DTA experiments indicate that in 2 (after evaporation of the solvent adsorbed on the crystal surface) the lattice-incorporated solvent, about 10% of the initial crystal mass, is lost around 186 \u00b1 20 \u00b0C, and that the porphyrin carboxylate species disintegrate into black amorphous powder only near 391 \u00b1 15 \u00b0C. In 3, similar phenomena occur at 180 \u00b1 30 \u00b0C and 418 \u00b1 15 \u00b0C, respectively. The corresponding DSC scans show a relatively sharp exothermic phase transition near 201 \u00b1 8 \u00b0C in 2, possibly reflecting the collapse of the open metal organic frameworks into a more condensed phase. No phase transition was observed, however, in 3 below 400 \u00b0C. Similar experiments with our related TCPP materials interlinked by exocyclic mononuclear K, Cu, Cu(NH3)6, and Zn bridges6 resulted in a cascaded deterioration and transition between several different phases of the corresponding solid materials (their bulk structures lacking substantial stability in three dimensions) within the same temperature range. The above thermal behavior is consistent with the 3D coordination polymerization in 2 and 3 vs 2D framework formation in the latter materials. The actual composition of the lattice-included solvent phase in 1-3 could not be reliably characterized at this preliminary stage, but this has little relevance to the descriptions of the coordination polymerization and networking patterns in this study.
