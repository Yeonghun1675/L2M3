Antibiotics such as cycloheximide (CHX), piperacillin (PIP), thiamphenicol (TAP), roxithromycin (RXM), azithromycin (AZM), spiramycin (SPM), amoxicillin (AMX), streptovitacin A (STV), oxacillin (OXA), and common organic chemicals including catechol, phenol, m-dichlorobenzene (m-diCB), o-dichlorobenzene (o-diCB), iodobenzene (IB), p-dichlorobenzene (p-diCB), bromobenzene (BB), benzene, chlorobenzene (CB), and aniline basically do not affect the luminescence intensity, whereas nitroimidazoles have a significant quenching effect on the luminescence intensity of 1 in water (b and S10). The maximum luminescence intensity at 614 nm was reduced by 91.6, 72.7, and 51.4% upon exposure to 167.0 \u03bcM concentration of RNZ, dimetridazole (DMZ), and metronidazole (MNZ), respectively. Such a high quenching effect toward RNZ indicates that 1 could serve as a promising sensor for detecting RNZ. Therefore, the fluorescence titration experiment of 1 for RNZ was further performed. As shown in c, the luminescence intensity of 1 dispersed in water progressively decreased with the gradual addition of RNZ. The strong red emission of the suspension of 1 can be observed by the naked eye under UV light, and its brightness dramatically vanishes with higher concentrations of RNZ (Figure S11). The fluorescence quenching efficiency was analyzed using the Stern-Volmer (SV) equation F 0/F = K SV[A] + 1, where K SV is the quenching constant (M-1), [A] is the molar concentration of the analyte, and F 0 and F are the fluorescence intensities before and after the addition of analyte, respectively. The SV plot for RNZ was nearly linear below 125.0 \u03bcM but subsequently deviated from linearity and bent upward at higher concentrations (Figure S12).

In addition, complex 1 could be regenerated and reused by centrifuging the dispersed solution after sensing and washing several times with water, and almost regaining the initial luminescence intensity over seven cycles implied a high photostability and reversibility of 1 for its long-time in-field RNZ detection application (Figures S20 and S21).
