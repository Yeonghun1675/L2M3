The experimental total pore volume obtained from the Ar adsorption isotherm was estimated to be 0.79 cm3\u22c5g-1, which is in good agreement with the theoretical pore volume of 0.90 cm3\u22c5g-1, based on the associated crystal structure.\n\nAccordingly, the porosity of 1-M (M = Fe, Zn) has been confirmed by Ar adsorption (). The apparent BET surface areas of 1-Fe and 1-Zn were estimated to be 2030 and 2360 m2\u22c5g-1, respectively. The experimental total pore volumes of 1-Fe and 1-Zn obtained from Ar adsorption isotherms were estimated to be 0.75 and 0.85 cm3\u22c5g-1, respectively. Interestingly, the isosteric heat of adsorption (Q st) of CO2, estimated by applying the Clausius-Clapeyron equation using the CO2 isotherms measured at 253, 273, 288, and 298 K, was enhanced from 25.2 to 31.8 and 34.6 kJ\u22c5mol-1 at low loading for 1, 1-Fe, and 1-Zn, respectively (). This noticeable enhancement can be attributed to the presence of favorable adsorption metal sites within the metalloporphyrin-based shp-MOFs. In light of the high porosity of shp-MOFs, high-pressure CH4 and CO2 adsorption studies were conducted on the 1 and 1-Zn. Examination of excess and absolute CH4 gravimetric (cm3(STP)\u22c5g-1) () and volumetric (cm3(STP)\u22c5cm-3) () uptakes at intermediate and high pressures showed that 1-Zn exhibits much higher CH4 adsorption capacity than the parent nonmetalated analogue 1 over the entire evaluated pressure range at room temperature. 1-Zn adsorbs 179, 232, and 249 cm3(STP)\u22c5cm-3 of CH4 at 35, 65, and 80 bar, respectively. Consequently, the resulting CH4 working storage capacities, assuming 35, 65, and 80 bar as the highest adsorption pressure and 5 bar as the lowest desorption pressure, are ca. 129, 182, and 199 cm3(STP)\u22c5cm-3, respectively. The recorded value for the 5-80 bar range is among the highest methane storage working capacities, slightly below the corresponding values for MOF-519, UTSA-76a, Al-soc-MOF-1, and HKUST-1 (). Interestingly, the Q st of CH4 adsorption for 1-Zn, determined from variable low-pressure data (), was estimated to be ca. 14 kJ\u22c5mol-1 at low CH4 loading, and it remained remarkably steady even at higher CH4 loading. In fact, this shows that the CH4 interaction with the framework of 1-Zn is very mild and uniform in comparison to other CH4 storage media and mostly governed by the pore filling and the CH4-CH4 interactions at high relative pressures.\n\nAnalysis of CO2 adsorption for these compounds at high pressure () shows that 1-Zn exhibits a very high CO2 volumetric uptake at 25 bar (307 cm3(STP)\u22c5cm-3).
