Numerous studies have revealed a complex relationship between aggregation state and solvation. The view that strong solvation leads to lower aggregation and higher reactivity is too simplistic. An excellent example of this is the use of hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) as additive. Although HMPA is well-known to be an excellent solvent molecule for lithium species, its effect on aggregation is not straightforward. Recent spectroscopic studies show addition of HMPA to lithium salts can actually increase the aggregation state, produce solvent separated species (LiS n  +\u22c5X-), or make no change to the aggregation state. The effect of the solvent appears to be highly dependent on the nature of the substrate being solvated. Polydentate donor solvents such as N,N,N\u2018,N\u2018-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) are widely used in both synthesis and to facilitate crystallization of organometallic compounds. However, studies by Collum question the function of molecules such as TMEDA when in the presence of polar media. Collum has also carried out extensive investigations into the aggregation of lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LHMDS) with various polydentate amine and ether ligands by 6Li, 15N, and 13C NMR spectroscopic studies. LHMDS is widely used since it combines the properties of a strong base with weak nucleophilicity. It is also highly soluble in both hydrocarbon and polar media allowing low temperature reactions to proceed homogeneously.
