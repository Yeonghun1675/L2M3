Therefore, in the solid state luminescent properties of free ligands TCOPM, 4'4-bipy, dpyb, complexes 1, 3, 4, and 5 at room temperature were investigated, as depicted in Figure  and  (Figures S12-16). The emissions of the free ligands are observed with wavelengths from 446 to 570 nm (\u03bbmax = 469 nm) for TCOPM, from 371 to 497 nm (\u03bbmax = 410 nm) for dpyb, and from 361 to 486 nm (\u03bbmax = 380 and 400 nm) for 4'4-bipy, which could be attributed to the \u03c0* \u2192 \u03c0 or \u03c0* \u2192 n transitions. Complex 3 exhibits the same emission characteristics as the free TCOPM ligands, and the emission peak is 467 nm. 4 shows a clearly blue-shift 18 nm compared with that of TCOPM ligand, and 5 is exhibits emission characteristics similar to that of the dpyb ligand. More important is that 1 shows an uncommon red-shift in emission compared to TCOPM, displays an intense emission peak band at \u03bbem = 579 and 610 nm, and emits a bright salmon pink color upon ultraviolet radiation. The excitation scan suggests the luminescence intensity is maximized around \u03bbex = 390 nm. The emission decay lifetimes of compounds 1, 3, 4, and 5 are monitored, and the curves are best fitted by biexponentials in the solid. The emission decay lifetimes of compounds 1, 3, 4 and 5 are complex 1, \u03c41 = 58.87 ns (92.9%) and \u03c42 = 4.004 ns (7.07%) (\u03c72 = 1.024, ); complex 3, \u03c41 = 2.429 ns (33.07%) and \u03c42 = 9.709 ns (66.93%) (\u03c72 = 1.179, ); complex 4, \u03c41 = 1.954 ns (31.99%) and \u03c42 = 7.507 ns (68.01%) (\u03c72 = 1.275, ); complex 5, \u03c41 = 1.017 ns (43.4%) and \u03c42 = 3.425 ns (56.60%) (\u03c72 = 1.024, ). \n\nN2 Adsorption Properties\n\nTo assess the porosity of 1, N2 gas sorption measurement was carried out, and the adsorption isotherm is depicted in  (Figure S22). The N2 isotherm at 77 K reveals that 1 exhibits typical type I adsorption behavior: the adsorption and desorption branches are closed without hysteresis. Compound 1 adsorbs 29.6 cm3 g-1 of N2 at 77 K, corresponding to a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 88.9 m2 g-1 (within the range 0.06 < p/p 0 < 0.2). The N2 adsorption shows very good reversibility. However, the gas uptakes are not as high as the pore volume derived from the crystal structure, which suggests that the framework of 1 is significantly collapsed or shrunk by the removal of the guests.
