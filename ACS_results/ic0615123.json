Compound 4, such as compound 3, contains one protonated sulfonate group, and the ligand is present as a dianion. The structure of 4 is remarkably similar to that of 3. Compound 4, at the lowest level of assembly, is composed of tetragonally elongated [Cu(py)4]2+ units which are linked, via axial ligation of sulfonate groups of HL2-, into 1-D ribbons. The coordination spheres of the two crystallographically unique Cu centers, as in 1-3, are again Jahn-Teller distorted octahedra (Cu-N = 2.016(5)-2.038(5) \u00c5, Cu-O = 2.414-2.545(4) \u00c5). The higher orders of assembly for 4 are exactly as in those of 3 in that ribbons align to form layers and layers subsequently interdigitate to form open channels. Figure  shows an overlaid view comparing the structures of the 1-D ribbons formed by compounds 3 and 4. Clearly, the structural relation is very close, although the exact orientations of each coordinated pyridyl group differ slightly. In 4, as in 3, the primary interactions sustaining an individual layer are van der Waals interactions between pyridyl groups and between pyridyl groups and L molecules (C\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C = 3.8-4.0 \u00c5). The final level of assembly involves the interdigitation of pendent aryl moieties to form channels as shown in Figure . The channels in 4 are more circular than those in 3 having dimensions of ~16.7 \u00d7 16.7 \u00c5. The channels are filled with a mix of ordered and disordered water molecules, 2.25 per copper center, as modeled crystallographically. The interdigitated aryl groups overlap at their edges to define the walls of the channels with the shortest C\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C distances of 3.285(8)-3.322(8) \u00c5.

Compound 1 is a discrete cage with an inexchangeable pyridine guest. Compound 2 is a ladder-type 1-D  structure which includes water and pyridine guests. Compound 3 assembles from a 1-D ribbon to layers to its ultimate form of a large open-channel solid. Notably, the metal-coordination sphere in all three compounds is identical, yet three different networks result. In addition to highlighting the subtleties involved in forming network coordination solids, the two infinite frameworks, 2 and 3, can be related so as to provide an insight to the network growth. By employment of a structure-directing agent in a preparation with identical building blocks, another network, 4, structurally almost identical to the minor product 3, can be formed as the sole product solid. The large open frameworks that result in 3 and 4, although themselves not robust, offer a paradigm for the construction of porous materials from low-dimensional building blocks.
