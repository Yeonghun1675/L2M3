In this respect, the X-ray optical activity at the L3-edge of rare-earth ions in Dy helices strongly differs from those of the previously investigated CoII and MnII, which revealed a large XNCD signal due to interference of 1s \u2192 3d quadrupolar and 1s \u2192 4p dipolar transitions. These findings suggest that, despite the fact that strong spin noncollinearity of Ln-based helices makes them strong candidates for the observation of MChEs, using hard X-rays does not appear to be straightforward for such investigations.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 39, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig5\" position=\"float\">\n<label>5</label>\n<caption>\n<p>XANES spectrum at the L<sub>3</sub>-edge of\nDy measured at room temperature in zero field (black line) obtained\nas 1/2\u00ad(\u03c3<sup>r</sup> + \u03c3<sup>l</sup>) and XNCD spectra\ngiven by (\u03c3<sup>r</sup> \u2013 \u03c3<sup>l</sup>) for two\nenantiomeric crystals. \u03c3<sup>r</sup> and \u03c3<sup>l</sup> denote X-ray absorption cross sections for right and left circularly\npolarized X-rays, respectively.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr5\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2016-01010j_0006.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 5  XANES spectrum at the L3-edge of Dy measured at room temperature in zero field (black line) obtained as 1/2(\u03c3r + \u03c3l) and XNCD spectra given by (\u03c3r - \u03c3l) for two enantiomeric crystals. \u03c3r and \u03c3l denote X-ray absorption cross sections for right and left circularly polarized X-rays, respectively.
