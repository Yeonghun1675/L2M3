After this \"pseudo-plateau\", decomposition starts.\n\nPrior to the gas-phase catalysis, the permanent porosity of 2 was confirmed by means of the N2 and the CO2 adsorption isotherms at 77 and 273 K, respectively (Figures S11 and S12). N2 isotherm shows an enhancement of the accessible void space for 2 compared with the ancestor 1, with a calculated Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 1189 m2/g with a calculated pore size of 1.38 nm. This behavior, showing an increase of 30% in the maximum amount of N2 adsorbed compared to the isomorphous compound 1, suggests an enhanced structural stability after the PS cation metathesis to yield 2.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "2", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "150", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "fast mass loss", "condition": "room temperature"}, {"value": "275", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "smooth mass loss", "condition": "loss of the water molecules coordinated to iron(III) cations"}], "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "N2", "value": "1189", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}], "pore diameter": [{"value": "1.38", "unit": "nm", "condition": ""}]}]]], "include_properties": ["decomposition_temperature", "surface_area", "pore_diameter"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['decomposition_temperature', 'surface_area', 'pore_diameter']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n  {\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"name\": \"\",\n      \"symbol\": \"2\",\n      \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"decomposition temperature\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"150\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"fast mass loss\",\n        \"condition\": \"room temperature\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"value\": \"275\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"smooth mass loss\",\n        \"condition\": \"loss of the water molecules coordinated to iron(III) cations\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"surface area\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"BET\",\n        \"probe\": \"N2\",\n        \"value\": \"1189\",\n        \"unit\": \"m2/g\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"pore diameter\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"1.38\",\n        \"unit\": \"nm\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 7, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Views of the porous crystal\nstructures, determined by single crystal\nX-ray diffraction, of <bold>2</bold> along the <italic>c</italic> (left)\nand <italic>a</italic> (right) axes, respectively.
