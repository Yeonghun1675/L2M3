When present, also counterions and solvent molecules were described by rigid models. The peak shapes were described by the fundamental parameters approach. In the case of 1, 3, 5, and 6, the anisotropic broadening of the peaks was modeled by means of spherical harmonics. This model alone is not enough in the case of 1 because of the very high anisotropy of its peaks. A different approach, modeling paracrystallinity, is presently under development. The background was modeled by a Chebyshev polynomial function. The thermal effect was simulated by using a single isotropic parameter for the metal ions, augmented by 2.0 \u00c52 for lighter atoms.

On the contrary, all of the other tested materials exhibit type I adsorption isotherms with a sharp knee at low relative pressures (p/p 0 ~ 0.01) corresponding to the filling of the porous structure, followed by a plateau, suggesting that the permanent porosity of the samples is mainly composed of micropores, of quite uniform size (Figure ). The presence of a hysteresis loop at relative pressures above 0.8 bar in the isotherms of 2, 3, 5, and 6 is indicative of textural mesoporosity arising from interparticle mesopores (voids), delaying gas release while passing from higher to lower relative pressures.
