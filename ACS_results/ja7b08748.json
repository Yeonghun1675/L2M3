The widespread implementation of sustainable nuclear energy thus requires the development of efficient iodine stores that have simultaneously high capacity, stability and more importantly, storage density (and hence minimized system volume). Here, we report high I2 adsorption in a series of robust porous metal-organic materials, MFM-300(M) (M = Al, Sc, Fe, In). MFM-300(Sc) exhibits fully reversible I2 uptake of 1.54 g g-1, and its structure remains completely unperturbed upon inclusion/removal of I2. Direct observation and quantification of the adsorption, binding domains and dynamics of guest I2 molecules within these hosts have been achieved using XPS, TGA-MS, high resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction, pair distribution function analysis, Raman, terahertz and neutron spectroscopy, coupled with density functional theory modeling. These complementary techniques reveal a comprehensive understanding of the host-I2 and I2-I2 binding interactions at a molecular level. The initial binding site of I2 in MFM-300(Sc), I2 I, is located near the bridging hydroxyl group of the [ScO4(OH)2] moiety [I2 I\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5H-O = 2.263(9) \u00c5] with an occupancy of 0.268. I2 II is located interstitially between two phenyl rings of neighboring ligand molecules [I2 II\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5phenyl ring = 3.378(9) and 4.228(5) \u00c5]. I2 II is 4.565(2) \u00c5 from the hydroxyl group with an occupancy of 0.208. Significantly, at high I2 loading an unprecedented self-aggregation of I2 molecules into triple-helical chains within the confined nanovoids has been observed at crystallographic resolution, leading to a highly efficient packing of I2 molecules with an exceptional I2 storage density of 3.08 g cm-3 in MFM-300(Sc).\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nSynthesis and Crystal Structure Analysis\n\nThe synthesis of the series of isostructural MOFs, MFM-300(M) (M = Al, Sc, In), was conducted following the reported methods. The synthesis of MFM-300(Fe) is reported here for the first time. The solvated framework complex [Fe2(OH)2(C16H6O8)]\u22c5(H2O)1.5\u22c5(C3H7NO)1.8 was prepared via solvothermal reaction of H4L (H4L = biphenyl-3,3',5,5'-tetracarboxylic acid) and FeCl3\u22c56H2O in dimethylformamide (DMF) and was isolated as a microcrystalline yellow powder. Structure solution by synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction confirmed that this material crystallizes in the tetragonal space group I4122, and is isostructural to the related MFM-300(Al, Sc, In) materials. MFM-300(Fe) exhibits an open structure consisting of chains of [FeO4(OH)2] moieties bridged by tetracarboxylate ligands L4- to afford a porous structure with channels formed by corner-sharing [FeO4(OH)2] octahedra linked via two mutually cis-\u03bc2-OH groups. The cis-\u03bc2-OH groups in MFM-300(Fe) tie the framework into a rigid \"wine-rack\" arrangement. Desolvated MFM-300(Fe) displays a surface area of 1193 m2 g-1 (a total pore volume of 0.46 cm3 g-1), as determined from the N2 isotherm at 77 K, consistent with the porosity derived from the crystal structure (pore volume of 0.46 cm3 g-1). The porosity data for MFM-300(M) (M = Al, Sc, In) materials are comparable to those previously reported, and confirm the complete activation and phase purity of these materials.\n\nThe uptake of I2 within all MFM-300 materials is reversible and the host can be fully regenerated upon desorption under heating. Based upon a pore filling model at saturation, the density of adsorbed I2 in MFM-300 can be calculated using the pore volume and the saturated I2 uptake and compared with a number of reported MOFs (). Interestingly, MFM-300 show very high storage densities (2.54-3.08 g cm-3) of I2 in the pore. Significantly, an exceptional density of 3.08 g cm-3 has been obtained for adsorbed I2 in MFM-300(Sc), exceeding those reported for the state-of-the-art MOFs such as [Zn3(DL-lac)2(pybz)2] (2.48 g cm-3), [Zr6O4(OH)4(peb)6] (peb2- = 4,4'-[1,4-phenylenebis(ethyne-2,1-diyl)]-dibenzoate) (2.41 g cm-3), HKUST-1 (2.36 g cm-3) and ZIF-8 (1.89 g cm-3) (). This value is 63% of that for solid I2 (4.93 g cm-3 at 298 K) and indicates highly efficient packing of adsorbed I2 molecules within the pores of MFM-300(Sc).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name":
