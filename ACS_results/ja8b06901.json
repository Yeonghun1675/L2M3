Fits of the decay lifetime measured for D  Pd  were thus performed accordingly with eq 1 in the Supporting Information (SI), derived from the TADF model. Values of \u0394E(S1-T1) = 1290 cm-1, \u03c4(S1) = 18.6 ns and \u03c4(T1) = 218 \u03bcs were extracted. They are comparable to those obtained for the precursor A (\u0394E(S1-T1) = 1560 cm-1, \u03c4(S1) = 9.9 ns and \u03c4(T1) = 185 \u03bcs) and support a priori a TADF mechanism. On the other hand, attempts to fit the decay lifetime for D  Pt  to eq 1 are less than satisfactory given the lack of data points at the high temperature regime. Nevertheless, a rough estimate of a \u0394E(S1-T1) of 2980 cm-1 and a \u03c4(T1) of 7.4 \u03bcs is obtained by fitting the data to the TADF equation. The relatively large \u0394E(S1-T1) estimated for D  Pt  is still within the thermal energy barrier (0.4 eV or 3230 cm-1) possible for reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). The shorter \u03c4(T1) than those observed in the Cu(I) and D  Pd  TADF systems is not unreasonable given the larger spin-orbit coupling (SOC) constant for Pt. Nevertheless, it is difficult to confirm the TADF nature for D  Pt  with certainty as one cannot exclude the possibility of the competition between ISC to give phosphorescence and RISC to give TADF in D  Pt ; i.e., platinum can provide significant SOC, resulting in efficient phosphorescence path in addition to the TADF path. Therefore, considering that D  M  derivatives are isostructural, the differences observed along the series clearly suggest a strong impact of the nature of the central M atom in their photophysical properties. Taking into account the large size of the molecules (417 atoms, 4417 basis functions) and the influence of the solid-state packing on the geometry, it was not possible to perform full DFT geometry optimization of the excited states to get deep insights about the electronic causes of these different photophysical properties. Nevertheless, the study of the molecular orbitals of the ground state and the nature of the first vertical singlet and triplet excited states of D  M  are significantly instructive. It reveals that in all cases the vertical excitation to S1 is described by a combination of electronic transitions from the highest occupied orbitals to the lower-lying unoccupied orbitals. They include the LUMO at different scale depending on the central metal atom (7.5% of the transitions for D  Ni ; 43.7% for D  Pd ; 59.9% for D  Pt ). Moreover, these LUMOs are partly localized on the central metal atom at different extent regarding the nature of M: less than 6% of M atomic character for D  Ni  and D  Pd , while it reaches up to 12.8% for D  Pt  (). Consequently, the implication of the electronic density of the central metal atom in the overall electronic transition upon the excitation process is less than 1% for D  Ni , is 2% for D  Pd  but reaches up to 8% for D  Pt . This is nevertheless sufficient to imply enhancement of the SOC components both in the nonradiative and radiative processes involving S1, with a magnitude order of Ni < Pd \u226a Pt.
