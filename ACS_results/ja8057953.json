Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a break-through in this respect; however, MOFs have one major disadvantage, their weak stability. New MOFs appear at a high pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare. Here we present a new zirconium-based building brick that allows the synthesis of high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability. In the synthesis of new MOFs, the structure of the organic linkers can be controlled, while the formation of the inorganic building brick and how the organic linkers will coordinate with this inorganic unit is still pure serendipity. However, once the synthesis of an inorganic brick has been established, is it possible to reproduce this unit, and also reproduce it when used in combination with new linkers. This has been demonstrated both by the elegant isoreticular synthesis of the IRMOF-1\u221216 and by the fact that an impressive number of new MOFs are based on surprisingly few highly symmetrical inorganic building units: the Cu<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub> brick from HKUST-1, the Zn<sub>4</sub>O(CO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub> brick from MOF-5, and the Cr<sub>3</sub>O(OH)<sub>3</sub>(CO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub> cornerstone from MIL-88. The stability of the framework is mainly controlled by the inorganic brick and the strength of the chemical bonding between the inorganic brick and the linker. Identification of stable, flexible new inorganic building units is therefore of utmost importance for the development of new, usable, open hybrid structures. The thermal stability of MOFs is usually limited to 350\u2212400 \u00b0C; there is only one example of a porous MOF structure that is stable above 500 \u00b0C, that is MIL-53.
