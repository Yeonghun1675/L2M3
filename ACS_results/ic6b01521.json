To our surprise, only upon gradual addition of 120 \u03bcL of 4-NP solution (5 \u00d7 10-4 M), the photoluminescence intensity decreases to 14.59% for MOF 1. The photoluminescence quenching by 4-NP could be determined at very low concentration (0.25 \u03bcM) for MOF 1 (). In other words, the detection limit of 4-NP is 34.48 ppb, which is lower than those of known MOFs. It is more interesting that other nitroaromatic explosives show minor effects on the photoluminescence intensity of MOF 1, compared with 4-NP (). These results indicate that MOF 1 has high sensitivity and selectivity to detect 4-NP. The photoluminescence quenching efficiency can be quantitatively explained by the Stern-Volmer (SV) equation: (I 0/I) = 1 + K sv [Q], in which K sv is the quenching constant (M-1), [Q] is the molar concentration of the nitroaromatic analyte, and I 0 and I are the photoluminescence intensities before and after adding the nitroaromatic analyte, respectively. At low concentrations, the SV plots of 4-NP display nearly linear (R 2 = 0.9981), as shown in b.
