second phase is obtained in which the fenbufen has been fully oxidized. It has not been possible to isolate this phase pure as some amorphous inorganic material is always formed under these conditions and this becomes the dominant reaction product at even higher temperatures. This phase, Zn<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>6</sub>(C<sub>13</sub>H<sub>9</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub> (<bold>2</bold>), crystallizes with a monoclinic structure (space group <italic toggle=\"yes\">C</italic>2/<italic toggle=\"yes\">c</italic>) which is shown in Figure a with full crystallographic details given in Table . The structure comprises zinc hydroxide layers separated by a bilayer of coordinated biphenyl-4-carboxylate anions. Within these layers (Figure b) there are three crystallographically distinct Zn atoms. Two of these have a 5-coordinate trigonal bipyramidal geometry while the third Zn atom has an out-of-center, distorted octahedral environment, with an unusually long Zn\u2013O bond. The five-coordinate zinc atom Zn(1) is bound to the four hydroxides and one carboxylate O atom, while Zn(2) is coordinated by three hydroxides and O atoms from two different biphenyl-4-carboxylate anions. Both five-coordinate zinc atoms are associated with a nearly linear O\u2013Zn\u2013O angle, corresponding to the bipyramid axis and the bipyramids are elongated along this direction. The coordination geometries can be more accurately described as trigonal bipyramidal with some distortion toward square pyramidal geometry. The value of \u03c4, a geometric parameter which gives a measure of the amount of distortion in these 5-coordinate systems, is 0.78 for Zn(1) and 0.94 for Zn(2), indicating that they are closer to ideal trigonal bipyramidal geometry than the square pyramidal one. Zn(3) is surrounded by three hydroxides, two carboxylate O atoms from different anions, with a longer bond of 2.5163(2) \u00c5 to a fourth hydroxide anion. Each of the biphenyl-4-carboxylate anions in the structure bridges between two Zn cations. The layer also contains an unusual hydroxide-centered Zn<sub>4</sub>OH(OH)<sub>4</sub> unit. Unlike the other OH groups which are 3-coordinate, the coordination environment of the central hydroxide anion has two long (2.558(3) and 2.530(3) \u00c5) and two short bonds (2.018(7) and 2.053(7) \u00c5) to the zinc atoms. This OH group is located on a crystallographic 2-fold rotation axis and must therefore have an even number of off-axis Zn neighbors. However, two bonds to Zn are too few to satisfy the bonding requirements of this hydroxide and four too many, so the coordination environment is distorted to give an effective coordination number of three from two short and two long interactions. The central hydroxide (O7A) is split into two different positions each with a 50% site occupancy. Attempts to refine a single site anisotropically produced an extremely prolate ellipsoid indicating that the disordered model is the correct one. This arrangement of Zn\u2013O bonds ensures that the OH group contributes a total of 1.0 vu to the Zn atoms and the valence sum of Zn\u2013O bonds is 2.
