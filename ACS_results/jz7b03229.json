As shown in Table S2, no phase transitions are observed in both HOIPs in the measured temperature range. Upon heating, both 1-Zn and 2-Cu expand linearly along the a and c axes with thermal expansion coefficients \u03b1 a(1-Zn) = 39.8(3) and \u03b1 c(1-Zn) = 26.6(5) MK-1, and \u03b1 a(2-Cu) = 51.8(5) and \u03b1 c(2-Cu) = 25.7(5) MK-1, respectively (Figures S5). Strikingly, 1-Zn exhibits negative thermal expansion (NTE) along the b-axis with \u03b1 b(1-Zn) = -5.2(5) MK-1, while 2-Cu shows positive thermal expansion (PTE) along corresponding direction \u03b1 b(2-Cu) = 3.2(7) MK-1 (a). Such an interesting positive-to-negative switch is primarily attributed to the distinct hydrogen-bonding modes in these two HOIPs. To elucidate the NTE mechanism in 1-Zn, we decompose the six hydrogen bonds within a pseudocubic unit cell along three orthogonal axes. As seen in Table S3, the total projections of hydrogen-bonding (N-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O distance) along the b-axis is ~50% larger than that along a, which consequently leads to significantly higher constraints of the pseudocubic unit cell along b- than a-axis upon thermal perturbation. In this regard, the a-axis expands so rapidly that the b-axis has to shrink upon heating as illustrated using the \"hinge-strut\" model in b. However, the situation in 2-Cu is different because of the lattice distortion induced by the JT effect. Though the total projections of hydrogen-bonding along a- and b-axis in 2-Cu are reminiscent of those in 1-Zn, the hydrogen-bonding angle changes dramatically. As seen in Tables S4, the bond angles of N1-H1A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O6 and N1-H1B\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O4 in 2-Cu are ~9\u00b0 and ~2\u00b0 larger than the corresponding N1-H1A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O1 angle in 1-Zn, which lead to ~0.20 and ~0.08 \u00c5 longer H1A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O6 and H1B\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O4 bond lengths. These stretched H-bonds significantly weaken the linking strengths between the Gua and framework along the b-axis in 2-Cu, thus giving rise to large enough thermal expansivity which cannot be compensated by the a-axis expansion upon heating. Such a cooperative process, coupled with octahedral tilting, lead to an opposite \"hinge-strut\" motion (c) compared with the scenario 1-Zn; hence, PTE occurs along the b-axis in 2-Cu.
