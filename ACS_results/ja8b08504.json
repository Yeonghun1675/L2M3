A closer examination revealed that site I also forms supramolecular interactions to two aromatic -CH groups from two adjacent phenyl rings [-CH\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C\ue5fcC(centroid) = 3.23(2), 3.48(3) \u00c5] and becomes the most populated location owing to this cooperativity between sites. Site III (occupancy 0.31) is stabilized by a combination of three types of interactions to the host: (i) hydrogen bonds between the D(\u03b4+) of C2D2 molecules and O(\u03b4-) center of the -NO2 group [D\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O = 1.99(9), 2.35(6) \u00c5]; (ii) supramolecular interactions between the C\ue5fcC bond and the -CH group on adjacent NO2-decorated phenyl rings [-CH\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C\ue5fcC(centroid) = 2.47(9), 2.80(4) \u00c5]; (iii) intermolecular dipole interactions between \u03c0-electrons in the C\ue5fcC bond (site III) and D atoms of C2D2 at site IV. Site IV (occupancy 0.26) is also stabilized by hydrogen bonds between C2D2 molecules and -NO2 groups [D\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5ONO2 = 1.69(2) \u00c5] and a -CH bond of the NO2-decorated phenyl ring [-CH\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C\ue5fcC(centroid) = 3.11(4) \u00c5]. Moreover, there is a weak \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interaction between C\ue5fcC bond of C2D2(IV) and the NO2-decorated phenyl ring [ring centroid\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C\ue5fcC(centroid) = 4.46(8) \u00c5]. Site V (occupancy = 0.16) is at the window between the cylindrical and spherical cages involving similar side-on mode interactions with the -CH group of the NO2-decorated phenyl ring [-CH\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C\ue5fcC(centroid) = 2.63(5) \u00c5] and the hydrogen bond to the -NO2 group [D\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5ONO2 = 3.05(10), 3.17(7) \u00c5]. Site VI (occupancy = 0.09) is located in the center of the elongated cage, interacting directly with the -NO2 group from three surrounding ligands with D\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5ONO2 distances ranging from 2.37(1) to 2.56(3) \u00c5. Overall, C2D2 molecules at sites III-VI are all directly associated with the -NO2 groups in the pore, confirming the positive effect of -NO2 group in achieving optimal acetylene binding.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 12, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig3\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>View of the binding sites for adsorbed C<sub>2</sub>D<sub>2</sub> molecules in MFM-102-NO<sub>2</sub>.
