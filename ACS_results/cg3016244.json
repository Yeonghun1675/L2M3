For comparison, the photodegradation process of MO or RhB solutions without any photocatalyst were also studied under the same conditions (Figure S6, ). As illustrated in Figure , the absorbances decreased and the changes in the concentration (C  t  /C0) of MO and RhB solutions were plotted versus irradiation time with using complex 1 as photocatalyst. It can be seen that approximately 68.8% of MO and approximately 13% of RhB have been decomposed after 3 h of irradiation, and the degradation rates are 23 \u00d7 10-2 h-1 and 4.3 \u00d7 10-2 h-1, respectively. These results indicated that catalyst 1 is more active for the decomposition of MO under UV light irradiation.\n\nOn the basis of above photocatalytic results, we can see that complexes 1 and 2 have an enormous advantage during the photocatalytic decomposition of MO compared to RhB under the identical photocatalytic process and concentration (Figure ). It is noted that approximately 25% of MO has been decomposed during the first 30 min with using 2 as photocatalyst, which indicated that 2 is more effective than 1 in photocatalytic decomposition of MO. Moreover, the BET surface areas of 1 and 2 were 0.59, and 0.66 m2 g-1, respectively. The relative activity for two complexes might be caused by different BET surface areas. The photocatalytic degradation of RhB solution is not obviously observed, implying no photocatalytic activity of two complexes under UV. It is clear that two complexes possessed higher activity for MO than RhB; however, the detailed reason is difficult to explain at the current stage.
