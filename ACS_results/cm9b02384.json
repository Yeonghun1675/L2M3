A representative emission spectrum collected under 980 nm excitation is shown in a for nanocrystals featuring a 6.00 mol % nominal rare-earth concentration. Results for other compositions are given in the Supporting Information (Figure S11). Three major emission bands arising from intraconfigurational f-f transitions of the Er3+ activator are observed upon excitation of the Yb3+ sensitizer. These transitions are 2 H 11/2 \u2192 4 I 15/2 (525 nm, green), 4 S 3/2 \u2192 4 I 15/2 (545 nm, green), and 4 F 9/2 \u2192 4 I 15/2 (660 nm, red). The integrated intensities of the corresponding emission bands increase with the total rare-earth concentration, indicating that concentration quenching does not occur (see Figure S12). Power-dependent measurements are consistent with two-photon upconversion processes for all three emission bands (see Figure S13). A very weak emission band centered at ~410 nm is also observed. This emission corresponds to the 2 H 9/2 \u2192 4 I 15/2 transition of Er3+, and its appearance indicates that three-photon upconversion occurs in Er:Yb:BaFCl nanocrystals. The spectral distribution of the upconverted photons is characterized by a red-to-green ratio in the 10-12 range and a yellow emission visible to the naked eye. Red-to-green ratios were computed as the quotient between the integrated intensity of the band centered at 660 nm and the sum of the integrated intensities of the bands centered at 525 and 545 nm. No dependence of the spectral distribution on the rare-earth concentration and the excitation density is observed within the 0.5-2.3 W cm-2 range. Nanocrystals featuring a 4.50 mol % rare-earth concentration are the sole exception to this trend. For this composition, a red-to-green ratio equal to ~25 is consistently observed for different batches; accordingly, these nanocrystals show orange red emission.
