The asymmetric unit consists of one Zn ion and one DCPCBim ligand.\nThe central Zn<sup>II</sup> ion is five-coordinated by five O atoms\n(Zn\u2013O 1.92\u20132.44 \u00c5) from four different ligands.\nTwo carboxylates bridge two Zn atoms to form a Zn<sub>2</sub> dimeric\nsecondary building unit (SBU). Each Zn<sub>2</sub> SBU binds with\nsix different DCPCBim ligands, including two bridging carboxylates\nin a carboxylate O,O\u2032 mode, one chelating carboxylate in a\n\u03b7<sup>2</sup>-mode, and one monodentate carboxylate for each\nZn atom (Figure a). The Zn<sub>2</sub> SBUs\nare linked via an imidazolium tricarboxylate to form a 2D framework\n(Figure b). If the Zn<sub>2</sub> dimeric\nunit and the DCPCBim ligand are simplified as 6- and 3-connected nodes,\nrespectively, the framework can be simplified as a 2D binodal 3,6-connected\nnet with the point (Schla\u0308fli) symbol (4<sup>2</sup>.6)<sub>2</sub>(4<sup>4</sup>.6<sup>9</sup>.8<sup>2</sup>) with the 6- and\n3-connected nodes in a ratio of 1:2 (Figure e). This represents an unprecedented 2D network topology with intralayer\nporosity rather than interlayer porosity. The overall charge of the framework is in balance,\nand the framework is of a charge-separated nature (see below). The\n1D intralayer channels exist along the <italic toggle=\"yes\">b</italic> axis, as\nshown in Figures b,c, and the solvated DMF\nmolecules reside in the channels (Figures f,g). The 2D flat layers slide in two directions to stack in an ABCA\u2032B\u2032C\u2032\npacking mode and are repeated every six layers (Figure d). The adjacent 2D layers are packed via offset face-to-face\n\u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions between para-substituted phenyl\nrings with an interplaner distance of 3.43 \u00c5. The distance between\nthe adjacent 2D layers is 6.44 \u00c5. Upon removal of the solvated\nmolecules, there is 17.3% void space to the total crystal volume (total\npotential solvent area volume 657.5 \u00c5<sup>3</sup> per unit cell\nvolume 3808.4 \u00c5<sup>3</sup>) calculated using <italic toggle=\"yes\">PLATON</italic>.\n</p><p>Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)\nof <bold>DCPCBim-MOF-Zn</bold> shows a weight loss of 7.99% from room\ntemperature to 250 \u00b0C corresponding to the loss of one guest\nDMF (calcd 7.78%; Figure a). There is no weight\nloss from 250 to 400 \u00b0C. The framework may decompose above 400\n\u00b0C.</p><p>A N<sub>2</sub> adsorption isotherm was first measured as showing neglectable\nuptake by the framework even at low temperature (Figure ). Such a behavior has been reported for some MOFs. However, CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption of <bold>DCPCBim-MOF-Zn</bold> at 195 K revealed a type I profile with a steep\nuptake at low-relative-pressure regions. The adsorption capacity at\n1 atm is 56.2 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> (11.0 wt %) at\n195 K, corresponding to 1.1 CO<sub>2</sub> molecules per DCPCBim ligand.\nThe Langmuir and Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) surface\nareas calculated from the CO<sub>2</sub> profile are 245 and 222 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup>, respectively. According to the Horvath\u2013Kawazoe\nmethod, the pore volume was calculated as 0.104 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> and the pore width is centered around 3.7 \u00c5.\nInterestingly, the isotherms show remarkable hysteresis loops between\nthe adsorption and desorption branches even at 298 K. This is unusual\nbecause hysteresis loops are usually temperature-dependent and tend\nto be unconspicuous with increasing temperature. For example, an indium carboxylate framework NOTT-202 exhibits\nadsorption\u2013desorption hysteresis only when the temperature\nis below the triple point of CO<sub>2</sub>. The hysteresis confines the gas molecules within the pores at high\npressure and releases them at low pressure, thus potentially enhancing\ngas uptake for potential application. The strong interaction of CO<sub>2</sub> with the framework is reflected in the high value of <italic toggle=\"yes\">Q</italic>\n<sub>st</sub> (ca. 30 kJ mol<sup>\u20131</sup>) calculated\nfrom the isotherms at 273 and 298 K using the Clausius\u2013Clapeyron\nequation. The value is comparable to those of Cu<sub>3</sub>(BTC)<sub>2</sub> (BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate, HKUST-1) and others with\nexposed metal sites. Therefore, the hysteretic\nsorption and large <italic toggle=\"yes\">Q</italic>\n<sub>st</sub> suggest a strong\ninteraction of CO<sub>2</sub> molecules with the narrow-pored and\ncharge-separated framework. This is different\nfrom previous observations that the hysteretic gas adsorption behavior\nis induced by partial double interpenetration or guest cations within the pore channels (i.e., the gas\nis kinetically trapped in the framework).\n</p><p>The activated <bold>DCPCBim-MOF-Zn</bold> after MeOH exchange\nwas also tested for H<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> uptake (Figure ), which revealed H<sub>2</sub> uptake up to 66.4\ncm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> (at 77 K and 1 atm) and CH<sub>4</sub> uptake of 52.8 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> (at 195\nK and 1 atm), corresponding to 1.3 H<sub>2</sub> and 1.0 CH<sub>4</sub> molecules per ligand, respectively. Interestingly, prominent hysteresis\nwas also observed in both the adsorption profiles, suggesting strong\ninteractions of H<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> molecules with the charge-separated\nframework. H<sub>2</sub> coverage dependencies of the isosteric heat\nof adsorption (<italic toggle=\"yes\">Q</italic>\n<sub>st</sub>) were calculated from\nfits of 77 and 87 K isotherms. The estimated <italic toggle=\"yes\">Q</italic>\n<sub>st</sub> is approximately 9.3 kJ mol<sup>\u20131</sup> at low surface\ncoverage with the virial-fit approach. The <italic toggle=\"yes\">Q</italic>\n<sub>st</sub> value drops off from 9.3 to 5.5 kJ mol<sup>\u20131</sup> with H<sub>2</sub> uptake, representing one of the highest values\nat low surface coverage for hydrogen physisorption in porous materials.\n</p><p>Further studies show that trace Cl<sup>\u2013</sup> anions\nsignificantly change the gas-sorption behavior (Figure ). As discussed above, trace Cl<sup>\u2013</sup> anions\nwere present in the as-prepared crystalline sample of <bold>DCPCBim-MOF-Zn</bold>, which was washed with MeOH three times to clean the surface and\nsubsequently activated by heating in a vacuum for 24 h at 150 \u00b0C.\nCO<sub>2</sub> adsorption at 195 K revealed a significantly lower\namount of ca. 30 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> at low relative\npressure regions (<italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>/<italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>\n<sub>0</sub> &lt; 0.1). The adsorption amount gradually increases to 48.2 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> at 1 atm, which is slightly lower than\nthat of activated <bold>DCPCBim-MOF-Zn</bold> with lower chloride\ncontent. This shows that CO<sub>2</sub> molecules are more difficult\nto enter the pore channels. The presence of trace Cl<sup>\u2013</sup> anions also decreases remarkably the absorbed amount of CH<sub>4</sub> or H<sub>2</sub> molecules, and only neglectable uptake of either\ngas molecules was observed. These results suggest that guest anions\ncan modulate the sorption property of the present material. This behavior is closely related to the charge-separated\nnature of <bold>DCPCBim-MOF-Zn</bold>. A trace amount of Cl<sup>\u2013</sup> ions may be readily entrapped in the pore channels and block H<sub>2</sub> or CH<sub>4</sub> molecules from passing into the pore channel.\nIn comparison, the affinity toward CO<sub>2</sub> is probably due\nto the quadrupolar nature of CO<sub>2</sub>. The electric field in\nthe host framework interacts with the quadrupole moment of CO<sub>2</sub> to make an additional contribution to the potential energy\nof adsorption.\n</p><p>Because charge separation may produce a strong effect for\npolar guests, the uptake of methanol and ethanol vapors was performed\nfor <bold>DCPCBim-MOF-Zn</bold> after MeOH exchange (Figure ). MeOH sorption isotherm showed a type I profile\nwith a steep uptake in the low-pressure region at 298 K. The adsorption\ncapacity is 60.2 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> corresponding\nto 1.2 MeOH molecules per formula unit of ligand. Differently, the\nEtOH adsorption isotherm revealed double steps in the adsorption branch.\nThe initial uptake is due to the micropore filling in the micropores\nand is followed by a second filling. The first step of 20.0 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> corresponds to 0.45 EtOH molecules\nper formula unit of ligand, while the total of 50.7 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> corresponds to 0.97 EtOH molecules.

CCDC 892909.</p>", "clean_text": "Single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that DCPCBim-MOF-Zn crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/c. The asymmetric unit consists of one Zn ion and one DCPCBim ligand. The central ZnII ion is five-coordinated by five O atoms (Zn-O 1.92-2.44 \u00c5) from four different ligands. Two carboxylates bridge two Zn atoms to form a Zn2 dimeric secondary building unit (SBU). Each Zn2 SBU binds with six different DCPCBim ligands, including two bridging carboxylates in a carboxylate O,O' mode, one chelating carboxylate in a \u03b72-mode, and one monodentate carboxylate for each Zn atom (Figure a). The Zn2 SBUs are linked via an imidazolium tricarboxylate to form a 2D framework (Figure b). If the Zn2 dimeric unit and the DCPCBim ligand are simplified as 6- and 3-connected nodes, respectively, the framework can be simplified as a 2D binodal 3,6-connected net with the point (Schla\u0308fli) symbol (42.6)2(44.69.82) with the 6- and 3-connected nodes in a ratio of 1:2 (Figure e). This represents an unprecedented 2D network topology with intralayer porosity rather than interlayer porosity. The overall charge of the framework is in balance, and the framework is of a charge-separated nature (see below). The 1D intralayer channels exist along the b axis, as shown in Figures b,c, and the solvated DMF molecules reside in the channels (Figures f,g). The 2D flat layers slide in two directions to stack in an ABCA'B'C' packing mode and are repeated every six layers (Figure d). The adjacent 2D layers are packed via offset face-to-face \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between para-substituted phenyl rings with an interplaner distance of 3.43 \u00c5. The distance between the adjacent 2D layers is 6.44 \u00c5. Upon removal of the solvated molecules, there is 17.3% void space to the total crystal volume (total potential solvent area volume 657.5 \u00c53 per unit cell volume 3808.4 \u00c53) calculated using PLATON. \n\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of DCPCBim-MOF-Zn shows a weight loss of 7.99% from room temperature to 250 \u00b0C corresponding to the loss of one guest DMF (calcd 7.78%; Figure a). There is no weight loss from 250 to 400 \u00b0C. The framework may decompose above 400 \u00b0C.\n\nA N2 adsorption isotherm was first measured as showing neglectable uptake by the framework even at low temperature (Figure ). Such a behavior has been reported for some MOFs. However, CO2 adsorption of DCPCBim-MOF-Zn at 195 K revealed a type I profile with a steep uptake at low-relative-pressure regions. The adsorption capacity at 1 atm is 56.2 cm3 g-1 (11.0 wt %) at 195 K, corresponding to 1.1 CO2 molecules per DCPCBim ligand. The Langmuir and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas calculated from the CO2 profile are 245 and 222 m2 g-1, respectively. According to the Horvath-Kawazoe method, the pore volume was calculated as 0.104 cm3 g-1 and the pore width is centered around 3.7 \u00c5. Interestingly, the isotherms show remarkable hysteresis loops between the adsorption and desorption branches even at 298 K. This is unusual because hysteresis loops are usually temperature-dependent and tend to be unconspicuous with increasing temperature. For example, an indium carboxylate framework NOTT-202 exhibits adsorption-desorption hysteresis only when the temperature is below the triple point of CO2. The hysteresis confines the gas molecules within the pores at high pressure and releases them at low pressure, thus potentially enhancing gas uptake for potential application. The strong interaction of CO2 with the framework is reflected in the high value of Q st (ca. 30 kJ mol-1) calculated from the isotherms at 273 and 298 K using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. The value is comparable to those of Cu3(BTC)2 (BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate, HKUST-1) and others with exposed metal sites. Therefore, the hysteretic sorption and large Q st suggest a strong interaction of CO2 molecules with the narrow-pored and charge-separated framework. This is different from previous observations that the hysteretic gas adsorption behavior is induced by partial double interpenetration or guest cations within the pore channels (i.e., the gas is kinetically trapped in the framework). \n\nThe activated DCPCBim-MOF-Zn after MeOH exchange was also tested for H2 and CH4 uptake (Figure ), which revealed H2 uptake up to 66.4 cm3 g-1 (at 77 K and 1 atm) and CH4 uptake of 52.8 cm3 g-1 (at 195 K and 1 atm), corresponding to 1.3 H2 and 1.0 CH4 molecules per ligand, respectively. Interestingly, prominent hysteresis was also observed in both the adsorption profiles, suggesting strong interactions of H2/CH4 molecules with the charge-separated framework. H2 coverage dependencies of the isosteric heat of adsorption (Q st) were calculated from fits of 77 and 87 K isotherms. The estimated Q st is approximately 9.3 kJ mol-1 at low surface coverage with the virial-fit approach. The Q st value drops off from 9.3 to 5.5 kJ mol-1 with H2 uptake, representing one of the highest values at low surface coverage for hydrogen physisorption in porous materials. \n\nFurther studies show that trace Cl- anions significantly change the gas-sorption behavior (Figure ). As discussed above, trace Cl- anions were present in the as-prepared crystalline sample of DCPCBim-MOF-Zn, which was washed with MeOH three times to clean the surface and subsequently activated by heating in a vacuum for 24 h at 150 \u00b0C. CO2 adsorption at 195 K revealed a significantly lower amount of ca. 30 cm3 g-1 at low relative pressure regions (P/P 0 < 0.1). The adsorption amount gradually increases to 48.2 cm3 g-1 at 1 atm, which is slightly lower than that of activated DCPCBim-MOF-Zn with lower chloride content. This shows that CO2 molecules are more difficult to enter the pore channels. The presence of trace Cl- anions also decreases remarkably the absorbed amount of CH4 or H2 molecules, and only neglectable uptake of either gas molecules was observed. These results suggest that guest anions can modulate the sorption property of the present material. This behavior is closely related to the charge-separated nature of DCPCBim-MOF-Zn. A trace amount of Cl- ions may be readily entrapped in the pore channels and block H2 or CH4 molecules from passing into the pore channel. In comparison, the affinity toward CO2 is probably due to the quadrupolar nature of CO2. The electric field in the host framework interacts with the quadrupole moment of CO2 to make an additional contribution to the potential energy of adsorption. \n\nBecause charge separation may produce a strong effect for polar guests, the uptake of methanol and ethanol vapors was performed for DCPCBim-MOF-Zn after MeOH exchange (Figure ). MeOH sorption isotherm showed a type I profile with a steep uptake in the low-pressure region at 298 K. The adsorption capacity is 60.2 cm3 g-1 corresponding to 1.2 MeOH molecules per formula unit of ligand. Differently, the EtOH adsorption isotherm revealed double steps in the adsorption branch. The initial uptake is due to the micropore filling in the micropores and is followed by a second filling. The first step of 20.0 cm3 g-1 corresponds to 0.45 EtOH molecules per formula unit of ligand, while the total of 50.7 cm3 g-1 corresponds to 0.97 EtOH molecules. The stepwise sorption may indicate a structural transformation of the 2D framework induced by ethanol inclusion. Similar to the gas-sorption behavior, both the MeOH and EtOH isotherms show large hysteresis, further verifying that the strong interaction arises from charge separation of the framework.\n\nLuminescence Properties\n\nThe solid-state emission spectra of DCPCBim-MOF-Zn and the free ligand at room temperature are shown in Figure . DCPCBim-MOF-Zn and the free ligand display blue fluorescence with maximum emission at 429 and 424 nm upon excitation at 317 and 323 nm, respectively. Because the emission band of DCPCBim-MOF-Zn occurs at a position similar to that of the free ligand with a rather resembling band profile, the emission of DCPCBim-MOF-Zn should be originated from an intraligand \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* transition of the ligand.\n\nCrystallographic data for DCPCBim-MOF-Zn: C41H31Zn2N5O13, fw = 932.45, monoclinic, C2/c, a = 25.843(3) \u00c5, b = 8.6601(4) \u00c5, c = 17.4254(11) \u00c5, \u03b1 = 90\u00b0, \u03b2 = 102.435(9)\u00b0, \u03b3 = 90\u00b0, V = 3808.4(5) \u00c53, Z = 4, T = 150(2) K, \u03bb = 1.54178 \u00c5, \u03c1calcd = 1.626 mg m-3, \u03bc = 2.216 mm-1, 5175 reflections were collected (2726 were unique) for 5.20 < \u03b8 < 59.99, R(int) = 0.0548, R1 = 0.0824, wR2 = 0.2188 [I > 2\u03c3(I)], R1 = 0.0911, wR2 = 0.2298 (all data) for 290 parameters, and GOF = 1.031.
