The calculated isosteric heat (Q st) of adsorption at zero CO2 loading is 25.8 kJ\u22c5mol-1. The CH4 uptake of CIAC-115 at ambient pressure is 19.9 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 273 K and 12.5 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 298 K (Figure S16), and Q  st  for CH4 is 22.2 kJ\u22c5mol-1. The corresponding values for C2H6 and C3H8 are 31.8 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 273 K, 22.5 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 298 K, 35.4 kJ\u22c5mol-1 and 81.9 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 273 K, 59.7 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 298 K and 39.8 kJ\u22c5mol-1 (Figures S17-S19). CIAC-115 exhibits much higher adsorption capacities on C2H6 and C3H8 compared to CH4, suggesting that CIAC-115 can be used for the separation of these gases.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "CIAC-115",
