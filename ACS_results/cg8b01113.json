However, when 2 was dispersed in different aqueous media at room temperature, there were some interesting emission changed phenomena depending on the changed pH values. In this case, complex 2 showed no response to the acidic environment, but it was sensitive with the alkaline environment. In detail, as shown in a, when 2 was dispersed in neutral-aqueous ambience, the relative proportion of dual-emission (\u03c0\u03c0*: ILCT) was 0.87:1. Interestingly, when the ambience was changed to alkaline, such ratio became 2.96:1, indicating the enhanced \u03c0\u03c0* emission (c). Herein, in comparison with the single fluorescence on-off response of 1 depending on the acidic condition, 2 exhibited the self-referencing fluorescence-response depending on the alkaline condition. This phenomenon was responding to the different coordination modes of tetrazole group between 1 and 2. As described before, in the case of 1, coordinated tetrazole was initially deprotonated, which was beneficial for the protonation process. In contrast, because of the existence of coordinated N3 -, coordinated tetrazole was close to neutral in the case of 2. Hence, comparing to the difficult protonation process in acidic condition, the deprotonation process easily occurred in alkaline condition.
