Because of the lower reactivity of Bi(III)acetate two more polymerizations were conducted at 150 \u00b0C (nos. 3 + 4, Table ). Regardless of the reaction conditions, viscosity and SEC measurements proved that the highest Mn values did not exceed 50% of the best result obtained from Ph2BiOEt. Together with the rather low reactivity of BiHex3 illustrated in Figures   , these results indicate that the simple Bi(III)carboxylates are not suited to prepare high molecular weights poly \u03b5CL (but they have the advantage of an extraordinarily low toxicity).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 26, "type": "table", "classification": null, "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Bi(OAc)<sub>3</sub>-Initiated,<xref rid=\"tbl2-fn1\"></xref> TEG-Coinitiated<xref rid=\"tbl2-fn2\"></xref> Polymerizations of \u03b5CL in Bulk</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table>\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"7\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col5\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col6\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col7\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">expt no.</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">temp (\u00b0C)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">time (h)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">yield<xref rid=\"tbl2-fn3\"></xref> (%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\u03b7<sub>inh</sub>\n<xref rid=\"tbl2-fn4\"></xref> (dL/g)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">M</italic>\n<sub>n</sub> (corr)<sub></sub>\n<xref rid=\"tbl2-fn3\"></xref>\n<xref rid=\"tbl2-fn5\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">polydispersity<xref rid=\"tbl2-fn3\"></xref>\n<xref rid=\"tbl2-fn5\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row valign=\"top\">\n<oasis:entry>1</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>120</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>13</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>87.0</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.15</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>48000</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.2</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row valign=\"top\">\n<oasis:entry>2</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>120</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>40</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>87.5</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.96</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>42000</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.2</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row valign=\"top\">\n<oasis:entry>3</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>150</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>3</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>86.0</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.88</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>35000</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.1</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row valign=\"top\">\n<oasis:entry>4</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>150</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>7</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>86.5</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.85</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>33000</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.1</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n<table-wrap-foot>\n<fn id=\"tbl2-fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>\u03b5CL/Bi(OAc)<sub>3</sub> feed ratio: 1000/1.</p>\n</fn>\n<fn id=\"tbl2-fn2\">\n<label>b</label>\n<p>\u03b5CL/TEG feed ratio: 1000/1.</p>\n</fn>\n<fn id=\"tbl2-fn3\">\n<label>c</label>\n<p>Determined after precipitation into diethyl ether.</p>\n</fn>\n<fn id=\"tbl2-fn4\">\n<label>d</label>\n<p>Inherent viscosity measured at 20 \u00b0C with <italic toggle=\"yes\">c</italic> = 2 g/L in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>.</p>\n</fn>\n<fn id=\"tbl2-fn5\">\n<label>e</label>\n<p>Size-exclusion chromatography measurements calibrated with polystyrene and multiplied with the correction factor 0.68.</p>\n</fn>\n</table-wrap-foot>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 27, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Conclusions</title><p>Diphenylbismuth ethoxide was the first single-site bismuth initiator used for the ring-opening polymerization of a lactone.
