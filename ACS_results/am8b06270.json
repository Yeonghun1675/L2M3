Generally, it is well-known that the pH value around the cancer cell is lower than that in the body fluid and healthy cell (alkalescence), the response drug loading-releasing systems could prevent the dispensable drug loss when the drug-loaded materials circulated in the body and ensure the efficiency of anticancer drugs in cancer cells. In addition, the release speed of drug molecules in the surrounding of the cancer cells would be faster than the sites around the healthy cell; consequently, it is convinced to suppose the delivery of the anticancer drug through this system might weaken its side effects to normal cell. Therefore, the change of the pH value in the environment plays a synergical role on the 5-FU delivery with temperature as another trigger, which can be utilized as a better alternative to improve loading capacities and chemotherapeutic efficiency and which can address the limitation induced by the complexity of the human body environment.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 29, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>On\nthe basis of the above-described results, <bold>Zn-cpon-1</bold> has\na great potential as the drug delivery system with thermal stimuli-triggered\nrelease.

However, the fitting degree of the first-order model is higher than the others (Table S9 and Figure S23). On the basis of the first-order rate equation, the guest-guest interactions and structural confinement effects should be taken into account. Hence, we take guest-guest interactions as well as structural confinements as a parameter, n, and plug it into the first-order release equation in the ideal substrate. Because the guest-guest interactions and structural effects vary with time and give rise to shape changes in the release curve in experiments, after the introduction of n, the release equation should be no more first-order.
