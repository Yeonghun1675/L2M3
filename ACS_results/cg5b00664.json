Thus, this solid-state reaction paved the way for accessing highly strained bicyclic compounds easily in quantitative yield. This unique reaction has been observed exclusively when 2F-4spy was used in 4. In a similar packing, 4spy pair in 1 does not undergo phenyl-olefin cycloaddition reaction readily, although methyl groups of the toluate ligands enforced such interaction to be robust in single crystals. In both cases, the end product is expected to be 1D coordination polymers. But in the case of 5, the Zn2(ptol)4 core is connected with two different types of photoproducts.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 45, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>It appears\nthat the fluorine substitution is needed for the activation\nof the reaction between the phenyl and olefin groups.
