Notably, there are still two channels between the x and z axes with the same size and shape; thus, complex 1 is a type of channel framework. Although interpenetrated, complex 1 still has a large solvent accessible volume of ca. 1849 \u00c53 per unit cell (4827 \u00c53), amounting to 38.3% of the crystal lattice, and low density (1113 mg\u22c5cm-3). The charges of the tetramer can be changed at will, and we have designed a Cu(II) tetramer, bridged by four 2,3-pyrazinedicarboxylate trianions; this tetramer is a tetraanion, and we can place functional cations in the channel which act as functionalized sites for ion exchange or catalysis.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "density": [{"value": "1.12", "unit": "g/cm^3", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "complex 1", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "density": [{"value": "1.113", "unit": "g/cm^3", "condition": ""}]}]]], "include_properties": ["density"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['density']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"MOF-A\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"density\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"1.12\",\n                \"unit\": \"g/cm^3\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"complex 1\",\n            \"symbol\": \"1\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"density\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"1.113\",\n                \"unit\": \"g/cm^3\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 4, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>The coordination environment of Ni(II) ion in complex <bold>1</bold> with the atom numbering, showing displacement ellipsoids at the 30% probability level.
