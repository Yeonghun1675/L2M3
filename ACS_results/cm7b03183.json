Such unique inherent structural features make the constructed MOF a highly promising candidate as a heterogeneous catalyst for CO2 chemical conversions. Among CO2 related reactions, catalytic CO2 cycloaddition with epoxides () has been intensively investigated owing to wide applications of the produced carbonates in pharmaceutical and electrochemical industries. Thus, CO2 cycloadditions with various epoxides were selected to investigate the catalytic activity of the fabricated MOF 1 in the chemical conversion of CO2. HKUST-1, as a benchmark Cu-based MOF, was also selected as a catalyst for control experiments, since it has the same embedded Lewis acid metal sites.

According to the adsorption isotherms at 273 and 298 K (b and S6 in the SI), the isosteric heat of adsorption (Q st) for CO2 was calculated via the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. MOF 1 presents a Q st value of ~36.7 kJ mol-1 for CO2 sorption at low loading range. When converging into a pseudo-plateau at relatively high CO2 uptake, the Q st value was ~25.6 kJ mol-1. The Q st values of MOF 1 are comparable to those of some reported nitrogen-rich MOFs such as NTU-180 (~32.2 kJ mol-1 at low loading range and ~25.8 kJ mol-1 at relatively high uptake), confirming that the constructed acylamide-containing MOF has a high affinity to CO2.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF 1", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "762.8", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "1 atm", "condition": "after activation process"}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "162.2", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "temperature": "273 K", "pressure": "1 atm", "condition": "incorporating nitrogen-rich acylamide units and exposed metal sites within the framework"}], "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "2878.9", "unit": "m2 g-1", "condition": "after activation process"}], "pore diameter": [{"value": "1.0-1.8", "unit": "nm", "condition": "peak focused at 1.3 nm"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["gas_adsorption", "surface_area", "pore_diameter"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['gas_adsorption', 'surface_area', 'pore_diameter']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"MOF 1\",\n            \"symbol\": \"1\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"N2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"762.8\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"77 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"1 atm\",\n                \"condition\": \"after activation process\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"CO2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"162.2\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"273 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"1 atm\",\n                \"condition\": \"incorporating nitrogen-rich acylamide units and exposed metal sites within the framework\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"surface area\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"BET\",\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"2878.9\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2 g-1\",\n                \"condition\": \"after activation process\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"pore diameter\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"1.0-1.8\",\n                \"unit\": \"nm\",\n                \"condition\": \"peak focused at 1.3 nm\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 17, "type": "table", "classification": ["Property"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Yields\nof Various Cyclic Carbonates\nGenerated from <bold>1</bold> Catalyzed CO<sub>2</sub> Cycloadditions\nwith Small/Large-Sized Epoxides</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"fx1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cm-2017-03183a_0007.tif\"></graphic>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "Empty Content", "data": [["No properties found"]], "include_properties": [], "intermediate_step": {"table-convert2MD": "[gpt.ft]Empty Content\n<END>", "table-categorize": "Property", "table-property-type": "[]"}}, {"idx": 7, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Perspective view of the porous framework of <bold>1</bold> showing\nthe incorporation of accessible nitrogen-rich acylamide groups and\nunsaturated Cu<sub>2</sub> sites with two kinds of pores (red and\nblue balls).
