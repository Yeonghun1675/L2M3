Adjacent binuclear units are connected by \u03ba1-\u03ba1-\u03bc2 carboxyl groups of BDC2- to generate one-dimensional chain structure (Figure a) and further form an infinite layer through the linkers (\u03ba1-\u03ba2)-(\u03ba1-\u03ba2)-\u03bc4-BPDC2- (Figure b) or (\u03ba1-\u03ba1)-(\u03ba1-\u03ba1)-\u03bc4-BDC2- (Figure c).

The structure of 1 is described here representatively. As shown in Figure , Ln-MOF 1 consists of one crystallographically independent eight-coordinated Eu3+ ion, one BDC2- anion, half of a BPDC2- anion, and one H2O molecule per asymmetric unit. The Eu-O bond lengths vary from 2.286(2) to 2.589(2) \u00c5 (average 2.413 \u00c5). Eight-coordinate geometries are usually taken as the D 2d  dodecahedron (DD), C 2v  bicapped trigonal prism (TP), and D 4d  square antiprism (SAP). The semiquantitative method of polytopal analysis is performed to further  evaluate the polyhedral shape of the metal coordination sphere. The smallest shape values with SAP ensure D 4d  site symmetry ( Table S2). Therefore, the coordination geometry of Eu3+ ion can be viewed as a slightly distorted square antiprism, with the basal planes made by atoms of O4B, O5A, O6, and O7 and O1A, O2, O3A, and O6A. Two oxygen atoms from carboxyl groups of BPDC2- bridge two Eu3+ ion, thus forming an edge-sharing binuclear unit with Eu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Eu distance of 3.963(1) \u00c5. In the unit, there are two different kinds of bridging modes for four carboxyl groups: two from BDC2- in bidentate (\u03ba1-\u03ba1-\u03bc2) mode and the other two from BPDC2- in tridentate (\u03ba2-\u03ba1-\u03bc2) mode (Scheme ). Adjacent binuclear units are connected by \u03ba1-\u03ba1-\u03bc2 carboxyl groups of BDC2- to generate one-dimensional chain structure (Figure a) and further form an infinite layer through the linkers (\u03ba1-\u03ba2)-(\u03ba1-\u03ba2)-\u03bc4-BPDC2- (Figure b) or (\u03ba1-\u03ba1)-(\u03ba1-\u03ba1)-\u03bc4-BDC2- (Figure c). Then the layers are connected by the linkers from the third direction into a three-dimensional (3D) network (Figure d). The 3D framework shows one-dimensional (1D) channels with a transverse section of ~2.8 \u00d7 3.0 \u00c52 along the [0, 0, 1] direction ( Figure S2). There are hydrogen bonds (O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O = 2.8310(2) and O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5N = 2.7986(2) \u00c5) in the structure ( Figure S3), which may enhance the stability of the structure.\n\nThermal Gravimetric Analyses\n\nThermal gravimetric analyses (TGA) of 1 and 2 were performed in the temperature range of 30-900 \u00b0C ( Figure S5). The trends of weight loss are similar due to the isostructural nature. Both of them almost do not lose any obvious weight until 200 \u00b0C, suggesting no guest molecules in the lattice, as confirmed by the single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.
