The UV absorption spectra of free ligands L1 and L2 exhibit weak absorption bands at 275 and 299 nm respectively (), which are usually attributed to ligand to ligand (LLCT) or \u03c0-\u03c0* or n-\u03c0* transitions. Upon excitation at 275 nm, free L1 exhibits broad, almost negligible emission bands at \u03bbmax 349 nm, whereas L2 is totally nonemissive. The band in the former case has been tentatively attributed to the \u03c0*-\u03c0 transition. Many aromatic ligands which include some polycarboxylate ligands also are weakly or nonemissive themselves, but their complexes show strong luminescence. The fluorescent emission bands are observed in the region of \u03bbmax 327-330 nm for L1 complexes (II), (VIII), (XIII), and (XIV) (ex = 272-276 nm), while L2 complexes (IV),(V),(IX), (XI), and (XVI) (ex = 272-298 nm) give fluorescent emission bands in the region of \u03bbmax 357-380 nm (Figure a,b). The results of their luminescent studies are given in Figure c, which show a significant response to Cu(II) ions. In the complexes these emissions might come from aforementioned LLCT, \u03c0-\u03c0* or n-\u03c0* transitions or may originate from LMCT or MLCT transitions. Except for Cu (II) complexes (VIII) and (XVI), the observed luminescence has been observed in complexes of Na(I), K(I), Ca(II), Ba(II), Cd(II), and Ag(I), all of which are difficult to oxidize or reduce; therefore these emissions have been assigned as intraligand transitions. The absorption bands in L1 are relatively at higher energy than L2 (vide supra), which is consistent with the HOMO-LUMO energy gap calculated in the two cases theoretically (\u0394E = 3.430 eV in L1 and 3.318 eV in L2) (). Accordingly the emission bands for L1 complexes are consistently at higher energies than those for L2. In the Cu(II) complexes, there is a possibility of LMCT or MLCT, but as the energy and shape of the observed bands are similar to that seen in the case of nontransition metal ions therefore they have been ruled out in favor of intraligand transitions only.
