In DMF, the N-bound methyl groups are inequivalent due to the \u03c0-conjugation of the N-lone pair and the carbonyl fragment. In contrast, the P-bound methyl groups in 3 exhibit a single 1H resonance, consistent with free rotation about the P-carbonyl bond at room temperature. To further probe this issue, computations were performed at the B3LYP/def2-QZVPP level of theory, including Grimme's D3 dispersion correction with Becke-Johnson damping. These results were corroborated by calculations using the BP86 functional and using the post-Hartree-Fock MP2 method, and incorporating a polarizable continuum model to account for the effects of THF as solvent (see ). The ground state (GS) features a pyramidal phosphorus center with the lone pair orthogonal to the PC(O)H plane. The three higher energy structures (TS  anti , TS  syn  and TS  planar ) are all first-order saddle points on the potential energy surface, with exactly one imaginary frequency.
