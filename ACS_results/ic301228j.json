Both structures are built on homochiral-rod SBUs, only a few of which have been reported previously. In 1, the naphthalimides connect to potassium through both carbonyl groups, an interaction that we have not previously observed with transition metals, to build the homochiral-rod SBUs into a three-dimensional MOF structure. These interactions are clearly a result of the oxophilicity of the potassium ions, demonstrating that with the same ligands extended structures of main-group metals can be very different from those of transition metals. Although this type of interaction is also present in 2, it only supports a second dimension of the structure. The third dimension is supported by \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0-stacking interactions of the naphthalimide groups, forming an SMOF structure. This type of interaction is also present in 1, although it only supports the three-dimensional MOF structure, showing the importance of the naphthalimide supramolecular synthon. This importance is highlighted by the fact that the \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0-stacking interactions are observed for naphthalimide groups that are also connected to potassium through the carbonyl oxygen atoms. TGA indicates that both the MOF structure of 1 and the SMOF structure of 2 are robust, especially with 2, where the crystals can be heated to 250 \u00b0C without loss of crystallinity.
