In all the examples of this structural family the Cp ring system and its attached -CHRN(CH3)2 substituent are used as active ligands for constructing the polymeric (LiCpX) n -type chain structure. In each case the Cp ring is \u03b75-coordinated to a lithium atom and the -N(CH3)2 nitrogen donor ligand is used to make up a connection to the next lithium atom. The structures vary from one another by the relative coordination symmetry and the gradual change in the involvement of the second Li atom to coordinate the Cp ring from the other face. The quantum chemical calculations have revealed that the resulting changes in energy are minute and that it is expected that these structural types are easily interconverted, and, hence, their actual presence may be determined by crystal packing forces and/or small steric substituent effects. In 10 the additional Li coordination from the second face is totally absent. This system must actually be regarded as a variation of an ordinary CpLi(L)2 example, whose oligomeric nature merely results from the covalent attachment of one of the donor ligands to the Cp ring. Complex 11 is principally of the same type, but here the ensuing Li-N interaction inside the oligomeric chain appears to be much stronger. Complex 12 already resembles a (CpLi) n -type supersandwich structure, except that the nitrogen donor ligand seems to compete with its own Cp system about the Li atom, which results in a \"mixed\" \u03b72-Cp/\u03baN coordinative situation. Eventually, compound 13 comes close to an oligomeric (CpLi) n  supersandwich, but here the attached pendant -CH(R)N(CH3)2 donors pairwise act together to pull a lithium atom from the center line toward the side, but without completely interrupting the Li-Cp interaction: residual \u03b72-Cp to \u03b74-Cp bonding is observed. The other crystallographically independent Li atom in 13 resides between two Cp rings in a sandwich (\u03b75-Cp-Li-\u03b75-Cp) arrangement. This diversity of chemically related structures demonstrates that an individual location of a specific structural subtype within a large family of energetically similar coordination types of oligomeric (RCpLi) n  systems can be realized by attaching a -N(CH3)2 donor ligand by a one-carbon (sp3-CHR) linker and thus make such structural variants experimentally observable in the crystal.
