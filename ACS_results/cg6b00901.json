The CdII in the 1D chains in the structure of 3 have two coordinated nitrate ions and two disordered DMF/H2O coordination sites, whereas the 1D chains in the structure of 4 involve two coordinated nitrate ions and only a single, well-ordered DMF ligand, presumably due to the smaller radius of the metal ion. The less symmetrical coordination environment of the metal ion in the 1D chain in 4 compared to that in 3 means that the overall structure of 4 is of lower symmetry, crystallizing in P21 as opposed to C2 for 3. The influence of the metal on the material is also observed through the thermal stabilities of the materials, shown by TGA. Both 3 and 4 show similar amounts of mass loss due to loss of solvent; however, they show ligand degradation at different temperatures.

Thermal stability is significantly increased by incorporation of the ligand into the coordination polymers. The increase in dimensionality and interpenetration of the structures of the coordination polymers appears to lead to higher degradation temperatures. The material consisting of 1D chains, 2, shows degradation at 230 \u00b0C, while that comprising 2D sheets, 1, shows pronounced degradation at 255 \u00b0C. The 1D + 2D \u2192 2D polythreaded compounds, 3 and 4, are slightly more thermally robust, degrading at 290 and 260 \u00b0C, respectively. The 2D + 2D \u2192 2D interpenetrated coordination polymer, 5, shows significantly more thermal stability than the lower dimensionality or noninterpenetrated compounds, degrading at 380 \u00b0C. The 3D coordination polymers, 6 and 7, are also much more thermally stable than those of lower dimensionality, with the exception of 5, both showing degradation at 370 \u00b0C. It appears that, within this system, higher dimensionality or interpenetration increases the thermal stabilities of the coordination polymers (Supporting Information, Figure S15).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']"}}, {"idx": 40, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Given the presence\nof naphthalenediimides within the coordination\nframeworks, the materials were tested for any solid-state luminescence\nactivity, although none was observed (see the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.cgd.6b00901/suppl_file/cg6b00901_si_001.pdf\">Supporting Information</ext-link>).</p>", "clean_text": "Given the presence of naphthalenediimides within the coordination frameworks, the materials were tested for any solid-state luminescence activity, although none was observed (see the Supporting Information).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 41, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Conclusions</title><p>Control\nof interpenetration in coordination polymers which incorporate\na number of different aromatic groups is subject to a variety of structural\nconsiderations.
