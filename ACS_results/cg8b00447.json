The methanol solution of H<sub>2</sub>DPA featured a strong emission with the maximum (\u03bb<sub>em,max</sub>) at 438 nm, while the \u03bb<sub>em,max</sub> of the\npowder sample of H<sub>2</sub>DPA was red-shifted to 460 nm with slight\nshouldering at about 500 nm. The shouldering feature, which can be\nascribed to excimer emission, becomes a broad, strong peak (\u03bb<sub>em,max</sub> = 500 nm) in the more crystalline sample of H<sub>2</sub>DPA\u00b7MeOH; and it becomes even stronger (i.e., relative to the\nmonomer emission around 460 nm) in the network crystal of Ag<sub>2</sub>(DPA) (\u03bb<sub>em,max</sub> = 506 nm). The dominant excimer emission\nin Ag<sub>2</sub>(DPA) is in line with the close, face-to-face alignment\nof the anthracene \u03c0-planes; prior to this study, smaller angles\nbetween anthracene moieties (i.e., closer to being parallel) have\nalso been observed to favor excimer emission in a similar anthracene-based\nsystem. In addition to the excimer and\nmonomer emissions, the Ag<sub>2</sub>(DPA) crystal also emits around\n420 nm, which arises likely from a ligand-centered emission from the\nDPA moieties in the network, and from a metal-centered transition\n(Ag<sup>+</sup>, ds/dp) modified by argentophilic interactions.</p>", "clean_text": "Diffuse reflectance measurements of the solid sample of Ag2(DPA) indicated an electronic bandgap of 2.4 eV (Figure S5), whereas the molecular solids of H2DPA (obtained by rotary evaporation of a CHCl3 solution; crystallinity relatively poor, see Figure S6) and H2DPA\u22c5MeOH (crystals obtained by slow evaporation from a methanol solution) both exhibit larger band gaps around 2.7 eV. Further theoretical studies may unveil the origin of the smaller band gap of the coordination network Ag2(DPA), so as to quantify the contributions from the Ag-pyrazolate bonding as well as the distinct short contacts such as argentophilic and cation-\u03c0 interactions. The photoluminescence spectra are also measured on H2DPA, H2DPA\u22c5MeOH, and the network sample Ag2(DPA) (; see also Figure S7 for emission spectra at various concentrations of MeOH). The methanol solution of H2DPA featured a strong emission with the maximum (\u03bbem,max) at 438 nm, while the \u03bbem,max of the powder sample of H2DPA was red-shifted to 460 nm with slight shouldering at about 500 nm.
