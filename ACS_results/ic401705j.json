Upon completion of the structural analysis for 1, it was determined that the crystal was merohedral twinned. A twin law (010 100 00-1) was applied with resulting structural components of 0.694 and 0.306, which reduced the R 1 value from 2.1 to 0.88%. Compound 2a crystallizes in the monoclinic space group, C2/c, with a = 24.785(2) \u00c5, b = 20.511(1) \u00c5, c = 16.558(1) \u00c5, and \u03b2 = 112.60(2)\u00b0. Long-range positional disorder of the molecular species is observed due to the chiral nature of the ligand, which could not be alleviated by increasing unit cell parameters or lowering the symmetry of the space group. Twinning was also not observed, so the disorder was modeled using two positions for each U atom and free refining the occupancy of these sites to final values of 60 and 40% for the A and B sites. Additional disorder was observed for the C and O atoms of the malate ligands and modeled as split positions. The alternative synthesis method resulted in compound 2b that crystallizes in C2/c with a = 32.02(4) \u00c5, b = 15.91(2) \u00c5, c = 19.86(2) \u00c5, and \u03b2 = 125.15(1)\u00b0. Identical molecular components were observed in both 2a and 2b, but the latter contains significantly more disorder within the crystalline lattice. Compound 3 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1\u0305 with a = 11.371(1) \u00c5, b = 13.883(1) \u00c5, c = 19.082(1) \u00c5, \u03b1 = 112.994(2)\u00b0, \u03b2 = 93.626(2)\u00b0, and \u03b3 = 96.393(2)\u00b0.
