It can be observed that complex 1 exhibits an intense emission band with a maximum at 404 nm upon excitation at 310 nm. One robust emission peak at 508 nm with the excitation at 360 nm was observed in the range 450-550 nm of free 1,4-ndc ligand, which is attributable to the \u03c0*-\u03c0 transitions. In comparison with the emission peaks of free 1,4-ndc, the maximum emission wavelength of complex 1 undergoes a blue-shift from 508 to 404 nm, we can presume that these emissions are neither ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (LLCT) nor metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) in nature. Therefore, the emission of 1 may be ascribed to a charge-transfer transition between ligands and metal centers, namely ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT), similar to the reported results on coordination polymers with benzene-dicarboxylate ligands. Because the luminescent polynuclear metal systems Zn(II) ion is difficult to oxidize or to reduce due to its d10 configuration, the emission of bulk ZnO material was observed at \u03bbem = 380 nm. At the same time, the free 1,4-bix exhibits weak fluorescent emission bands at ca. 423 nm upon excitation at 250 nm, which further supports this interpretation. On one hand, this may be caused by a change in the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of deprotonated 1,4-ndc anions and neutral ligands coordinating to metal centers, a charge-transfer transition between ligands and metal centers. On the other hand, a weak luminescence emission may be attributed to flexibility of the 1,4-bix ligand to the metal cluster, which effectively increases the flexibility of the metal-organic framework and the loss of energy by radiationless decay. This observation indicates that 1 may be an excellent candidate for potential photoactive materials.\n\nCrystal data for 1: C76H54N8O18Zn5, M r = 1694.22, monoclinic, P21/c, a = 15.309(3) \u00c5, b = 15.799(3) \u00c5, c= 16.424(3) \u00c5, \u03b1 = \u03b3 = 90\u00b0, \u03b2 = 117.56(3)\u00b0, V = 3521.6(12) \u00c53, \u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5, T = 293.0(2) K.
