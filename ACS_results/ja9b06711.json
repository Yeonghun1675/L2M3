Visualized from the results of SCXRD, much more open sites had been exposed on the surface of channels in terms of the coordinatively unsaturated nickel ions fixed in the framework of HUST-3. The more regular arrangement of nickel ion of the heptanuclear cluster in HUST-2 leads to the saturate coordination environment and less open metal sites, which is the main reason that the lowest catalytic performance had been presented compared to HUST-3 and HUST-4. Although the real nickel state could not be fixed, the separated nickel centers and open metal sites in HUST-4 should be responsible for the higher catalytic performance than the ordered and saturated nickel ions in HUST-2. In addition, although HUST-3 has no nitrogen adsorption after thermal activation, the framework is highly robust when operated in the liquid phase, and the active sites within the pores remain accessible. The catalyst can keep its high activity for at least three runs in the recycle experiments without significant loss of Ni content and crystallinity, as confirmed by ICP and XRD (Table S5 and Figure S6).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 23, "type": "table", "classification": null, "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\"
