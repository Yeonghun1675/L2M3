Compared to the polymer from bulk, the content of the isotactic triad was improved from 2% to 8% in PMMA and PBzMA, and 1% to 8% in PEMA. Initiator functionalized MOFs advance control over polymerization, which enabled the synthesis of polymers with higher MW, low \u0110, and predeterminable MW (PMMA with 392000, PEMA with 169000, and PBzMA with 143000, \u0110 = 1.2-1.4). Additionally, enhanced microstructure could be achieved as well with an increase in isotactic triad to 11% in PMMA and 10% in PEMA. Moreover, chain extensions with IBMA were successfully performed, confirming preservation of end-group functionality. The results demonstrate that the combination of MOFs and controlled polymerization is a facile, robust, and universal methodology to prepare high molecular weight polymers with low \u0110, predetermined MW, high end-group fidelity, and well-defined stereostructure.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 40, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information is\navailable free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b00546\">10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b00546</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Additional characterization\nof crystals, ATR-FTIR spectra,\nSEC chromatograms, calculated initiation efficiency, and experimental\nprocedures (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b00546/suppl_file/cm8b00546_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Crystallographic information (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b00546/suppl_file/cm8b00546_si_002.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b00546.
