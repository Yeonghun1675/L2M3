After addition of water (170 mL) the aqueous solution was extracted with chloroform (4 \u00d7 170 mL) and the organic phase was dried above anhydrous Na2SO4. Thereafter, the solvent was removed on a rotary evaporator. The obtained white residue was kept at 80\u00b0 C in vacuum (10-3 mbar) overnight, recrystallized from chloroform, and dried in a desiccator. The yield was 5.59 g (96 %). 1H NMR (CDCl3): \u03b4 2.25 (s, 12H, -CH3), 5.23 (s, 4H, -CH2-), 6.80 (s, 2H, 4HIm), 7.04 (s, 2H, 5HIm), 7.33 (s, 2H, 2HIm).\n\nSynthesis of 1 \n\nZn(NO3)2 .6H2O (0.066 g, 0.222 mmol), H2bdc (0.037 g, 0.222 mmol), bimx (0.065 g, 0.222 mmol), and distilled water (4 mL, 222 mmol) were mixed to yield a suspension with a pH value of 4. The suspension was charged into an autoclave (degree of filling 50 %) and treated hydrothermally under autogeneous pressure and static conditions at 180\u00b0 C for 66 h. Pale yellow crystals of 1 were separated by filtration, washed with water, and dried. The yield was 0.071 g (29 % based on Zn).
