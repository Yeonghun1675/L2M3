This is so these lengths can be directly compared to distances calculated from known bond distances. Assuming standard tabulated bond lengths and a Ag to N distance of 2.21 \u00c5, one finds a distance of 13.02 \u00c5 between the center of the molecules 1 - 7 and the adjacent silver ions. For the ThSi2 structure, we find that the c axis is invariant and should be 3 times this distance or 39.06 \u00c5 while for AlB2 the b axis is also invariant and should be \u221a3 times this distance or 22.55 \u00c5. These theoretical values compare well with the single-crystal lattice parameters of, respectively, 38.75 and 22.26 \u00c5 for 1\u22c5AgOTf and 5\u22c5AgOTf. Such comparisons will be used in this paper for systems for which there are only powder data and for which one wishes to distinguish between the AlB2 and ThSi2 structural alternatives.

The filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator and the residue purified by column chromatography on silica gel (CH2Cl2) to yield 9 as a yellow solid (0.33 g, 37%): 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) \u03b4 7.85 (s, 3H), 7.76-7.74 (m, 24H); 13C NMR (90 MHz, CDCl3) \u03b4 141.7, 141.3, 132.1, 127.4, 125.4, 121.7, 118.5, 111.6, 93.5; IR (KBr, cm-1) 3039, 2224, 2217, 1599, 1515, 1017, 832; HRMS (EI, 70 eV) calcd 681.2205, found 681.2177. \n\n 1,3,5-Tris(4-(4-ethynylbenzonitrile)benzoethylnyl)benzene (10). A heavy-walled Schlenk flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer was charged with 1-trimethylsilylethynyl-4-((4-cyanophenyl)-ethynyl)benzene (500 mg, 1.7 mmol), potassium carbonate (0.12 g, 0.80 mmol), and a methanol-dichloromethane (1:3) solution (20 mL) and then the mixture was stirred under nitrogen for 3 h. This mixture was transferred to another heavy-walled Schlenk flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer which was then charged with 1,3,5-tribromobenzene (153 mg, 0.48 mmol), copper(I) iodide (1.0 mg, 5.3 \u03bcmol), triphenylphosphine (12.6 mg, 48 \u03bcmol), bis(dibenzylideneacetone)palladium(0) (5.2 mg, 9.7 \u03bcmol), and triethylamine (10 mL). The flask was capped with a septum, evacuated, back-filled with nitrogen, sealed with a Teflon cap, and stirred at 70 \u00b0C for 16 h. The reaction mixture was then allowed to cool to room temperature and filtered through a glass funnel. The filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator and the residue purified by column chromatography on silica gel (CH2Cl2) to yield 10 as a yellow solid (148 mg, 41%): 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) \u03b4 7.66 (s, 3H), 7.62-7.56 (m, 12H), 7.53 (s, 12H); 13C NMR (90 MHz, CDCl3) \u03b4 134.2, 132.0, 131.7, 131.6, 127.8, 123.8, 123.3, 122.4, 118.3, 111.7, 93.1, 90.2, 89.9, 89.6; IR (KBr, cm-1) 2226, 2217, 1658, 1600, 1579, 1103, 835; HRMS (EI, 70 eV) calcd 753.2205, found 753.2184. \n\n Preparation of Microcrystalline Powders 1\u22c5, 2\u22c5, 3\u22c5, 4\u22c5, 5\u22c5, 7\u22c5, 8\u22c5, 9\u22c5, and 10\u22c5AgOTf. The organic ligand (40 mg, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in benzene (10 mL) and added to a solution of silver(I) trifluoromethanesulfonate (25 mg, 0.1 mmol) in benzene (10 mL) in a vial sealed with a Teflon-lined screw cap. The vial was heated in a programmable furnace equipped with a Eurotherm temperature controller from 1 to 100 \u00b0C, held at 100 \u00b0C for 60 min, and then cooled to room temperature at 0.02 \u00b0C/min. The resultant crystalline powder was composed of particles typically 25 \u03bcm \u00d7 10 \u03bcm \u00d7 10 \u03bcm as determined by optical microscopy. \n\n Preparation of X-ray-Quality Single Crystals of 9\u22c5AgOTf. A solution of silver(I) trifluoromethanesulfonate (0.05 mg, 0.2 \u03bcmol) in benzene (1.5 mL) was added to a solution of 9 (0.13 mg, 0.2 \u03bcmol) in benzene (1.5 mL) in a clean vial. Slow evaporation of the solvent yielded three single crystals suitable for X-ray data collection after 10 days. \n\n Trifluoroacetic ((2,4,6-Tris(4-ethynylbenzonitrile)phenoxy))ethyl Ester (19). 6 (5.8 mg, 0.01 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (3 mL) was added to trifluoroacetic anhydride (1.05 g, 5 mmol). This solution was stirred at room temperature for 10 min and then evacuated to dryness to yield 19 as a white solid (100% by thin layer chromatography): 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) \u03b4 7.73 (s, 2H), 7.70-7.60 (m, 12H), 4.76 (dd, J = 3.3, 2.2 Hz, 2H), 4.69 (dd, J = 3.3, 2.2 Hz, 2H); 1H NMR (300 MHz, acetone-d 6) \u03b4 7.89-7.75 (m, 14H), 4.90 (s, 4H); IR (KBr, cm-1) 3431, 2228, 1788, 1603, 1501, 1402, 1221, 1155, 837; MS (FAB) m/z (M+) 609 (14).
