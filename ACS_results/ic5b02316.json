The amount of absorbed CO2 in FJU-14-BF  4  -a at 296 K is lower than some famous MOFs, such as Co2Cl2(bbta) (OH) (203 cm3 cm-3), MgMOF-74 (162 cm3 cm-3), UTSA-16 (160 cm3 cm-3), SIFSIX-2-Cu-i (151 cm3 cm-3), and is comparable with the values on MPM-1-TIFSIX (115.7 cm3 cm-3), Bio-MOF-11 (113 cm3 cm-3), Mg2(dobpdc) (102 cm3 cm-3), and Mmen-CuBTTri (83 cm3 cm-3) (d). However, the adsorption enthalpy value of FJU-14-BF  4  -a is significantly lower than some representative MOFs for large CO2 uptake: Co2Cl2(bbta)(OH) (110 kJ mol-1), Mmen-CuBTTri (96 kJ mol-1), Mg-MOF-74 (47 kJ mol-1), Bio-MOF-11 (45 kJ mol-1), MPM-1-TIFSIX(44.4 kJ mol-1), and Mg2(dobpdc) (44 kJ mol-1) (e). The CO2 density in FJU-14-BF  4  -a at 1 atm and 296 K is estimated according to the amount of gas adsorbed and the pore volume (0.172 cm3 g-1) of the framework from N2 adsorption at 77 K. It is  0.955 g cm-3, close to the liquid CO2 density of 1.032 g cm-3, the highest ever reported on the MOFs for CO2 capture at the same condition (f). The highest CO2 density means FJU-14-BF  4  -a can trap CO2 in the most efficient mode into its pore to reach saturation even at 296 K and 1 atm, featuring FJU-14-BF  4  -a as the very promising material for the highly selective separation of CO2 from the light gases. The CO2 uptake on FJU-14-BF  4  -a is about 14 times the N2 uptake (6.9 cm3 cm-3) (Figure S9). To evaluate the performance of FJU-14-BF  4  -a in the actual adsorption-based separation and purification processes, dynamic column breakthrough experiments were performed in which a CO2/N2 (15:85, v/v) mixture was flowed over a packed bed of FJU-14-BF  4  -a solid with a total flow of 5 mL min-1 at 296 K. As shown in c, the separation of a CO2/N2 (15:85, v/v) mixture through the column packed bed of FJU-14-BF  4  -a solid can be efficiently achieved. The dynamic CO2 adsorption capacity in FJU-14-BF  4  -a at room temperature is  0.99 mmol g-1, comparable with the values on MOF-890 (1.38 mmol g-1) and IRMOF-74-III-CH2NH2 (0.8 mmol g-1), and higher than HKUST-1 (0.45 mmol g-1).

The high-density and low-enthalpy CO2 capture on FJU-14-BF  4  -a can be assigned to multiple-point interactions between adsorbate and framework as well as its counteranions.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nCrystal Structures\n\nGreen polyhedral crystals of FJU-14 were solvothermally synthesized by  reaction of various copper salts and Hcpt in DMAc-CH3OH solution for 1 day. Single-crystal X-ray study reveals that FJU-14 crystallizes in the tetragonal space group I4/mmm. As shown in a, there is one crystallographically independent Cu2+ ion, its octahedral geometry completed by four independent cpt ligands, a \u03bc4-Cl- anion, and one terminal water molecule. The Cl- anion connects with four Cu2+ ions to form [Cu4Cl]7+ square plane SBU. There are two types of polyhedral nanocages in FJU-14, that is, one octahedron (Cage A) and one tetrahedron (Cage B) (b). Cage A with its center at the Wyckoff position 2b is constructed by six [Cu4Cl]7+ SBUs as vertices and eight cpt ligands as the edges. As its equator has no cpt occupied, each triangle face of the octahedron is composed of two cpt edges and three [Cu4Cl]7+ vertices. In addition, the dimension of this cage is estimated to be around 14 \u00c5. Cage B with its center at the Wyckoff position 4d consists of four [Cu4Cl]7+ SBUs and four cpt ligands, with a dimension of 5.8 \u00c5. On the whole, Cage A is linked by eight Cage B through sharing eight triangle faces (Figure S1b). Similarly, Cage B is linked by four Cage A by sharing four triangle faces. The connection of two types of polyhedral nanocages extends to form a three-dimensional (3D) cationic framework (c). For the sake of clarity, if we simplify [Cu4Cl]7+ vertices as eight-connected nodes, FJU-14 adopts the bcu network with the topological point symbol of 424.64 (d). After elimination of guest solvent molecules, the total accessible volumes in FJU-14-NO  3 , FJU-14-ClO  4 , and FJU-14-BF  4  are 43.1%, 48.7%, and 46.0%, respectively, by using the PLATON software. The anion substitution does not obviously decrease the pore volume of FJU-14.\n\nGas Adsorption Studies\n\nThe improved robustness and stability by the balanced MHBIs in FJU-14-BF  4  encourage us to further examine the effect of counteranions on the pore structures and CO2 adsorption for the three MOFs. Their N2 sorption isotherms at 77 K are shown in a. FJU-14-NO  3  -a takes much less N2 gas with no pore volume. FJU-14-ClO  4  -a exhibits a typical type-IV behavior and the pore condensation with pronounced adsorption-desorption hysteresis, while FJU-14-BF  4  -a shows reversible type-I isotherm and appears to have small hysteretic sorption behavior because of dynamic features and the cage effect. FJU-14-BF  4  -a has the BET/Langmuir surface area of 324/447 m2 g-1, 5-fold the value (62/90) for FJU-14-ClO  4  -a, although their pore volumes are closed (0.172 vs 0.125 cm3 g-1). By the nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) method, FJU-14-BF  4  -a shows a bimodal pore-size distribution centering at 5.8 and 8.8 \u00c5 (Figure S8). The significantly different pore structures of the FJU-14 are attributed to the various robustness nature resulted from the MHBIs between the hosts and the guests.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn summary, we  synthesized three isostructural microporous cationic metal-organic frameworks (FJU-14) and first demonstrated that the robustness, stability, and gas separation capacity of the MOFs can be tuned by alerting the weak interactions between the host and the counteranions. Among the three MOFs, FJU-14-BF  4  containing a BF4 - anion in its tetrahedral cages can take CO2 with a high volume uptake (95.8 cm3 cm-3) but low enthalpy (18.8 kJ mol-1) at ambient conditions. The trapped CO2 density of 0.955 g cm-3 is the highest value among the reported MOFs. Dynamic fixed-bed breakthrough experiments indicate that the separation of CO2/N2 mixture gases through a column packed with FJU-14-BF  4  -a solid can be efficiently achieved. The balanced MHBIs between the BF4 - counteranion and the cationic skeleton play a crucial role in the stability of FJU-14-BF  4  -a. The high-density CO2 capture is mainly contributed from the multiple-point interactions between the adsorbate molecules and the framework as well as its counteranions. We do believe that our findings will encourage further work in the control of multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions for MOFs, especially the nonrobust MOFs, to improve their stability and gas separation capacity through the counterion substitution.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "FJU-14", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "(Cu4Cl)(cpt)4(H2O)4"}, "crystal system": [{"value": "tetragonal", "condition": ""}], "space group": [{"value": "I4/mmm", "condition": ""}], "topology": [{"value": "bcu", "condition": ""}], "porosity": [{"probe": "", "value": "43.1", "unit": "%", "condition": "FJU-14-NO3"}, {"probe": "", "value": "48.7", "unit": "%", "condition": "FJU-14-ClO4"}, {"probe": "", "value": "46.0", "unit": "%", "condition": "FJU-14-BF4"}], "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "324", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": "FJU-14-BF4"}, {"type": "Langmuir", "probe": "", "value": "447", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": "FJU-14-BF4"}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "95.8", "unit": "cm3/cm3", "temperature": "ambient", "pressure": "", "condition": "FJU-14-BF4"}], "density": [{"value": "0.955", "unit": "g/cm3", "condition": "FJU-14-BF4"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["crystal_system", "space_group", "topology", "porosity", "surface_area", "gas_adsorption", "decomposition_temperature", "density"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['crystal_system', 'space_group', 'topology', 'porosity', 'surface_area', 'gas_adsorption', 'decomposition_temperature', 'density']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"FJU-14\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"(Cu4Cl)(cpt)4(H2O)4\"\n        },\n        \"crystal system\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"tetragonal\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"space group\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"I4/mmm\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"topology\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"bcu\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"porosity\": [\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"43.1\",\n                \"unit\": \"%\",\n                \"condition\": \"FJU-14-NO3\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"48.7\",\n                \"unit\": \"%\",\n                \"condition\": \"FJU-14-ClO4\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"46.0\",\n                \"unit\": \"%\",\n                \"condition\": \"FJU-14-BF4\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"surface area\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"BET\",\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"324\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"FJU-14-BF4\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"type\": \"Langmuir\",\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"447\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"FJU-14-BF4\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"CO2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"95.8\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3/cm3\",\n                \"temperature\": \"ambient\",\n                \"pressure\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"FJU-14-BF4\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"density\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"0.955\",\n                \"unit\": \"g/cm3\",\n                \"condition\": \"FJU-14-BF4\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 5, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Schematic Diagram for the Synthesis of Three\nIsostructural Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) by Making Use of Different\nCopper Salts</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2015-023165_0007.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Schematic Diagram for the Synthesis of Three Isostructural Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) by Making Use of Different Copper Salts   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 22, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Tetranuclear [Cu<sub>4</sub>Cl]<sup>7+</sup> square face SBU in <bold>FJU-14</bold>.
