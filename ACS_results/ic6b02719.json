This high amount of H<sub>2</sub> adsorption at 77 K and 1 bar\nof pressure for <bold>1\u2032</bold> may be due to an effective\npore size with appreciable void spaces and the presence of coordinatively\nunsaturated metal centers. During dehydration\nof <bold>1</bold>, the axially coordinated H<sub>2</sub>O molecules\nwere released and formed vacant sites on each copper\u00ad(II) to form metal\nhydride or hydrogen complexes. However,\nunsaturation in coordination may inspire stronger physisorption and\nis concomitant with the lowering of the density of the framework,\nwhich may facilitate the loss of the terminal ligands. The reported grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation reveals that the small pores created by catenation play an active\nrole in confining the H<sub>2</sub> molecules more closely, indicating\nthat the catenated MOFs have higher H<sub>2</sub> uptake than the\nnoncatenated MOFs at low pressure.

The nature of the N2 adsorption isotherm signifies the permanent microporous nature of 1'. Notably, 1' also exhibits appreciably high, type I H2 adsorption with a maximum value of 216 cc/g (i.e., 1.94 wt %) at 77 K and 1 bar of pressure (). The high uptake for H2 may be attributed to the opening of the polycatenated nets due to the structural transformation of 1 as discussed above (). To check the reliability and reproducibility of the study, the measurement was repeated five times, taking fresh samples in each case, which give very similar results. We also repeated the measurement three times on the same sample, which resulted in 216 cc/g (1.94 wt %), 209 cc/g (1.88 wt %), and 180 cc/g (1.62 wt %) consecutively at the same temperature and pressure ranges (Figure S10). The gradual decrease in H2 uptake is probably due to the partial rupture of the framework during the degassing process. Hence, it clearly reveals that the optimum opening of the polycatenated framework occurs when it was degassed the first time at 120 \u00b0C. Interestingly, the high-pressure H2 adsorption study shows comparatively less uptake of 130 cc/g (1.17 wt %) at 62 bar (), which is probably due to more partial rupture of the framework at high pressure. This is further supported by the PXRD pattern of 1' after high-pressure measurement, showing fewer peaks having lesser intensity compared to the PXRD pattern taken after normal H2 adsorption measurement (Figure S5). This high amount of H2 adsorption at 77 K and 1 bar of pressure for 1' may be due to an effective pore size with appreciable void spaces and the presence of coordinatively unsaturated metal centers. During dehydration of 1, the axially coordinated H2O molecules were released and formed vacant sites on each copper(II) to form metal hydride or hydrogen complexes. However, unsaturation in coordination may inspire stronger physisorption and is concomitant with the lowering of the density of the framework, which may facilitate the loss of the terminal ligands. The reported grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation reveals that the small pores created by catenation play an active role in confining the H2 molecules more closely, indicating that the catenated MOFs have higher H2 uptake than the noncatenated MOFs at low pressure. Both the ambient- and high-pressure H2 adsorption measurements of 1' show a small hysteresis in the adsorption-desorption profile, possibly due to the flexible nature of polycatenated structure, and also for the moderate chemical interaction between the open metal sites in 1' and a hydrogen molecule. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first example showing H2 adsorption for an inclined polycatenated MOF-based material. It is also worth mentioning that the amount of H2 uptake is higher than or comparable to (Table S6) the earlier reported value of interpenetrated MOFs. The activated framework of 1 (1') also exhibited 9.5 cc/g H2 uptake at 298 K and 0.99 bar (Figure S11). Sorption with some other gases (e.g., CH4 at 298 K and CO2 at 195, 273, and 298 K) and vapors (e.g., H2O and EtOH at 298 K) was also investigated for 1'. The framework of 1' exhibited a significant amount of CO2 uptake up to 153, 67, and cc/g measured at 195, 273, and 298 K, respectively, at 1 bar of pressure (Figures S9 and S12). Selective adsorption of CO2 over CH4 (26 cc/g) was also found at 298 K and 1 bar of pressure (Figure S9), which has also been observed in interpenetrated/catenated isoreticular MOFs. This elevated CO2 selectivity has been accounted for as a result of the small pore size and interpenetrated adsorption sites. CO2, N2, and CH4 adsorption capacities of 1' are also higher than or comparable to those of known MOFs (Table S7). In the case of solvent vapor (Figure S13), it shows type V H2O adsorption up to 156 cc/g at 298 K and P/P 0 ~ 0.9. At a pressure P/P 0 region of 0.09-0.17, a sharp uptake of H2O adsorption (74 cc/g) occurred, which is equivalent to 1.8 mol of H2O per formula unit, signifying the loss of two coordinated H2O molecules at the low-pressure region. The H2O uptake capacity is more compared to the uptake of less polar EtOH vapor (up to 143 cc/g) at the same pressure and temperature. The H2O adsorption profile also exhibits a larger hysteresis in the adsorption-desorption curve compared to that of the EtOH profile, possibly because of the strong adsorbate-adsorbent interaction in the case of H2O.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of an inclined polycatenated MOF-based material that shows appreciably high H2 uptake capacity.\n\nDark-blue single crystals of 1 were obtained by mixing an aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2\u22c53H2O with a mixed-ligand aqueous methanolic solution of 1,2-bis-(4-pyridyl)ethane (bpe) and disodium 2-nitroterephthalate (Na2-2-ntp) at room temperature using a slow diffusion method. The compound crystallizes in the monoclinic I  a  space group (Table S1), and the structure analysis reveals that 1 is a polycatenated 2D + 2D \u2192 3D framework through the parallel/diagonal inclined polycatenation of two identical sets of parallel 44-squarelike (sql) layers. The hexacoordinated copper(II) center in 1 exhibits an axially elongated octahedral geometry due to Jahn-Teller distortion, confirmed by electron spin resonance spectroscopy (Figure S1). Here each copper(II) center is connected with two oxygen atoms (O1 and O3a) of two different bridging 2-ntp2- and two nitrogen atoms (N1 and N2) of two different bpe linkers in the basal plane along with two axial H2O molecules (O1W and O2W; a and S2a and Table S2). Here, each 2-ntp2- ligand is connected in a bis-monodentate fashion between two adjacent copper(II) centers that are parallelly pillared by the bpe linkers to form a single 44-sql layer (b). Finally, two identical sets of parallel 44-sql layers are polycatenated in an inclined way, followed by the interpenetration of two adjacent single layers, resulting in the formation of a 2D + 2D \u2192 3D inclined polycatenated framework (c,d). Unlike most of the nonporous polycatenated systems, the structure of 1 is found to be microporous with a total solvent-accessible estimated void of 658.0 \u00c53, which is 27.54% of the total crystal volume (2389.1 \u00c53). The framework is further stabilized by intermolecular hydrogen-bonding, \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0, and C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions (). Structure analysis with TOPOS  suggests that the overall framework exhibits a 4c uninodal net with the point symbol {44.62}. It also indicates that the entangled type of 1 belongs to the 2D + 2D \u2192 3D inclined polycatenation class (orientations of group 1, [1, 1, 0], and group 2, [1, -1, 0]; the angle of groups 1 and 2 is 82.5\u00b0, inclined), and the nonequivalent six-membered shortest rings are catenated and connected in eight different ways (Table S5).\n\nThe expanded framework of 1' exhibits a typical type I N2 adsorption up to 250 cc/g at P/P 0 ~ 0.99 (Figure S9). The nature of the N2 adsorption isotherm signifies the permanent microporous nature of 1'. Notably, 1' also exhibits appreciably high, type I H2 adsorption with a maximum value of 216 cc/g (i.e., 1.94 wt %) at 77 K and 1 bar of pressure (). The high uptake for H2 may be attributed to the opening of the polycatenated nets due to the structural transformation of 1 as discussed above (). To check the reliability and reproducibility of the study, the measurement was repeated five times, taking fresh samples in each case, which give very similar results. We also repeated the measurement three times on the same sample, which resulted in 216 cc/g (1.94 wt %), 209 cc/g (1.88 wt %), and 180 cc/g (1.62 wt %) consecutively at the same temperature and pressure ranges (Figure S10). The gradual decrease in H2 uptake is probably due to the partial rupture of the framework during the degassing process. Hence, it clearly reveals that the optimum opening of the polycatenated framework occurs when it was degassed the first time at 120 \u00b0C. Interestingly, the high-pressure H2 adsorption study shows comparatively less uptake of 130 cc/g (1.17 wt %) at 62 bar (), which is probably due to more partial rupture of the framework at high pressure. This is further supported by the PXRD pattern of 1' after high-pressure measurement, showing fewer peaks having lesser intensity compared to the PXRD pattern taken after normal H2 adsorption measurement (Figure S5). This high amount of H2 adsorption at 77 K and 1 bar of pressure for 1' may be due to an effective pore size with appreciable void spaces and the presence of coordinatively unsaturated metal centers. During dehydration of 1, the axially coordinated H2O molecules were released and formed vacant sites on each copper(II) to form metal hydride or hydrogen complexes. However, unsaturation in coordination may inspire stronger physisorption and is concomitant with the lowering of the density of the framework, which may facilitate the loss of the terminal ligands. The reported grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation reveals that the small pores created by catenation play an active role in confining the H2 molecules more closely, indicating that the catenated MOFs have higher H2 uptake than the noncatenated MOFs at low pressure. Both the ambient- and high-pressure H2 adsorption measurements of 1' show a small hysteresis in the adsorption-desorption profile, possibly due to the flexible nature of polycatenated structure, and also for the moderate chemical interaction between the open metal sites in 1' and a hydrogen molecule. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first example showing H2 adsorption for an inclined polycatenated MOF-based material. It is also worth mentioning that the amount of H2 uptake is higher than or comparable to (Table S6) the earlier reported value of interpenetrated MOFs. The activated framework of 1 (1') also exhibited 9.5 cc/g H2 uptake at 298 K and 0.99 bar (Figure S11). Sorption with some other gases (e.g., CH4 at 298 K and CO2 at 195, 273, and 298 K) and vapors (e.g., H2O and EtOH at 298 K) was also investigated for 1'. The framework of 1' exhibited a significant amount of CO2 uptake up to 153, 67, and cc/g measured at 195, 273, and 298 K, respectively, at 1 bar of pressure (Figures S9 and S12). Selective adsorption of CO2 over CH4 (26 cc/g) was also found at 298 K and 1 bar of pressure (Figure S9), which has also been observed in interpenetrated/catenated isoreticular MOFs. This elevated CO2 selectivity has been accounted for as a result of the small pore size and interpenetrated adsorption sites. CO2, N2, and CH4 adsorption capacities of 1' are also higher than or comparable to those of known MOFs (Table S7). In the case of solvent vapor (Figure S13), it shows type V H2O adsorption up to 156 cc/g at 298 K and P/P 0 ~ 0.9. At a pressure P/P 0 region of 0.09-0.17, a sharp uptake of H2O adsorption (74 cc/g) occurred, which is equivalent to 1.8 mol of H2O per formula unit, signifying the loss of two coordinated H2O molecules at the low-pressure region. The H2O uptake capacity is more compared to the uptake of less polar EtOH vapor (up to 143 cc/g) at the same pressure and temperature. The H2O adsorption profile also exhibits a larger hysteresis in the adsorption-desorption curve compared to that of the EtOH profile, possibly because of the strong adsorbate-adsorbent interaction in the case of H2O.
