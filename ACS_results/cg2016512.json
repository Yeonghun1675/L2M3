The addition of inorganic oxidant, such as H2O2, may play important roles in accelerating the degradation rate of azo dyes. It has been found that H2O2 could increase the rate of hydroxyl radical formation through three ways. First, it could act as an alternative electron acceptor to oxygen (eq ), which might restrain the recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes. Second, the reduction of H2O2 at the conductance band would also produce hydroxyl radical.
