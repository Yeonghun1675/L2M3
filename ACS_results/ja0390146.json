These results indicate that NTHU-2 contain both micro- and mesopores. The extra-porosity may be attributed to the presence of defect sites (absence of templates and pillaring BDC units) in the framework upon heating.This may correspond to the mesoporosity created in postsynthesis treatments of parent zeolites such that the gas transport characteristics are improved.
