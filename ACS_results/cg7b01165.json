Yield: 13.1 mg (0.00111 mmol), 5.6%.\n\nThe structure contains solvent accessible voids of 2284 \u00c53 combined, or ca. 24.6% of the unit cell volume. The residual electron density peaks were not arranged in an interpretable pattern, and no meaningful disorder and solvent model could be conceived. The cif and fcf files were thus corrected for using reverse Fourier transform methods with the SQUEEZE routine as implemented in the program Platon. The resultant files were used in the further refinement. (The FAB file with details of the Squeeze results is appended to the cif). The Squeeze procedure corrected for 939 electrons within the solvent accessible voids.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "Zn4O(C8H4O4)3"}, "chemical formula
