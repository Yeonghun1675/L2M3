The distances between the doubly linked layers also increase from 2.20 nm for Zr12-BPDC to 2.49 nm for Zr12-TPDC and 2.83 nm for Zr12-QPDC. The BET surface areas measured by nitrogen sorption also increase from 1211 m2/g for Zr12-BPDC to 1859 m2/g for Zr12-TPDC-NO2 (Figures S16-S18 in the Supporting Information). The measured BET surface area for Zr12-QPDC-NO2 was small (347 m2/g) due to distortion of the framework upon solvent removal, which is not uncommon for MOFs with very open channels (Figure S19 in the Supporting Information).
