Monitoring the reaction of [MnIII(OH)(dpaq)]+ with 4-t-butylArOH by electronic absorption spectroscopy showed that the decay of the [MnIII(OH)(dpaq)]+ complex is concomitant with the formation of the corresponding phenoxyl radical, 4-t-butylArO\u22c5 (\u03bbmax = 628 nm; \u03b5 = 400(10) M-1 cm-1 in MeCN at 25 \u00b0C; see Figure ). The phenoxyl radical was formed in 80% yield, relative to the initial [MnIII(OH)(dpaq)]+ concentration. A comparison of perpendicular-mode X-band EPR spectra of [MnII(dpaq)]+, [MnIII(OH)(dpaq)]+, and the final products of 4-t-butylArOH oxidation provides evidence for the formation of [MnII(dpaq)]+ and the phenoxyl radical following the phenol oxidation reaction (see ). The 80% yield of the phenoxyl radical was observed regardless of the initial [MnIII(OH)(dpaq)]+:4-t-butylArOH ratio (see ). It is possible that the 80% yield is observed because the radical participates in side reactions that prevent its full accumulation. However, the clean isosbestic behavior observed in the reaction of [MnIII(OH)(dpaq)]+ with 4-t-butylArOH (Figure ) is difficult to reconcile with the disappearance of 20% of the radical product during the timecourse of this reaction. The substoichiometric formation of phenoxyl radical was also noted in the reaction of [MnIII(OH)(PY5)]+ (Figure , left) with 4-t-butylArOH. For that system, the phenoxyl radical was formed after most of the MnIII-OH complex was consumed, indicating a reaction between the metal complex and the phenoxyl radical. In this present work, the rate of formation of the radical is the same as the rate of disappearance of [MnIII(OH)(dpaq)]+; thus, we assume that no reaction occurs between the MnIII complex and the phenoxyl radical. An alternative explanation for the 80% yield of the phenoxyl radical would be that the equilibrium for the reaction of [MnIII(OH)(dpaq)]+ and 4-t-butylArOH to give [MnII(OH2)(dpaq)]+ and 4-t-butylArO\u22c5 does not lie very far to the right. This can be discounted by the nearly invariant yield of the phenoxyl radical over a range of initial [MnIII(OH)(dpaq)]+: 4-t-butylArOH concentrations (see ).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 40, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig8\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>8</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Electronic absorption spectra of 1.25 mM [Mn<sup>III</sup>(OH)(dpaq)]<sup>+</sup> upon the addition of 100 equiv of 2,4,6-tri-<italic toggle=\"yes\">t</italic>-butylphenol (<sup>4\u2011<italic toggle=\"yes\">t</italic>\u2011butyl</sup>ArOH) at 50 \u00b0C in MeCN under argon.
