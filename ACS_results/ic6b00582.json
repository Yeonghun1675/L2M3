Orbitals 104-106 are \u03c0*(L) in character. Above them are two \u03c0*(U\ue5fbO) orbitals. The \u03c0(Ph)-based HOMO (orbital 100) is observed, mixed with some \u03c3(U\ue5fbO).

The \u03c0\u2225(Oeq) forms two orbitals of 97 and 98, where the notation \"\u2225\" denotes that they are parallel to the equatorial plane of the uranyl ion.
