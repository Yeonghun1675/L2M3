The application of the scale-down chemistry through the use of the short and inexpensive BDC and IN ligands leads to a smaller pore size and lower surface area but little compromise in H2 sorption properties. The compound exhibits a high CO2 uptake of 73.1 cm3 g-1 (273 K and 1 atm) despite its moderate Langmuir and BET surface areas (888.3 and 571.0 m2 g-1, respectively). Its H2 uptake (1.47 wt % at 77 K and 1 atm) is also quite high, comparable to that of many materials with high surface area.\n\nTo investigate the porosity of the present material, gas adsorption measurements (N2, H2, CO2, and CH4) were performed on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 surface area and pore size analyzer. A comparison of sorption data between compound 1 and MCF-19 is given in Table S2 of the . Prior to the measurements, the sample was exchanged with dichloromethane and then degassed at 85 \u00b0C under vacuum. As can be seen from Figure a, compound 1 exhibits a typical type I adsorption isotherm characteristic of permanent microporosity. The Langmuir and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas were calculated to be 888.3 and 571.0 m2 g-1, respectively.
