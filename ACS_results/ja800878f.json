Notably, in many cases the observation of a threshold photon density has been reported below which the local excited states do not grow into a new macroscopic domain. The macroscopic phase change is observed only when the excitation density exceeds this critical \"percolation\" value, i.e., when the interactions between the photogenerated species can stabilize the new phase. As this phenomenon is closely related to the concept of critical nucleus size in phase transitions, the notion of photoinduced phase transition (PIPT) was introduced. The lattice relaxation which follows the (local) optical excitation may also lead to a \"cascade\" phenomenon and thus to very high photoconversion efficiencies. For example, in the organic salt (EDO-TTF)2PF6 a transition from the insulator phase to the metal phase can be induced by ultrashort (femtosecond) light pulses.

Moreover, in many cases, strong, long-range elastic interactions arise between the metal centers leading to first-order thermal phase transition and hysteresis phenomena. Inside the hysteresis loop the macroscopic potential barrier is sufficiently high to make the lifetime of the metastable phases virtually infinite.

However, as the lifetime of the local excited spin states is very short at high temperatures (typically in the microsecond to nanosecond range at 295 K) only a short and intense light pulse can generate a sufficiently high excitation density. Recently, a few experimental results have been published describing the effects of short laser pulses on SCO complexes within the thermal hysteresis region. The first light-induced low-spin to high-spin (LS \u2192 HS) transition in the hysteresis region of an SCO complex was achieved by applying a 8 ns laser pulse at around 170 K on the compound [Fe(PM-BiA)<sub>2</sub>(NCS)<sub>2</sub>] (PM-BIA = <italic toggle=\"yes\">N</italic>-2\u2032-pyridylmethylene-4-aminobiphenyl).
