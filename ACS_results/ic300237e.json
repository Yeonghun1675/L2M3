The red emission\nof the pure Eu<sup>III</sup> compound (<bold>3</bold>) is due to the\nmost intense peak at 615 nm for a <sup>5</sup>D<sub>0</sub>-to-<sup>7</sup>F<sub>2</sub> transition, and the green color of the pure\nTb<sup>III</sup> compound is due to the most intense peak at 545 nm\nfor a <sup>5</sup>D<sub>4</sub>-to-<sup>7</sup>F<sub>5</sub> transition.\nFurthermore, Tb<sup>III</sup> and Eu<sup>III</sup> are a well-known\ndonor\u2013acceptor pair, where Tb<sup>III</sup> acts as a donor\nand Eu<sup>III</sup> acts as an acceptor, and they have green and\nred emission, respectively, as described previously. Eu<sup>III</sup> and Tb<sup>III</sup> have similar charge and ionic radii; therefore,\nEu<sup>III</sup> can be doped easily in the Tb<sup>III</sup> compound\nand the corresponding emission color can be tuned based on the concentration\nof the acceptor Eu<sup>III</sup> through an energy-transfer process.\nThus, to obtain color tunability based on compound <bold>1</bold>,\nwe varied the doping amount of Eu<sup>III</sup> in <bold>1</bold> and\nisolated seven mixed Tb<sup>III</sup>\u2013Eu<sup>III</sup> compounds\nof Eu<sup>III</sup> contents of 50, 24, 15, 7, 4, 1.24, and 0.6 atom\n%. The compositions of the compounds were confirmed by energy-dispersive\nX-ray analysis. The PXRD patterns of all mixed Tb<sup>III</sup>\u2013Eu<sup>III</sup> compounds are similar to that of compound <bold>1</bold>, indicating that they are all isostructural (Figure S12 in the ). By increasing the Eu<sup>III</sup> content\nin the system, we observed that the emission color changes from green\nto red gradually (inset of Figure ). As we\nknow, the Ln ion possesses a very low extinction coefficient because\nof the intraconfigurational f\u2013f transition and has very weak\nemission when directly excited. The problem of inefficient emission\ncan be overcome via the indirect excitation of a coordinated organic\nligand, and this phenomenon is generally known as sensitization or\nthe antenna effect. In all of the compounds, mucic acid is acting\nas an antenna. In order to understand the energy-transfer phenomenon,\nwe have excited different Eu-doped Tb compounds at 315 nm. The emission\nspectra and decay profiles for different compounds are shown in Figures  and S15 in the . The\nspectra of the Tb<sub>2\u20132<italic toggle=\"yes\">x</italic>\n</sub>Eu<sub>2<italic toggle=\"yes\">x</italic>\n</sub> compounds show peaks at 485, 545, 589, and 615 nm;\namong them, the most intense peaks are at 545 and 615 nm for green\nand red emission, respectively. The intensities of the peaks at 545\nand 615 nm decrease and increase, respectively, with increasing percentage\nof Eu<sup>III</sup> in {[Tb<sub>2\u20132<italic toggle=\"yes\">x</italic>\n</sub>Eu<sub>2<italic toggle=\"yes\">x</italic>\n</sub>(Mu<sup>2\u2013</sup>)<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]\u00b74H<sub>2</sub>O}<sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">n</italic>\n</sub>. The lifetimes of the <sup>5</sup>D<sub>0</sub> (Eu<sup>III</sup>) and <sup>5</sup>D<sub>4</sub> (Tb<sup>III</sup>) states increase\nand decrease in the doped sample from the pure compound, implying\nthe presence of Fo\u0308rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from\nTb<sup>III</sup> to Eu<sup>III</sup> ().

Because of the longer distance (6 \u00c5) between the Tb<sup>III</sup> and Eu<sup>III</sup> centers, FRET would be weak in doped\ncompounds, with a very low concentration of the acceptor (Eu<sup>III</sup>; Table S6 in the ).</p>", "clean_text": "The PXRD pattern of 3 is similar to that of 1, and indexing of the pattern using the KOHL program suggests a cell parameter identical with that of 1 (Table S4 in the ), confirming that 1 and 3 are isomorphous (Figure S12 in the ). Typical emission spectra of 1 and its europium analogue 3 show their respective characteristic peaks when excited at 315 nm for both compounds. Compound 1 shows emission peaks at 485, 545, 585, and 620 nm corresponding to transitions from 5D4 to 7F J  (where J = 6-3, respectively) for TbIII (Figure S13 in the ), whereas compound 3 exhibits emission peaks at 590, 615, 650, and 693 nm related to 5D0-to-7F J  transitions, where J = 1-4, respectively (Figure S14 in the ). The red emission of the pure EuIII compound (3) is due to the most intense peak at 615 nm for a 5D0-to-7F2 transition, and the green color of the pure TbIII compound is due to the most intense peak at 545 nm for a 5D4-to-7F5 transition. Furthermore, TbIII and EuIII are a well-known donor-acceptor pair, where TbIII acts as a donor and EuIII acts as an acceptor, and they have green and red emission, respectively, as described previously. EuIII and TbIII have similar charge and ionic radii; therefore, EuIII can be doped easily in the TbIII compound and the corresponding emission color can be tuned based on the concentration of the acceptor EuIII through an energy-transfer process. Thus, to obtain color tunability based on compound 1, we varied the doping amount of EuIII in 1 and isolated seven mixed TbIII-EuIII compounds of EuIII contents of 50, 24, 15, 7, 4, 1.24, and 0.6 atom %. The compositions of the compounds were confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. The PXRD patterns of all mixed TbIII-EuIII compounds are similar to that of compound 1, indicating that they are all isostructural (Figure S12 in the ).

The intensities of the peaks at 545 and 615 nm decrease and increase, respectively, with increasing percentage of EuIII in {[Tb2-2x Eu2x (Mu2-)3(H2O)2]\u22c54H2O} n . The lifetimes of the 5D0 (EuIII) and 5D4 (TbIII) states increase and decrease in the doped sample from the pure compound, implying the presence of Fo\u0308rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from TbIII to EuIII (). The efficiency of energy transfer within a single donor-acceptor pair at distance r is E = R 0 6/(R 0 6 + r 6), where R 0 is the Fo\u0308rster distance.
