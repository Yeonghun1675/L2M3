Essentially, this material exhibits a robust framework with an order/disorder in a substituent group that leads to flexible magnetic ground states dependent on the degree of solvation. Thus, the present compound revealed a new concept for reversible magnetism in which a trigger as subtle as a structural fluctuation, in this case order/disorder of a ligand substituent, is crucial for deciding the magnetic properties. These results are quite different from the known cases of reversible changes in magnetism for materials that undergo major structural changes effected by interstitial solvent loss.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 31, "type": "text", "classification": ["synthesis condition"], "content": "<title>Experimental Section</title><title>Synthesis of <bold>1</bold>\n</title><p>All synthetic procedures were carried out under anaerobic conditions.

This result not only indicates that the charge transfer from the [Ru<sub>2</sub>\n<sup>II,II</sup>] unit to the TCNQ(MeO)<sub>2</sub> moiety occurs in <bold>1</bold> but also that a significant coupling of magnetic centers occurs through TCNQ(MeO)<sub>2</sub>\n<sup>\u2022\u2009\u2212</sup> within and between layers even at high temperatures (vide infra). The observed lower \u03c7<italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic> values at high temperatures are attributed to the following three reasons. The first is the large anisotropy of [Ru<sub>2</sub>\n<sup>II,II</sup>] and [Ru<sub>2</sub>\n<sup>II,III</sup>] units with <italic toggle=\"yes\">D</italic> \u2248 400 K (<italic toggle=\"yes\">S</italic> = 1) and <italic toggle=\"yes\">D</italic> \u2248 100 K (<italic toggle=\"yes\">S</italic> = 3/2), respectively. The second one is that antiferromagnets (such as <bold>1</bold>; vide infra) in this type of system have strong interlayer antiferromagnetic interactions even at high temperatures (vide infra). The last one is that it is not obvious whether the spin arrangement in a layer is ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic because of the above two reasons. Upon decreasing the temperature, the \u03c7<italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic> value gradually increases in the high temperature region and then drastically increases at around 80 K to reach 243 cm<sup>3</sup>\u00b7K\u00b7mol<sup>\u22121</sup> at 62 K followed by a decrease to 9.50 cm<sup>3</sup>\u00b7K\u00b7mol<sup>\u22121</sup> at 1.8 K. As expected from this \u03c7<italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic> behavior, the \u03c7 value at 1 kOe exhibits a rapid increase at ca. 80 K without any decrease being observed over the entire temperature range (Figure a). Measurements at an external field less than 300 Oe, however, show a peak around 70\u221275 K (Figure b), owing to a spin flip from an antiferromagnetic (AF) phase to a paramagnetic (P) phase. To obtain more details of the spin ordering near this temperature, temperature dependence of the ac susceptibility was measured under a zero dc field and a 3 Oe oscillating field. The in-phase susceptibility (\u03c7\u2032) shows a sharp peak at 75 K without frequency dependence (Figure ), and there is no anomaly in the out-of-phase susceptibility (\u03c7\u2032\u2032), indicating the occurrence of an antiferromagnetic phase transition with <italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic>\n<sub>N</sub> = 75 K. We note that a small, broad peak for \u03c7\u2032 was also observed at \u223c35 K, which is due to defects caused by a minimal loss of solvent (vide infra). This spin flip phenomenon can also be observed in the field dependence of the magnetization (Figure a); the initial magnetization experiences a spin flip that that can be detected as a peak in a d<italic toggle=\"yes\">M</italic>/d<italic toggle=\"yes\">H</italic> plot (Figure b). Ultimately, these data lead to an <italic toggle=\"yes\">H</italic>\u2212<italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic> phase diagram for <bold>1</bold> as shown in Figure  characteristic of metamagnetism. Nevertheless, this metamagnetic behavior is unusual; after the material achieves a P-phase, <bold>1</bold> becomes a field-induced canted antiferromagnet with a large coercivity up to 1.6 T at 1.8 K (Figure a). The coercivity disappears at ca. 80 K (inset of Figure a).

The \u03c7T value of 1.80 cm3\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1 at 300 K (at 1 kOe; Figure a) is less than the spin-only value of 2.00 cm3\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1 for a set of two S = 1 spins with g = 2.00 for isolated [Ru2 II,II] units as calculated on the basis of no redox reaction. This result not only indicates that the charge transfer from the [Ru2 II,II] unit to the TCNQ(MeO)2 moiety occurs in 1 but also that a significant coupling of magnetic centers occurs through TCNQ(MeO)2 \u22c5- within and between layers even at high temperatures (vide infra). The observed lower \u03c7T values at high temperatures are attributed to the following three reasons. The first is the large anisotropy of [Ru2 II,II] and [Ru2 II,III] units with D ~ 400 K (S = 1) and D ~ 100 K (S = 3/2), respectively. The second one is that antiferromagnets (such as 1; vide infra) in this type of system have strong interlayer antiferromagnetic interactions even at high temperatures (vide infra). The last one is that it is not obvious whether the spin arrangement in a layer is ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic because of the above two reasons. Upon decreasing the temperature, the \u03c7T value gradually increases in the high temperature region and then drastically increases at around 80 K to reach 243 cm3\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1 at 62 K followed by a decrease to 9.50 cm3\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1 at 1.8 K. As expected from this \u03c7T behavior, the \u03c7 value at 1 kOe exhibits a rapid increase at ca. 80 K without any decrease being observed over the entire temperature range (Figure a). Measurements at an external field less than 300 Oe, however, show a peak around 70-75 K (Figure b), owing to a spin flip from an antiferromagnetic (AF) phase to a paramagnetic (P) phase. To obtain more details of the spin ordering near this temperature, temperature dependence of the ac susceptibility was measured under a zero dc field and a 3 Oe oscillating field. The in-phase susceptibility (\u03c7') shows a sharp peak at 75 K without frequency dependence (Figure ), and there is no anomaly in the out-of-phase susceptibility (\u03c7''), indicating the occurrence of an antiferromagnetic phase transition with T N = 75 K. We note that a small, broad peak for \u03c7' was also observed at ~35 K, which is due to defects caused by a minimal loss of solvent (vide infra). This spin flip phenomenon can also be observed in the field dependence of the magnetization (Figure a); the initial magnetization experiences a spin flip that that can be detected as a peak in a dM/dH plot (Figure b). Ultimately, these data lead to an H-T phase diagram for 1 as shown in Figure  characteristic of metamagnetism. Nevertheless, this metamagnetic behavior is unusual; after the material achieves a P-phase, 1 becomes a field-induced canted antiferromagnet with a large coercivity up to 1.6 T at 1.8 K (Figure a). The coercivity disappears at ca. 80 K (inset of Figure a). The details of the M-H hysteresis will be described below.\n\nCrystal Data for 1 \n\nC71H42N4O18Cl10Ru4, FW = 1997.94, triclinic P-1 (No. 2), T = 103 \u00b1 1 K, \u03bb(Mo K\u03b1) = 0.71075 \u00c5, a = 10.18970(10) \u00c5, b = 11.8946(2) \u00c5, c = 15.8515(3) \u00c5, \u03b1 = 83.299(3)\u00b0, \u03b2 = 86.941(3)\u00b0, \u03b3 = 80.846(3)\u00b0, V = 1882.63(5) \u00c53, Z = 1, D calc = 1.762 g\u22c5cm-3, F 000 = 986.00, 2\u03b8max = 55.0\u00b0.
