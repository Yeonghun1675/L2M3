One prominent emission peak occurs at 580 nm (fwhm ~ 100 nm), and its  excitation spectrum shows a maximum absorption at 490 nm. This process is likely due to the S2- to Cd2+ charge transfer, similar to that observed for the bulk CdS. The emission disappears upon dissolving UCR-9 in dilute nitric acid.
