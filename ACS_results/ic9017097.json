The TGA curve of compound <bold>1</bold> shows that seven water molecules are lost in the temperature range of 70\u2212115 \u00b0C (obsd 12.14%, calcd 11.71%). Then the compound is stable up to 330 \u00b0C. At higher temperature, decomposition starts and two weight losses are observed, one from 300 to 570 \u00b0C (obsd 37.67%) and another in the range from 830 to 1130 \u00b0C. As the final product, we suggest a mixture of NiO and Na<sub>2</sub>O (obsd 24.97%, calcd 25.40%). Compound <bold>2</bold> shows a similar TGA curve. Eight water molecules are lost in the temperature range of 60\u2212128 \u00b0C (obsd 12.87%, calcd 13.26%). Then the dehydrated product is stable up to 260 \u00b0C, after which decomposition of the organic ligands starts. This results in a weight loss in the range of 260\u2212560 \u00b0C (obsd 39.98%) and another weight loss in the range of 850\u2212990 \u00b0C (obsd 25.49%, calcd 26.06%), leading to a suggested formation of CuO and Na<sub>2</sub>O. The TGA curve of compound <bold>3</bold> is different. A gradual decomposition occurs up to 520 \u00b0C, resulting in an observed weight loss of 74%.

Finally, there is a slight weight loss up to 1230 \u00b0C, which leads to a suggested mixture of NiO and Li<sub>2</sub>O (2:1) (obsd 20.18%, calcd 18.03%).</p><p>Magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed in the temperature range of 1.8\u2212300 K only for paramagnetic compound <bold>2</bold>.

The evolution of \u03c7M T with temperature is shown in Figure . The magnetic superexchange interaction between the two CuII centers within each repeating unit is mediated by the phenol oxygen atoms from each ligand strand through one sodium atom. However, no interaction could be possible between each unit, which is connected by three double sodium atoms along with the 1D chain. At room temperature, the \u03c7M T product is 0.81 cm3\u22c5K/mol. This value is in very good agreement with the presence of two CuII metal ions (S = 1/2). The g value can thus be estimated at 2.07. Upon decreasing temperature, the \u03c7M T product at 1000 Oe stays almost constant until 40 K and then continuously decreases to reach 0.67 cm3\u22c5K/mol at 1.8 K, indicating the presence of weak antiferromagnetic interactions. The data have been analyzed using the isotropic spin Hamiltonian H = -2JS 1 S 2 with quantum numbers S 1 = S 2 = 1/2. Using the Bleaney-Bowers equation, the fit to the magnetic susceptibility data leads to the best set of parameters as J = -0.53(1) K and g = 2.07(1) (Figure ).
