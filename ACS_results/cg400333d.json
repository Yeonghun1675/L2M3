Magnetic analyses indicate the three Gd3+-containing compounds bear an interesting magnetocaloric effect, and the -\u0394Sm(T) values are 5.8, 6.0, and 18.8 J kg1- K-1 (\u0394H  = 5 T) for 1, 4, and 6, respectively.\n\nMagnetic Properties\n\nThe magnetic susceptibilities of 1-8 have been studied in the temperature range of 2-300 K with an applied direct current (dc) magnetic field of 1000 Oe. At room temperature, the \u03c7M T values of 1-4 are in agreement with the expected values: observed 18.68 cm3 mol-1 K for 1 and 18.21 cm3 mol-1 K for 4 [calcd 18.00 cm3 mol-1 K for two uncoupled Gd3+ (S = 7/2, g = 2) and six Cu2+ (S = 1/2, g = 2) ions], observed 26.22 cm3 mol-1 K for 2 [calcd 25.88 cm3 mol-1 K for two Tb3+ (S = 3, L = 3, g = 3/2) and six Cu2+ (S = 1/2, g = 2) ions], observed 30.16 cm3 mol-1 K for 3 [calcd 30.58 cm3 mol-1 K for two uncoupled Dy3+ (S = 5/2, L = 5, g = 4/3) and six Cu2+ (S = 1/2, g = 2) ions]. For 5, the \u03c7M T value is 29.19 cm3 mol-1 K, larger than the expected value of 25.88 cm3 mol-1 K for two spin-only S = 3, L = 3, g = 3/2 and six S = 1/2, g = 2 metal centers.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "magnetic susceptibility": [{"value": "0.98", "unit": "cm3 mol-1 K", "temperature": "room temperature", "condition": "per hexanuclear unit"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "magnetic susceptibility": [{"value": "18.68", "unit": "cm3 mol-1 K", "temperature": "room temperature", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "2", "chemical formula": ""}, "magnetic susceptibility": [{"value": "26.22", "unit": "cm3 mol-1 K", "temperature": "room temperature", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "3", "chemical formula": ""}, "magnetic susceptibility": [{"value": "30.16", "unit": "cm3 mol-1 K", "temperature": "room temperature", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "4", "chemical formula": ""}, "magnetic susceptibility": [{"value": "18.21", "unit": "cm3 mol-1 K", "temperature": "room temperature", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "5", "chemical formula": ""}, "magnetic susceptibility": [{"value": "29.19", "unit": "cm3 mol-1 K", "temperature": "room temperature", "condition": ""}]}]]], "include_properties": ["magnetic_susceptibility"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['magnetic_susceptibility']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"MOF-A\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"magnetic susceptibility\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"0.98\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 mol-1 K\",\n                \"temperature\": \"room temperature\",\n                \"condition\": \"per hexanuclear unit\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"\",\n            \"symbol\": \"1\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"magnetic susceptibility\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"18.68\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 mol-1 K\",\n                \"temperature\": \"room temperature\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"\",\n            \"symbol\": \"2\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"magnetic susceptibility\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"26.22\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 mol-1 K\",\n                \"temperature\": \"room temperature\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"\",\n            \"symbol\": \"3\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"magnetic susceptibility\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"30.16\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 mol-1 K\",\n                \"temperature\": \"room temperature\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"\",\n            \"symbol\": \"4\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"magnetic susceptibility\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"18.21\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 mol-1 K\",\n                \"temperature\": \"room temperature\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"\",\n            \"symbol\": \"5\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"magnetic susceptibility\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"29.19\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 mol-1 K\",\n                \"temperature\": \"room temperature\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 7, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Schematic Representation of the Dynamic Assembly Procedures\nfor <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>8</bold>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cg-2013-00333d_0009.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Schematic Representation of the Dynamic Assembly Procedures for 1-8    ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 10, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) 1D chain of <bold>1</bold>.
