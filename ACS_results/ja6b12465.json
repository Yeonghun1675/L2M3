In the absence of structural data on this phase, variable scan rate studies (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 K min-1), which were conducted as standard practice on all phases, provide some useful insight into the lattice changes involved. In comparing across 1\u22c5(H  2  O,EtOH), 1\u22c53H  2  O and 1\u22c5~2H  2  O we found that the thermal hysteresis loops for the 1.0 to 0.5 HS conversion are widened with increasing scan rate (), as is broadly consistent with standard temperature lag and transition enthalpy considerations. However, it is notable that the low temperature hysteresis loops of both 1\u22c53H  2  O and 1\u22c5~2H  2  O (the latter incorporating a double step) show significant scan rate dependence in the cooling sweep, which is notably more pronounced than that of the other loops, and almost no variance on the warming sweep; similar behavior has been seen in other systems and attributed to structural phenomena occurring on a longer time scale than the experimental scan rate. Here, the observation of a pronounced scan rate broadening of the 0.5 to 0.25 HS conversion of 1\u22c53H  2  O () is consistent with there being a relatively slow ordering of guest water molecules at site B within half of the pores, as described above. The observation of a comparable scan rate dependence in 1\u22c5~2H  2  O () suggests that a similar effect is present, although now involving the ordering of a single rather than two water guests within site B of the pores. The fact that this rate dependency is observed over the entire 0.5 to 0.25 to 0.0 HS conversion suggests that water molecule reorganization occurs over both steps, rather than just the 0.5 to 0.25 portion, with stepwise ordering in pores Y then X corresponding to each partial crossover step such that the thermodynamic stabilization of the 0.25 HS lattice state again occurs concomitantly with a mixture of ordered and disordered guest water molecules.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 24, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, we present\na new spin crossover framework material\nin which a diverse network of host\u2013host and host\u2013guest\ninteractions gives rise to a competition between antagonistic ferro-\nand antiferro-elastic interactions that drive SCO related lattice\ndistortions.
