While this model employs a single Ni atom in lieu of a larger Ni-oxo cluster, it should permit qualitative exploration of the influence of the installed ligands. Thus, previous computations have shown single Ni atoms to be a good model for Ni4 clusters specifically for understanding the catalytic activity of nonelaborated Ni-AIM-NU-1000 for ethylene dimerization. As illustrated in , the catalytic cycle starts with the activated species 1, where the ethyl group binds to Ni(II) via a strong \u03b2-agostic interaction with one H of the CH3 group. An incoming ethylene binds to 1 at Ni(II) leading to the formation of 2, which is exergonic by 8.3 kcal/mol for Ni-Facac-AIM-NU-1000. With a 26.6 kcal/mol free energy of activation, ethylene inserts into the Ni-C bond to produce 3 via transition-state (TS) structure TS2-3. With a subsequent free energy of activation of 9.6 kcal/mol (TS3-4), 1-butene is produced via \u03b2-hydrogen elimination with the concomitant formation of a nickel hydride species. After 1-butene desorption, ethylene can react with the nickel hydride species to reform 1. Alternatively, 3 can further react with another ethylene molecule to produce a more stable structure 6 (5.4 kcal/mol lower than 3 in free energy). However, the migratory insertion of ethylene into the Ni-C bond in 6 to produce Ni-hexyl species 7 requires going through transition structure TS6-7 with a 24.5 kcal/mol free energy of activation, which is 9.5 kcal/mol higher than that to produce 1-butene. Therefore, the production of 1-butene is more favorable than the chain growth process to make oligomeric products, in line with the experimental observation (vide supra); Ni-Acac-AIM-NU-1000 shows similar selectivity to Ni-Facac-AIM-NU-1000 for 1-butene production because the free energy of activation for Ni-hexyl production (23.2 kcal/mol) is 11.2 kcal/mol higher than that for 1-butene production (). Also noteworthy is the computation that the activation barrier for the first C-C coupling step of unmodified Ni-AIM-NU-1000 (2\u21923) (13.7 kcal/mol) is 12.9 kcal/mol lower than that for Ni-Facac-AIM-NU-1000, consistent with the higher activity for ethylene oligomerization observed for the former. The lower activity of Ni-Facac/Acac-AIM-NU-1000 for ethylene dimerization derives partly from stronger binding of substrate to Ni and partly from greater costs for structural deformation along C-C coupling reaction pathways, likely due to rearrangement of the siting of (F)acac- to partially ligate added nickel ( and ; data in ).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 14, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig3\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Gibbs free\nenergy profiles (298.15 K, 1 atm) for the stationary\npoints along reaction coordinates for ethylene oligomerization catalyzed\nby Ni-Acac-AIM-NU-1000 and Ni-Facac-AIM-NU-1000 compared to Ni-AIM-NU-1000.<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref22\"></xref> Solid and dash lines represent C2 to C4 and\nC4 to C6 reaction paths, respectively.
