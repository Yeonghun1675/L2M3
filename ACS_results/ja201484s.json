The framework connectivity and zinc coordination geometry of the intermediates are nearly identical, indicating that the transition of zinc cores to the open form requires complete desolvation. As anticipated from the TG experiment, the dried form 2d with one open metal site is sensitive to air moisture; one water molecule coordinates readily to one of the zinc ions to give the hydrated form 2e, [Zn2(tp)2(L  2 )(H2O)] n  (Figure ). The Raman signature of 2e is similar to that of 2d with a single band at 1433 cm-1 ().
