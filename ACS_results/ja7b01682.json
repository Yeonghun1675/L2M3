Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and porosimetry data were thereby collected at intervals of 1, 7, and 14 days. SIFSIX-2-Cu-i (B) was found to be stable for the full testing period with retention of the PXRD pattern (E) and surface area (Figure S27). This was not the case, however, for SIFSIX-1-Cu (A) and SIFSIX-14-Cu-i (C), which underwent crystalline-to-crystalline phase transformations from porous pcu topology networks to nonporous interpenetrated square grid, sql-c*, topology networks (). The sql-c* compound formed by SIFSIX-1-Cu is isostructural to that of Robson and co-workers' landmark coordination polymer reported in 1990, [Zn(1)2(H2O)2]\u22c5SIFSIX (CSD refcode: JEZRUB), wherein octahedral metal nodes form square grid networks with 4,4'-bipyridyl ligands in the equatorial positions and aqua ligands in the axial positions. These square grids interpenetrate diagonally, affording the sql-c* topology (). That SIFSIX-1-Cu transforms into [Cu(1)2(H2O)2]\u22c5SIFSIX upon exposure to water was previously reported by Kitagawa and co-workers. The structure of [Cu(14)2(H2O)2]\u22c5SIFSIX, the transformed product of SIFSIX-14-Cu-i, was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) from single crystals that formed concomitantly during the preparation of SIFSIX-14-Cu-i (Table S1). The purities of the bulk phases after transformation were verified by PXRD (D,F). Zn-DMOF-1 was previously found to exhibit a similar negative adsorption event in the presence of water vapor, but its transformation product was not structurally characterized. In contrast, SIFSIX-3-Ni was synthesized via an unknown precursor with the pcu network being obtained upon heating to 100 \u00b0C under vacuum for 24 h. PXRD and thermal analysis studies suggest that the precursor material is isostructural to a previously reported sql network [Cu(3)2(F)(HF)].TaF6 (CSD refcode: NATYAK), wherein fluoride groups coordinating to the metal node are replaced by water molecules (Figures S2, S11, S18, and S24 and Table S3). Upon exposure to elevated temperature and humidity, SIFSIX-3-Ni was found to undergo a phase transformation to the as-synthesized phase, proposed to be a square lattice, sql, network topology. The solid-state phase transformation between the porous pcu network and the proposed nonporous sql network is reversible as shown by a recyclability protocol whereby a sample of SIFSIX-3-Ni was exposed to 75% RH and 40 \u00b0C for 24 h. These conditions promote the phase transformations to the sql network. SIFSIX-3-Ni was regenerated as a pcu network by heating the sql network to 80 \u00b0C under vacuum for 16 h (). This protocol was repeated for 10 cycles. CO2 sorption profiles (298 K) after the 10 cycles were unchanged with respect to the pristine sample (Figure S28).

The desorption isotherms of porous SIFSIX-1-Cu and SIFSIX-14-Cu-i indicate that water content is consistent with coordination of aqua ligands found in the nonporous sql-c* topology networks. The desorption isotherm of SIFSIX-3-Ni reaches vacuum with ca. 0.7 molecules of water per formula unit. In contrast, SIFSIX-2-Cu-i was observed to exhibit a type V isotherm with the relatively low uptake of water vapor at low partial pressure, eventually adsorbing 14.61 mmol g-1 of water at ca. 90% RH and hysteresis ( and S35).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "SIFSIX-1-Cu", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "water vapor", "adsorbed amount": "7.98", "unit": "mmol g-1", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "90% RH (2.85 kPa)", "condition": "negative adsorption"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "SIFSIX-3-Ni", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "water vapor", "adsorbed amount": "8.53", "unit": "mmol g-1", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "90% RH (2.85 kPa)", "condition": "negative adsorption"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "SIFSIX-14-Cu-i", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "water vapor", "adsorbed amount": "8.19", "unit": "mmol g-1", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "90% RH (2.85 kPa)", "condition": "negative adsorption"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "SIFSIX-2-Cu-i", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "water vapor", "adsorbed amount": "14.61", "unit": "mmol g-1", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "90% RH", "condition": "type V isotherm"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["gas_adsorption"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['gas_adsorption']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"SIFSIX-1-Cu\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"water vapor\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"7.98\",\n                \"unit\": \"mmol g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"298 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"90% RH (2.85 kPa)\",\n                \"condition\": \"negative adsorption\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"SIFSIX-3-Ni\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"water vapor\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"8.53\",\n                \"unit\": \"mmol g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"298 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"90% RH (2.85 kPa)\",\n                \"condition\": \"negative adsorption\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"SIFSIX-14-Cu-i\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"water vapor\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"8.19\",\n                \"unit\": \"mmol g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"298 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"90% RH (2.85 kPa)\",\n                \"condition\": \"negative adsorption\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"SIFSIX-2-Cu-i\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"water vapor\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"14.61\",\n                \"unit\": \"mmol g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"298 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"90% RH\",\n                \"condition\": \"type V isotherm\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 5, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Water vapor adsorption\nisotherms (298 K) for <bold>SIFSIX-1-Cu</bold> (green), <bold>SIFSIX-2-Cu-i</bold> (blue), <bold>SIFSIX-3-Ni</bold> (purple), and <bold>SIFSIX-14-Cu-i</bold> (red).
