As expected, UTSA-300a takes up a large amount of C2H2 (3.41 mmol g-1, 76.4 cm3 g-1) at 1 bar and 273 K, which is comparable to 3.86 mmol g-1 (86.4 cm3 cm-3) in SIFSIX-3-Zn. However, to our big surprise, UTSA-300a adsorbs negligible amounts of CO2 (0.18 mmol g-1, 4.1 cm3 g-1) and C2H4 (0.04 mmol g-1, 0.92 cm3 g-1) at the same condition, which is less than any other MOF materials with considerable uptake of C2H2. Compared with other MOFs, the uptake ratios of C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/ C2H4 for UTSA-300a at 1 bar are very high and up to 19 and 83 (d and Table S2), suggesting potential application to address the challenging separation of these gases under ambient condition.

The results in  (also Figure S36) indeed demonstrate that UTSA-300a is highly efficient for these challenging separations of C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4 mixtures. For C2H2/CO2 separation, gas chromatography data revealed that the outlet effluent gas during initial purges contains only CO2 (purity >99.9%), and this continues until C2H2 starts breaking through because its uptake capacity in UTSA-300a has been reached. Similar results can also be observed for the C2H2/C2H4 mixture, and the outlet C2H4 purity is also up to >99.9%. For both gas mixtures, high-purity C2H2 (>99%) can be obtained during the final regeneration stage. Notably, the breakthrough curves for both gas mixtures are almost the same (elution times >30 min), suggesting the same C2H2 capture capacities for UTSA-300a to these mixtures, which demonstrates that the molecular exclusion of CO2 and C2H4 works well even under dynamic gas mixture flow. Further studies for UTSA-300a with larger gas flow (see Figures S37 and S38) also show excellent separation performance toward challenging C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4 mixtures.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 28, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig6\" position=\"float\">\n<label>6</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Experimental\ncolumn breakthrough curves for equimolar C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> (purple) and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> (orange) mixtures (298 K, 1 bar) in an\nadsorber bed packed with <bold>UTSA-300a</bold>. <italic>C</italic>\n<sub>0</sub> is the total concentration of gases at outlet.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr6\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ja-2017-03850w_0006.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 6  Experimental column breakthrough curves for equimolar C2H2/CO2 (purple) and C2H2/C2H4 (orange) mixtures (298 K, 1 bar) in an adsorber bed packed with UTSA-300a.
