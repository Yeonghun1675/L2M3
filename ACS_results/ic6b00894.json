The DHIP MOFs may promise a new heterogeneous system and bring new inspiration to chiral separation in terms of the exploration of advanced adsorbents for varieties of adsorbates. Further efforts will focus on other DHIP-based framework adsorbents as well as chiral stationary phases and membranes with potential actual applications.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 17, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting\nInformation is available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at\nDOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00894\">10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00894</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Experimental details\nand spectral data (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00894/suppl_file/ic6b00894_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Crystallographic file in CIF format (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00894/suppl_file/ic6b00894_si_002.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Crystallographic file in\nCIF format (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00894/suppl_file/ic6b00894_si_003.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00894.
