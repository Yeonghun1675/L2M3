The sample exhibited a slightly lower BET surface area (260 m2 g-1) than that of the bulk I, but the total pore volume of 0.60 cm3 g-1 was 4-fold larger than that of the bulk I. This result could be ascribed to the presence of the large interparticle voids for micro-I, and these voids can be observed as a dramatic increase of an adsorbed amount of N2 above P/P 0 = 0.9 atm. The low uptake ability can be mainly attributed to the small pore dimension of micro-I. This is due to the pore blocking effect of the bulky 4-tolyl moieties and the low adsorptivity of N2 gas as mentioned earlier for the bulk I. However, the evacuated micro-I showed a relatively large amount of CO2 uptake at 196 K but no adsorption of CO2 at 273 K. These behaviors were very similar to those of the bulk Co-MOF I (Figure ). The CO2 uptake amount measured at 196 K, 125.6 cm2 g-1 (5.60 mmol g-1), is comparable to that of I. Even the shapes of the adsorption-desorption isotherms are very similar to that of bulk sample of I. Interestingly, both bulk I and micro-I exhibited a much enhanced adsorption for CO2 than N2. The gas sorption analyses for CH4 at 196 K and H2 at 77 K indicated low levels of uptake (Figure S4, ): CH4, 20.8 cm3 g-1 (0.93 mmol g-1); H2, 36.6 cm3 g-1 (1.63 mmol g-1).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']"}}, {"idx": 33, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>The capture of iodine inside the\nMOF channels is an attractive\nmethod for stabilizing the volatile and potentially toxic iodine.
