Colorless needles of 3 with lengths up to 2 mm were obtained with a yield of ~50% based on Sn. The final pH was 2.3.\n\nSynthesis of Sn3O(1,4-bdc)2 (4)\n\nCompound 4 was synthesized by hydrothermal reactions of a mixture of saturated aqueous solutions of SnSO4 (3 mL) and (TMA)2(1,4-bdc) (3 mL) [TMA = tetramethylammonium]. The mixture was sealed in a Teflon vessel (23 mL inner volume) in air and heated at 180 \u00b0C for 24 h, and then it was cooled in air to room temperature. Colorless plates of 4 were recovered from the final solution (pH = 3.1) by vacuum filtering and washing with distilled water, N,N-dimethylformamide, and methanol. The yield is ~30% based on Sn. Elem.
