A solution of n-BuLi in n-hexane (1.53 M, 110 mL, 168 mmol) was added dropwise with stirring over 3 h. After the addition was complete, the turbid yellow solution was stirred for another 4 h at -78 \u00b0C and then slowly warmed to room temperature overnight. The resulting suspension was treated with a saturated aqueous solution of NaHCO3 (50 mL). After stirring for 10 min, the resulting two liquid phases were separated and the aqueous phase was extracted with n-hexane (2 \u00d7 20 mL) and ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 20 mL). The combined organic phases were washed with deionized H2O (50 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and filtered. All volatiles were removed from the filtrate under vacuum, and the pale yellow, oily residue was vacuum distilled to give a colorless, viscous liquid. Yield: 20.3 g (86%).\n\n 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra were in accord with published data of a sample of 1 obtained through a two-step synthesis sequence. \n\nSynthesis of 2 \n\nMg turnings (1.52 g, 62.5 mmol) were heated with a heat gun under vacuum for 15 min in a two-necked Schlenk flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a dropping funnel. After the flask had cooled to room temperature again, 1 (5.9 g, 21 mmol), (i-PrO)Bpin (8.0 mL, 7.3 g, 39 mmol), and THF (100 mL) were added. The mixture was heated by means of a heating mantle to start the Grignard reaction. As soon as the solvent had reached reflux temperature, the heating mantle was switched off and a solution of 1,2-C2H4Br2 (1.8 mL, 3.9 g, 21 mmol) in THF (10 mL) was added continuously to the vigorously stirred reaction mixture over a period of 1 h. After the addition was complete, the resulting yellow slurry was heated to reflux temperature for 4 h. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature again and stirred overnight. It was treated with a saturated aqueous solution of NaHCO3 (50 mL) and stirred for 30 min, the two liquid phases were separated, and the aqueous phase was extracted with n-hexane (50 mL) and ethyl acetate (50 mL). The combined organic phases were washed with H2O (50 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and filtered, and all volatiles were removed from the filtrate under vacuum. The flask containing the crude product was placed in a silicone oil bath, and impurities were sublimed off in an oil-pump vacuum at temperatures up to 80 \u00b0C. In a second run, compound 2 itself was sublimed at temperatures T \u2265 100 \u00b0C; in order to speed up the process, the flask can be heated to 200 \u00b0C without thermolysis of 2. Compound 2 was obtained as a colorless, analytically pure solid. Yield: 5.48 g (80%). All NMR spectra (1H, 11B{1H}, 13C{1H}) were in accord with published data. \n\nSynthesis and Characterization of 3 \n\nMethod A\n\nMg turnings (1.86 g, 76.5 mmol) were heated with a heat gun under vacuum for 15 min in a two-necked Schlenk flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a dropping funnel. After the flask had cooled to room temperature again, 1,2,4,5-C6H2Br4 (5.0 g, 13 mmol), (i-PrO)Bpin (20.0 mL, 18.2 g, 98.0 mmol), and THF (100 mL) were added. The mixture was heated to reflux temperature by means of a heating mantle to start the Grignard reaction. While external heating was continued, a solution of 1,2-C2H4Br2 (2.0 mL, 4.4 g, 23 mmol) in THF (15 mL) was added dropwise with stirring over 1 h. Heating was continued for a further 4 h, the mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature, and all volatiles were removed under reduced pressure. n-Hexane (50 mL), ethyl acetate (50 mL), and a saturated aqueous solution of NaHCO3 (50 mL) were added to the crude product. After separation of the two liquid phases, the organic phase was washed with H2O (50 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and filtered, and the filtrate was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The resulting yellow oil was purified by column chromatography (n-hexane/ethyl acetate, 3:1, R  f  = 0.79) to finally obtain 3 as a colorless solid. Colorless block-shaped single crystals were grown by slow evaporation of a solution of 3 in CHCl3 over a period of 7 d.

The resulting solution was cooled to -78 \u00b0C in an i-PrOH/dry ice bath, and a solution of n-BuLi in n-hexane (1.38 M, 37 mL, 51 mmol) was added dropwise with stirring over 3 h. The yellow reaction mixture was stirred for another 4 h at -78 \u00b0C and then slowly warmed to room temperature overnight. The resulting turbid solution was treated with a saturated aqueous solution of NaHCO3 (50 mL). After stirring for 10 min, the two liquid phases were separated and the aqueous phase was extracted with n-hexane (2 \u00d7 30 mL) and ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 30 mL). The combined organic phases were washed with H2O (50 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and filtered, and the filtrate was evaporated under vacuum. The oily residue was heated to 100 \u00b0C under vacuum to remove impurities by distillation/sublimation and to obtain 3 as a colorless solid. Yield: 4.9 g (77%).\n\nSynthesis and Characterization of 4 \n\nMg turnings (512 mg, 21.1 mmol) were heated with a heat gun under vacuum for 15 min in a two-necked Schlenk flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a dropping funnel. After the flask had cooled to room temperature again, 3 (1.5 g, 3.1 mmol), (i-PrO)Bpin (5.0 mL, 4.6 g, 25 mmol), and THF (100 mL) were added. The mixture was heated to reflux temperature by means of a heating mantle to start the Grignard reaction. While external heating was continued, a solution of 1,2-C2H4Br2 (0.6 mL, 1 g, 7 mmol) in THF (10 mL) was added dropwise with stirring over 1 h. Heating of the resulting greenish slurry was continued for a further 4 h before the mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature overnight. The resulting turbid solution was treated with a saturated aqueous solution of NaHCO3 (50 mL). After stirring for 30 min, the two liquid phases were separated and the aqueous phase was washed with n-hexane (2 \u00d7 30 mL) and ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 30 mL). The combined organic phases were washed with H2O (50 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and filtered, and the filtrate was evaporated under vacuum. The solid residue was heated to 150 \u00b0C (silicone oil bath) in an oil-pump vacuum to remove impurities by sublimation and to obtain 4 as a colorless solid. Yield: 1.49 g (83%).
