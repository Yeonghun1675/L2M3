This compound is isostructural to the zinc(II) analogue Zn  2  L  1  described in our previous work. The asymmetric unit contains two crystallographically independent Cd2+ ions (a), both adopting a hexacoordinated geometry. The azamacrocycle acts as a tridentate N-donor ligand for one Cd atom. The two Cd are located in close proximity to each other (Cd1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cd2:3.790(9) \u00c5) and are interconnected through three bridging benzenecarboxylate linkers coming from three different ligands. Three oxygen atoms from the carboxylate groups and the fac-N3 donor atoms surround the Cd1 atom, which then displays a distorted octahedral geometry. The deviation from the ideal geometry is caused by steric constraints imposed by the macrocycle as evidenced by the values of 2.417(5) \u00c5 for the Cd1-N1 bond and 76.3(2)\u00b0 for the N1-Cd1-N1 angle. The distortion of the coordination polyhedron can be assigned to a large displacement of Cd1 from the N3-mean plane. As a matter of fact, the distances between Cd1 atom and centroids of the two planes, defined by the three nitrogen atoms and the three O3(2) atoms, are 1.701 and 0.953 \u00c5 respectively. It has to be noticed that Cd1-N1 and Cd1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cd2 distances are significantly higher than those observed for the isostructural Zn  2  L  1  (2.201 and 3.517 \u00c5, respectively), which is in accordance with the larger ionic radius of Cd2+ vs Zn2+. Cd2 atom adopts a slightly distorted trigonal prism geometry and is coordinated to three oxygen atoms from the bridging carboxylate groups and three water molecules, the latter having an individual occupancy of 1/3. Overall, the stability of the architecture is supported by the rigidity of this dinuclear cadmium cluster.\n\nThus, a secondary building unit (SBU) for Cd  2  L  1  is composed of two cadmium ions, one N3-cyclic chelate unit, three carboxylates, and three water molecules, giving the formula [Cd2(COO)3(fac-N3)(H2O)3]. Each SBU can be seen as a 6-connected node, and the framework can be described as a bcs net according to a topological approach (b). The view along the unit cell axis reveals regular voids due to square-shaped channel apertures of 7.5 \u00c5 (c,d). Owing to the cubic symmetry of the framework, the voids are connected to each other to form a 3D network of channels. According to calculation with the SOLV PLATON program, the structure has an overall solvent accessible void volume of 46.1% (8797 \u00c53), and the pore volume was estimated to 0.380 cm3 g-1.\n\nStructural Studies of CdL2 \n\nFollowing the isoreticular approach, H  3  L  2  was designed by insertion of alkyne spacers between the aryl moieties and the TACN scaffold. This new ligand was expected to behave similarly to H  3  L  1  and to form isoreticular nets with larger pore apertures and a higher porosity. To our surprise, a new material presenting a different topology and possessing metallic nodes with an original coordination scheme was obtained. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of CdL  2  revealed that this MOF crystallizes in a monoclinic crystal system with space group C2/c and cell parameters of a = 20.9966(15) \u00c5, b = 18.9165(14) \u00c5, c = 29.059(2) \u00c5, and \u03b2 = 92.303(3)\u00b0. Only one ligand molecule and one cadmium atom form the asymmetric unit. The overall structure can be described as a pair of identical nets, which are mutually interwoven to form a doubly interpenetrated framework (b,c).\n\nDespite interpenetration, CdL  2  is highly porous and displays a solvent accessible volume of 54.7% (6308 \u00c53) and an accessible pore volume estimated to 0.633 cm3 g-1. These values outperform those of the non-interpenetrated Cd  2  L  1 . The view along the c axis reveals square open channels with apertures between 8.0 and 11.5 \u00c5 for the smallest and largest one, respectively (b,c and S8). Furthermore, the space-filling model clearly shows that the pore accessibility is not restricted (d).\n\nTGA Analysis\n\nThermal stabilities of the two materials were studied by TGA between 25 and 1000 \u00b0C (Figure S4). Values of the weight loss and those of the residues enable us to confirm the composition of the solids suggested from the elemental analysis, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), and X-ray data. Crystals of Cd  2  L  1  and CdL  2  were analyzed after thorough exchange of the solvent used for their synthesis (DMF) by THF and drying under a vacuum at room temperature for 48 h. Thermal behavior of both compounds shows a small weight loss (3%) around 400-420 K, which can be due to the loss of residual solvent or water molecules adsorbed in the pores. After a plateau until 570 K, a dramatic weight loss is observed between 600 and 780 K that corresponds to decomposition of the networks leading to the formation of CdO. The residual weights of each sample (Cd  2  L  1 : 30.5%; CdL  2 : 17.5%) are in good agreement with the expected values (Cd  2  L  1 : 29.8%; CdL  2 : 17.1%). Therefore, the frameworks show a similar thermal stability despite their different structures.\n\nAdsorption Properties\n\nThe porosity of the two materials was evaluated by recording N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K (Figure S12). Before analysis, DMF-soaked samples were activated under reduced pressure as described above. The absence of residual solvent trapped in the pores was checked by 1H NMR spectroscopy after the decomposition of both samples in acidic media (Figure S3). The permanent porosity of the solids was confirmed by the typical type-I shape of adsorption isotherms, characteristic of microporous solids with a nitrogen uptake of 163 and 97 cm3 g-1 at saturation, respectively for Cd  2  L  1  and CdL  2 . The BET surface areas were calculated to 625 and 343 m2 g-1, and the Langmuir surface areas were 730 and 414 m2 g-1, respectively. Since the materials are exclusively microporous, the single data point at relative pressure close to 0.95 gave microporous volumes equal to 0.253 and 0.150 cm3 g-1. The higher porosity of Cd  2  L  1  compared with CdL  2  shows a discrepancy with the solvent accessible volume calculated from the single crystal X-ray data and gives evidence of a partial collapse of the framework during desolvation for the interpenetrated CdL  2  as shown by PXRD analyses (see supra). Hence, Cd  2  L  1  is a more opened framework than CdL  2 . These values are in the same range (350-800 m2 g-1) as those obtained with other MOFs based on cyclam, cyclen, or other polyazacycloalkane, but significantly smaller than those of the previously described Zn  2  L  1  (1100 m2 g-1) which is isostructural to Cd  2  L  1 . A mean pore size diameter was calculated using the Horvath-Kawazoe method that gave a value around 8 \u00c5 for both solids (Figure S13) in agreement with the two crystal structures.\n\nFor CdL  2 , the isotherm displays a type-I morphology and the progressive pore-filling is observed with saturation profile nearly reached for 1 atm pressure. In addition, the CO2 isotherm displays a small hysteresis loop. The adsorption capacity at 1 atm (99 cm3 g-1) and the calculated Langmuir surface area (408 m2 g-1) are very close to values found from N2 uptake (97 cm3 g-1 and 414 m2 g-1, respectively). Cd  2  L  1  exhibits a similar isotherm of CO2 at 195 K, but the gas uptake at 1 atm is significantly lower (66 cm3 g-1) and the Langmuir surface is only 348 m2 g-1. It has to be noted that the initial slope in the low-pressure range is more pronounced, indicating a higher affinity for CO2 than CdL  2 .\n\nAs shown in , both materials show a significant CO2 and moderate CH4 uptake, and an overall low affinity for CO and N2, with values of N2 adsorption equal to 1.6 cm3 g-1 and 1.0 cm3 g-1 and CO uptake close to 1.0 cm3 g-1 and 3.0 cm3 g-1 for Cd  2  L  1  and CdL  2  respectively. CdL  2  adsorbs 26.7 cm3 g-1 (5.2% w/w) of CO2 at 1 atm, whereas the uptake for Cd  2  L  1  is 42.9 cm3 g-1 (8.4% w/w). No distinct plateau was observed for both isotherms in the 0-1 atm pressure range, indicating that the samples can adsorb a greater volume of CO2 at higher pressure or lower temperatures. The difference in CO2 capacity at 1 atm between these materials is in part ascribed to a partial collapse of the framework of the desolvated CdL  2  that limits the accessibility of the porosity.",
