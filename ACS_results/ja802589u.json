Taking into account the volumes of the molecules of 67.2 and 122 \u00c53 for methanol and acetone, respectively, we calculate an occupied value of 340 \u00c53 per unit cell, which is close to the full loading of the large channels indicating that the guest stabilization is remarkable and the nanochannel capacity is the limiting factor. In the case of benzene the lower loading of 1.1 molecules per unit cell at P/P 0 = 0.95, which corresponds to an occupied volume of 37% with respect to that of CO2, suggests a looser interaction of the apolar benzene molecules with the framework.\n\nThe densities in the liquid phase, for both methanol and acetone, are 0.79 g cm-3 ", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "compound 1", "symbol": "1",
