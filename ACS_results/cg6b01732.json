The layers are built from [Cu4OH2] moieties, where the CuII atoms form a rhomb, with the two hydroxy groups located at the center of each triangle (a) defined by the sides and the short diagonal. These hydroxy units are not coplanar and appear one above and one below the plane defined by the four CuII atoms. The two CuII atoms at the short diagonal (Cu-Cu distance = 2.868 \u00c5) are connected through this double hydroxy bridge and complete their pseudosquare planar coordination geometry with two carboxylate groups from two different calix units. These carboxylate groups show a syn-syn geometry and bridge the CuII atoms in the short diagonal to the CuII atoms in the long diagonal, displaying a syn-syn coordination mode (Cu-Cu distance = 3.296 \u00c5). The CuII atoms in the long diagonal complete their distorted trigonal bipyramid geometry with one oxygen atom of a terminal carboxylate group from an additional calix ligand and another oxygen atom of one carboxylic group from a fourth calix linker. In this way, each [Cu4OH2] is connected to eight different calix units, four above and four below the plane defined by the short diagonal copper centers (b).
