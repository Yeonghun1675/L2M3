The solvated nitrate ions, as seen\nin <bold>1</bold> with perturbed symmetry, corresponding to the nitrates\nin complexes <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold> advance them to an\nextended structure in such a way that they bind in chelating bidentate\nmode to the same metal center and at the same time to the adjacent\nmetal centers in bridging mode. The overall activity of the nitrate\nion thus results in anion-assisted 2D structures for <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold> (Figures S13\u2013S16 in the ). The shortest inter- and intramolecular (M\u2013O) bonds\ndue to nitrate ions bonded to neighboring metal centers were observed\nin the ranges of 2.378(5)\u20132.410(6) (M = Cd, <bold>2</bold>)\nand 2.44(1)\u20132.67(1) (M = Hg, <bold>3</bold>). The structural\ncomplexities due to nitrate ions are found to be similar in <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold> and exhibit a close crystallographic\nresemblance. We considered all possible experimental factors and reasoned\nthat the structural complexities in <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold> were a result of the inherent activity of the nitrate ion, which\nis deeply related to solvation around it. The behavior of the nitrate\nions in <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold> could be rationalized in\nview of the fundamentals associated with nitrate chemistry. For instance,\nthe nitrate ion (NO<sub>3</sub>\n<sup>\u2013</sup>) in the gas phase\nis frequently encountered as a planar ion in <italic toggle=\"yes\">D</italic>\n<sub>3<italic toggle=\"yes\">h</italic>\n</sub> symmetry, with the negative charge uniformly\ndistributed on the three oxygen atoms. In polar solvents, however, the <italic toggle=\"yes\">D</italic>\n<sub>3<italic toggle=\"yes\">h</italic>\n</sub> symmetry of the nitrate ion is expected to be broken\nbecause of the nonsymmetric solvation environment and partially localizes\nthe negative charge. There is also evidence in which nitrate bonded\nto a metal ion in its complexes exhibits a reduction in the local\nsymmetry from <italic toggle=\"yes\">D</italic>\n<sub>3</sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">h</italic> to <italic toggle=\"yes\">C</italic>\n<sub>2<italic toggle=\"yes\">v</italic>\n</sub> symmetry. On the contrary, while working in aqueous or protic\nmedia, the nitrates usually act as charge-balancing counterions in\ntheir respective metal complexes. Considering the nature of the nitrate\nion in different environments, it is more likely that a nonsymmetrical\nsolvation environment of the anion in complex <bold>1</bold> adopts\na nonplanar feature and partially localizes the negative charge on\ntheir nonbonded end. The partially localized negative charge on nitrate\ninevitably allows it to act as a weak nucleophile (the anion becomes\na ligand), which, in turn, interacts with solvent molecules, as seen\nin the crystal structure of <bold>1</bold>. Apparently, the advances\nactivity of the anion can be visualized provided that the geometrical\npreferences and charge-accepting ability of a metal ion allow it to\nproceed. On the basis of comparable experimental conditions and structural\ninformation obtained for complexes <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>3</bold>, the extended coordination of nitrate in <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold> may be anticipated because of the relativistic effect. As relativistic effects become significant for\nthe heaviest ions, the relativistic stabilization of the d and s orbitals\nof the heaviest ions enhances their charge-accepting ability relative\nto those of lighter ions in the same group of the periodic table.\nBecause of the counterions bearing negative charges and the increased\ncharge-accepting properties of metal ions in <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold>, the structural characteristics are fundamentally different\ncompared to <bold>1</bold>. The overall nitrate ion activity in these\ncomplexes results in an extended 2D coordination structure. Definitely,\nthe role of external influences in the activity of the nitrate ion\ncannot be ignored because the nitrate ion in atmospheric and geochemical\nsciences is considered to be a photochemically active species and\nis believed to remain active in the dark. It is difficult to make any further comment on the exact nature\nof the symmetry breaking of the nitrate ion in the solution state\nexcept that complexes <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>3</bold> were prepared\nand crystallized from acetonitrile in comparable reaction conditions.\nIt is important to note that the extended bonding of the nitrate ion\nhas also been seen in a few of its metal complexes derived from silver(I),\ncadmium(II), and lead(II) nitrates either prepared or crystallized\nfrom acetonitrile and rationalized in terms of the coordination flexibility\nof the anion.\n</p>", "clean_text": "The influence of the solvent on metal-bonded nitrate is quite noteworthy because N-O and O-N-O bond lengths and bond angles respectively were observed in the ranges of 1.216(3)-1.282(2) \u00c5 and 117.6(2)-123(2)\u00b0. We believe that the observation of ONO2\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5CH3CN interactions is a positive indication of the perturbed symmetry of nitrate ions and suggests that complex 1 should remain active in the solution.

The M-N bonds of 2.001(18)-2.042 (17) \u00c5 (M = Zn, 1), 2.281(7)-2.304(5) \u00c5 (M = Cd, 2), and 2.18(1) \u00c5 (M = Hg, 3) predict an increase of the M-N bond upon moving from ZnII to CdII but a decrease upon continuing from CdII to HgII. On the other hand, the M-O bonds (for nitrate ion bonded to metal in a unidentate mode) range from 1.989(16)-2.017(17) \u00c5 (1) to 2.331(7) \u00c5 (2) to 2.57(1) \u00c5 (3). Similarly, the N-M-N angles in the complexes increases from 126.93(7)\u00b0 to 137.0(2)\u00b0 to 147.6(4)\u00b0 upon moving from 1 to 2 to 3, respectively. The solvated nitrate ions, as seen in 1 with perturbed symmetry, corresponding to the nitrates in complexes 2 and 3 advance them to an extended structure in such a way that they bind in chelating bidentate mode to the same metal center and at the same time to the adjacent metal centers in bridging mode. The overall activity of the nitrate ion thus results in anion-assisted 2D structures for 2 and 3 (Figures S13-S16 in the ). The shortest inter- and intramolecular (M-O) bonds due to nitrate ions bonded to neighboring metal centers were observed in the ranges of 2.378(5)-2.410(6) (M = Cd, 2) and 2.44(1)-2.67(1) (M = Hg, 3). The structural complexities due to nitrate ions are found to be similar in 2 and 3 and exhibit a close crystallographic resemblance. We considered all possible experimental factors and reasoned that the structural complexities in 2 and 3 were a result of the inherent activity of the nitrate ion, which is deeply related to solvation around it. The behavior of the nitrate ions in 2 and 3 could be rationalized in view of the fundamentals associated with nitrate chemistry. For instance, the nitrate ion (NO3 -) in the gas phase is frequently encountered as a planar ion in D 3h  symmetry, with the negative charge uniformly distributed on the three oxygen atoms. In polar solvents, however, the D 3h  symmetry of the nitrate ion is expected to be broken because of the nonsymmetric solvation environment and partially localizes the negative charge. There is also evidence in which nitrate bonded to a metal ion in its complexes exhibits a reduction in the local symmetry from D 3 h to C 2v  symmetry. On the contrary, while working in aqueous or protic media, the nitrates usually act as charge-balancing counterions in their respective metal complexes. Considering the nature of the nitrate ion in different environments, it is more likely that a nonsymmetrical solvation environment of the anion in complex 1 adopts a nonplanar feature and partially localizes the negative charge on their nonbonded end. The partially localized negative charge on nitrate inevitably allows it to act as a weak nucleophile (the anion becomes a ligand), which, in turn, interacts with solvent molecules, as seen in the crystal structure of 1. Apparently, the advances activity of the anion can be visualized provided that the geometrical preferences and charge-accepting ability of a metal ion allow it to proceed. On the basis of comparable experimental conditions and structural information obtained for complexes 1-3, the extended coordination of nitrate in 2 and 3 may be anticipated because of the relativistic effect. As relativistic effects become significant for the heaviest ions, the relativistic stabilization of the d and s orbitals of the heaviest ions enhances their charge-accepting ability relative to those of lighter ions in the same group of the periodic table. Because of the counterions bearing negative charges and the increased charge-accepting properties of metal ions in 2 and 3, the structural characteristics are fundamentally different compared to 1. The overall nitrate ion activity in these complexes results in an extended 2D coordination structure. Definitely, the role of external influences in the activity of the nitrate ion cannot be ignored because the nitrate ion in atmospheric and geochemical sciences is considered to be a photochemically active species and is believed to remain active in the dark. It is difficult to make any further comment on the exact nature of the symmetry breaking of the nitrate ion in the solution state except that complexes 1-3 were prepared and crystallized from acetonitrile in comparable reaction conditions. It is important to note that the extended bonding of the nitrate ion has also been seen in a few of its metal complexes derived from silver(I), cadmium(II), and lead(II) nitrates either prepared or crystallized from acetonitrile and rationalized in terms of the coordination flexibility of the anion.
