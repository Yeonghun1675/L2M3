Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) of 3 and 4 were studied under N2 flow (60 mL/min) at a heating rate of 1 \u00b0C min-1.

As shown in Figure b, 3a reversibly adsorbs and desorbs H2 at 77 K, a type-I adsorption behavior being observed. The H2 uptake at 20 bar is 0.78 wt %, which is comparable to the values found for some carbon materials. The Langmuir linear fitting of the H2 adsorption data affords a maximum uptake of 0.87 wt %. The adsorbed H2 density at 20 bar is 0.0326 g/cm3, with respect to the solvent-accessible volume calculated from single-crystal data, notably lower than those observed for other 3D layer-pillared framework materials with \u03b1-Po topology (). \n\nSorption studies show the activated 4a can adsorb 0.23 wt % H2 at 77 K and 1 bar, increasing to 0.57 wt % H2 at 20 bar (Figure b). These uptakes are comparable or superior to those observed for layered coordination frameworks under similar conditions. The absence of an absorption plateau before 20 bar shows further uptake can be expected at higher pressure. If H2 molecules are considered to be stored in both intralamellar tubular channels and interlamellar voids (total free volume 26.3%), then the adsorbed H2 density at 20 bar is half of the density of liquid H2 (0.0708 g cm-3).
