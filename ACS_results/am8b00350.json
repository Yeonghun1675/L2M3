For a H2O/Me2CO (1:3 by volume) solution containing Co-POM (0.3 \u03bcmol) and TEA (NEt3) (9 v/v %), light irradiation leads to considerable hydrogen evolution after 21 h. Control experiments revealed that changing any of these individual components in the reaction resulted in little or no hydrogen production (Table S2). When Zn-POM or K6P2W18O62 was used as a photocatalyst, no hydrogen was detected under the same experimental conditions. A mixture of K6P2W18O62 and Co(NO3)2 at the same concentration in the solution produced only a very low quantum yield of hydrogen compared to the aforementioned cobalt-based system.
