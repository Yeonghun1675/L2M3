It is interesting to note that the broadness of the partial DOS near the Fermi level for the oxygen atoms from carboxyl group is similar to that in DPTP-U1. The current result suggests that the overlapping of the 2p orbitals of oxygen atoms O(5) and O(6) from phosphonate with the f-orbitals of U(1,2) is greater with the orbital energy ranging from -3 to -2 eV than O(8) and O(14). These results demonstrate that the phosphonate group significantly contributes to the stability of DPTP-U2, which is consistent well with the findings from the bond populations of DPTP-U2 presented in .", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 27, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig5\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>5</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Total and selected partial densities of states of <bold>DPTP-U1</bold> (a) and <bold>DPTP-U2</bold> (b).</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr6\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2015-012666_0005.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 5  Total and selected partial densities of states of DPTP-U1 (a) and DPTP-U2 (b).
