The above luminescent phenomenon is presumably owing to the framework architecture of <bold>1</bold>, which is more rigid than that of <bold>1a</bold>. In the original crystal, abundant lattice water molecules fill the network, forming important weak forces, which not only stabilize the framework and enhance the rigid structure, but also affect the transfer of energy effectively from bpp to the metal center. Accordingly, some guest molecules are removed from the MOF when heated, undoubtedly decreasing the weak interactions. Therefore, the emission spectrum becomes weaker, and the main peak is shifted. Moreover, this compound exhibits blue-shift emission with large intensity enhancement compared with that of the free ligand.

The emission spectra are shown in Figure  (the test conditions are the same in compounds 1 and 1a: the excitation wave in both is 280 nm; the width of the slide in excitation and emission is 10 nm; the test voltage is 700 V and the scan speed is 240 nm/min). The emission spectrum for 1 shows a main peak at 350 nm and two shoulder peaks at 387 and 449 nm with \u03bbex =280 nm. The shoulder peak at 449 nm is probably due to ligand donation because a very weak, similar peak at 446 nm also appears for the free bpp ligand (\u03bbex =350 nm for bpp, the solid H2ADC ligand does not possess any luminiscence at room temperature). The main peak at 350 nm and another shoulder peak at 387 nm are blue-shifted relative to that of the pure bpp ligand and may be assigned to ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) bands because the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is presumably the \u03c0-bonding orbital from the pyridylic rings, and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is associated mainly with the Cd-O (carboxylate) \u03c3*-antibonding orbital, which is localized mostly on the metal centers.
