TJU-11 achieves the first ultrastable near-UV-excited broadband white-light emitter with a moderately high PLQE of 17.2%, owing to its unique cationic bromoplumbate chains stacked with high corrugation. DFT calculations indicate the broadband emissions originate from the Pb-Pb dimerization and Cl-Cl pairing in [Pb2X2]2+ (X = Cl/Br) layers. We believe that crystal engineering of these intrinsic, ultrastable lead halide photoemitters offers promising possibilities in the development of high-performance single-component white-light phosphors.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 27, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information is\navailable free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b05345\">10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b05345</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Experimental details\nand addition characterization as\nwell as crystallographic data (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b05345/suppl_file/cm8b05345_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>X-ray crystal details for TJU-10 (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b05345/suppl_file/cm8b05345_si_002.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>X-ray crystal\ndetails for TJU-11 (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b05345/suppl_file/cm8b05345_si_003.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b05345.
