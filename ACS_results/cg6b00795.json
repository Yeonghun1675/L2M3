The variable-temperature powder X-ray diffraction (VTPXRD) studies for both the frameworks reveal that crystallinity and overall framework integrity is maintained at least up to 150 \u00b0C (Figures S9 and S10, Supporting Information). In contrast, the TGA curves of 1  Cu  and 2  Cu  reveal a continuous loss of solvent molecules, starting from room temperature, without a plateau (Figure S17, Supporting Information) showing their limited thermal stability. Also, the VTPXRD data of the transmetalated frameworks show a complete loss of crystallinity above 50 \u00b0C (Figures S13 and S14, Supporting Information).\n\nGas Adsorption Studies\n\nThe porous and robust nature of 1 and 2, together with the presence of -NH2 functionalized channels and possibility of creating unsaturated metal center (UMC) in the SBU upon activation, satisfies the essential prerequisites for gas sorption studies. Activation of the samples could be achieved by dipping crystals of 1 or 2 in acetone for 5 days, followed by heating at 120 \u00b0C under a vacuum for 12 h to produce the guest-free frameworks 1' and 2', respectively. The activated frameworks were first subjected to N2 gas sorption measurements at 77 K up to a relative pressure of 1.0, which showed type-I behavior in both cases, suggesting their microporous nature (). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area for 1' and 2' were estimated as 300 and 340 m2/g, respectively. On the basis of N2 adsorption isotherms, the pore volumes of 1' and 2' were calculated to be 0.15 and 0.18 cm3/g, respectively, while the pore sizes are found to be 0.73 nm for 1' and 0.76 nm for 2' (Figure S18, Supporting Information). The superior N2 adsorption capacity in 2' is in full agreement with its larger opening of channels (vide supra). However, it is worth mentioning that compound 2' shows adsorption-desorption hysteresis in the relative pressure range 0.40-0.95. This behavior suggests that the adsorbed N2 is not immediately released on reducing the external pressure and may be trapped within the framework.\n\nWe next studied the H2 storage performances of the activated frameworks at 77 K up to the relative pressure of 1.0. As depicted in , the H2 sorption for 1' and 2' shows typical type-I behavior, where a steep uptake is realized at a low-pressure region, with gradual increase in the uptake amount upon rising pressure. Noticeably, the desorption curve does not follow the adsorption one and shows hysteresis for both the frameworks. The final adsorption amounts to be 0.27 wt % (29.85 cm3/g) for 1' and 0.54 wt % (60.22 cm3/g) for 2' ().\n\nThe -NH2 group decorated channels in these frameworks prompted us to explore their CO2 capture properties. The sorption isotherms of CO2 at 273 and 298 K for 1' and 2' are probed up to the relative pressure (p/p 0) of 1.0. As depicted in , the maximum CO2 uptake capacities at 273 and 298 K for 1' are 28.00 and 15.95 cm3/g, respectively, with small hysteresis, while those values for 2' are 54.03 and 38.54 cm3/g, respectively. It should be mentioned that although the adsorption-desorption experiments in 2' were conducted several times with fair consistency; the reproducibility for 1' was poor after two cycles.\n\nGas sorption studies on individual activated Cu-exchanged frameworks at 77 K show negligible N2 uptake (maximum 22.73 cm3/g for 1  Cu  ' and 38.83 cm3/g for 2  Cu  ') (Figure S31, Supporting Information), compared to their corresponding mother Zn(II) frameworks. Also, both the transmetalated frameworks do not exhibit any H2 sorption at 77 K or CO2 sorption at 273 K. The Cu-exchanged frameworks are unstable even at 75 \u00b0C, as evidenced from the VTPXRD patterns (Figures S13 and S14, Supporting Information). The TGA curves also reveal a continuous loss of solvent molecules, starting from room temperature, without a plateau (Figure S17, Supporting Information) showing their limited thermal stability. Exchange with other low boiling solvents like MeOH, Me2CO, CHCl3, or CH2Cl2, followed by activation under mild conditions, always led to amorphous materials as confirmed from PXRD measurements (Figures S32 and S33, Supporting Information).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "porosity": [{"probe": "", "value": "56.87", "unit": "%", "condition": "per
