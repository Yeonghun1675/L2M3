The only two phases present during each of the processes are the \u201cclosed\u201d starting material and the \u201copen\u201d final product: Bragg peaks only due to the phases shown in Table  are present and there is no evidence for any intermediate open states. Thus the pore opening occurs in a stepwise fashion, crystal by crystal, at least on the time-scale of the measurement we make. An alternative mechanism is that of dissolution followed by recrystallization in the presence of the new guest: although this has previously been seen for Group 12 metal coordination polymers that have anionic guests, for MIL-53(Fe), where the guest molecules are neutral, this process is rather unlikely since the material has established flexibility in the gas phase where no solvent is required, the decay and growth in solution crosses at \u223c50%, and the solid shows high stability in a range of organic solvents with no sign of dissolution. Figure a shows the case when a dilute aqueous solution containing a mixture of pyridine (5%) and 2,6-lutidine (5%) is added to MIL-53(Fe)[H<sub>2</sub>O]. A close examination of the EDXRD spectra shows that initially the Bragg peaks of both the MIL-53(Fe)[pyridine] and the MIL-53(Fe)[2,6-lutidine,H<sub>2</sub>O] phases replace those of the MIL-53(Fe)[H<sub>2</sub>O] starting phase before ultimately the peak positions of the MIL-53(Fe)[2,6-lutidine,H<sub>2</sub>O] material are the only ones present. Despite overlapping Bragg peaks of the three phases, integration of these representative reflections proved possible, and, as shown in Figure b, this allows the temporal evolution of the system to be traced, confirming the initial, simultaneous appearance of two phases. This also reveals that once the starting material is consumed, the MIL-53(Fe)[pyridine] then is replaced by solely MIL-53(Fe)[2,6-lutidine,H<sub>2</sub>O]. This assignment is based upon indexing the sets of Bragg peaks that are observed at each stage of reaction. To confirm that the final product contains 2,6-lutidine and not pyridine we performed two experiments: first, the solid product isolated after leaving MIL-53(Fe)[H<sub>2</sub>O] in a mixture of 50% pyridine-50% 2,6-lutidine overnight was washed with a large excess of water to release the guest molecules, and the resulting solution was examined by HPLC (Figure a), and second IR spectroscopy of the solid product (Figure b) was compared with the reference IR of both MIL-53(Fe)[pyridine] and MIL-53(Fe)[2,6-lutidine,H<sub>2</sub>O]. Both experiments unambiguously prove that the final product is MIL-53(Fe)[2,6-lutidine,H<sub>2</sub>O]. The final product is the most open form of the solid in which water molecules allow a hydrogen bonding interaction between the framework and the guest molecules. Thus although the MIL-53(Fe)[H<sub>2</sub>O] host phase takes up pyridine and 2,6-lutidine easily (in the former case displacing water), the pyridine is subsequently replaced by 2,6-lutidine with co-sorption of water. Similar separation behavior has been reported for layered double hydroxides in the presence of a solution of carboxylate anions: when exposed to a mixture of two anions the initial rapid uptake of both takes place before the sole product containing one anion is formed with expulsion of the other. Studies of the separation of both the gas phase and the liquid phase separation of xylene (and other aromatic) isomers by materials with the MIL-53 structure have recently been reported by other groups. For example, Alaerts et al. showed that MIL-53(Al) would preferentially bind <italic toggle=\"yes\">ortho</italic>-isomers of xylene, ethyltoluene, and so forth in liquid phase separations, and rationalized the selectivity as arising from strong interactions between methyl groups of the sorbates and carboxylate moieties in the pore corners. It is difficult to compare that case directly with the organics we have studied since there was no scope for hydrogen bonding and all of the isomers of xylene interacting with the host give the fully open form of the structure. Clearly the balance of host\u2212guest interactions stabilizing one phase over another is a subtle one, and guest\u2212guest interactions are also important to consider, and indeed the choice of framework metal, which is known to give different breathing properties.\n</p>", "clean_text": "Time-Resolved Diffraction Study of Sorption of Organics\n\nFigure  shows contour maps of in situ EDXRD data measured during the uptake (separately) of pyridine and 2,6-lutidine by MIL-53(Fe)[H2O]. The only two phases present during each of the processes are the \"closed\" starting material and the \"open\" final product: Bragg peaks only due to the phases shown in Table  are present and there is no evidence for any intermediate open states. Thus the pore opening occurs in a stepwise fashion, crystal by crystal, at least on the time-scale of the measurement we make. An alternative mechanism is that of dissolution followed by recrystallization in the presence of the new guest: although this has previously been seen for Group 12 metal coordination polymers that have anionic guests, for MIL-53(Fe), where the guest molecules are neutral, this process is rather unlikely since the material has established flexibility in the gas phase where no solvent is required, the decay and growth in solution crosses at ~50%, and the solid shows high stability in a range of organic solvents with no sign of dissolution. Figure a shows the case when a dilute aqueous solution containing a mixture of pyridine (5%) and 2,6-lutidine (5%) is added to MIL-53(Fe)[H2O]. A close examination of the EDXRD spectra shows that initially the Bragg peaks of both the MIL-53(Fe)[pyridine] and the MIL-53(Fe)[2,6-lutidine,H2O] phases replace those of the MIL-53(Fe)[H2O] starting phase before ultimately the peak positions of the MIL-53(Fe)[2,6-lutidine,H2O] material are the only ones present.
