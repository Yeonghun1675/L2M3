potential of tetrazolate-based ligands for forming metal\u2212organic frameworks of utility in\nhydrogen storage is demonstrated with the use of 1,4-benzeneditetrazolate (BDT<sup>2-</sup>) to generate a series\nof robust, microporous materials. Reaction of H<sub>2</sub>BDT with MnCl<sub>2</sub>\u00b74H<sub>2</sub>O and Mn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\u00b74H<sub>2</sub>O in <italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>-diethylformamide (DEF) produces the two-dimensional framework solids Mn<sub>3</sub>(BDT)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>(DEF)<sub>6</sub> (<bold>1</bold>) and Mn<sub>4</sub>(BDT)<sub>3</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(DEF)<sub>6</sub> (<bold>2</bold>), whereas reactions with hydrated salts of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, and Zn<sup>2+</sup> in a mixture of\nmethanol and DMF afford the porous, three-dimensional framework solids Zn<sub>3</sub>(BDT)<sub>3</sub>(DMF)<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>\u00b73.5CH<sub>3</sub>OH (<bold>3</bold>), Mn<sub>3</sub>(BDT)<sub>3</sub>(DMF)<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>\u00b73CH<sub>3</sub>OH\u00b72H<sub>2</sub>O\u00b7DMF (<bold>4</bold>), Mn<sub>2</sub>(BDT)Cl<sub>2</sub>(DMF)<sub>2</sub>\u00b71.5CH<sub>3</sub>OH\u00b7H<sub>2</sub>O (<bold>5</bold>), and Cu(BDT)(DMF)\u00b7CH<sub>3</sub>OH\u00b70.25DMF (<bold>6</bold>).

Reaction of H2BDT with MnCl2\u22c54H2O and Mn(NO3)2\u22c54H2O in N,N-diethylformamide (DEF) produces the two-dimensional framework solids Mn3(BDT)2Cl2(DEF)6 (1) and Mn4(BDT)3(NO3)2(DEF)6 (2), whereas reactions with hydrated salts of Mn2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ in a mixture of methanol and DMF afford the porous, three-dimensional framework solids Zn3(BDT)3(DMF)4(H2O)2\u22c53.5CH3OH (3), Mn3(BDT)3(DMF)4(H2O)2\u22c53CH3OH\u22c52H2O\u22c5DMF (4), Mn2(BDT)Cl2(DMF)2\u22c51.5CH3OH\u22c5H2O (5), and Cu(BDT)(DMF)\u22c5CH3OH\u22c50.25DMF (6). It is shown that the method for desolvating such compounds can dramatically influence the ensuing gas sorption properties. When subjected to a mild evacuation procedure, compounds 3-6 exhibit permanent porosity, with BET surface areas in the range 200-640 m2/g.

In addition, the desolvated form of 6 exhibits preferential adsorption of O2 over H2 and N2, showing promise for gas separation and purification applications. \n\nThe optimally desolvated materials also adsorb significant amounts of N2. Fitting the BET equation to the N2 adsorption isotherms (see Figure ) gave estimated surface areas of 640, 290, and 530 m2/g for Zn3(BDT)3, Mn3(BDT)3, and Mn2(BDT)Cl2, respectively. Notably, there is a large discrepancy between the adsorption properties of Zn3(BDT)3 and Mn3(BDT)3. Although the structures of 3 and 4 are isotypic, Zn3(BDT)3 adsorbs almost twice as much H2 as Mn3(BDT)3 at 880 Torr and, consistently, has more than double the surface area of Mn3(BDT)3. Because identical degassing procedures were used for both compounds, we believe, on the basis of the X-ray crystal structures, that the differences are due to their different response to desolvation. Significantly, the mean Mn-N bond distance in 4, 2.25(2) \u00c5, is significantly longer than the average Zn-N distance in 3, 2.15(3) \u00c5. The metal-ligand bonds are likely the weakest links in metal-organic frameworks, and breaking or reorganization of these bonds is what presumably leads to collapse upon desolvation. The longer, weaker Mn-N bonds are therefore probably responsible for the partial collapse, lower surface area, and reduced H2 adsorption capacity of Mn3(BDT)3.  \n\nThe gas sorption characteristics of Cu(BDT) were therefore also probed via low-temperature isotherm measurements.
