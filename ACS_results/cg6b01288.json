The DMF solution was pipetted away from the resultant pale yellow crystals and replaced with fresh DMF (1 mL) and placed in the oven at 100 \u00b0C for 1 h. This was repeated two more times. The DMF solution was then exchanged with dry CH2Cl2 over a week. The MOF was then activated by heating under vacuum at 120 \u00b0C for 5 h. Yield 45 mg (32%). Found: C, 45.68; H, 3.04; N, 3.01.
