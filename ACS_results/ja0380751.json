The measured \u03c7M T value at room temperature is ca. 3.51 cm3 mol-1 K, higher than the spin-only value of 1.88 cm3 mol-1 K for S = 3/2, owing to a significant orbital contribution of high-spin Co(II) in an octahedral surrounding, which increases smoothly upon cooling to ca. 35 K and reaches a maximum value of 6.27 cm3 mol-1 K, and then decreases sharply to 0.84 cm3 mol-1 K at 2 K (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The magnetic susceptibility in the range 100-300 K obeys the Curie-Weiss law (\u03c7m = C/(T - \u03b8)), with C = 3.095(8) cm3 mol-1 K and \u03b8 = +35.9(2) K. The C value corresponds to g = 2.57. The positive Weiss constant indicates a ferromagnetic coupling between Co(II) ions bridged by EO azide ligands. The same set of data above 100 K can be fitted well by a Fisher 1D chain (S = 3/2) model (H = -JS  i  S  j , intrachain coupling J), giving J = 12.4(1) cm-1 = 17.8 K, g = 2.542(3), and R = 2.7 \u00d7 10-5 (R = \u2211[(\u03c7 m T)obs - (\u03c7m T)calcd]2/\u2211[(\u03c7m T)obs]2). Using the mean-field expression for the Curie-Weiss temperature, \u03b8 = zJS(S + 1)/3k B (keeping the same H = -JS  i  S  j ), the magnetic interaction J/k B along the chain can be estimated to be ca. 14.4 K when S = 3/2 and average z = 2 for such an isolated chain. The J values (17.8 and 14.4 K) are in good agreement with the value of 20.7(3) K observed in an EO N3-bridged dimer, Co2(DMphen)2(N3)4 (2). \n\nAs shown in Figure , a hysteresis loop is observed clearly at 1.85 K when the field is less than 20 kOe, but gives a coercive field of ca. 1.0 kOe and a very small remnant magnetization of ca.  0.08 N\u03b2 mol-1. With the increase of field, several steps are observable at ca. 17, 26, and 46 kOe, which are clearly characterized by the peaks in the field dependence of dM/dH and \u03c7\u2018, \u03c7\u2018\u2018 (inset of Figure ), even to ca. 4.6 K.
