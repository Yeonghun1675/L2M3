After heating the crystals of 1 in boiling water for 3 days, no significant change of either the external appearance or the PXRD patterns was found for the sample. Moreover, under ambient condition, the unchanged PXRD patterns also confirm extreme framework stability of 1 after long time storage in air even up to 1 year ().\n\nThe sorption behaviors of methanol removed phase of 1' were investigated using CO2 as a probe molecule. It adsorbs CO2 of 27.6 (293 K) and 55.1 (195 K) cm3 (STP) g-1 at 760 Torr (), respectively. However, it does not exhibit the classically reversible type-I isotherms, but instead a noticeable hysteresis for CO2 desorption. The hysteresis can be attributed to the hindered escape due to the residual iodine ions in the channels. From the CO2 sorption isotherm at 195 K, a BET surface area of 131.6 m2 g-1 is estimated, which further confirms the permanent porosity. This value is understandably uncompetitive as compared to the high surface areas of 3D MMOFs, but it was comparable to some reported interdigitated structures. Moreover, the characteristic peaks of PXRD patterns of 1' keep their intensities and positions after the sorption experiment, which further confirms the stability of the porosity ().\n\nAs the iodine location in 1 was determined by single-crystal diffraction and the neutral iodine removal phase (1') can be easily obtained through crystal transformation, it provided us a precious chance to compare the influence of polyiodide anions on host-guest cooperative properties.

On the other hand, the lower conductivity of 1 can be partly attributed to the loose packing of I5 - or I7 - in 1 as indicated by the distance between adjacent polyiodide ions. Moreover, the positively charged framework and irregular \u03c0-electron walls may be disadvantageous for the effective charge transfer.
