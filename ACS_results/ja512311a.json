The sizes of the functional groups also varied. Bulky substituents, such as -OC7H7 and -C4H4, were chosen to study steric effects. Furthermore, the same functional group (e.g., -NH2) was applied at different positions of the linker (ortho-, R1, and meta-, R3, for linkers B and J, respectively) in order to study how the conformation of the linker was imparted by functional groups at these positions. This has been noted as critical for the design of MOFs with different topologies. Finally, we further explored the possibility of building the MOF-177 structure, with the qom net, using a variety of functional groups on one linker (e.g., linker K with -H, -NH2 and -C4H4 on each of the three peripheral benzoate units).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 29, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Functionalization of the\nMOF-177 Structure</title><p>A series\nof nine MOF-177-X structures, composed of only one type of linker,\nwere synthesized using the 10 functionalized BTB linkers, B\u2013K\nexcept for C (Figure ).
