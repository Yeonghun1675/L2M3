The atz- ligands link the Cd2 atoms through the symmetry-related N5 atoms of the \u03bc3-atz (mode II) ligands, affording along the ab plane a perfect kagome layer featuring vertex-sharing equilateral triangles with the Cd\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cd distance equal to 6.531(1) \u00c5 (Figure a,b). A pair of Cd1 atoms are connected to each other by three \u03bc4-atz- ligands, forming a [Cd2(\u03bc4-atz)3]3+ cluster with a Cd\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cd distance of 4.029(3) \u00c5. The neighboring perfect kagome layers are bridged by the [Cd2(\u03bc4-atz)3]3+ clusters to generate a 3D porous cationic framework whose hexagonal channels are filled by the disordered SO4 2- anions and water molecules (Figure a). The SO4 2- groups act as counterions and occupy the void of the channels to stabilize the lattice. The presence of SO4 2- anions in the channels of 3 is supported by the IR spectrum, which exhibits the IR bands at 1120 and 617 cm-1 for the asymmetric S-O stretching (\u03bd 3 ) and SO4 2-bending modes (\u03bd4), respectively. The amounts of the disordered guest water molecules can be proven by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).

As illustrated in Figure , Cd2 adopts a pseudo-octahedral coordination geometry that is formed by four nitrogen atoms from four atz ligands [Cd1\u2212N 2.314(4)\u22122.387(4) \u00c5], one oxygen atom from sulfate anion [Cd1\u2212O2 2.272(5) \u00c5], and one OH-group [Cd1\u2212O3 2.281(2) \u00c5]. The hydroxyl acts as a \u03bc<sub>3</sub>-bridge linking three equivalent Cd2 atoms, generating an equilateral triangle with Cd\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cd distances equal to 3.754(1) \u00c5. The Cd\u2212O2\u2212Cd angle is 110.72(13)\u00b0 and the OH<sup>\u2212</sup> group is displaced out of the Cd3 plane, which results in the formation of a non-coplanar [Cd<sub>3</sub>(\u03bc<sub>3</sub>-OH)] trimetric unit. The sulfate anion resides on a 3-fold axis, acting as an architectural truss to support the trimetric unit to form a stable [Cd<sub>3</sub>(\u03bc<sub>3</sub>-OH)(\u03bc<sub>3</sub>-SO<sub>4</sub>)] cluster. The cluster is surrounded by three identical \u03bc<sub>4</sub>-atz ligands, each of which sets up an N\u2212N bridge between two Cd2 ions via two neighboring nitrogen atoms (N2 and N3) from one tetrazole ring. The ligand is also bonded to Cd1 and Cd2 ion via N4 and N5 atom, respectively. Simultaneously, the neighboring Cd1 and Cd2 are linked through two neighboring nitrogen atoms of the other \u03bc<sub>3</sub>-atz(mode II) and \u03bc<sub>4</sub>-atz ligands, and hence constitutes a paddle-wheel. The shortest distance of Cd1<bold>\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7</bold>Cd2 distance is 4.062(1) \u00c5. Each Cd1 ion locates at the special position and adopts the octahedral coordination geometry with six N atoms from six atz<sup>\u2212</sup> ligands. The equatorial positions are occupied by four different but symmetry-related N4 atoms [Cd1\u2212N4 2.348(4) \u00c5] from four atz<sup>\u2212</sup> ligands, and the axial positions are occupied by two symmetry-related N8 atoms [Cd1\u2212N8 2.322(6) \u00c5] of the other two atz<sup>\u2212</sup> ligands. Thus, each Cd1 linked to four [Cd<sub>3</sub>(\u03bc<sub>3</sub>-OH)(\u03bc<sub>3</sub>-SO<sub>4</sub>)] clusters (Figure a), and each cluster is connected to three Cd1 centers, giving rise to a complicated 3D network. Taking the clusters as 3-connected nodes and the Cd1 centers as 4-connected nodes, the 3D network represents a (3,4)-connected topological 3D network. In the (3,4)-connected framework (Figure b), the ratio of 3-connected [Cd<sub>3</sub>(\u03bc<sub>3</sub>\u2212OH)(\u03bc<sub>3</sub>-SO<sub>4</sub>)] clusters to 4-connected Cd2 atoms is inversely proportional to their connectivity (i.e., 4:3). Therefore, the short (Schla\u0308fli) vertex symbol is (8<sup>3</sup>)<sub>4</sub>(8<sup>6</sup>)<sub>3</sub>. Among the known (3,4)-connected nets in coordination polymers, the typical examples are boracite, Pt<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, cubic-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, and the twisted boracite.

As illustrated in Figure , Cd2 adopts a pseudo-octahedral coordination geometry that is formed by four nitrogen atoms from four atz ligands [Cd1-N 2.314(4)-2.387(4) \u00c5], one oxygen atom from sulfate anion [Cd1-O2 2.272(5) \u00c5], and one OH-group [Cd1-O3 2.281(2) \u00c5]. The hydroxyl acts as a \u03bc3-bridge linking three equivalent Cd2 atoms, generating an equilateral triangle with Cd\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cd distances equal to 3.754(1) \u00c5. The Cd-O2-Cd angle is 110.72(13)\u00b0 and the OH- group is displaced out of the Cd3 plane, which results in the formation of a non-coplanar [Cd3(\u03bc3-OH)] trimetric unit. The sulfate anion resides on a 3-fold axis, acting as an architectural truss to support the trimetric unit to form a stable [Cd3(\u03bc3-OH)(\u03bc3-SO4)] cluster. The cluster is surrounded by three identical \u03bc4-atz ligands, each of which sets up an N-N bridge between two Cd2 ions via two neighboring nitrogen atoms (N2 and N3) from one tetrazole ring. The ligand is also bonded to Cd1 and Cd2 ion via N4 and N5 atom, respectively. Simultaneously, the neighboring Cd1 and Cd2 are linked through two neighboring nitrogen atoms of the other \u03bc3-atz(mode II) and \u03bc4-atz ligands, and hence constitutes a paddle-wheel. The shortest distance of Cd1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cd2 distance is 4.062(1) \u00c5. Each Cd1 ion locates at the special position and adopts the octahedral coordination geometry with six N atoms from six atz- ligands. The equatorial positions are occupied by four different but symmetry-related N4 atoms [Cd1-N4 2.348(4) \u00c5] from four atz- ligands, and the axial positions are occupied by two symmetry-related N8 atoms [Cd1-N8 2.322(6) \u00c5] of the other two atz- ligands. Thus, each Cd1 linked to four [Cd3(\u03bc3-OH)(\u03bc3-SO4)] clusters (Figure a), and each cluster is connected to three Cd1 centers, giving rise to a complicated 3D network. Taking the clusters as 3-connected nodes and the Cd1 centers as 4-connected nodes, the 3D network represents a (3,4)-connected topological 3D network. In the (3,4)-connected framework (Figure b), the ratio of 3-connected [Cd3(\u03bc3-OH)(\u03bc3-SO4)] clusters to 4-connected Cd2 atoms is inversely proportional to their connectivity (i.e., 4:3). Therefore, the short (Schla\u0308fli) vertex symbol is (83)4(86)3. Among the known (3,4)-connected nets in coordination polymers, the typical examples are boracite, Pt3O4, cubic-C3N4, and the twisted boracite. Recently, another two new (3,4)-connected nets with (4 122)2(42 124) and (62 10)2(64 102) Schla\u0308fli symbol were reported by Moorthy's and Hong's group, respectively.

In a typical experiment, the addition of a slight excess of NaNO3 (aq) to a suspension of crystalline {[Cd5(atz)9]Cl} n \u22c52nH2O in water at room temperature showed that the NO3 - anions begin to exchange with Cl- anions after 3 h, as evidenced by the infrared data (see , Figure S6). Here, the characteristic bands at 1791, 1385, 835, and 726 cm-1 for free NO3 - begin to appear. On the basis of IR data and elemental microanalysis, it is estimated that after 12 h nearly 85% exchange has occurred. Inspection of the crystals under an optical microscope during the exchange process revealed that the crystals could still keep the original shape after ion exchange. Furthermore, they still give a sharp X-ray powder diffraction pattern coinciding with that of the original unexchanged material. Analogous ion exchange of NO3 - was achieved for compound 3; the intense NO3 - bands at 1790, 1382, 833, and 724 cm-1 for free NO3 - begin to appear as those intense bands at 1120 and 617 cm-1 due to free SO4 2- beginning to disappear.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 33, "type": "text", "classification": ["property"], "content": "<title>Photoluminescent Properties</title><p>The solid-state luminescent properties of the compounds <bold>1</bold>\u2212<bold>5</bold> were investigated at room temperature.
