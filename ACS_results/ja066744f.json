It is the first metal-TCNE magnet with direct bonding between metal ion and [TCNE]\u22c5- whose structure has been determined, and it possesses a novel planar \u03bc4-[TCNE]\u22c5- spin coupling unit bonded to four FeII's, with an axial pair of MeCNs. The [FeIIICl4]- anion occupies sites between the [FeII(TCNE\u22c5-)(NCMe)2]+ layers. [Fe(TCNE)(NCMe)2][FeCl4] has a coercive field of 1730 Oe and a remnant magnetization of 7500 emuK/mol at 50 K. \n\nThe 5 to 300 K temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility, \u03c7, of [Fe(TCNE)(NCMe)2][FeCl4] is reported as \u03c7T(T) and \u03c7-1(T) [\u221d (T - \u03b8)] (Figure ). \u03c7T at 300 K has a value of 10.90 emuK/mol that significantly exceeds 7.75 emuK/mol expected for the sum of the spin-only values for [TCNE]\u22c5- and high-spin Fe(II) and Fe(III) indicative of strong spin coupling. In accord with the strong coupling, \u03c7T(T) increases gradually with decreasing temperature and rises significantly at ~110 K and reaches 530 emuK/mol at 75 K, prior to decreasing toward 0 at low temperature. \u03c7-1(T) is linear between 110 and 190 K with \u03b8 ~ 100 K, indicative of significant short-range ferromagnetic coupling. Above 200 K, the slope, d\u03c7-1(T)/dT, decreases, characteristic of a ferrimagnet.  \n\nThe field-dependent magnetization, M(H), is characteristic of magnetic ordering and exhibits hysteretic behavior with a coercive field, H cr, of 1730 Oe and remanant magnetization, M r, of 7500 emuK/mol at 50 K (Figure ).
