Herein we report the design and synthesis\nof a new type of RE-free, blue-excitable yellow phosphor, obtained\nby combining a strongly emissive molecular fluorophore with a bandgap\nmodulating co-ligand, in a three-dimensional metal organic framework.\n[Zn<sub>6</sub>(btc)<sub>4</sub>(tppe)<sub>2</sub>(DMA)<sub>2</sub>] (btc = benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate, tppe = 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(4-(pyridin-4-yl)phenyl)ethene,\nDMA = dimethylacetamide) crystallizes in a new structure type and\nemits bright yellow light when excited by a blue light source. It\npossesses the highest internal quantum yield among all RE-free, blue-excitable\nyellow phosphors reported to date, with a value as high as 90.7% (\u03bb<sub>ex</sub> = 400 nm). In addition to its high internal quantum yield,\nthe new yellow phosphor also demonstrates high external quantum yield,\nluminescent and moisture stability, solution processability, and color\ntunability, making it a promising material for use in phosphor conversion\nWLEDs.</p><p>Upon standing in air for a period of time (a few days), <bold>1</bold> was slowly converted to <bold>1a</bold>, in which most or\nall DMA\nmolecules are replaced by water, as confirmed by the single crystal\ndata and elemental analysis (see , Sections\nS1, S4). The optical absorption and PL excitation and emission spectra\nof powder samples of both tppe and <bold>1a</bold> were measured at\nroom temperature (Figure B,C). The estimated\nHOMO\u2013LUMO and VB\u2013CB (VB: valence band, CB: conduction\nband) energy gaps of tppe and <bold>1a</bold> are \u223c2.69 and\n\u223c2.38 eV, respectively, based on their optical absorption spectra\ncollected at room temperature (Figure B).\nThe decrease in the bandgap of <bold>1a</bold> is a result of btc\nmodulation and is consistent with the orbital energies obtained by\nDFT calculations performed on the individual ligands (tppe and btc)\nand a fragment of MOF (Figures A and ). These values are also in full accordance\nwith their emission energies. The free tppe ligand emits green light\n(500 nm) when excited at 360\u2013400 nm, which is due to intramolecular\n\u03c0\u2013\u03c0* transitions, while free H<sub>3</sub>btc does\nnot emit in visible region. Upon excitation at the same wavelength\n(400 nm), compound <bold>1a</bold> emits yellow light with an emission\nmaximum at \u223c540 nm and an IQY of 90.7%, a significant increase\ncompared to 57.2% for free tppe (Table ).\nTo the best of our knowledge, this value is the highest among all\nRE-free and blue-excitable yellow phosphors reported to date. While\nthe highest emission intensity of <bold>1a</bold> is achieved at an\nexcitation wavelength of 350 nm (monitored at \u03bb<sub>em</sub> = 540 nm, Figure C), it is worth noting\nthat the excitation intensity is relatively flat from its max to \u223c450\nnm, indicating the material can be excited effectively by a range\nof light sources, including blue light. Indeed, the IQY obtained at\nexcitation wavelengths deeper into the visible region is 72.9, 67.9\nand 63.9%, at 420, 440, and 450 nm, respectively. The large emission\nred-shift of <bold>1a</bold> compared to tppe is a result of incorporating\nbtc as a bandgap modulator, which leads to a decrease in the bandgap\nenergy and corresponding emission (Figures A,C and ). Based on a number\nof recent reports on similar MOF systems, the strong PL enhancement\nof <bold>1a</bold> can be attributed to the immobilization of tppe\nin the MOF backbone which effectively reduces nonradiative decay due\nto molecular vibration and rotation. The external QYs (EQY, defined as the ratio of the\nnumber of photons emitted to the number of incident photons) of <bold>1a</bold> were measured on a QE2000 system (see  for details) and are listed in Table . At 400, 415, 440, and 455 nm, they account for 96%, 95.3%, 91.4%\nand 84.7% of the IQY values, respectively, indicating high absorption\nefficiency of the compound (nearly 100%).</p><p>To further verify\nthe suitability of the material for potential\nuse in PC-WLEDs, stability measurements were carried out on <bold>1a</bold> and an assembly of <bold>1a</bold> with Teflon film (<bold>TF@1a</bold>, see ).

Herein we report the design and synthesis of a new type of RE-free, blue-excitable yellow phosphor, obtained by combining a strongly emissive molecular fluorophore with a bandgap modulating co-ligand, in a three-dimensional metal organic framework. [Zn6(btc)4(tppe)2(DMA)2] (btc = benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate, tppe = 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(4-(pyridin-4-yl)phenyl)ethene, DMA = dimethylacetamide) crystallizes in a new structure type and emits bright yellow light when excited by a blue light source. It possesses the highest internal quantum yield among all RE-free, blue-excitable yellow phosphors reported to date, with a value as high as 90.7% (\u03bbex = 400 nm). In addition to its high internal quantum yield, the new yellow phosphor also demonstrates high external quantum yield, luminescent and moisture stability, solution processability, and color tunability, making it a promising material for use in phosphor conversion WLEDs.\n\nUpon standing in air for a period of time (a few days), 1 was slowly converted to 1a, in which most or all DMA molecules are replaced by water, as confirmed by the single crystal data and elemental analysis (see , Sections S1, S4). The optical absorption and PL excitation and emission spectra of powder samples of both tppe and 1a were measured at room temperature (Figure B,C). The estimated HOMO-LUMO and VB-CB (VB: valence band, CB: conduction band) energy gaps of tppe and 1a are ~2.69 and ~2.38 eV, respectively, based on their optical absorption spectra collected at room temperature (Figure B). The decrease in the bandgap of 1a is a result of btc modulation and is consistent with the orbital energies obtained by DFT calculations performed on the individual ligands (tppe and btc) and a fragment of MOF (Figures A and ). These values are also in full accordance with their emission energies. The free tppe ligand emits green light (500 nm) when excited at 360-400 nm, which is due to intramolecular \u03c0-\u03c0* transitions, while free H3btc does not emit in visible region. Upon excitation at the same wavelength (400 nm), compound 1a emits yellow light with an emission maximum at ~540 nm and an IQY of 90.7%, a significant increase compared to 57.2% for free tppe (Table ). To the best of our knowledge, this value is the highest among all RE-free and blue-excitable yellow phosphors reported to date. While the highest emission intensity of 1a is achieved at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm (monitored at \u03bbem = 540 nm, Figure C), it is worth noting that the excitation intensity is relatively flat from its max to ~450 nm, indicating the material can be excited effectively by a range of light sources, including blue light. Indeed, the IQY obtained at excitation wavelengths deeper into the visible region is 72.9, 67.9 and 63.9%, at 420, 440, and 450 nm, respectively. The large emission red-shift of 1a compared to tppe is a result of incorporating btc as a bandgap modulator, which leads to a decrease in the bandgap energy and corresponding emission (Figures A,C and ). Based on a number of recent reports on similar MOF systems, the strong PL enhancement of 1a can be attributed to the immobilization of tppe in the MOF backbone which effectively reduces nonradiative decay due to molecular vibration and rotation. The external QYs (EQY, defined as the ratio of the number of photons emitted to the number of incident photons) of 1a were measured on a QE2000 system (see  for details) and are listed in Table . At 400, 415, 440, and 455 nm, they account for 96%, 95.3%, 91.4% and 84.7% of the IQY values, respectively, indicating high absorption efficiency of the compound (nearly 100%).\n\nTo further verify the suitability of the material for potential use in PC-WLEDs, stability measurements were carried out on 1a and an assembly of 1a with Teflon film (TF@1a, see ). Compound 1a exhibits high moisture stability at room temperature; a sample of 1a was left sitting in air for a period >3 months, after which time a PXRD measurement verified the material's structural integrity (). At excitation wavelength of 455 nm, the IQY of 1a was measured as 58.1% originally, and 57.6% after being exposed to air for 3 months, with <1% decrease over this long period of time. Only a small decrease in the emission intensity was observed upon continuous irradiation of the sample under a UV lamp (365 nm) for 7 days (). The thermal stability of 1a and TF@1a was examined at various temperatures. Thermogravimetric analysis () shows that 1a undergoes continuous weight loss from room temperature to ~220 \u00b0C, then remains stable until ~300 \u00b0C, at which point the framework starts to decompose. PXRD and PL data were collected after TF@1a was heated at different temperatures for a given period of time (e.g., 12 h), which show the material is both thermally and optically stable up to 180 \u00b0C (). Decreases in PL intensity and IQY are <3.5% and 6.7%, respectively, upon heating at 150 \u00b0C for 12 h (Table ).\n\nThe authors declare no competing financial interest.\n\nReferences\n\nCrystal data
