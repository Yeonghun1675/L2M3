However, upon standing for a few days in the presence of the mother solution the deep blue crystals of 2Cu disappeared leaving only pale blue crystals of 1Cu. Therefore, under the selected conditions, 1Cu was the thermodynamically stable product (showing indeed a lower solubility) whose formation is preceded by the nucleation of crystals of 2Cu, the kinetically favored species. This sequence of events follows Ostwald's rule of stages which allows the possibility that different crystalline species (e.g., polymorphs, or different hydrates or solvates) can nucleate sequentially starting from the least stable one that in turn transforms into a thermodynamically more stable species and so on until only the most stable species survive owing to its lowest solubility. Supersaturation conditions that provoke at first the nucleation of 2Cu followed by the more stable 1Cu (but see later for the opposite 1Cu to 2Cu transformation) are mirrored in the large number of small single crystals of 2Cu while crystals of 1Cu are generally heavily twinned rosettes. Nucleation of 2Cu occurs within minutes after mixing of reactants (e.g., CuCl2 4.0 mM and bpp 12.0 mM), while the subsequent solvent-mediated transformation into 1Cu requires several days to go to completion as monitored by means of time lapse optical microscopy (). This behavior is highly reproducible and has been checked several times. In the context of MOFs chemistry several other systems displayed crystal-to-crystal transformations.
