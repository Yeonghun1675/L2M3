The solvothermal in situ reduction of azpy to bphy is further proven to be an effective strategy for the crystal engineering of coordination polymers. As observed in the diverse interpenetration/packing structures and supramolecular interactions of these low-dimensional coordination frameworks, bphy represents a unique ligand for the construction of flexible coordination networks.
