The obtained results reveal that TPPS molecules in the interlayer spacing remain photoactive; however, intercalated TPPS molecules more intimately interact with the LRH hydroxide layers than with the LDH hydroxide layers. The enhanced interaction is also documented by the considerably increased Q(0,1) emission band over the Q(0,0) band and by fast fluorescence decays that are best characterized by two lifetimes: 0.6 (86%) and 2.5 ns (14%).
