Because the LS iron(II) complexes are\ndiamagnetic, these low-temperature nonzero susceptibilities and effective\nmagnetic moments can be explained by the incomplete SCO and, hence,\nthe occurrence of the HS iron(II) fraction.

For both compounds, the magnetic susceptibility is monotonically decreasing upon heating and reaching its minimum at ca. 210 K. Afterward, an increase of the molar susceptibility is observed, which indicates the spin transition in 1 and 2. The effective magnetic moments at lower temperature (~50 K) reach plateaus of 1.96 \u03bcB for 1 and 1.73 \u03bcB for 2. Because the LS iron(II) complexes are diamagnetic, these low-temperature nonzero susceptibilities and effective magnetic moments can be explained by the incomplete SCO and, hence, the occurrence of the HS iron(II) fraction. Similar incomplete SCOs were reported for two other 1D chains containing the abpt ligand, namely, [Fe(abpt)2(\u03bc-tcpd)] n  (tcpd2- = (C[C(CN)2]3)2-) and [Fe(abpt)2(\u03bc-Ni(CN)4)] n , in which the residual HS fractions were 30% and 13%, respectively. Upon heating, the gradual increase of the effective magnetic moments is observed above ca. 200 K and the final values of \u03bceff are 5.10 \u03bcB for 1 and 5.01 \u03bcB for 2 at T = 400 K. The theoretical (spin-only) HS value of the effective magnetic moment for S = 2 is 4.90 \u03bcB (g = 2.0), but usually iron(II) has a g factor close to the value of 2.2, which would result in \u03bceff = 5.39 \u03bcB. Thus, we might presume that, even at such a high temperature, the SCO is not completed. It is worth mentioning that this magnetic behavior was reproducible also after several cycles of heating and cooling and also for different batches of compounds 1 and 2. In order to quantitatively describe the SCO behavior of the compounds under study, an Ising-like model was used. The three free parameters define the HS mole fraction x'HS as a function of the temperature, and they are as follows: \u0394 = energy difference between the HS and LS states; \u03b3 = cooperativness; r eff = effective degeneracy ratio between the HS and LS states. In the next step, the molar susceptibility is calculated as \u03c7mol = (x\"HS + x rHS)\u03c7HS + (1 - x\"HS - x rHS)\u03c7LS, where x rHS is the mole fraction of the residual HS state observed at low temperature and x\"HS is the rescaled HS fraction calculated from an Ising-like model as x\"HS = x'HS(1 - x rHS). The total HS mole fraction x HS is then equal to x HS = x\"HS + x rHS and is shown in Figure . The molar susceptibility of the HS state \u03c7HS was calculated using the Curie-Weiss equation, and \u03c7LS is equal to zero. Finally, the parameters \u0394, \u03b3, r eff, x rHS, g HS, and \u0398HS were varied during the fitting procedure. The resulting parameters were g HS = 2.25, \u0398HS = -2.5 K, x rHS = 14%, \u0394 = 1287 K, r eff = 79, and \u03b3 = 218 K for 1 and g HS = 2.22, \u0398HS = -2.7 K, x rHS = 11%, \u0394 = 1640 K, r eff = 166, and \u03b3 = 234 K for 2. The fitted g factors reveal the expected values for HS octahedral iron(II), and negative Weiss constants reflect the zero-field splitting of residual HS iron(II) centers and their possible intrachain interactions mediated by bridging metallocyanates. The calculated enthalpy and entropy of spin transition are \u0394H = 10.7 kJ mol-1 and \u0394S = 36.3 J K-1 mol-1 for 1 and \u0394H = 13.6 kJ mol-1 and \u0394S = 42.5 J K-1 mol-1 for 2. These parameters adopt typical values for iron(II) SCO compounds. Estimated critical temperatures (T c) based on the condition that x HS = 0.5 are 300 K for 1 and 325 K for 2. With the aim of more deeply understanding the SCO development in this class of coordination polymers, the transmission 57Fe Mo\u0308ssbauer spectra were collected at different temperatures. In order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and to simplify the analysis by suppressing the absorption of the nitroprusside anion, an isotopically enriched sample, [57Fe(abpt)2(\u03bc-Fe(CN)5(NO))] n  (1'), was used. First, the spectrum of 1' measured at 25 K consists of four doublets with parameters of \u03b41 = -0.20 mm s-1, \u0394E  Q, 1  = 1.68 mm s-1, \u03b42 = 0.52 mm s-1, \u0394E  Q, 2  = 0.48 mm s-1, \u03b43 = 1.13 mm s-1, \u0394E  Q, 3  = 3.74 mm s-1, and \u03b44 = 1.22 mm s-1, \u0394E  Q, 4  = 3.04 mm s-1 (Figure ). The first doublet may be assigned to LS iron(II) of pentacyanidonitrosylferrate. The second doublet corresponds to [Fe(abpt)2]2+ in the LS state. Finally, the third and fourth doublets correspond to [Fe(abpt)2]2+ in the HS state. The areas of the absorption peaks are in the ratio A 1:A 2:A 3:A 4 = 3.6:72:7.4:17 and, hence, x HS = (A 3 + A 4)/(A 2 + A 3 + A 4), which results in x HS \u00d7 100% = 25%. The next spectrum was measured at 400 K. Now, the signal of nitroprusside was totally suppressed, and the LS state absorption was found to be expressed by a doublet with parameters of \u03b41 = 0.24 mm s-1, \u0394E  Q, 1  = 0.97 mm s-1 and two doublets with \u03b42 = 0.76 mm s-1, \u0394E  Q, 2  = 1.50 mm s-1 and \u03b43 = 0.95 mm s-1, \u0394E  Q, 3  = 2.25 mm s-1, which are assigned to the HS states of [Fe(abpt)2]2+. Then, x HS = (A 2 + A 3)/\u2211A  i  = 93%. The observed lowered values of the isomer shifts at elevated temperature can be explained by the second-order Doppler effect and are comparable to the parameters found for [Fe(abpt)2(\u03bc-Ni(CN)4)] n . The coexistence of two HS doublets in the isotopically enriched sample can be explained by the presence of structural deformations and different distributions of 57Fe in the solid state. The latter may be supported by a comparison of the Mo\u0308ssbauer spectra of 1 and 1' measured at 25 K (Figure S5 in the ). This distribution of HS absorption was found to be much more pronounced in the isotopically enriched [57Fe(abpt)2(\u03bc-Pt(CN)6)] n  (2') at different temperatures ranging from 5 to 440 K, as discussed in detail in the  (Figure S6). The course of x HS from the Mo\u0308ssbauer spectroscopy of both compounds copies the main features acquired by magnetic data analysis, which are the existence of a residual HS fraction at low temperature and a residual LS fraction at the highest temperature. However, the exact values are somewhat different as a result of neglect of the divergence of the Lamb-Mo\u0308ssbauer factors and their temperature dependence for each of the present iron(II) ions in the studied compounds.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 8, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig3\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Temperature dependence of the effective magnetic\nmoments, molar\nsusceptibilities, and total HS molar fractions for <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>.
