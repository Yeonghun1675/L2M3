SC-XRD analysis revealed that the compound crystallized in orthorhombic crystal system with space group Pna21 (Table S3). The asymmetric unit of LCP-100\u2283NBz involves one Cd(II) and two linkers (L) and two ClO4 - and two nitrobenzene as guest solvent molecules (Figure S2). Each metal ion is six coordinated with a distorted octahedral geometry having N4O2 as the donor set of atoms (four nitrogen atoms from four ligands and two oxygen atoms from two ClO4 -) (b).

Use of electron deficient nitrobenzene as guest coupled with highly conjugated linker favored the crystallization of LCP-100\u2283NBz.

Bulk phase purity of LCP-100\u2283NBz was confirmed by overlapping PXRD patterns (d and S8) and elemental analysis. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that LCP-100\u2283NBz showed ~26% weight loss at around 255 \u00b0C owing to the loss of two nitrobenzene guests occupying the pores of the framework (Figure S10). Guest-free phase LCP-100 was obtained by heating crystals of LCP-100\u2283NBz in vacuum at 255 \u00b0C, resulting in removal of nitrobenzene guests, as confirmed by the TGA analysis (Figure S10). 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Figures S15 and S16) of digested LCP-100 showed no characteristic peaks for free nitrobenzene, indicative of guest-free nature of LCP-100.

Interestingly, LCP-100 swelled back to the original phase (LCP-100\u2283NBz) when soaked in nitrobenzene solvent (for ~4 days), as confirmed by the PXRD and TGA patterns, which is indicative of the soft porous crystallinity/reversible dynamism of the framework (d, S8, and S11).
