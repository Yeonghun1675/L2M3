The choice of a proper organic moiety becomes important work, which can construct a series of abundant TMC modifiers. The N-donor organic ligands with strong coordination capacity have been extensively utilized for constructing these TMCs-modified POM-based compounds. Initially, the rigid organic ligands with N-donors become the preferred choice, such as pyrazine, imidazole, triazole, 2,2\u2032-bipyridine, and 4,4\u2032-bipyridine, which have merits of tiny conformational transformation and controllable structural tune for final products.

Although compounds <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> are isostructural, their CV curves are different (Figure ), depending on the different electrochemical behaviors of parent PMo<sub>12</sub> and PW<sub>12</sub> polyoxoanions. There exists also one irreversible anodic peak I with the potential of +120 mV assigned to the oxidation of the copper centers for <bold>3</bold>\u2212CPE (scan rate: 100 mV\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>). In addition, there exist two reversible redox peaks II\u2212II\u2032 and III\u2212III\u2032 with the half-wave potentials at \u2212414.5 (II\u2212II\u2032) and \u2212571 (III\u2212III\u2032) mV, respectively, which correspond to two consecutive two-electron processes of W centers.\n</p>", "clean_text": "Thermogravimetric Analyses\n\nThe TGA experiments were performed under N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C\u22c5min-1 in the temperature range of 30-600 \u00b0C for compounds 1 and 2, while 30-700 \u00b0C for compound 3, shown in . In the TG curves of compounds 1 and 2, the weight loss steps below 300 \u00b0C correspond to the loss of water molecules. The weight loss steps in the range of 300-600 \u00b0C are ascribed to the loss of organic molecules bbtz, 39.05% (calc. 39.15%) for 1, and 30.45% (calc. 30.67%) for 2. In the TG curve for compound 3, the weight loss of 15.04% (calc. 14.29%) from 300 to 600 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of bbtz molecules.\n\nCyclic Voltammetry\n\nRedox properties of compounds 1-3 were studied in 1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution (Figure ). The cyclic voltammograms for 1-CPE at different scan rates are presented in the potential range of +800 to -150 mV. There exist three reversible redox peaks I-I', II-II', and III-III' with the half-wave potentials (E 1/2 = (E pa + E pc)/2) at +400(I-I'), +253(II-II'), +24(III-III') mV (scan rate: 40 mV\u22c5s-1), respectively. Redox peaks I-I', II-II', and III-III' correspond to three consecutive two-electron processes of Mo centers. However, the oxidation peak of copper centers is not observed in the scan range of +800 and -150 mV. This phenomenon was also observed in (NH4)[Cu24I10L12][PMoV 2MoVI 10O40]3 (L = 4-[3-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)propyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazole) and [Cu2(H2O)2(bpp)2Cl][PMo12O40]\u22c520H2O (bpp = 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane). In the potential range of +450 to -650 mV for 2-CPE, there exist three reversible redox peaks II-II', III-III' and IV-IV' with the half-wave potentials at -68(II-II'), -288(III-III'), -567(IV-IV') mV for 2-CPE (scan rate: 40 mV\u22c5s-1). Redox peaks II-II' and III-III' correspond to two consecutive one-electron processes of W centers, while IV-IV' corresponds to a two-electron process. In addition, the irreversible anodic peak I with the potential of +125 mV for 2-CPE is assigned to the oxidations of the copper centers. Although compounds 1 and 2 are isostructural, their CV curves are different (Figure ), depending on the different electrochemical behaviors of parent PMo12 and PW12 polyoxoanions. There exists also one irreversible anodic peak I with the potential of +120 mV assigned to the oxidation of the copper centers for 3-CPE (scan rate: 100 mV\u22c5s-1). In addition, there exist two reversible redox peaks II-II' and III-III' with the half-wave potentials at -414.5 (II-II') and -571 (III-III') mV, respectively, which correspond to two consecutive two-electron processes of W centers.
