The compound can be mostly desolvated by first soaking in methanol to remove DMF, followed by heating at 180 \u00b0C under dynamic vacuum to yield activated Fe-BTTri as a tan powder. The powder is microcrystalline and retains its crystallinity through activation, as assessed by powder X-ray diffraction measurements (Figure S1). The resulting X-ray diffraction pattern indicates a framework structure type analogous to that of Cu-BTTri. The activated material retains a small amount of methanol, as seen by elemental analysis, and the majority of these methanol molecules are postulated to be bound to the extra-framework FeII cations. Adsorption of N2 at 77 K revealed a Langmuir surface area of 1930 m2/g and a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 1630 m2/g (Figure S3). These values are in good agreement with results obtained for Cu-BTTri, which displays Langmuir and BET surface areas of 1900 and 1770 m2/g, respectively. \n\nGas Adsorption\n\nThe compound Fe-BTTri was investigated for selected gas adsorption properties. In particular, adsorption isotherms for CO were collected at various temperatures. As shown in , the CO adsorption isotherm at 25 \u00b0C shows an extremely steep initial rise, reaching a value of 1.49 mmol/g adsorbed at just 102 \u03bcbar. The sharp initial uptake ends at 2.2 mmol/g at 157 \u03bcbar, and subsequent uptake more gradually increases to 2.7 mmol/g at 268 mbar, corresponding to a maximum total adsorption of CO at 75% of the iron sites (excluding extra-framework FeII cations). The steep rise in the isotherm suggests an initial strong interaction with CO for some of the iron sites, whereas the gradual rise afterward represents weak interactions with the framework. The remaining iron sites are likely blocked by solvent or remain inaccessible, as has been observed previously for Fe-BTT. This sharp uptake of CO adsorption is also seen at higher temperatures, with significant adsorption of CO still observable at 100 \u00b0C, reaching 1.08 mmol/g at 1.06 mbar.\n\nThe adsorption of CO at different temperatures was examined to evaluate the strength of its binding within the framework. Isotherms collected from 25 to 150 \u00b0C all displayed significant low-pressure adsorption relative to other CO adsorbing materials (). By fitting isotherms collected from 65 to 100 \u00b0C with a Langmuir-Freundlich equation and employing the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, an isosteric heat of adsorption (Q st) of -65 kJ/mol can be calculated (Figure S7). This value is greater in magnitude than those previously reported for metal-organic frameworks examined for CO adsorption, which have isosteric heats of adsorption ranging from -19 to -52 kJ/mol. The isosteric heat of adsorption, combined with a high capacity for CO at low pressures, suggests that Fe-BTTri is a promising candidate for extracting and removing very low concentrations of CO from gas mixtures. Indeed, its CO adsorption capacity of 0.75 mmol/g at just 0.05 mbar is unprecedented for these materials, representing a 2 orders of magnitude improvement relative to the previous best material, Ni2(dobdc) (dobdc4- = 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzene-dicarboxylate) (Figure S8). It should be noted, however, that the adsorption capacity of Fe-BTTri at pressures greater than 268 mbar is lower than that of Ni2(dobdc) and several related materials because of its lower concentration of accessible open metal sites. \n\nTo assess the ability of Fe-BTTri to separate CO from mixed CO/H2 gas streams for the purification of hydrogen, H2 adsorption isotherms were also collected. At 25 \u00b0C, only a very minor uptake of H2 is observed, with the isotherm rising gradually to reach a value of 0.05 mmol/g at 1.0 bar (). Indeed, at all of the pressures evaluated, Fe-BTTri was found to adsorb significantly more CO than H2, suggesting its application in the selective adsorption of CO during hydrogen purification.\n\nInfrared Spectroscopy\n\nTo understand the origin of the strong CO selectivity observed in Fe-BTTri, various spectroscopic methods were employed to probe the state of both the framework iron sites and the bound CO molecules. Infrared spectroscopy was used as an initial probe for the nature of the iron-carbonyl interaction. After exposure to 0.05 bar of CO, a sharp absorbance band at 2017 cm-1 arises ().
