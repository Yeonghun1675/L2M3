The N2 sorption at 77 K for 2 was activated by evacuating a freshly prepared sample at 200 \u00b0C under a dynamic vacuum overnight. The stability of the activated sample was confirmed by TGA and PXRD. Fittings of the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller equation to the adsorption isotherms of N2 (Figure c) give an estimated surface area of 355.68 m2/g and a Langmuir surface area of 470.73m2/g, which confirms the existence of micropores in 2.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF 2", "symbol": "2", "chemical formula": ""}, "porosity": [{"probe": "PLATON program", "value": "53.8", "unit": "%", "condition": "total crystal volume (8351.4 \u00c53)"}], "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "355.68", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": "N2 sorption at 77 K"}, {"type": "Langmuir", "probe": "", "value": "470.73", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": "N2 sorption at 77 K"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["porosity", "surface_area"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['porosity', 'surface_area']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n  {\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"name\": \"MOF 2\",\n      \"symbol\": \"2\",\n      \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"porosity\": [\n      {\n        \"probe\": \"PLATON program\",\n        \"value\": \"53.8\",\n        \"unit\": \"%\",\n        \"condition\": \"total crystal volume (8351.4 \u00c53)\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"surface area\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"BET\",\n        \"probe\": \"\",\n        \"value\": \"355.68\",\n        \"unit\": \"m2/g\",\n        \"condition\": \"N2 sorption at 77 K\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"Langmuir\",\n        \"probe\": \"\",\n        \"value\": \"470.73\",\n        \"unit\": \"m2/g\",\n        \"condition\": \"N2 sorption at 77 K\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 7, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>View of the doubly interpenetrated 3D framework\nwith channels of <bold>2</bold> along the [001] (a), [110] (b), and\n[112] (c) directions\nand the chiral (10,3)-a network<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"cit5a\"></xref> (d).</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2012-01707h_0001.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  View of the doubly interpenetrated 3D framework with channels of 2 along the [001] (a), [110] (b), and [112] (c) directions and the chiral (10,3)-a network (d).
