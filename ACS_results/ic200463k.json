The framework shows high thermal stability and a highly selective gated water adsorption property among a number of gases (N2, CO2) and solvent molecules (MeOH, EtOH). The adsorption behavior is correlated by smaller channel aperture and dynamic nature of the framework. The framework exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering at low temperature through superexchange processes between the V4+ centers bridged by PO3 2- moieties.
