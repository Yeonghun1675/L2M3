To check if the potassium cation in 1 is still bound to the Ge18 cluster in solution we first of all tried to transfer 1 intact into the gas phase via the mild electrospray ionization technique that normally works well for metalloid germanium clusters of the composition [Ge9R3]-. However, in case of 1 very complicated mass spectra are obtained, indicating the presence of germanium clusters with 9, 18, and even 27 germanium atoms (see Supporting Information Figures S7-S9), showing that 1 is more sensitive than [Ge9(Hyp)3]-. The higher sensitivity is also obvious by first subsequent reactions of 1; for example, the reaction with ZnCl2 leads to a degradation in solution, which is indicated by a complex proton NMR spectrum of the reaction mixture. Also the addition of 2.2.2.-crypt to a THF solution of K1 leads to a degradation (Figure S4, Supporting Information); that is, the bonding of the potassium cation to the dianionic cluster [(Hyp)2Ge9-SiMe2-C6H4-SiMe2-Ge9(Hyp)2]2- 2 appears to be important to obtain a stable compound in solution. The instability of multicharged metalloid germanium clusters in solution seems to be a general behavior, as the metalloid cluster [Li(THF)2]3Ge14(Hyp)5 also degrades in solution after eliminating the stabilizing [Li(THF)2]+ groups by a chelating ligand. The nature of the bridging ligand in 1 is also of vital importance for the stability of 1 in solution. This is shown by further experiments, where we tried to connect two [Ge9(Hyp)2]2- clusters via other Cl-R-Cl units like ClMe2Si-O-SiMe2-O-SiMe2Cl, ClMe2Si-(CH2)2-SiMe2Cl, ClMe2Si-(CH2)6-SiMe2Cl, or ClMe2Si-C6H4-C6H4-SiMe2Cl. All these experiments failed, as the reactions only give complex product mixtures as indicted by complicated proton NMR spectra of the reaction solution and from which no product could be isolated yet. Nevertheless, in some cases first of all a promising simpler proton NMR spectrum is obtained from the reaction mixture, showing that first of all a quite selective metathesis reaction takes place. However, the spectrum gets more complicated by time, showing that the primary formed product, which might be the anticipated target molecule, is not stable in solution and slowly degrades. If the primarily formed products might be isolated at lower temperature or might be stabilized by the addition of other cations is not clarified yet and is within the scope of further ongoing experiments. To get a first insight into the bonding situation of 1 we performed quantum chemical calculation on 1, where the calculated structure fits quite well to the experimentally determined one. An analysis of the bonding within 1 further shows that the bonding electrons are strongly delocalized, as three center bonding components with shared electron numbers (SENs) up to 0.37 are obtained via an Ahlrichs-Heinzmann population analysis; that is, a similar bonding situation as observed within Ge9Hyp3 -, is realized.
