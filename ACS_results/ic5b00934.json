UPC-19 with 5-fold interpenetration is nonporous, whereas UPC-20 with 3-fold interpenetration is porous and exhibits selective adsorption of CO2 over N2 and CH4 and fluorescence sensing of Cu2+ and Fe3+. Although several strategies on the control of interpenetration in MOFs have been documented, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on achieving selective adsorption of CO2 and selective sensing of metal ions through tuning of the interpenetration dimensionalities in a pair of isomers. Further studies will focus on the synthesis of a noninterpenetrating framework that is a single net in UPC-19 and UPC-20 by introducing template molecules and changing the solvents or reagent concentration.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 14, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>X-ray crystallographic data in CIF format, materials, methods and\ncharacterization, experimental section, and supplementary structure\nfigures.

In contrast, the N2 adsorption isotherm at 77 K for UPC-20 exhibits a reversible type I behavior, indicating its permanent porosity. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area calculated from the N2 isotherm is 697.4 m2 g-1, with a pore volume of 0.37 cm3 g-1.
