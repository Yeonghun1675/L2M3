A mixture of 3-methoxyphenol (12.41 g, 100 mmol), dichloromethane (200 mL), and benzaldehyde (10.61 g, 100 mmol) was stirred while being cooled in an ice bath for 0.5 h with dropwise addition of BF3\u22c5OEt2 (15 mL). The mixture was maintained at room temperature and stirred overnight. The product was then washed using CH2Cl2. The crude product of the precursor 2,8,14,20-tetra-phenyl-6,12,18,24-tetra-methoxy-4,10,16,22-tetra-carboxy-methoxy-resorcin[4]arene (L1) was achieved in 78% yield after evaporation of the solvent. The synthesis of 2,8,14,20-tetra-1-naphthal-6,12,18,24-tetra-methoxy-4,10,16,22- tetra-carboxy-methoxy-resorcin[4]arene (L2) is similar to that of the former (yield 59%). A mixture of L1 (16.96 g, 20 mmol), anhydrous K2CO3 (55.28 g, 400 mmol), methyl chloroacetate (17.36 g, 160 mmol), KI (0.15 g, 0.90 mmol), and CH3CN (300 mL) was heated in a water bath for 48 h under nitrogen gas. After filtration of the mixture, the solvent was removed with the rotary evaporator. Then, the extraction was conducted three times by addition of the saturated K2CO3 aqueous solution and chloroform (200 mL) to the dry solid. The mixture was recrystallized in methanol after removal of the chloroform. Then, tetrahydrofuran (150 mL), sodium hydroxide (4 g, 100 mmol), and water (150 mL) were poured into the isolated products, and refluxed for 8 h. The solvent was removed by water bath, and 500 mL of water was then added. With HCl (1.0 mol L-1), the pH value of the mixture was adjusted to 1-2, and pale green solid of TPC4A was achieved in a 60% yield. Anal. Calcd for C64H56O16 (M r = 1081.12): C, 71.10; H, 5.22.

For the different suspensions of 1, the Ca2+, Cd2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Mg2+, and Co2+ ions enhance the luminescence intensity, whereas the metal ions such as Al3+, Cu2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ produce varying degrees of luminescent quenching effects (a). In the case of the different suspensions of 2, the luminescent intensity is enhanced when the Mg2+, Na+, K+, and Ca2+ are involved. In contrast, the interaction with Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ ions drastically decreased the luminescence intensity (b). The rest of the tested metal ions such as Cd2+ and Zn2+ result in a little bit of change in the luminescent intensity. The different quenching effects on the luminescent changes completely correspond to the variation tendency of the emission spectra, as illustrated in . Notably, although both the Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions greatly quench the emissions of 1 and 2, their emission intensities are slightly different and can be distinguished under UV light. As shown in , Fe2+ can quench the emission of 1 and 2, causing the luminescence decrease. However, under the same condition, Fe3+ ions can completely quench the emission of the MOFs, which leads to the dark under UV light, as illustrated in . In other words, the suspensions of 1 and 2 exhibit the selective sensing of the Fe2+ and Fe3+. Notably, there exist some shifts of the emission peaks of 2 in aqueous solutions of different metal ions, which probably accounts for the coordination interactions between guest metal ions and ligands/MOFs. The concentration-dependent luminescent sensing of Fe2+ and Fe3+ were also examined (see the Supporting Information).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 22, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig4\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Emission spectra\nand intensities for <bold>1</bold> (a) and <bold>2</bold> (b) in aqueous\nsolutions of different metal ions.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr5\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2015-02666d_0006.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 4  Emission spectra and intensities for 1 (a) and 2 (b) in aqueous solutions of different metal ions.
