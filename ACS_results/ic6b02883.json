We carried out first-principles DFT+U calculations that confirmed the insulating band structure of 1 with a filled valence band of primarily Fe d and O p character and an unpopulated N-based conduction band (A). The electronic structure and magnetic properties of 1-4 were also probed by temperature dependent magnetometry. The \u03c7T 300 of 1 is 2.74 cm3 K/mol, which is comparable with the spin-only \u03c7T of 3 cm3 K/mol expected for an S = 2 center. This corresponds to a g value of 1.93(4), a value which is consistent over several samples. Fe(II) ions with S = 2, however, typically exhibit higher g values in the range of 2.00-2.29. To exclude the possibility of low-spin impurities, Mo\u0308ssbauer data was acquired for 1. Fits to this data yield an isomer shift of 1.171(1) mm/s and quadrupole splitting of 3.198(2) mm/s (), both of which are consistent with high-spin Fe(II).

Cobalt(II) acetate (0.041 g, 0.25 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (6 mL) at 100 \u00b0C. Malonic acid (0.39 g, 3.75 mmol) and pyrazine (0.2 g, 2.5 mmol) were dissolved in DMF (6 mL). Terephthalic acid (0.042 g, 0.25 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (6 mL) at 100 \u00b0C. The malonic acid/pyrazine and terephthalic acid solutions were added sequentially to the cobalt(II) acetate solution, and the resulting mixture was heated at 100 \u00b0C for 2.5 days to yield pink crystals. The polycrystalline material was then washed twice with fresh DMF. Analytically pure material was activated by heating the crystals under vacuum at 50-100 \u00b0C for 1 week to give a 70% yield (0.053 g, 0.17 mmol).

The structure of solvated 1 is representative of the bulk material as the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of 1 is well fit to the space group (P6/m) obtained from SXRD (A, Table S1). The permanent porosity of this material after activation was verified by nitrogen uptake measurements, which indicated a surface area of 1360 m2/g using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory (). Activated samples of 1 were also characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (Figures S1, S2A, and S3A).\n\nCo(BDC) (pyz) (2) was synthesized under analogous conditions to 1 and yielded pink, translucent crystals. The N2 adsorption isotherm yields a BET surface area of 1370 m2/g (). This value is very similar to that obtained for 1 and suggests that these two species may be isoreticular. Indeed, fitting of the PXRD pattern of 2 to the SXRD parameters of 1 provides a good fit with a comparable unit cell parameter c of 7.23(1) \u00c5 and a/b parameters of 25.06(1) \u00c5 (vs 7.238(1) and 25.020(2) \u00c5 for 1 (C, Table S1). While single crystal data could not be obtained for 2, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy indicates that the primary coordination sphere in 2 is similar to that determined by SXRD for 1 (Figure S4, Table S2). The calculated Co-N/O bond lengths are within <0.1 \u00c5 of the analogous bonds crystallographically determined for 1. Given the consistency between the EXAFS and PXRD pattern fits as well as in the surface areas, we conclude that 1 and 2 are isostructural. Activated samples of 2 were also characterized by TGA, DSC, and FT-IR spectroscopy (Figures S1, S2B, and S3A).\n\nRoom temperature, isotropic pressed pellet conductivity measurements were carried out on 1. The conductivity was too low to yield a linear potential vs current relationship, providing an upper limit of ~10-14 S/cm. We carried out first-principles DFT+U calculations that confirmed the insulating band structure of 1 with a filled valence band of primarily Fe d and O p character and an unpopulated N-based conduction band (A).

The \u03c7T 300 of 1 is 2.74 cm3 K/mol, which is comparable with the spin-only \u03c7T of 3 cm3 K/mol expected for an S = 2 center. This corresponds to a g value of 1.93(4), a value which is consistent over several samples. Fe(II) ions with S = 2, however, typically exhibit higher g values in the range of 2.00-2.29. To exclude the possibility of low-spin impurities, Mo\u0308ssbauer data was acquired for 1.
