Thereafter a discontinuous transition is marked by a considerable drop in volume of -13.0 \u00c53 per formula-unit (V/Z). Another more subtle volume discontinuity (V/Z of -6.0 \u00c53) occurs at 2.60 GPa. These 1\u22c5H  2  O phases are termed phase I (1\u22c5H  2  O-I, up to 1.0 GPa), phase II (1\u22c5H  2  O-II up to 2.60 GPa), and phase III (1\u22c5H  2  O-III, above 2.60 GPa). We have established that the two transformations are isostructural with respect to maintaining space-group symmetry and approximate unit-cell dimensions (Figure ). In our explanation of these transformations the presence of isopropanol in the channel pores of 1\u22c5H  2  O is crucial. Large molecules of isopropanol enter the framework only in the relatively low-pressure range, up to 0.2 GPa, when the pores are wide enough to allow their diffusion. This intake results in an initial expansion along the ab plane and, compared to the reference compression of 1\u22c5H  2  O in silicone oil, in a small formula-unit volume anomaly (Figure c). The transport of isopropanol molecules along the pores is possible, but high pressure narrows the voids and increases steric hindrances, thus hampering their further diffusion. The number of isopropanol molecules distributed stochastically in the bulk of the crystal is relatively small and hence undetectable by X-rays, but large enough to control the crystal compression. Owing to their matched size, the isopropanol molecules block the width contraction of the pores, and the volume compression between 0.2 and 1.0 GPa can only be realized by the c-parameter shrinkage. At 1.0 GPa, the accumulated strain is released by the contraction of the structure along c coupled to the expansion along a and b in phase 1\u22c5H  2  O-II. This mechanism leads to the most pronounced NAC, with a and b expanding by +4.2% up to 2.60 GPa, while the c axis is substantially compressed (by -21.5%, see Figure S3, ). This giant strain along c is clearly visible and allows one to follow the crystal stability regions by observing the changes in crystal shape (Figure ). On releasing the pressure, 1\u22c5H  2  O-III transforms back to 1\u22c5H  2  O-II, and subsequently to phase I; these changes are also easy to discern by observing the crystal shape changes (Figure , cf. Figure S4, ). The compressibility coefficients for the ab plane (\u03b2(001) = 2\u03b2 a ) and along the c axis (\u03b2 c ) are -72(6) and +145(9) TPa-1, respectively (Table S2, ). The NAC magnitude is about an order of magnitude larger than that of Ag(tcm) (\u03b2(010) = -7.5(8) TPa-1) and nearly five times that of the molecular crystal 2MeBzIm (\u03b2(001) = -15(6) TPa-1).
