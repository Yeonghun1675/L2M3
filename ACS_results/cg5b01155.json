Colorless block crystals were collected by filtration (yield: 62% based on Zn(II)). Replacing H2ipa by 5-hydroxyisophthalic acid (H2ipa-OH, B), 5-ethoxyisophthalic acid (H2ipa-eo, D), and 5-acetamidoisophthalic acid (H2ipa-ac, E), respectively, products of {[Zn5(OH)(dmtrz)3(ipa-OH)3]\u22c5DMF\u22c55H2O} n  (MAC-4-B, yields 46%), {[Zn5(OH)(dmtrz)3(ipa-eo)3]\u22c5DMF} n  (MAC-4-D, yields 42%), and {[Zn5(OH)(dmtrz)3(ipa-ac)3]\u22c5guest} n  (MAC-4-E, yields 55%) were obtained accordingly.\n\nSynthesis of MAC-4-AB-x, MAC-4-AC-x, and MAC-4-AD-x, MAC-4-AE-x (x = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7)\n\nMAC-4-AB-x, MAC-4-AC-x, MAC-4-AD-x, and MAC-4-AE-x were synthesized by mixing isophthalic acid and 5-substituted-isophthalic acid ligands at a defined molar ratio, and then following the procedure described below (x indicates the molar ratio of 5-substituted-isophthalic acid in the mixed acid ligands, taking MAC-4-AB-x for an example: x = 0.3 means that B/(A + B) = 0.3, which means B:A = 3:7). In a typical synthetic procedure for MAC-4-AB-0.3: H2ipa (0.21 mmol, 0.035 g) and H2ipa-OH (0.09 mmol, 0.016 g) were dissolved in 5 mL of DMF and stirred at room temperature for 60 min. After that, the solution was added to the 5 mL DMF solution of Zn(OAc)2\u22c52H2O (0.45 mmol, 0.101g) and dmtrz (0.3 mmol, 0.031g). The mixture was then stirred at room temperature for another 10 min and then transferred into the Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (15 mL) and heated at 140 \u00b0C for 3 days. Yields: 43% based on Zn(II). Varying the molar ratio of H2ipa and H2ipa-OH, MAC-4-AB-0.5, and MAC-4-AB-0.7 can be isolated, respectively. Following the same procedure, MAC-4-AC-x, MAC-4-AD-x, and MAC-4-AE-x can be obtained, respectively.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "{[Zn5(OH)(dmtrz)3(ipa)3]\u22c5DMF\u22c5H2O} n", "symbol": "MAC-4-A",
