A mixture of CuCl2\u22c52H2O (0.34 g, 1.0 mmol) and 1,2,4-triazole (0.069 g, 2.0 mmol) in 10 mL of H2O was introduced into a Parr Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (25 cm3), after which the vessel was sealed and heated at 180 \u00b0C for 5 days under autogenous pressure.

To solve the problem that unsubstituted 1,2,4-triazole immediately produces an insoluble precipitate with transition-metal ions, hydrothermal techniques were used in our experiments. The hydrothermal reaction of CuCl2\u22c52H2O with the ligand 1,2,4-triazole in a molar ratio of 1:1 at 180 \u00b0C produced bright blue octahedral crystals of 1 in about 45% yield. When the amount of CuCl2\u22c52H2O was gradually increased, a decrease in the yield of 1 was observed and then dark blue dodecahedral crystals of 2 were obtained. A further increase in the amounts of salts led to the formation of black prismatic crystals of 3. The almost phase-pure products were obtained under certain stoichiometric conditions (Cu:trz = 1:1 for 1, 4:3 for 2, and 2:1 for 3), whereas mixtures were obtained under intermediate conditions. Attempts to increase the amounts of organic ligands only led to microcrystals or precipitates.

TGA of 1 (Figure S6; Supporting Information) first shows a weight loss (found 24.02%) from 130 to 300 \u00b0C, which is attributed to the loss of guest water molecules (calcd 24.48%). The weight loss observed between 300 and 450 \u00b0C was slight; after that a sharp weight loss started and ended at 625 \u00b0C. The total weight loss in the temperature range 300-625 \u00b0C was 37.03%, which corresponds to the loss of triazole groups (calcd 36.27%). For 2 and 3, similar weight losses were observed in the temperature range 300-750 \u00b0C, which were due to the decomposition of organic components and chlorine (Figure S6). The N2 sorption experiments for 1 showed that only surface adsorption had occurred, indicating that nitrogen molecules could not diffuse into the channels at this temperature. On the other hand, heating-cooling and dehydration-hydration experiments were carried out according to the TGA results and monitored by X-ray powder diffraction techniques (XRPD, Figure S7 (Supporting Information)). In comparison to the original crystals, the dehydrated solid obtained by heating 1 at 300 \u00b0C for 30 min showed an almost identical XRPD (curves b and e in Figure S7). The loss of water caused 1 to change color from bright blue to cyan. When 1 was heated to 350 \u00b0C, some of the characteristic peaks became weak or disappeared, but the intensity of the lines could be recovered after this dehydrated solid was immersed in water (curve i in Figure S7), which suggests that the dehydration of 1 is reversible.
