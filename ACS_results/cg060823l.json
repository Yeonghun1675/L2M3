The nature of the Gd-Gd interaction in 1 is further supported by magnetization measurements in the 0-5 T range at 2 K: in the M-vs-H plot, at 0-2 T, M values rapidly increase, and then, above 2.5 T, the increase of magnetization slows down and trends to reach saturation (21.78 N\u03b2), which is slightly larger than the value (21 N\u03b2, g = 2.0) of the sum of Gd3, suggesting the presence of weak ferromagnetic coupling or paramagnetic behavior.(Figure b.)
