For example, recent works have shown that copper porphyrinates can be saddle-shaped even in the absence of sterically hindered substituents. Configuration changes in the series of phosphoryl substituted copper porphyrinates 4Cu(a), 4Cu(b), and 5Cu\u22c56CHCl  3  is a remarkable example demonstrating that the geometry of the porphyrinic core can be influenced even by weak interactions of the porphyrin molecule with its closed environment.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 37, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>To prepare\nheterometallic polymers using this synthetic approach,\nPW dicopper complex <bold>1</bold> was reacted with palladium(II),\nnickel(II), or zinc(II) porphyrinates <bold>4Pd</bold>, <bold>4Ni</bold>, or <bold>4Zn</bold>.
