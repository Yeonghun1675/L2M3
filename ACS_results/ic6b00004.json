Bearing in mind that the copper(II) ion is located in a compressed octahedral environment, its magnetic orbital is d z 2 ; hence, the possible magnetic interaction with the nitronyl nitroxide radical through the pyrimidine unit (located in an equatorial position) should be very weak. Thus, from a magnetic point of view, a chain consists of independent Rad-Gd-Rad units plus one noninteracting copper(II) ion. For the Rad-Gd-Rad unit, two kinds of exchange interactions are operative, namely, the direct Gd-ON interaction (J 1) and a next-neighbor interaction between two NO groups via the gadolinium(III) ion (J 2). The theoretical expression for \u03c7M T derived from the Hamiltonian H = -2J 1(S Rad1 S Gd1 + S Gd1 S Rad2) - 2J 2 S rad1 S rad2 (see the Supporting Information) was used to model the behaviors between 300 and 136 K and between 14 and 140 K respectively for the HT and LT phases. The best fit to the experimental behaviors yielded J 1 = 3.52 cm-1, J 2 = -7.14 cm-1, g = 2.02, and g Cu = 2.10 for the HT behavior and J 1 = 1.00 cm-1, J 2 = -6.36 cm-1, g = 2.02, and g Cu = 2.10 for the LT domain, values consistent with those reported in similar compounds. These J 1 values support the role of the Gd-O-N-C torsion angle in the major transition of the magnetic behavior found in 1. The different \u03c7M T profiles observed for the HT and LT phases can clearly be ascribed to the marked difference in the strength of the ferromagnetic gadolinium-radical interaction (3.5 versus 1.0 cm-1); the jumps of \u03c7M T result from the temperature-triggered structural transitions, modifying this exchange parameter. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) confirmed the coincidence of the magnetic steps and the phase transition (Figure S5). Interestingly, like the two-step transition found in the magnetic behavior, DSC also shows two signals, which suggests that the structural modification involves two steps close in temperatures. While the LT and HT structures are informative on the phase before and after the structural transition, its stepping remains unknown.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 12, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>As mentioned above, the width\nof the bistability domain is correlated with the cooperative effect\nbetween the molecules.
