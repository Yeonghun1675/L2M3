It could be shown that the formation of the different compounds are due to changes in the pH of the starting mixture and thus the degree of deprotonation of H2O3P-C(OH)(CH3)-PO3H2 (H4L). In a large region of the parameter space under acidic conditions compound 1 containing H2L2- ions crystallizes. At a pH of about 7 compound 2 is formed, which is composed of Ca2+ and HL3- ions. At even higher pH the ligand is completely deprotonated to L4- which is incorporated into the structure of 3. Compared to 1, which already can be observed after 5 min of sonication, 2 and 3 necessitate prolonged crystallization times. The application of ultrasound was demonstrated to accelerate the crystallization of the title compounds.
