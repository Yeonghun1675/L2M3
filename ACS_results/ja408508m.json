Recent theoretical studies have also predicted moderately strong PdCl2-H2 interactions in modified COF-301 and axial \u03b72-H2 bonding at vacant Ni2+ sites in other PCPs. So, it was decided to study H2 adsorption in M-PCM-18 over a wider temperature range. Interestingly, at temperatures above 300 K both Pd- and Pt-PCM-18 showed marked increases in H2 adsorption between 0-1 bar. Adsorption-desorption isotherms were collected on freshly activated samples at 25 K increments, which revealed maximum H2 sorption occurred at ~425 K and 1.0 bar H2 for both materials (Figure a,b; black lines). Between 425-500 K the total amount of adsorbed H2 was diminished but remained higher than at ambient temperature; the high-temperature H2 adsorption isotherms were always linear, suggesting that saturation was not reached at 1.0 bar (; closed circles). In addition, desorption phases showed marked hysteresis, indicative of relatively strong H2 binding inside the materials, even at 425 K (; open circles). When these samples were immediately subjected to readsorption-desorption, no further H2 was adsorbed, presumably because the available H2 sorption sites in the pores were still occupied (; triangles).

In addition, desorption phases showed marked hysteresis, indicative of relatively strong H2 binding inside the materials, even at 425 K (; open circles). When these samples were immediately subjected to readsorption-desorption, no further H2 was adsorbed, presumably because the available H2 sorption sites in the pores were still occupied (; triangles). If the same samples were reactivated in situ by prolonged evacuation (4 h; also at 425 K), it was possible to obtain the original hysteretic adsorption-desorption profiles over repeated cycles, without any decrease in H2 capacity ().", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "M-PCM-18", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "CO2", "value": "211", "unit": "m2 g-1", "condition": "at 196 K for Pd"}, {"type": "BET", "probe": "CO2", "value": "244", "unit": "m2 g-1", "condition": "at 196 K for Pt"}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "H2", "adsorbed amount": "36", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "", "condition": "for Pd"}, {"adsorbate": "H2", "adsorbed amount": "53", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "", "condition": "for Pt"}, {"adsorbate": "H2", "adsorbed amount": "", "unit": "", "temperature": "above 300 K", "pressure": "0-1 bar", "condition": "for both Pd and Pt"}, {"adsorbate": "H2", "adsorbed amount": "", "unit": "", "temperature": "425 K", "pressure": "1.0 bar", "condition": "for both Pd and Pt"}, {"adsorbate": "H2", "adsorbed amount": "", "unit": "", "temperature": "425-500 K", "pressure": "1.0 bar", "condition": "for both Pd and Pt"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["surface_area", "gas_adsorption"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['surface_area', 'gas_adsorption']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"M-PCM-18\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"surface area\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"BET\",\n                \"probe\": \"CO2\",\n                \"value\": \"211\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2 g-1\",\n                \"condition\": \"at 196 K for Pd\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"type\": \"BET\",\n                \"probe\": \"CO2\",\n                \"value\": \"244\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2 g-1\",\n                \"condition\": \"at 196 K for Pt\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"H2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"36\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"77 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"for Pd\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"H2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"53\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"77 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"for Pt\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"H2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"\",\n                \"unit\": \"\",\n                \"temperature\": \"above 300 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"0-1 bar\",\n                \"condition\": \"for both Pd and Pt\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"H2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"\",\n                \"unit\": \"\",\n                \"temperature\": \"425 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"1.0 bar\",\n                \"condition\": \"for both Pd and Pt\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"H2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"\",\n                \"unit\": \"\",\n                \"temperature\": \"425-500 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"1.0 bar\",\n                \"condition\": \"for both Pd and Pt\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 5, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Synthetic Route to Obtain the M-PCM-18 Materials<xref rid=\"sch1-fn1\"></xref>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ja-2013-08508m_0004.tif\"></graphic>\n<p>\n<fn id=\"sch1-fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>(i) 4 eq. 4-bromolithiobenzene,\nTHF, 195 K; (ii) 4.5 equiv <italic toggle=\"yes\">n</italic>-BuLi, THF, 195 K, CO<sub>2</sub>, HCl; (iii) 1 equiv M(COD)Cl<sub>2</sub> (M = Pd, Pt), THF,\n303 K; (iv) 3.5 equiv Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\u00b7<italic toggle=\"yes\">x</italic>H<sub>2</sub>O, DMF/EtOH (2.25:1); 10 d, 318 K.</p>\n</fn>\n</p>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Synthetic Route to Obtain the M-PCM-18 Materials      a (i) 4 eq. 4-bromolithiobenzene, THF, 195 K; (ii) 4.5 equiv n-BuLi, THF, 195 K, CO2, HCl; (iii) 1 equiv M(COD)Cl2 (M = Pd, Pt), THF, 303 K; (iv) 3.5 equiv Zn(NO3)2\u22c5xH2O, DMF/EtOH (2.25:1); 10 d, 318 K.
