Special interest centers on the layered phosphonates and is due to their unique properties, such as their high thermal stability and the variability of organic functional groups that can be introduced. Originally, work in this area was focused on group IV metal phosphonates. In most cases, these compounds are layered and the metal atoms are bridged by oxygens of the phosphonates, while the organic moiety of the phosphonate projects into the interlayer space. By using the reaction of bis(phosphonic acids) with zirconium, the phosphonic acid can bond with metal ions on both ends and thus cross-link inorganic layers to form a molecular sieve-like three-dimensional structure. The distance between the biphenyl cross-links is only 5.3 \u00c5, allowing for no porosity. It was claimed that by the preparation of mixed derivatives in which phosphite or phosphate ions replace some of the biphenyl groups, porosity was built into the structures. The materials prepared by the Dines group were amorphous, and as such, they were able to obtain a complete solid solution series of the type Zr(O3PH)2 - 2  x (O3PC12H8PO3) x  with x = 0-1.

Compound I begins to lose its coordinated water at 108 \u00b0C. The observed weight loss for this stage is 6.86%, close to the calculated value 7.55% for loss of two water molecules. After dehydration, there is no weight loss or phase change (observed from DTA data) until the temperature reaches 473 \u00b0C. In the temperature range 473-607 \u00b0C the organic moieties decompose. On the assumation that the final product is Zn2P2O7, the reactions may be represented as in eq 1.    The total weight loss was found to be 33.8% as compared to a calculated value of 36.1%. The corresponding mixed-derivative (compound III) behaved similarly (Figure B) except that the water loss began as soon as heating was initiated and occurred in two steps. The first, due to interstitial or surface water, is not present in the pure zinc  bis(phosphonate) because of its hydrophobic nature and the fact that the water molecules are coordinated to the zinc atoms. The second step occurs immediately after most of the interstitial water is lost and, in analogy with compound I, is attributed to water coordinated to Zn. The total observed weight loss from the water is 9.75%, a value close to that calculated for 2.5 mol of water (9.86%).  \n\nThe TGA curve for Zn2(O3PC6H4PO3)(H2O)2, shown in Figure A, was taken from ref . The coordinated water is lost at 110-200 \u00b0C and amounts to 8.6% (calculated 8.98%). The total weight loss is 24.4% compared to a calculated value of 24.0%. The mixed phosphate-phosphonate (compound II) shows a two-step weight loss of water that amounts to 11.75% compared to a calculated value of 11.28% based upon a water content of 2.5 mol. The higher water content in both this example and the one above is due to the introduction of the more hydrophilic monohydrogen phosphate group and the more openness of the structure. The decrease in stability of compounds II and III, as shown by the lower temperature of burnout of the organic is also attribuated to the introduction of the phosphate groups, which allows oxygen ready access to the interior. The TGA curve of compound IV is similar to that for the linear-chain zinc biphenylenebis(phosphonate), Zn(HO3PC12H8PO3H) (Figure B,A). It shows no weight loss up to 389 \u00b0C, which is 104 \u00b0C higher than the parent linear-chain phosphonate, indicating that compound IV is more thermally stable. The first weight loss is due to condensation of the hydroxyl groups and is followed by decomposition of the phenyl rings. The total weight loss for the parent compound amounts to 40.4%, while the calculated weight loss for this process is 40.8%, assuming that the end product is zinc phosphite, Zn(PO3)2 (eq 2).    The total observed weight loss for the mixed phosphonate-phosphate was 34.5% as compared to a calculated value of 37.6%. The formula in brackets in eq 2 is that of an unknown intermediate that is stable to ~600 \u00b0C after the split-out of water from the monohydrogen phosphonate groups.
