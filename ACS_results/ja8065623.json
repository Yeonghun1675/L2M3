Compared with the spectrum of [Et4N]2[TeFe3(CO)9], polymers [Et4N]\u221e[1] and 2 have wider absorption ranges by extending the absorptions to the lower-energy region. To reduce the computation time, two units of polymer 1 ([TeFe3(CO)9Cu]2 2- , 1a) and two units of polymer 2 (H2[{TeFe3(CO)9Cu2}(\u03bc-4,4'-dipyridyl)1.5]2, 2a) were used to compute their respective singlet-singlet transitions to understand the absorption spectra (). The calculations show that the absorption patterns of polymers [Et4N]\u221e[1] and 2 also extend to a redder region compared to [Et4N]2[TeFe3(CO)9], in which the low-energy transitions of 1a and 2a are involved in the transitions contributed from the Cu and dipyridyl. This result suggests that the incorporation of Cu and dipyridyl into the TeFe3 skeleton can contribute to the low-energy absorption of polymers [Et4N]\u221e[1] and 2, which can be used to account for the small energy gaps of these polymers obtained from the onset frequencies of the frequency-dependent conductivity addressed below.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 11, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>To fully elucidate their electronic transitions, room-temperature optical reflectance was measured over the entire frequency range (no polarization dependence in the data was detected) of [Et<sub>4</sub>N]<sub>\u221e</sub>[<bold>1</bold>] and <bold>2</bold> in solids (a).
