Using the PHI program, the best-fitting results obtained over the whole temperature range are \u03bb = -239 cm-1, \u03b1 = 7.74, \u0394 = 293 cm-1, and g = 2.31. The large positive value of \u0394 gives an indication that only the lowest two Kramers doublets of the 4A2 ground term are thermally populated such that the energy gap between them corresponds to the axial zero field splitting (ZFS) within the quartet state. Hence, the magnetic properties have been investigated further, using the following spin Hamiltonian in  to get an insight into the ZFS parameters 3    H = D  [     S   z     2   - S  ( S + 1 )  / 3 ]  + E  (     S   x     2   -     S   y     2   )  + g   \u03bc   B   S \u00d7 B   where D and E represent the single-ion axial and rhombic ZFS parameters, S is the spin operator, and B is the magnetic field vector. From the field-dependent isothermal magnetization data (a, inset), the highest value of 2.55 N\u03bcB is obtained at 2 K and 7 T, which is well below the theoretical saturation value for an S = 3/2 system (M sat = 3.3 N\u03bcB for g = 2.2). This observation, in addition to the feature of nonsuperimposition of the isothermal magnetization plots in the M/N\u03bcB versus H/T plots (b), indicates the presence of significant magnetic anisotropy in the system. The PHI program was used to determine the anisotropy parameters of the CoII center by simultaneous fitting of the susceptibility and magnetization curves. The best fits of the magnetization data give D = 54.7 cm-1, E = 0.9 \u00d7 10-3 cm-1, and g = 2.30.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 42, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>The magnetization dynamics\nis also investigated for complex <bold>2</bold> by AC susceptibility\nmeasurements at various temperatures\nand frequencies at 3.5 Oe AC field and in the absence and presence\nof DC fields.

The Co atom binds to three O atoms from two Br-isa2- ligands and three N atoms from three different bpe linkers (b). Analysis of the coordination geometry around the CoII center by using the SHAPE 2.1 program reveals that it can best be described as distorted octahedron (O  h  symmetry) (Figure S7a) with a CShM value of 4.923 (detail geometric analyses are described in Table S1). The Co-N bond lengths are in the range of 2.151(2)-2.166(2) \u00c5, while the Co-O bond lengths are in the range of 2.069(2)-2.257(2) \u00c5. The Co\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Co distances bridged by Br-isa and bpe ligands are 9.89 and 13.73 \u00c5, respectively.\n\nPXRD and Thermal Stability Analysis\n\nIn order to check the phase purity of the bulk samples, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis was carried out for complexes 1-4. As shown in Figure S2, all of the peaks displayed in the experimental patterns closely match those in the simulated patterns generated from single-crystal diffraction data, which indicates that the analyzed compounds represent a single phase. To evaluate the thermal stabilities of compounds 1-4, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out in the temperature range of 30-800 \u00b0C (Figure S13) under N2 flow with a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min-1. Complex 1 shows a weight loss of ~1.81 wt % in the range of 55-110 \u00b0C that corresponds to the loss of one H2O molecule per unit cell (calcd 1.81 wt %). The desolvated framework begins to collapse from ~350 \u00b0C. For complex 2, the weight loss is ~1.50 wt % in the temperature range 50-105 \u00b0C. This also corresponds to the removal of guest H2O molecule per unit cell (calcd 1.52 wt %). The decomposition of the desolvated framework takes place in steps in a temperature range of 310-750 \u00b0C. In complex 3, the observed weight loss is ~4.84% in the 50-100 \u00b0C range, corresponding to loss of six lattice H2O molecules per formula unit (calcd 5.00 wt %). The desolvated framework of 3 collapses in a stepwise manner within 300-750 \u00b0C. The weight loss in complex 4 is ~3.83% which corresponds to nearly 21/2 guest H2O molecules/formula unit (calcd 4.21 wt %). After loss of the lattice solvents, the framework starts collapsing from about 310 \u00b0C in a stepwise fashion. For compounds 1, 2, and 4, the above observations match reasonably well the solvent content assessments from the residual electron count, with the disordered solvent excluded from the structural model (by the Squeeze procedure in PLATON software; see above). In 3, the residual diffraction data indicate considerably larger solvent content (the calculated solvent accessible voids in this structure account for more than one-third of the crystal volume), possibly due to lattice-inclusion of the less volatile acetonitrile species as well.\n\nMagnetic Properties Studies\n\nGiven the unpaired spins of the MnII and CoII ions, variable temperature (2-300 K) and variable field direct current (DC) magnetic measurements were carried out for all the complexes 1-4. For complex 2, the magnetization dynamics was investigated as well by alternating current (AC) susceptibility measurements as a function of temperature and frequency. Complexes 1 and 3 display similar magnetic behaviors as illustrated in . The room-temperature \u03c7 M  T values for 1 and 3 are 4.31 and 4.16 cm3 mol-1 K, respectively (a) (\u03c7 M  = molar magnetic susceptibility), which are comparable to the spin-only value (4.38 cm3 mol-1 K) for a high-spin MnII ion in an octahedral environment (S = 5/2, g = 2). With lowering of temperature, \u03c7 M  T initially decreases gradually up to around 30 K, below which it decreases sharply. This decline in the \u03c7 M  T value from 300 K is due to an antiferromagnetic interaction between two MnII ions in the dimer. The \u03c7 M  T vs T plots are fitted according to Curie-Weiss law [\u03c7 M  T = C/(T - \u03b8)] and the best fitting yield Curie constant C = 4.56 cm3 mol-1 K and Weiss temperature \u03b8 = -7.80 K for 1 and C = 4.26 cm3 mol-1 K and \u03b8 = -6.66 K for 3.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "C36H42N6O4"}, "chemical formula weight": [{"value": "622.75",

Upon lowering the temperature, the \u03c7 M  T value first decreases gradually up to ~75 K and then sharply to reach a minimum value of 1.87 cm3 mol-1 K at 1.8 K.
