The very close EHC values of 1  x /UP and UP suggest that no more incomplete combustion of 1  x /UP happens in the gaseous phase compared with UP. In other words, the main flame-retardant mechanism of 1 should be attributed to the condensed phase mechanism, in which the char residue formed serves as an insulation layer hindering the heat release during the combustion. Although no remarkable distinction can be observed in the morphology of the char residue (Figure S9), the Raman spectra show that the signal of the G-band (diffusion band around 1580 cm-1) corresponding to the C-C vibrations in aromatic structures and the D-band (diffusion band around 1350 cm-1) related to sp3 hybridized C atoms can be clearly identified in all of the residue samples. Among all of the composites, 1\u22c5FR 19/UP has the highest peak intensity ratio of D-band/G-band (I D/I G), meaning that more turbostratic carbon structures growing among polyaromatic layers are formed during the combustion, producing a stronger char layer, which plays important roles in the fire-resistance process. Nevertheless, the char layer formed in 1  x /UP is not strong enough to prevent the dispersion of soot particles so that the corresponding SPR and TSP values remain high. From the lowered EHC and high amount of char residue, the mechanisms of both gaseous and condensed phases in 1\u22c5FR  x /UP are suggested. The radical capture from the gaseous phase should be attributed to the phosphorus-containing DMMP in 1\u22c5FR, which is also reflected in the higher CO produced. The polyphosphoric acid and phospho-carbonaceous layer formed during the combustion further help in the reduction of THR and HRR and in smoke suppression (Figure S9). It should be noted that, under the same additive ratio, 1\u22c5FR  x /UP exhibits char residue amount very close to that of 1  x /UP, although the content of 1 is only 59% of that in 1  x /UP, meaning that the DMMP has non-negligible contributions to the condensed phase formation during the combustion. As reported in many previous cases, DMMP mainly worked as a gaseous phase flame retardant. Therefore, we can conclude that through the interaction with MOF, the flame-retardant mechanism of DMMP has been regulated in both ways, which is apparently more effective in fire resistance. Considering that there is still a large amount of copper ions in 1\u22c5FR  x /UP, the acceleration of polymer decomposition caused by OMS should be restrained by the coordination between phosphonate groups and unsaturated CuII dimmers (). In other words, the hierarchical functionalization presented in this work not only overcomes the negative effects to the thermal stability of the polymer matrix but also gives rise to a stronger synergetic flame-retardant effect between 1 and DMMP.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 21, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch2\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Schematic Illustration of Different Interactions of\nOMS Contained <bold>1</bold> and Functionalized <bold>1</bold>\u00b7<bold>FR</bold> with\nthe UP Matrix</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr2\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"am-2019-023574_0007.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 2  Schematic Illustration of Different Interactions of OMS Contained 1 and Functionalized 1\u22c5FR with the UP Matrix   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 22, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<title>Mechanical Properties</title><p>To further compare the influence\nof the additives on the mechanical properties of UP composites, the\ntensile and impact tests and dynamical mechanical analysis (DMA) were\nconducted (, ).
