As shown in a, two types of Cu coordination geometries exist: one is the five-coordinated Cu(II) (Cu1 and Cu2), and another is two-coordinated linear Cu(I) (Cu3-Cu9). The linear Cu(I) ions locate in three different coordination environments: Cu3 and Cu6 connect to one N atom of the imidazole moiety and one O atom from the monodentate carboxylate of BTBA3- ligand, Cu7 coordinates with two N atoms from two different imidazole moieties, Cu4, Cu5, Cu8, and Cu9 link to one N from the imidazole and one O atom from the bimonodentate carboxylate of BTBA3-, respectively.
