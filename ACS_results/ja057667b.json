These values are similar to those of [Co3(bpdc)3bpy]\u22c54DMF\u22c5H2O, suggesting a relatively strong adsorbent-adsorbate interaction. It leads us to believe this high density is a result of suitable pore diameter (comparable to H2 kinetic diameter) and effective pore structure (close-packed 1D channels).
