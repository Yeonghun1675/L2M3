The asymmetric unit is made up of half Zn atom, half-molecule of 4,4'-bipyridine, half-molecule of ABDCA ligand, and half-molecule of lattice DMF. The Zn atom adopts a distorted tetrahedral geometry with two oxygen atoms of ABDCA and two nitrogen atoms of 4,4'-bipyridine spacer. The average Zn-O and Zn-N bond lengths are 1.943 and 2.062 \u00c5, respectively ().

The coordination polymer has a topological network with a uninodal 4-c net, which can be represented by the Schla\u0308fli symbol {66} (TD10 = 981) (see the SI). \n\nThermal Stability\n\nThe thermal stability of all the compounds has been studied using thermogravimetric analysis (). Compounds 1 and 2 have both lattice and coordinated DMF molecules. The initial weight loss in both cases is due to the loss of lattice DMF molecules and was followed by elimination of coordinated DMF molecules up to ~300 \u00b0C. In the case of compound 3, both lattice solvent and coordinated DMF molecules were eliminated by ~200 \u00b0C and the compound was stable up to ~550 \u00b0C before organic struts started decomposing. For compounds 1 and 2, framework decomposed at a lower temperature (~450 \u00b0C) compared to compound 3. In the case of compound 4, the lattice water molecule slowly released until ~250 \u00b0C followed by removal of the organic struts. Compound 5 was stable up to ~250 \u00b0C and then the framework started degrading. For compound 6, the framework exhibits a stepwise decomposition. The lattice DMF get released up to ~200 \u00b0C and after that it started losing the organic struts of the framework.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula":
