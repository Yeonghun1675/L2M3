The last three cadmium disulfonates in the list above contain two-dimensional sheet structures with H-bonding linking the sheets into a framework, while the silver compounds have complex three-dimensional structures connected entirely through direct metal-sulfonate linkages. The examples with Jahn\u2212Teller distortion are also very few and involve the d<sup>9</sup> and d<sup>8</sup> metal centers Cu(II) and Ni(II), respectively: [Cu(en)<sub>2</sub>(1,5nds)](H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>, [Cu(N-meen)<sub>2</sub>(1,5nds)](H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>, Cu(dpn)<sub>2</sub>(bpds), Cu(cyclam)(1,5nds), and Ni(cyclam)(1,5nds) where dpn = 2,3-diaminopropane, bpds = biphenyldisulfonate, and cyclam = 1,4,8,11-tetrazacyclotetradecane.

They are very weak ligands that, depending on the conditions, may not be able to replace even the water molecules in solvated transition-metal cations typically produced upon dissolving metal salts in water. However, manipulation of the synthetic conditions by varying different parameters has proven successful in achieving a few examples with direct metal-sulfonate interactions. As already discussed, all of them are either with closed-shell d10 metals or involve greatly elongated octahedra because of Jahn-Teller distortion.
