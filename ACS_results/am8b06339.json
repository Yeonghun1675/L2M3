Both field emission scanning electron microscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscopy images of 1 reflect the formation of microflowers by self-assembly of nanopetals. With the dehydrated framework of 1, sorption studies of different gases (N2, H2, and CO2) as well as polar and nonpolar solvents, such as water, benzene (Bz), and cyclohexane (Cy), have been performed. The CO2 sorption isotherm depicts type I isotherm at 298 and 273 K and type IV isotherm at 195 K. Furthermore, with an uptake of 129.2 cm3 g-1 (25.62 wt %) at 195 K, sorption of CO2 is selective over N2 (77 K) and H2 (77 K) because of the strong adsorbate-adsorbent interaction as clearly evident from an isosteric heat of adsorption (Q st) at zero coverage of 37.5 kJ mol-1, which is exceptionally higher than that of other functionalized MOFs. Using the ideal adsorption solution theory calculation for a CO2/N2 (15:85) mixture, selectivity values are found to be 54.08 (298 K) and 46.96 (273 K) at 100 kPa. For a major application, activated 1 has been utilized for selective and ultrafast detection of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) in water with a limit of 0.94 nM (0.2 ppb), which supersedes any previous reported value. Excellent recyclability and stability of 1 for sensing experiments have been established. Time-resolved fluorescence studies and density functional theory calculations have been used to establish its mechanism of action. Furthermore, a prototype experiment for the real-time sensing of TNP in the vapor phase by fluorescence microscopy provides an easy colorimetric monitoring.\n\nMOF 1 crystallizes in the orthorhombic noncentrosymmetric polar space group Fdd2 from achiral components. Each heptacoordinated Cd(II) center in 1 exhibits distorted pentagonal bipyramidal geometry with an N3O4 environment (a,b and S1, S2), where one nitrogen atom and one NH2 group from one triazine ring of the ligand, one nitrogen atom from the triazine ring of the second ligand, and two carboxylate groups (both in chelated mode) from two different ligands are involved. The bidentate chelating binding mode of the carboxylate groups to Cd(II) in its crystal structure is further confirmed by the difference in asymmetric and symmetric stretching bands of the carboxylate group in its FTIR spectrum that appear at 1564 and 1367 cm-1 (\u0394\u03bd = \u03bdasym - \u03bdsym = 197 cm-1), respectively (Figure S3). Each ATAIA ligand acts as a linear linker to connect four Cd(II) centers, resulting in the formation of a three-dimensional (3D) framework (b and S1a-c). The double helical metal chain that repeats in the framework is believed to be the source of its crystallization in the mm2 point group (c and S2a). 1 has a rare 11-connected network with uninodal net topology bearing a point symbol {315.425.515} (d and S2b). The phase purity of bulk 1 was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) by comparing the experimental pattern of the as-prepared sample with the simulated pattern obtained from SCXRD (Figure S4). Upon removal of lattice water molecules by immersing 1 in MeOH followed by heating at 70 \u00b0C to obtain activated 1, there is no loss of its 3D structure (Figure S4c); furthermore, it is also stable in aqueous acid and base solutions based on the PXRD data (Figure S4d,e). The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of 1 shows a weight loss of 15.19% (calculated value: 15.23% for the loss of seven lattice water molecules) in the 40-172 \u00b0C range followed by its decomposition (Figure S5). One-dimensional channels are formed along all three axes with pore dimensions (without van der Waals radii) of 11.305 \u00d7 5.923 \u00c52 (a-axis), 11.987 \u00d7 20.077 \u00c52 (b-axis), and 5.205 \u00d7 4.905 \u00c52 (c-axis) as shown in Figure S2c. Each of these pores decorated with free NH and NH2 groups of the ligand is occupied by water molecules. To comprehend the surface morphology of 1, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were performed. Both FESEM and HRTEM images reflect the formation of microflowers by self-assembly of nanopetals ().\n\nGas and Vapor Sorption Studies\n\nThe successful construction of dual-amine functionalized pore sites in 1 also influences to explore its potential gas sorption studies. By considering the stability based on TGA, PXRD, and cognizable large solvent accessible void of 47.8% (8252.7 \u00c53 per unit cell) obtained using PLATON in the dehydrated framework of 1 (designated as activated 1), the sorption studies of different gases (N2 and H2 at 77 K; CO2 at 195, 273, and 298 K) as well as polar and nonpolar solvents water, benzene (Bz), and cyclohexane (Cy) have been performed. The N2 sorption isotherm at 77 K exhibits a mixture of type I and type IV reversible isotherms with the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and Langmuir surface areas estimated to be 62 and 98 m2 g-1, respectively (Figure S6a). Employing both the non-local density functional theory and microporous analysis, a narrow pore size distribution of 1 was found to be 0.6-2.2 and 0.4-1.7 nm, respectively. In both cases, the highest peak was observed at 1.0-1.1 nm (Figure S6b,c). The H2 sorption isotherm shows reversibility with an uptake of 20.12 cm3 g-1 (Figure S7). The CO2 sorption isotherm depicts type I isotherm at 298 and 273 K and type IV isotherm at 195 K. The uptake values of CO2 at 298 and 273 K were 17.1 and 24.3 cm3 g-1, respectively (Figure S8). However, the CO2 sorption isotherm at 195 K follows a two-step gate-opening adsorption isotherm, which sharply rises at a lower pressure and then increases sharply from 0.27 to 1 bar with an uptake of 129.2 cm3 g-1 (25.62 wt %) (). The desorption isotherm accompanied with a large hysteresis and incomplete branching indicates strong interactions between CO2 and activated 1. The gate-opening mechanism suggests that with an increase in pressure pore expansion takes place, followed by the facilitation of the affinity of polar groups toward CO2. \n\nThe selectivity values of a CO2/N2 mixture (15:85, flue gas composition) at 100 kPa are as follows: 54.08 at 298 K and 46.96 at 273 K (). These values are significantly higher than those for many well-known MOFs: PCN-61 (CO2/N2: 15/298 K), PCN-61 (CO2/N2: 15/298 K), JUC-141 (CO2/N2: 21.6/273 K and 27.6/298 K), Cu-BTTri (CO2/N2: 21/298 K), and en-Cu-BTTri (CO2/N2: 25/298 K). The high selectivity of 1 can be attributed to the presence of amine-functionalized Lewis basic sites, resulting in a significant selectivity of CO2 over N2. Furthermore, the water adsorption-desorption shows a type IV sorption isotherm with an uptake of 285 cm3 g-1 (corresponds to five H2O molecules per unit formula) at p/p 0 = 0.9 accompanied with a large desorption hysteresis () attributing to strong interaction with activated 1. To ascertain the selective adsorption behavior of Bz/Cy, the single-component vapor sorption experiment of Bz and Cy was carried out at 298 K. Strikingly, the uptake amount of Bz was immensely higher than that of Cy (STP, 52 cm3 g-1 for Bz and 8 cm3 g-1 for Cy, at p/p 0 ~ 1) (). The aforementioned gate opening was also observed for Bz at p/p 0 = 0.12, followed by higher uptake and hysteresis due to the presence of strong interaction between electron-deficient triazine and electron-rich Bz.
