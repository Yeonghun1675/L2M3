Compound (2) has a \u03c7M T value of 10.10 emu\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1 at 1 kOe and 300 K, which is also higher than that expected for a noninteracting couple of CoII and GdIII cations (9.75 emuK\u22c5mol-1; S Co = 3/2, S Gd = 7/2 and g = 2). The \u03c7M T value gradually decreases to reach a value of 8.1 emu\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1 at 8 K; then a more abrupt decrease is observed until 1.8 K, reaching a value of 4.7 emu\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1 (). Clearly, in both compounds a predominant antiferromagnetic coupling can be observed; however a ferrimagnetic behavior becomes evident below 8 K for (1). The higher \u03c7M T values observed for (1) and (2) have been associated with orbital contribution of CoII ions, which can be inferred from the plots of magnetization vs H/T, given as Supporting Information (Figure S4). Furthermore, the \u03c7M -1 vs T curves for (1) and (2) in the high temperature zone (above 50 K) follows the Curie-Weiss law, and the fit of the experimental data gives \u03b8 values of -14.1 and -4.2 K for (1) and (2), respectively.
