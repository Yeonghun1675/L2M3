No EPR signals were observed for Ti-TBP in dark, and only faint EPR signals corresponding to TBP\u22c5+ were observed in Hf-TBP and H4TBP upon light irradiation. The EPR results thus directly prove ET in Ti-TBP. To understand Ti3+-mediated ROS generation, O2 - was scavenged by benzoquinone to evaluate its influence on other ROSs (Figure S12, Supporting Information). 1O2 generation of Ti-TBP decreased at the same proportion as the emission of H4TBP (Figures S13 and S14, Supporting Information) due to luminescence quenching by benzoquinone. Negligible amounts of H2O2 and \u22c5OH were detected in the presence of benzoquinone (c,d), demonstrating that both H2O2 and \u22c5OH are generated from O2 -.
