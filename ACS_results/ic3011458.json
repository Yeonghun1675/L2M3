Thermal factors of nitrogen (N1A) and carbon (C1A) atoms in a coordinated DMF molecule were restrained by using SIMU, DELU, and ISOR during the least-squares refinement. The crystal structure of 1\u2283nitrobenzene was solved by a direct method with the SHELXTL-XS program and refined by full-matrix least-squares calculations with the SHELX-TL (version 2008) program package. Two ligands, four Li ions, two coordinated water molecules, and one nitrobenzene molecule as a guest were observed as an asymmetric unit. After soaking 1 in nitrobenzene, its single crystallinity was decreased to result in inferior quality of the data to 1. The nitro group in a nitrobenzene molecule was restrained using DFIX, DANG, SIMU, and DELU during the least-squares refinement. For both structures, all non-H atoms were refined anisotropically. The H atoms were assigned isotropic displacement coefficients U(H) = 1.2U(C,N) or 1.5U(Cmethyl), and their coordinates were allowed to ride on their respective atoms. All of the methyl H atoms and some H atoms on the C atoms were not included during the least-squares refinement.

After stirring at 0 \u00b0C for 3 h, the solution was evaporated under reduced pressure, which resulted in a pale-yellowish oily residue. Methanol (MeOH) was added to the residue until white microcrystals of bis(4-bromophenyl)-N-methylamine were formed. The product was filtered, washed with MeOH, and dried briefly in air. Yield: 3.9 g (35%). 1H NMR (DMSO-d 6): \u03b4 7.43 (d, 4H), 6.97 (d, 4H), 3.22 (s, 3H). Bis(4-bromophenyl)-N-methylamine (1.0 g, 2.9 mmol) was dissolved in freshly distilled tetrahydrofuran (40 mL) in an Ar(g) atmosphere, and n-butyllithium (1.6 M hexane, 12 mL, 19 mmol) was added to the solution at -78 \u00b0C. After the solution was stirred for 3 h, crushed dry ice was added, and a white precipitate immediately formed. The white precipitate suspended in the solution was kept at room temperature for 4 h, and acetic acid was added to the solution until the precipitate was completely dissolved. After the solution was filtered, the filtrate was concentrated and added to cold water. The resulting precipitate was filtered, washed with water, and dried under reduced pressure at ambient temperature. Yield: 0.62 g (79%). 1H NMR (DMSO-d 6): \u03b4 7.86 (d, 4H), 7.15 (d, 4H), 3.31 (s, 3H). FT-IR (KBr pellet): \u03bdO-C\ue5fbO 1673(s), 1593(s) cm-1.\n\nSynthesis of {Li3[Li(DMF)2](CPMA)2}\u22c54DMF\u22c5H2O  [1; DMF = N,N'-Dimethylformamide, H2CPMA = Bis(4-carboxyphenyl)-N-methylamine]\n\nH2CPMA (0.040 g, 1.5 \u00d7 10-1 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (2 mL) and added to a DMF solution (3 mL) of LiNO3\u22c56H2O (0.021 g, 3.0 \u00d7 10-1mmol). The mixture was placed in a Teflon vessel within the autoclave, heated, and kept at 150 \u00b0C for 12 h. The temperature was sequentially raised to 180 \u00b0C and kept for another 24 h. The solution was cooled to room temperature and kept until pale-yellow rodlike crystals resulted. The crystals were filtered off and washed briefly with DMF. Yield: 22%. FT-IR for 1 (Nujol mull): \u03bdC\ue5fbO(DMF) 1678, \u03bdO-C\ue5fbO(carboxylate) 1595, \u03bdC\ue5fbC(aromatic) 1557 cm-1. UV/vis (diffuse reflectance, \u03bbmax): 339, 283 nm. Anal.
