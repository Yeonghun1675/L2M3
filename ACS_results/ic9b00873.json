In order\nto gain further information for structure\u2013property interpretation\nand propose a plausible mechanism for the acetone-triggered on\u2013off\nluminescence switching, we managed to obtain the acetone-loaded crystals\n(<bold>1-acetone</bold>) in good quality for single-crystal X-ray\ncrystallography data collection (see the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b00873/suppl_file/ic9b00873_si_001.pdf\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Supporting Information</ext-link>). The locations of the acetone molecules have been\nrevealed, and multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions between the guest\nacetone and host framework have been confirmed in the crystal structure\nof <bold>1-acetone</bold>. As shown in , each of the absorbed acetone molecules\nwas locked on the surface of the framework by forming two hydrogen\nbonds with the H atom of the terminal water molecule and the uncoordinated\ncarboxylate O atom, respectively. We speculate that the pipe-and-cavity\nstructure in channel B functions as a molecular sieve, which allows\nonly small molecules such as acetone (molecule diameter: 4.6 \u00c5) to go through and reach the binding sites in\nthe cavities. Furthermore, the specific geometry of the cavity greatly\npromotes host\u2013guest interactions with acetone by forming multiple\nhydrogen bonds. The incorporation of acetone in the channel rearranged\nthe ligand orientations, and the distance between the \u03c0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0\nconjugated benzene rings of 6-BA and TBAPy expands from 3.685 to 5.642\n\u00c5. These results suggest that the exclusive luminescence quenching\nof <bold>1</bold> in the presence of acetone might be ascribed to\nenergy transfer from pyrene ligands to acetone molecules.\n</p>", "clean_text": "According to previous reports, luminescence quenching by either ions or small molecules was usually caused by collapse of the framework, guest exchange, competing absorption, host-guest interaction, etc. For Zn-based LMOFs, luminescence was mostly generated from ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) and/or intraligand charge transfer (n-\u03c0* or \u03c0-\u03c0*). 1, 6-BA, and H4TBAPy were first measured by their UV-vis absorption (Figure S14). The absorption spectrum of 1 features two intense and broad emission bands (250-330 and 350-460 nm), largely overlapped with the absorption spectrum of acetone (220-320 nm). Thus, the competing absorption of excitation light by acetone may weaken the energy transfer in 1, resulting in a reduced luminescence intensity. In order to gain further information for structure-property interpretation and propose a plausible mechanism for the acetone-triggered on-off luminescence switching, we managed to obtain the acetone-loaded crystals (1-acetone) in good quality for single-crystal X-ray crystallography data collection (see the Supporting Information). The locations of the acetone molecules have been revealed, and multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions between the guest acetone and host framework have been confirmed in the crystal structure of 1-acetone. As shown in , each of the absorbed acetone molecules was locked on the surface of the framework by forming two hydrogen bonds with the H atom of the terminal water molecule and the uncoordinated carboxylate O atom, respectively.
