Manganese(II) acetate tetrahydrate (122 mg, 0.50 mmol), the ligand (32 mg of H3Shi, 34 mg of H3 p-aShi, or 46 mg of H3 p-pyShi; 0.21 mmol), and sodium acetate trihydrate (28 mg, 0.2 mmol) were each dissolved in 2 mL of DMF. The three solutions were mixed with stirring in the following order: manganese(II) acetate, H3L, and sodium acetate. The resulting dark brown solution was stirred for 4 h and then centrifuged to remove insoluble impurities. Slow evaporation of the supernatant at room temperature gave dark brown crystals suitable for XRD analysis within 4 weeks. Yields of compounds 11 and 13 were 28% and 2%, respectively. The synthesis of 12 was attempted several times, giving a few crystals of the compound only twice. From the other synthesis, a 12-MC-4 of formula {MnII(OAc)2(O-DMF)5[12-MCMn,p-aShi-4]}(DMF)2 was obtained (compound 12bis). The structural description of this 12-MC-4 is provided as Supporting Information. The three complexes correspond to the following formulas: Na4[(MnII)2(MnIII)9(\u03bc3-O)4(OAc)9(Shi)6(DMF)3](DMF)3(H2O)6.75 (11), Na3.5H0.5[(MnII)2(MnIII)9(\u03bc3-O)4(OAc)9(p-aShi)6](DMF)7.5(H2O)6 (12), and H[(MnII)2(MnIII)9(\u03bc3-O)4(OAc)3(OH)3(p-pyShi)6](H2O)6 (13). Several solvent molecules (not refined) are present in the channels of compounds 12 and 13, as deduced by the presence of residual electron density.
