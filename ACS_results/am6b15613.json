Thus, the luminescence of Eu3+ can provide valuable information about the local environment and make it very suitable for acting as a structural probe deciphering the symmetry of the chemical environment. Especially, the ratio of the intensities for 5D0 \u2192 7F2 and 5D0 \u2192 7F1 transitions is very sensitive to the symmetry of the Eu3+ centers, because the 5D0 \u2192 7F1 emission is attributed to the magnetic dipole and independent of the environment, while the 5D0 \u2192 7F2 emission is due to the electric dipole, sensitive to the crystal field symmetry. As shown in b, for the original sample UJN-Eu4, the intensity ratio of the 5D0 \u2192 7F2 and 5D0 \u2192 7F1 transitions is 7.7, while the intensity ratio of UJN-Eu4 exposed to pure water is determined to be 9.1. The larger increased value in the intensity ratio of 5D0 \u2192 7F2 and 5D0 \u2192 7F1 transitions suggests that the environment of Eu3+ for the sample exposed to solvent aqueous molecules is probably less symmetric and much more strained than that of the original sample, thus triggering enhancement of Eu3+ emission. This consequence can be exemplified by the crystal structure of UJN-Eu4 as mentioned below. The crystal structure for UJN-Eu4 shows that one coordinated water molecule is presented independently in the axial position of the trigonal antiprism. Upon exposure to solvent water, the coordinated water molecule will interact with the solvent aqueous molecules through one face of the trigonal antiprism. Therefore, the environment of Eu3+ becomes less symmetric, resulting in some strain between the coordinated water and some solvent aqueous molecules (). When the wet sample was air-dried in room temperature, the solvent aqueous molecules were removed, which would again give rise to a coordinated water molecule lonely residing in the axial position of the trigonal antiprism.

Two types of synergistic coordination linkages are simultaneously observed in constructing the wheel cluster layer-pillared structure: one is between the triangular pyramidal Ln4 SBUs and dcd ligands adopting anti-conformations; the other is between the Ln24 wheel cluster layers and dcd ligands adopting gauche-conformations. These two synergistic coordination linkages work together to promote the formation of finely porous Ln-WCOFs featuring hydrophobic nanosized channels surrounded by 1D trigonal antiprism arrays with hydrophilic cagelike chambers. This is the first observation that the nanosized lanthanide wheel cluster layers formed by Ln24 TBUs are further pillared by dcd ligands in Ln-WCOFs. Moreover, these Ln-WCOFs demonstrate exceptional water stability attributed to the hydrophobicity of nanosized channels. Photoluminescent studies reveal that solvent water molecules can enhance the fluorescence intensity of solid-state UJN-Eu4 in our homemade sensor cell used as the solid-state photoluminescence measurements in H2O and different aqueous solutions. Due to the competitive absorption and emission responses between different metal ions and the solid-state sample, water-stable UJN-Eu4 is highly sensitive toward Fe3+ and Cu2+ ions in aqueous solutions through fluorescence quenching (turn-off). Most importantly, UJN-Eu4 also demonstrates highly sensitive sensing of SDBS in aqueous medium through fluorescence enhancement (turn-on). The enhanced luminescence response of UJN-Eu4 to SDBS likely originates from the direct excitation of UJN-Eu4 associated with indirect energy transfer between the excited sulfonate groups and the Eu3+ skeletons. To our knowledge, this is the first example of quantitatively detecting SDBS in aqueous solutions by employing luminescent lanthanide frameworks as fluorescent sensors. Moreover, used as a recyclable luminescent sensor, UJN-Eu4 can also be reused by simple water-washing. We anticipate that many Ln-WCOFs would be synthesized through other cycloalkane dicarboxylic acid derivatives, strongly corroborating a less-investigated but feasible strategy by employing cyclopropane dicarboxylic acid derivatives as ligands to design and assemble new luminescent Ln-WCOFs applied in sensitive detection of harmful pollutants in aquatic environments.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 39, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting\nInformation is available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at\nDOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsami.6b15613\">10.1021/acsami.6b15613</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Schematic representation of homemade sensor cell used\nas the solid-state photoluminescence measurements in H<sub>2</sub>O and different aqueous solution, mechanism speculation on the luminescent\nenhancement for SDBS, blocklike single crystal pictures, FT-IR spectra,\nthe experimental and simulated PXRD patterns, the single Eu24 wheel\ncluster viewed as TBU, the single hydrophobic 12-membered-ring channel\nsurrounded by six trigonal antiprism arrays, perspective view of the\nhydrophilic cagelike chamber and the free hydrophobic channel, the\nequivalent 3D topology framework, the TG/DTA curves, temperature-dependent\nPXRD patterns, the PXRD patterns for the rehydrated and freshly isolated\nsamples, water vapor sorption isotherm for <bold>UJN-Eu4</bold> measured\nat 298 K, emission spectra for the adhesive film before and after\nexposure to pure water, emission spectra of <bold>UJN-Eu4</bold> before\nand after exposure to pure water, schematic representation of the\ninteractions between the coordinated water and solvent aqueous molecules,\nemission spectra for <bold>UJN-Eu4</bold> soaked in different concentrations\nof metal ions and SDBS aqueous solutions, UV\u2013vis absorption\nspectrum of FeCl<sub>3</sub> in aqueous solution and UV\u2013vis\ndiffuse reflectivity spectrum of solid-state <bold>UJN-Eu4</bold>,\nUV\u2013vis absorption spectrum of CuCl<sub>2</sub> in aqueous solutions,\nexcitation and emission spectra of SDBS solution, schematic representation\nof the indirect energy transfer between the excited sulfonate groups\nand the Eu<sup>3+</sup> skeletons (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.6b15613/suppl_file/am6b15613_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Txt file (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.6b15613/suppl_file/am6b15613_si_002.txt\">TXT</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acsami.6b15613.

This is consistent with the fact that the freshly isolated UJN-Eu4 contains one coordinated water molecule in its formula of Eu4(\u03bc4-dcd)6(H2O).
