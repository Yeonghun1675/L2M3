The phase purities of the three MOFs have been confirmed\nby PXRD (Figure S1, ). To evaluate the storage capability of the three desolvated MOFs,\nnitrogen and CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption studies were conducted. The\nthree N<sub>2</sub> adsorption isotherms reveal type I behavior (Figure ). The N<sub>2</sub> adsorptions of three MOF materials\nare very low at 77 K, as are the calculated accessible surface areas,\nwhich is probably due to the distorted framework upon removal of the\nsolvent molecules. Adsorption measurements\nof CO<sub>2</sub> were carried out up to about 800 Torr at 273 K (Figure ). Interestingly, though only a small N<sub>2</sub> loading, the CO<sub>2</sub> uptake of Cu-DDQ is considerably high.\nCu-DDQ can uptake nearly 26.1 wt % (180 cm<sup>3</sup>/g STP) of CO<sub>2</sub> at 800 Torr and 273 K. In comparison to the numerous MOFs\nreported with higher accessible porosity, only a few MOFs display\na CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption to such a value. The CO<sub>2</sub> uptake of Zn-DDQ is also very high at 12.8 wt\n% (75 cm<sup>3</sup>/g STP) of CO<sub>2</sub> at 800 Torr and 273\nK. Indeed, the void volumes of these two MOFs are less than 35%. These\nvalues are better than those of MOF-5 and MOF-177, which have greater\nBrunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller surface area. The observed enhancement in CO<sub>2</sub> adsorptions\nis mostly attributed to the N\u2013H groups on pyrazine decorating\nthe channels. As is well known, N\u2013H groups here can be considered\nnot only as a kind of basic group but also as hydrogen-bond donors\nwhich can catch the CO<sub>2</sub> molecules with hydrogen-bonding\ninteractions. Moreover, in light of such high CO<sub>2</sub> and low\nN<sub>2</sub> uptake, Cu-DDQ can be used as an efficient material\nfor CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> selectivity.\n</p>", "clean_text": "For Zn-DDQ, the asymmetric unit consists of one Zn ion, one H2DDQ ligand, and two coordinated H2O molecules. The central ZnII ion is five-coordinated to form a slightly disordered rectangular pyramid with two N atoms from the chelating N-H group (Zn-N = 2.083(11) and 2.093(11) \u00c5) and three O atoms from one carboxylate group with the \u03b71 mode and two H2O molecules (Zn-O = 2.020(8)-2.083(10) \u00c5). Only one of the carboxylates of the ligand is connected to the central Zn ions; the other is deprotonated to balance the charge and linked to the nearest coordinated H2O by a strong hydrogen-bonding interaction with an O2\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O5 distance of 2.736 \u00c5. The DDQ2- ligand here acts as an unpredictable bridging mode which connects the Zn ions into a 1D chain from the a axis with a Zn\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Zn distance of 9.536 \u00c5 (Figure a). The 1D chains are further connected to the 2D layer via strong face-to-face \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 stacking interactions between the adjacent quinoxaline rings with a centroid to centroid distance of 3.426 \u00c5 (Figure b). After the solvated molecules are removed, there is 34.7% void space in the total crystal volume (total potential solvent area volume 965.8 \u00c53 per unit cell volume 2781.1 \u00c53). From Figure c, the 3D porous frameworks show special divergence-like pores (15.6 \u00c5 \u00d7 10.8 \u00c5) which have been rarely reported to our knowledge from the c axis.\n\nThere are two Cu atoms with different coordination modes in the structure of Cu-DDQ. Cu1 is six-coordinated by two N atoms from the chelating N-H group and four O atoms from two different DDQ2- molecules in the bridging bidentate mode, forming a distorted-octahedral geometry. With the bridging mode of the DDQ2- ligand, the Cu1 atoms are connected to form 1D chains from the c axis with a Cu1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu1 distance of 8.95 \u00c5 (Figure a). For Cu2, which is five-coordinated, two carboxylate oxygen atoms from two adjacent DDQ2- molecules occupy its apical positions, and three coordinated H2O molecules are in the equatorial plane with Cu-O bond lengths in the range 1.985(12)-2.338(11) \u00c5. Cu2 atoms in the structures act as bridging atoms which connect the 1D chain into 2D layers to afford a 2D undulant network with a 4-connected (44\u22c562) kg m net topology (Figure b). Then these adjacent 2D layers are further interconnected by \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 stacking interactions between the quinoxaline rings to form the 3D open framework (Figure c). Meanwhile, the 1D cuboid-shaped channel can be viewed along the c axis with ca. 15.27 \u00c5 \u00d7 9.34 \u00c5 windows (Figure ). The total potential solvent accessible void volume was calculated to be 963.1 \u00c53 per cell, 33.5% of the crystal volume.\n\nOn the basis of the substantive weight loss from the TGA analyses (Figure S2, ), there should be organic solvents such as DMF and H2O inside the MOF channels. The phase purities of the three MOFs have been confirmed by PXRD (Figure S1, ). To evaluate the storage capability of the three desolvated MOFs, nitrogen and CO2 adsorption studies were conducted. The three N2 adsorption isotherms reveal type I behavior (Figure ). The N2 adsorptions of three MOF materials are very low at 77 K, as are the calculated accessible surface areas, which is probably due to the distorted framework upon removal of the solvent molecules. Adsorption measurements of CO2 were carried out up to about 800 Torr at 273 K (Figure ). Interestingly, though only a small N2 loading, the CO2 uptake of Cu-DDQ is considerably high. Cu-DDQ can uptake nearly 26.1 wt % (180 cm3/g STP) of CO2 at 800 Torr and 273 K. In comparison to the numerous MOFs reported with higher accessible porosity, only a few MOFs display a CO2 adsorption to such a value. The CO2 uptake of Zn-DDQ is also very high at 12.8 wt % (75 cm3/g STP) of CO2 at 800 Torr and 273 K. Indeed, the void volumes of these two MOFs are less than 35%.
