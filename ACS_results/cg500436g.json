They exhibit different 3D net topologies but all contain trinuclear [Zn3(COO)8] building units. Compound 1 shows an 8-connected bcg net just based on [Zn3(COO)8] nodes, while compound 2 displays an 8-connected bcu net based on two similar [Zn3(COO)8] nodes. Interestingly, compound 3 represents a novel (4,8)-connected flu net based on the trinuclear nodes [Zn3(COO)8] and the binuclear nodes [Zn2(COO)4]. Gas sorption measurements indicate that the desolvated host 1-ht exhibits permanent porosity with Langmuir surface area of 630.5 m2\u22c5g-1 and a H2 uptake of 109.5 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 77 K and 1 atm, as well as a selective sorption of CO2 over N2 at 0 \u00b0C and ambient pressure.\n\nIn this work, by employing the H2thb ligand to assembly with Zn2+ ions, we successfully synthesized three anionic Zn-thb frameworks, which all contain trinuclear [Zn3(COO)8] building units and exhibit different net topologies. Compound 1, (Me2NH2)2\u22c5[Zn3(thb)4]\u22c5\u03c7G, shows an 8-connected bcg net just based on [Zn3(COO)8] nodes, while compound 2, (Et4N)2\u22c5[Zn3(thb)4]\u22c5\u03c7G, displays an 8-connected bcu net based on two similar [Zn3(COO)8] nodes. Interestingly, compound 3, (Bu4N)\u22c5[Zn3.5(thb)4(DMF)3]\u22c5\u03c7G, represents a novel (4,8)-connected flu net based on not only the trinuclear nodes [Zn3(COO)8] but also the binuclear nodes [Zn2(COO)4]. The desolvated host 1-ht shows permanent porosity with Langmuir surface area of 630.5 m2\u22c5g-1 and a H2 uptake of 109.5 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 77 K and 1 atm. In addition, at 0 \u00b0C and ambient pressure, 1-ht can separate CO2 from N2.\n\nCrystal Data\n\nCompound 1: Space group Fddd, orthorhombic, a = 33.1272(12) \u00c5, b = 65.1158(10) \u00c5, c = 19.1804(3) \u00c5, \u03b1 = 90.00\u00b0, \u03b2 = 90.00\u00b0, \u03b3 = 90.00\u00b0, V = 41374.1(18) \u00c53, T = 100.00(11), Z = 32, 23187 reflections measured, 6345 independent reflections (R int = 0.0388). The final R 1 value was 0.1166 (I > 2\u03c3(I)). The final wR(F 2) value was 0.3022 (I > 2\u03c3(I)). The goodness of fit on F 2 was 1.042. Compound 2: Space group Pnc2, orthorhombic, a = 14.6561(5) \u00c5, b = 23.4491(6) \u00c5, c = 16.0392(7) \u00c5, \u03b1 = 90.00\u00b0, \u03b2 = 90.00\u00b0, \u03b3 = 90.00\u00b0, V = 5512.2(3) \u00c53, T = 293(2) K, Z = 4, 11346 reflections measured, 6337 independent reflections (R int = 0.0209). The final R 1 value was 0.0387 (I > 2\u03c3(I)). The final wR(F 2) value was 0.1121 (I > 2\u03c3(I)). The goodness of fit on F 2 was 1.025. Compound 3: Space group P1\u0305, triclinic, a = 15.5168(7) \u00c5, b = 16.7790(8) \u00c5, c = 18.7394(11) \u00c5, \u03b1 = 94.142(4)\u00b0, \u03b2 = 113.527(5)\u00b0, \u03b3 = 110.215(4)\u00b0, V = 4070.6(4) \u00c53, T = 293(2) K, Z = 1, 14821 reflections measured, 9907 independent reflections (R int = 0.0931). The final R 1 value was 0.0518 (I > 2\u03c3(I)). The final wR(F 2) value was 0.1352 (I > 2\u03c3(I)). The goodness of fit on F 2 was 0.892.\n\nThe thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curve of 1 reveals a weight loss of 25.03% before 250 \u00b0C, corresponding to the release of DMF and MeCN molecules (Figure S6, ). The host framework of 1 can be stable up to 300 \u00b0C. For gas sorption studies, 1 was activated at 150 \u00b0C for 7 h under high vacuum and then formed the hollow samples 1-ht. Compared to 1, the peak positions in the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of 1-ht are just slightly changed (Figure S7, ). This result indicates that the host framework of 1 underwent a slight change after the removal of guest molecules.\n\nTo investigate the permanent porosity of desolvated 1-ht, the adsorption experiments of N2 and Ar were measured at 77 and 87 K, respectively (Figure a). The uptake of Ar for 1-ht is ~171.6 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 1 atm. For N2, it shows reversible and typical type I adsorption isotherm behavior, which is characteristic of a microporous material. The N2 uptake capacity of 1 reaches 146.3 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 1 atm. The BET and Langmuir surface areas are 453.2 and 630.5 m2\u22c5g-1, respectively. The measured pore volume from the N2 sorption is 0.226 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 1 atm. Actually, these measured pore parameters are relatively low. The main factor may be that cations occupy the part of the channel or some even block the pore window, which further prevent N2 to enter into the channel.\n\nThe H2 sorption isotherms at 77 and 87 K for 1-ht were also investigated (Figure a). For 1-ht, the H2 uptake capacity reaches 109.5 cm3\u22c5g-1 (0.98 wt %) at 77 K and 1 atm, a value closing to those of recently reported MOFs at the same condition. The H2 adsorption enthalpy (Qst) of 1-ht calculated by the virial equation from the adsorption isotherms measured at 77 and 87 K is 7.1 kJ\u22c5mol-1. In addition, the CO2 uptake of 1-ht at 273 and 298 K can reach 50.4 cm3\u22c5g-1 (2.25 mmol\u22c5g-1) and 44.9 cm3\u22c5g-1 (2.00 mmol\u22c5g-1), respectively (Figure b). However, under the same measurement conditions, it can hardly adsorb N2 (1.27 cm3\u22c5g-1). At zero coverage, the CO2 adsorption enthalpy for 1-ht is 10.2 kJ\u22c5mol-1. In a range of pressures up to 1 atm at 273 K, the adsorption selectivity for CO2/N2 with mole ratios of 20:80 is 41 (Figure c), which was calculated using ideal solution adsorbed theory (IAST). Obviously, at 273 K and 1 atm, 1-ht can separate CO2 from N2.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn summary, by employment of the 2,5-thiophenedicarboxylic acid (H2thb) ligand to assemble with the Zn2+ ions by tuning different organic cations, three anionic Zn-thb frameworks containing [Zn3(COO)8] units and exhibiting different net topologies are presented here.
