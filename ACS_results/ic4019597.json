All of the conductivity values here reported refer to measurements carried out after the conductivity had reached a constant value for at least 2 hours. Water uptake at controlled temperature and RH was determined by means of a cell having the same size and shape as the conductivity cell and differing from that mainly because the pellet holder is replaced by a glass container hosting the sample. The cell is equipped with a device that allows the closure of the sample container with a Teflon plug without opening the cell. After a suitable equilibration time (usually 1 day) at the desired temperature and RH, the sample container is closed, extracted from the cell, and weighed. The water content is determined on the basis of the weight of the sample dried at 120 \u00b0C by taking into account the amount of water trapped in the sample container at the temperature and RH of the experiment.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 20, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Structure Determination and Refinement for <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>3</bold>\n</title><p>The crystal structures of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> were solved ab initio from PXRD data.
