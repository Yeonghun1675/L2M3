Crystallization from a MeCN solution containing Ag[Co(C2B9H11)2] and 0.5 or 1.0 equiv of dabco gives single crystals of [Ag(dabco)]\u22c5[Co(C2B9H11)2] with a needle-like morphology. We have previously reported the structure of this complex which features a linear 1D [Ag(dabco)]+ chain. Crystallization from a MeCN solution with Ag[Co(C2B9H11)2] and 2 or more equivalents of dabco gives crystals with prismatic morphology and composition [Ag2(dabco)3(CH3CN)2]\u22c52[Co(C2B9H11)2] 2. The highest yield of 2 was obtained with 4 equiv of dabco. The crystal structure of complex 2 was solved in space group P21/n. There are two crystallographically independent Ag(I) sites each on a general position. Both Ag(I) cations have approximately tetrahedral geometries each with three dabco ligands (Ag-N distances from 2.329(15) to 2.398(15) \u00c5) and one acetonitrile ligand (Ag-N distances 2.382(18) and 2.44(3) \u00c5). The dabco ligands bridge between two Ag(I) sites, while the MeCN ligand is terminally coordinated; hence a three-connected coordination polymer is formed, Figure . The coordination polymer has 3D connectivity forming 10-membered rings, Figure b. The topology of the network is (10,3)-b or ths  topology. There are substantial channels throughout the network; however, these are filled by the terminal acetonitrile ligands which are directed into the center of the rectangular channels, Figure a, and by the bulky [Co(C2B9H11)2]- counteranions (). There are a number of close B-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5H-C distances between neighboring [Co(C2B9H11)2]- anions, indicating the presence of dihydrogen bonding. The closest interactions are at separations 1.63, 1.89, and 1.94 \u00c5, which are similar to those previously reported for dihydrogen interactions between [Co(C2B9H11)2]- anions.
