Similar powder patterns, as recorded in the room temperature spectrum of 2, were detected for vast number of copper dinuclear systems, especially copper carboxylates (Cu2(O2CR)4L2), as well as for Cu3(btc)2(H2O)3, [Zn1-x Cu x (bdc)(dabco)]0.5  and STAM-1 MOFs, which contain similar Cu2 PW units. The first interpretation of such spectrum was already given in 1952 by B. Bleaney and K.D. Bowers, who observed an atypical single crystal spectrum of Cu2+ acetate monohydrate, (Cu(CH3COO)2(H2O)2). They concluded that the two S = (1/2) spins of two interconnected Cu2+ ions (electronic configuration of a single Cu2+ ion is 3d9, S = (1/2)) couple antiferromagnetically into the S = 0 ground state (EPR silent), but the excited S = 1 triplet state (susceptible to EPR spectroscopy) is thermally populated at elevated temperatures. This coupling occurs because two unpaired electrons reside in the d  x 2-y 2  orbitals of Cu2+, and thus they can be exchanged as a result of the superexchange interaction, which is mediated via diamagnetic carboxylate groups. The PW unit in the investigated MOF also contains two Cu2+ ions connected via four carboxylate groups (see Figure ).

Similar values of the interdinuclear exchange coupling constant were observed in the chains of Cu2 dinuclear units of formula [Cu(trans-2-butenoate)4] n  (J' = 5.9 cm-1, bridges between apical positions)31 and Cu2(syn,syn-\u03b71:\u03b71:\u03bc-MeCOO)4(anti,anti-\u03b71:\u03b71:\u03bc-MeCOO)(Et3NH)] n  (J' = -25 cm-1, bridges between basal positions). In these compounds, the exchange pathways are much shorter (up to 4 bonds) compared with the pathway that connects two PW units in the investigated MOF (19 bonds), making it a rather poor candidate for the electron exchange path. Moreover, if the exchange is mediated through the linker, then it is unclear why the interdinuclear exchange does not occur in 2. Therefore, it seems that the exchange among the triplets of the Cu2+ pairs is mediated via apical positions of the PW units, since the distance between two Cu2+ ions from the neighboring units is only 4.99 \u00c5. The removal of the axially coordinating water may create a weak interaction between two PWs, permitting the exchange. For example, it was found that two dinuclear copper units form a stacked dimer unit via Cu\ue5f8O coordination with Cu\ue5f8O distance of 2.22 \u00c5, where Cu and O atoms are from different units. However, the Cu\ue5f8O distance of 4.23 \u00c5, determined for the investigated MOF, is too big to form such a bond. Thus, the observation of the interdinuclear exchange interaction across such an extended distance seems to be unique and the precise origin of the interdinuclear exchange path in the investigated MOF still remains unclear.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 42, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>It should\nbe also mentioned that few approximations were involved\nin the simulation of the interdinuclear exchange line.
