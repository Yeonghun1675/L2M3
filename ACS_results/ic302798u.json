Upon the addition of Zn(ClO4)2 to a CD3CN solution of BrL14, peaks associated with the pyridyl protons (peaks \"a\"-\"d\" in Figure ), aliphatic methylene protons (peaks \"e\" and \"f\" in Figure ), and 1,2,3-triazolyl proton (peak \"T\" in Figure ) are broadened. The two methylene Hf protons shift upfield from the 2:1 ligand/zinc(II) ratio, similar to the observations made with compound 1. At a ligand/zinc(II) ratio of 2:1, the pyridyl and aliphatic protons, comparing to 4-phenyl-1,2,3-triazolyl protons, are disproportionally broadened, which is an indication that the N,N-di(2-picolyl)amino group preferentially binds zinc(II) at the early stage of the titration to form a 2:1 ligand/zinc(II) complex (see structures on the right margin of Figure ). As the concentration of zinc(II) increases, the peaks resharpen and are shifted downfield. The four methylene protons He (Figure ) are now split into two doublets under the constraints of a five-membered chelating ring with increased kinetic stability, while Hf protons of the 1,2,3-triazolyl group remain a singlet. This observation indicates that the dissociation of pyridyl/zinc(II) coordination is slower than that of 1,2,3-triazolyl N3 and zinc(II) ion.

Under these conditions, the 1:1 ligand/metal complex presumably forms directly without the intermediacy of a 2:1 complex that was observed in the 1H NMR titration experiments. At least five different zinc(II) concentrations for each ligand were used, and multiple experiments were conducted on different days to ensure reproducibility. The experimentally determined k obs (rate = k obs[L]) values were plotted versus zinc(II) concentration, the slope of which yields the second-order rate constant k on (k obs = k on[zinc(II)]; see ).

In the solid state, L15 is a tridentate ligand for zinc(II) in the 1:1 ligand/metal complex, while an intermolecular 1,2,3-triazolyl coordination is maintained in the single crystals to result in a coordination polymer. The 2:1 BrL15/zinc(II) complex crystallizes into a fac stereoisomer with C 2 symmetry, which is shown to be the thermodynamically stable form in solution. The equilibrium constant of N3 1,2,3-triazolyl/CH3CN exchange for zinc(II) binding is 18 (-1.7 kcal/mol at 298 K), as determined in an ITC experiment. This value represents the benefit of enlisting 1,2,3-triazolyl in cooperative binding to the overall zinc(II) affinity in CH3CN. 1H NMR titrations of 1,4- and 1,5-isomers with Zn(ClO4)2 reveal the structural details of the 2:1 and 1:1 ligand/zinc(II) complexes, which are corroborated by the conclusion from the single-crystal X-ray data. Competition binding experiments and stopped-flow data show that the 1,4-isomeric ligand (FL14) with an integrated 1,2,3-triazolyl binds stronger and faster with zinc(II) ions than the 1,5-isomer FL15. FL14 and FL15 are viable fluorescent indicators for zinc(II) ions in live-cell imaging experiments. Both indicators report a large intracellular fluorescence enhancement when zinc(II) in the growth medium is enriched, while no toxic effect was observed over the course of the staining/imaging experiments. FL14 is capable of staining endogenous zinc(II) in the dentate gyrus and CA3 regions of rat hippocampus, which is known to accumulate free zinc(II) ions. FL15 is ineffective due to a low affinity to zinc(II) and overall low achievable fluorescence quantum yield. Both the brightness at the excitation wavelength (\u03b5 \u00d7 \u03d5F = 4672 at 350 nm) and fluorescence quantum yield of the zinc(II) complex of FL14 (\u03d5F = 0.64) are significant improvements over those previously reported for compound 1 (\u03b5 \u00d7 \u03d5F = 711 at 300 nm, \u03d5F = 0.14), thus achieving the objective stated in the  section.
