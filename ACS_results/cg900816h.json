These solvent molecules play a significant role in the formation of the MPF-3 phase because we note that the MPF-3 phase does not form without DMF. Many experiments were conducted using various solvents and solvent ratios. No combination of solvents or solvent ratios that excluded DMF produced MPF-3 crystal. We hypothesize that the DMF molecule may act as a template in the formation of the framework, as has been noted in previous studies on other MOF syntheses. The interactions between the 2D layers and the guest molecules could affect the interlayer spacing. Since the reflections corresponding to the 2D interlayer spacing are often the most intense, X-ray powder diffraction can be used to monitor the interlayer spacing of the 2D layered materials.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 19, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig7\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>7</label>\n<caption>\n<p>X-ray powder diffraction patterns for MPF-3.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr7\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"cg-2009-00816h_0007.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 7  X-ray powder diffraction patterns for MPF-3.
