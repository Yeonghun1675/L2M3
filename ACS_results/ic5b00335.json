The TG analysis curve for complex <bold>1</bold> shows a weight\nloss of about 10.5% near 100 \u00b0C, which corresponds to the loss\nof one ethanol molecule (calc. 10.7%). Then, it follows a continuous\nweight loss from 160 to 300 \u00b0C attributed to consecutive loss\nof one water molecule (obsd. 4.0%, calc. 4.2%). The compound begins\nto decompose when the temperature is raised to 380 \u00b0C. Finally,\ncomplex <bold>1</bold> was completely degraded into ZnO with a total\nloss of 80.5 wt % (calc. 81.1 wt %). Furthermore, the pH-dependent\nstabilities of <bold>1</bold> in aqueous solutions were investigated\nby XRPD (Figure ). For these tests, 50 mg\nof as-synthesized <bold>1</bold> was soaked in aqueous solutions with\ndifferent pH values and stirred for 3 days at room temperature. According\nto these results, complex <bold>1</bold> is stable in a pH range from\n5 to 9 but unstable in either strong acid (pH 2\u20133) or strong\nbase (pH 13\u201314). This stability is lower than several aluminum-isophthalate-based\nMOFs (CAU-10-X, where X = H, CH<sub>3</sub>, OCH<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>2</sub>, and OH), but\nthe results are very remarkable, especially when compared with those\nof other MOFs constructed from aromatic carboxylate, N-containing\nauxiliary ligands, and zinc ions. The H<sub>2</sub>O sorption isotherm of <bold>1</bold> at 298 K has also been\nexplored to further evaluate its water stability (Figure ), which shows sorption hysteresis, indicating that\nthere is a hydrophilic interaction between water and the polar pore\nsurface due to the presence of one guest water molecule per asymmetric\nunit. Compound <bold>1</bold> displays a type V water isotherm, with\nlow water uptake (15.2 wt %) even up to a <italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>/<italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>\n<sub>0</sub> value of 1 and pore filling at higher relative\npressures (about <italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>/<italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>\n<sub>0</sub> = 0. 4) indicating that <bold>1</bold> possesses a hydrophobic pore. The repeated experiments based on the same batch of material shows\nthat <bold>1</bold> has excellent hydrostability (see Figure S3 of\nthe ). In addition,\nN<sub>2</sub> sorption measurements were used to examine the porosity\nof the MOF samples after soaking in water for 3 days. Compound <bold>1</bold> was activated (<bold>1a</bold>) at 150 \u00b0C for 12 h\nunder vacuum. The N<sub>2</sub> sorption isotherms were performed\nat 77 K and show a type I isotherm characteristic of a microporous\nmaterial (Figure ) with the BET surface area\nof 925 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>\u20131</sup>, which is well consistent\nwith the value obtained through theoretical calculations (see Figure\nS4 of the ). No significant\nloss in the BET surface area was observed (from 925 to 882 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>\u20131</sup>) for <bold>1</bold> after soaking in water\nfor 3 days, indicating the maintenance of the porous structures of <bold>1</bold> in water. The hydrophobic functional groups (\u2212NO<sub>2</sub> and \u2212CH<sub>3</sub>) are close to the zinc center\nwithin the framework of <bold>1</bold>, and could prevent the Zn\u2013O\nand Zn\u2013N bonds from attacking by water and thus effectively\nenhance the hydrophobic properties of <bold>1</bold>. Additionally,\nbulk samples were also measured by X-ray diffraction at room temperature\nto check the purity of <bold>1</bold>. As shown in Figure , all major peaks of the experimental PXRD patterns\nof compound <bold>1</bold> matches well that of simulated PXRD patterns,\nwhich clearly indicates the high purity of the complex.</p><title>Drug Delivery Studies</title><p>The surface\narea and pore diameter play a critical role in drug adsorption and\nrelease in porous frameworks as drug loading and release systems. N<sub>2</sub> adsorption measurements (HK model)\nindicate that the pore size of <bold>1</bold> is 8.9 \u00c5 (see Figure\nS5 of the ). Complex <bold>1</bold>, with wide-open channels (10.5 \u00d7 8.9 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>), is suitable for loading busulfan with a molecular size of 3.5\n\u00d7 13.4 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>. Incorporation\nof the busulfan molecule during the adsorption process was confirmed\nby FT-IR and N<sub>2</sub> sorption (more details in Figure S6, ) (Figure ). The characteristic peak of busulfan observed at 1349 cm<sup>\u20131</sup> is assigned to the stretching vibration of the S\ue5fbO\ngroup. The BET surface area of the busulfan loaded MOF is 63 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>\u20131</sup>, which shows ca. 93.2% reduction, as\ncompared with the as-synthesized sample (925 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>\u20131</sup>). The result indicates that there is almost no residual porosity\nafter drug adsorption; thus, the busulfan molecules approximately\nfilled up the pores and channels. HPLC was used to determine the effective\nstorage capacity of <bold>1a</bold>. To achieve a maximal drug loading\nof busulfan to the pore solid, different drug concentrations and contact\ntimes were tested (see Table S2 of the ).

As shown in Figure a, each Zn(II) center is four-coordinated by three oxygen atoms from three NO2-BDC ligands and one nitrogen atom from a dmbpy ligand, to give a distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry. The bond lengths surrounding the Zn(II) center (Zn-O and Zn-N bond distances) are in the range of 1.9292(17)-2.0206(19) \u00c5, and the bond angles are in range of 99.45(8)-116.55(8)\u00b0. The values are in agreement with those found in other four-coordinated Zn(II) complexes with oxygen and nitrogen donating ligands. In the crystal structure of 1, the NO2-BDC ligands act as a bridging \u03bc3 mode to link three metal ions, whereas the dmbpy ligand has a bridging \u03bc2 mode connecting two metal ions. In this manner, each \u03bc3-NO2-BDC ligand links two Zn atoms to obtain an infinite chain of [Zn2(NO2-BDC)4] n  with dinuclear zinc cores separated by 9.822 \u00c5 (see more details in Figure S1, ). The rigid \u03bc2-dmbpy struts point alternately up and down with respect to the chain and link neighboring chains to result in an ideal three-dimensional structure with the channels of 10.5 \u00d7 8.9 \u00c52 along the c axis (Figure S1, ) (Figure b and c). Moreover, the lattice water molecules and the ethanol molecules present in the framework can be confirmed by FT-IR and TGA spectra. The potential void is 1386.3 \u00c53, which is about 35.2% of the unit cell volume. \n\nThermal and Chemical Stability\n\nTo test the thermal stability of 1, we performed thermogravimetric analysis (see Figure S2 of the ). The TG analysis curve for complex 1 shows a weight loss of about 10.5% near 100 \u00b0C, which corresponds to the loss of one ethanol molecule (calc. 10.7%). Then, it follows a continuous weight loss from 160 to 300 \u00b0C attributed to consecutive loss of one water molecule (obsd. 4.0%, calc. 4.2%). The compound begins to decompose when the temperature is raised to 380 \u00b0C. Finally, complex 1 was completely degraded into ZnO with a total loss of 80.5 wt % (calc. 81.1 wt %). Furthermore, the pH-dependent stabilities of 1 in aqueous solutions were investigated by XRPD (Figure ). For these tests, 50 mg of as-synthesized 1 was soaked in aqueous solutions with different pH values and stirred for 3 days at room temperature. According to these results, complex 1 is stable in a pH range from 5 to 9 but unstable in either strong acid (pH 2-3) or strong base (pH 13-14). This stability is lower than several aluminum-isophthalate-based MOFs (CAU-10-X, where X = H, CH3, OCH3, NO2, NH2, and OH), but the results are very remarkable, especially when compared with those of other MOFs constructed from aromatic carboxylate, N-containing auxiliary ligands, and zinc ions. The H2O sorption isotherm of 1 at 298 K has also been explored to further evaluate its water stability (Figure ), which shows sorption hysteresis, indicating that there is a hydrophilic interaction between water and the polar pore surface due to the presence of one guest water molecule per asymmetric unit. Compound 1 displays a type V water isotherm, with low water uptake (15.2 wt %) even up to a P/P 0 value of 1 and pore filling at higher relative pressures (about P/P 0 = 0. 4) indicating that 1 possesses a hydrophobic pore. The repeated experiments based on the same batch of material shows that 1 has excellent hydrostability (see Figure S3 of the ). In addition, N2 sorption measurements were used to examine the porosity of the MOF samples after soaking in water for 3 days. Compound 1 was activated (1a) at 150 \u00b0C for 12 h under vacuum. The N2 sorption isotherms were performed at 77 K and show a type I isotherm characteristic of a microporous material (Figure ) with the BET surface area of 925 m2g-1, which is well consistent with the value obtained through theoretical calculations (see Figure S4 of the ). No significant loss in the BET surface area was observed (from 925 to 882 m2g-1) for 1 after soaking in water for 3 days, indicating the maintenance of the porous structures of 1 in water. The hydrophobic functional groups (-NO2 and -CH3) are close to the zinc center within the framework of 1, and could prevent the Zn-O and Zn-N bonds from attacking by water and thus effectively enhance the hydrophobic properties of 1. Additionally, bulk samples were also measured by X-ray diffraction at room temperature to check the purity of 1. As shown in Figure , all major peaks of the experimental PXRD patterns of compound 1 matches well that of simulated PXRD patterns, which clearly indicates the high purity of the complex.\n\nDrug Delivery Studies\n\nThe surface area and pore diameter play a critical role in drug adsorption and release in porous frameworks as drug loading and release systems. N2 adsorption measurements (HK model) indicate that the pore size of 1 is 8.9 \u00c5 (see Figure S5 of the ). Complex 1, with wide-open channels (10.5 \u00d7 8.9 \u00c52), is suitable for loading busulfan with a molecular size of 3.5 \u00d7 13.4 \u00c52. Incorporation of the busulfan molecule during the adsorption process was confirmed by FT-IR and N2 sorption (more details in Figure S6, ) (Figure ). The characteristic peak of busulfan observed at 1349 cm-1 is assigned to the stretching vibration of the S\ue5fbO group. The BET surface area of the busulfan loaded MOF is 63 m2g-1, which shows ca. 93.2% reduction, as compared with the as-synthesized sample (925 m2g-1). The result indicates that there is almost no residual porosity after drug adsorption; thus, the busulfan molecules approximately filled up the pores and channels. HPLC was used to determine the effective storage capacity of 1a. To achieve a maximal drug loading of busulfan to the pore solid, different drug concentrations and contact times were tested (see Table S2 of the ). It was observed that the optimal busulfan concentrations and contact times were 0.6 mg/mL and 48 h, respectively. Chemical analysis indicates that desolvated 1 shows a remarkable busulfan absorption capacity with the encapsulation efficiency of 21.5% (17.2 wt %), which is higher than the busulfan loading in MIL-88A, MIL-53, and MIL-89 with the pore size ranging from 6 to 11 \u00c5. Moreover, the amount of busulfan in the sample was determined by TGA and elemental anslysis. The TGA curve is depicted in Figure S7 (). A weight-loss of 2.6% is observed from 100 to 150 \u00b0C, which is assigned to the loss of residual water molecules. Upon further heating, a weight-loss of 16.6% is observed between 170 and 380 \u00b0C, due to the release of busulfan molecules. The sharp weight-loss step that occurs above 380 \u00b0C corresponds to the decomposition of the framework. An elemental analysis technique was employed to obtain the organic species (C, H, N, and S wt %) of the dried busulfan-loaded 1a. The result indicated a busulfan content of 18.1 wt % on the basis of the data (C 43.3 wt %; H 2.9 wt %, N 6.5 wt %, and S 4.0 wt %).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "complex 1", "symbol": "1",
