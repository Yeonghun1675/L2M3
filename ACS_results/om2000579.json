While two DME molecules chelate to the lithium cation in V\u22c5(DME)2, each lithium cation in (V\u22c5DME)2 only coordinates to one DME species. Thus, the degree of aggregation of V depends upon the size and number of the coordinating solvents bound to the Li+ cation. In (V \u22c5THF) n , V\u22c5(DME)2, and (V\u22c5DME)2, each NHDC ligand employs its two carbene centers (i.e., C2 and C4 carbons) to bind to two BH3 molecules. The borons are four-coordinate and adopt near-tetrahedral geometries. (All the BH3 hydrogens were located from difference Fourier maps.) The C-B bond distances (1.588(7)-1.602(7) \u00c5) of V compare well to that (1.585(4) \u00c5) in the L:BH3 complex.
