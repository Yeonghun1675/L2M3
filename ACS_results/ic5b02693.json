When <bold>UPC-17</bold> was dispersed\nin MeOH solvent, it emitted visible bright-yellow-green light (). Upon the incremental\naddition of the Fe<sup>3+</sup> ion, the luminescence intensity decreased\ngradually, indicating its quenching effect on the PL emission of <bold>UPC-17</bold>. When 70 \u03bcL (233 \u03bcM) of a Fe<sup>3+</sup> solution was added, nearly 90% of the initial fluorescence intensity\nwas quenched, indicating that <bold>UPC-17</bold> possesses high sensitivity\nin the detection of the Fe<sup>3+</sup> ion through fluorescence quenching\n(turn-off). In contrast, only 23% of the initial fluorescence intensity\nwas quenched when the same amount of a Fe<sup>3+</sup> solution was\nadded to the acetone emulsion of <bold>UPC-17</bold>, indicating that <bold>UPC-17</bold> have much lower sensitivity to the Fe<sup>3+</sup> ion\nin acetone than in MeOH. However, fluorescence enhancement was observed\nwhen the Fe<sup>3+</sup> ion was added to the THF emulsion of <bold>UPC-17</bold>. The luminescence intensity was enhanced by almost\n4.5 times when 70 \u03bcL of a Fe<sup>3+</sup> solution was added\nto the emulsion. This result indicates that <bold>UPC-17</bold> dispersed\nin a THF solvent can sense the Fe<sup>3+</sup> ion with high efficiency\nthrough fluorescence enhancement (turn-on), which is higher than that\nin an acetone solution but lower than that in a MeOH solution. More\ninterestingly, the visible-bright-yellow emission of the THF emulsion\nof <bold>UPC-17</bold> gradually changed to a yellow-green emission\nupon the gradual addition of the Fe<sup>3+</sup> ion, which further\nincreases the application potential of <bold>UPC-17</bold> in the\ndetection of the Fe<sup>3+</sup> ion because it is easy to distinguish\nby the naked eye based on the color change. In the past decade, although\nmany fluorescent MOFs exhibiting selective sensing of the Fe<sup>3+</sup> ion have been synthesized and reported, all of the reported results\nare based on the fluorescence quenching effect (turn-off) on the MOFs\nupon the addition of the Fe<sup>3+</sup> ion. To the best of our knowledge, <bold>UPC-17</bold> represents the\nfirst example with highly efficient detection of the Fe<sup>3+</sup> ion through both fluorescence quenching (turn-off) in a MeOH solution\nand fluorescence enhancement (turn-on) in a THF solution. It is well-known\nthat the luminescence intensity of an MOF highly relies on the efficiency\nof metal-to-ligand/ligand-to-metal or intraligand/ligand-to-ligand\nenergy transfer. Thus, the energy-transfer process can be positively\nor negatively influenced by the addition of a certain metal ion as well as the solvent used. For <bold>UPC-17</bold>, the luminescence\nintensity reduces gradually upon the addition of the Fe<sup>3+</sup> ion when it is dispersed in a MeOH solvent, but the opposite result\nis observed in a THF solvent. According to these results, the intraligand/ligand-to-ligand\nenergy-transfer process is less or more effective with the addition\nof the Fe<sup>3+</sup> ion in MeOH and THF solvents, respectively.</p>", "clean_text": "To explore the ability of UPC-17 to detect a trace quantity of analytes such as metal ions and NACs, fluorescence titrations were carried out with the incremental addition of analytes to UPC-17 dispersed in MeOH, acetone, and THF. Inspiringly, UPC-17 exhibits fast and highly efficient detection of Fe3+/Al3+ ions and 4-NP with unprecedented solvent-dependent sensitivities. As shown in , UPC-17 can efficiently detect the Fe3+ ion in MeOH, acetone, and THF emulsions with different sensing fashion and sensitivities. When UPC-17 was dispersed in MeOH solvent, it emitted visible bright-yellow-green light (). Upon the incremental addition of the Fe3+ ion, the luminescence intensity decreased gradually, indicating its quenching effect on the PL emission of UPC-17. When 70 \u03bcL (233 \u03bcM) of a Fe3+ solution was added, nearly 90% of the initial fluorescence intensity was quenched, indicating that UPC-17 possesses high sensitivity in the detection of the Fe3+ ion through fluorescence quenching (turn-off). In contrast, only 23% of the initial fluorescence intensity was quenched when the same amount of a Fe3+ solution was added to the acetone emulsion of UPC-17, indicating that UPC-17 have much lower sensitivity to the Fe3+ ion in acetone than in MeOH. However, fluorescence enhancement was observed when the Fe3+ ion was added to the THF emulsion of UPC-17. The luminescence intensity was enhanced by almost 4.5 times when 70 \u03bcL of a Fe3+ solution was added to the emulsion. This result indicates that UPC-17 dispersed in a THF solvent can sense the Fe3+ ion with high efficiency through fluorescence enhancement (turn-on), which is higher than that in an acetone solution but lower than that in a MeOH solution. More interestingly, the visible-bright-yellow emission of the THF emulsion of UPC-17 gradually changed to a yellow-green emission upon the gradual addition of the Fe3+ ion, which further increases the application potential of UPC-17 in the detection of the Fe3+ ion because it is easy to distinguish by the naked eye based on the color change. In the past decade, although many fluorescent MOFs exhibiting selective sensing of the Fe3+ ion have been synthesized and reported, all of the reported results are based on the fluorescence quenching effect (turn-off) on the MOFs upon the addition of the Fe3+ ion. To the best of our knowledge, UPC-17 represents the first example with highly efficient detection of the Fe3+ ion through both fluorescence quenching (turn-off) in a MeOH solution and fluorescence enhancement (turn-on) in a THF solution. It is well-known that the luminescence intensity of an MOF highly relies on the efficiency of metal-to-ligand/ligand-to-metal or intraligand/ligand-to-ligand energy transfer. Thus, the energy-transfer process can be positively or negatively influenced by the addition of a certain metal ion as well as the solvent used. For UPC-17, the luminescence intensity reduces gradually upon the addition of the Fe3+ ion when it is dispersed in a MeOH solvent, but the opposite result is observed in a THF solvent. According to these results, the intraligand/ligand-to-ligand energy-transfer process is less or more effective with the addition of the Fe3+ ion in MeOH and THF solvents, respectively.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 15, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig3\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>PL intensity\nof <bold>UPC-17</bold> upon the addition of different metal ions into\nthe MeOH (a), acetone (b), and THF (c) emulsions and a comparison\nof the changes of the PL intensity with the addition of Fe<sup>3+</sup> (d) and Al<sup>3+</sup> (e) ions into the MeOH, acetone, and THF\nemulsions of <bold>UPC-17</bold>.
