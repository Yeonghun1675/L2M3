The O-H stretching vibrations of small water cluster (H2O) n  (n = 2-10) in the gaseous state have been investigated using infrared depletion and fragment spectroscopy. The stretching vibrations are found to be size specific spreading over a wide range from 3720 to 2935 cm-1 with the higher nuclearity cluster showing the vibration below 3400 cm-1. In comparison, the O-H stretching vibration in ice appears24 at 3220 cm-1, while in liquid it shifts24 to 3280 and 3490 cm-1. Therefore, the O-H stretching frequency of the water cluster in 1 is more like ice with a slight variation attributable to its surroundings. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns of 1 before (simulated) and after water expulsion show a complete change in the pattern, suggesting breakdown of the host lattice due to the exclusion of water. This result is expected, as the water cluster acts as a \"glue\" to assemble the coordination polymeric chains around it, leading to the 3D structure.
