Azopyridines 2a-c were used as photodissociable axial ligands (PDLs) to control the coordination number and concurrently the spin state of Ni-porphyrin 1. In the trans configuration, the azopyridines bind to the Ni-porphyrin as axial ligands, forming paramagnetic (S = 1) 1:1 and 2:1 complexes. Upon light-induced isomerization to the cis configuration, the binding is drastically reduced because of steric hindrance. By dissociation of the cis azopyridines, the diamagnetic (S = 0) square-planar Ni-porphyrin is formed. The difference between the binding constants for the cis and trans configurations was increased and systematically investigated by introducing substituents at the 4- and 4'-positions of the azopyridines [R = H (2a), CH3 (2b), iPr (2c)]. Association constants for all of the 1:1 and 2:1 complexes involving the cis and trans configurations of 2a-c with Ni-porphyrin 1 were determined by NMR titration. Upon alternating irradiation of a solution of Ni-porphyrin 1 and a large excess of azopyridine 2c with UV light (365 nm) and violet-blue light (455 nm), the percentage of paramagnetic Ni centers was switched between 20.5 and 68.1%, and the molar paramagnetic susceptibility was reversibly changed between \u03c7M P = 1006 \u00d7 10-6 and 2444 \u00d7 10-6 cm3\u22c5mol-1. No side products or fatigue was observed over a large number of cycles. Thus, in regard to reversibility and efficiency, the system is superior to previous LD-LISC systems.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 37, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The switching efficiency (SE) depends on the mixing ratio of Ni\u2013porphyrin <bold>1</bold> and the axial ligand <bold>2a</bold>\u2013<bold>c</bold>.
