In this study, the output of the excitation laser (third harmonic 355 nm, Nd:YAG laser) was coupled with a half-wave plate and a Glan-Thompson linear polarizer to fine-tune the polarization without changes of the laser intensity. The results revealed that the 490 nm fluorescence intensity, within experimental error, was independent of the polarization vector of the excitation beam,\u2020 eliminating the origin of the 490 nm emission mainly from the linear Ag\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Ag interaction. In another approach, theoretical computation has been performed, in which compound 1 was truncated into [Ag(L)2(ClO4)2] (L = 4,5-diazospirobifluorene) to avoid the complexity. The ground state geometry was adapted from the truncated X-ray data. On the basis of this geometry, time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculation using the B3LYP functional was performed.22,23\u2020 The results indicate that the lowest singlet excitation is dominated by the combination of HOMO \u2192 LUMO and HOMO - 1 \u2192 LUMO transitions, in which both HOMO - 1 and HOMO are composed of d orbitals of Ag(I) and lone pair orbitals of the perchlorate bridge, while LUMO mainly consists of \u03c0 orbitals of ligand (4,5-diazospirobifluorene). As a result, the origin of 490 nm fluorescence is ascribed to a metal to ligand charge transfer transition (1MLCT) mixed, in part, with the \u03c0* (4,5-diazospirobifluorene) \u2192 n (perchlorate bridge) transition. The \u03c0 stacking interaction between two centroid rings in the adjacent chains (vide supra) may play an important role to account for the 490 nm fluorescence in the single crystal of 1, which is otherwise absent in the free ligand. Accordingly, it is reasonable to assign the origin of 550 nm phosphorescence to possess a 3\u039cLCT character. These assignments imply that both 1\u039cLCT and 3\u039cLCT are affected by the \u03c0 stacking interaction. Nevertheless, one cannot rule out the possibility that the state mixing may take place in the lower-lying triplet states between e.g. 3\u03c0\u03c0 and 3MLCT manifolds, as supported by the similarity in spectral properties between the phosphorescence of compound 1 and that of free ligand L measured in a 77 K crystal solid (\u03bbphos ~ 540 nm, \u03c4phos ~ 6. 2 \u03bcs). At this stage, a definitive assignment unfortunately is not possible without more sophisticated theoretical approaches to gain detailed insights into the energy correlation among various electronic states for nontruncated compound 1.
