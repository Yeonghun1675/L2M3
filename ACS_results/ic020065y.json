A crystal of 1 was mounted in a thin film of perfluoropolyether oil on mohair fiber, and data were collected at 150 K on a Bruker SMART 1000 CCD instrument at the University of Sydney. Single crystals of 2 and 3 were glued on the tips of glass fibers, and data were collected at 295 K on a Kappa CCD Nonius diffractometer at the Service de Cristallographie in Strasbourg. Both diffractometers employ graphite-monochromated Mo K\u03b1 (0.7107 \u00c5) radiation. The data were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects. The structures were solved by direct methods and expanded using Fourier techniques. The non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. No extinction corrections have been applied. Full-matrix least-squares refinement on F o 2 converged to R = \u2211||F o| - |F c||/\u2211|F o| and R w = [\u2211w(|F o| - |F c|)2/\u2211w|F o|2]1/2, as given in Table .

Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility studies have been performed on polycrystalline samples of 1-3 over the temperature range from 2 to 300 K. \n\nThe magnetic properties (Figures -10) of 1 are quite complex, as it exhibits three different ground states (collinear antiferromagnetism, canted antiferromagnetism, and field-induced ferromagnetism). We shall attempt to present the data to best describe the behavior in the three different temperature regimes. For T > 20 K the behavior is that of a paramagnet with Curie constant of 5.99 cm3 K mol-1 and a Weiss constant of +16.4 K for a fit to data taken in an applied field of 100 Oe between 30 and 300 K (Figure ). This result indicates that ferromagnetic interactions between nearest-neighbor cobalt atoms dominate at high temperatures. The susceptibility increases gradually up to 30 K and then more rapidly toward the maximum at 16 K. There is a sudden drop at 16 K due to long-range antiferromagnetic ordering. The susceptibility tends to a constant value below ca. 12 K; however, its value for T < 12 K is only 1/10 of the value at the maximum at T N and is far from the expected 2/3 for a polycrystalline two-sublattice collinear antiferromagnet. This ratio is similar to that found in Co2(OH)2(terephthalate), even though the dominant interaction is antiferromagnetic in this case. The susceptibility above 13 K in fields up to 3000 Oe is essentially independent of applied field (Figure ). Above 3000 Oe it deviates below 50 K, due to the increase of correlation length as a consequence of the ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor exchange.

The magnetic entropy was derived by integration of the C p/T versus T plot up to 40 K. It increases continuously to T N and then monotonically up to 40 K. The value of the entropy approaches 12 J/(K mol) (6 J/K per cobalt). This value is only half of the expected 23 J/(K mol) (11.5 J/K per Cobalt) for 2R ln(2s + 1) if s = 3/2. However, since cobalt is known to have s eff = 1/2 at low temperatures, the value of 12 J/(K mol) is in good agreement with the expected 11.5 J/(K mol) for 2R ln(2s + 1) and s = 1/2. An important point regarding the dimensionality of this compound is that only 60% of the entropy is acquired up to the transition temperature. This is consistent with a 2D rather than a one 1D or 3D magnetic system. The continuous increase of the entropy above T N also suggests that an appreciable short-range order persists from T N to well above 35 K. This short-range order is in good agreement with the low dimensionality.
