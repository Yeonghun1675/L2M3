Diffraction data for 1, 1\u2018, and 1\u2018\u2018 were collected with an Enraf Nonius Kappa CCD diffractometer (Mo K\u03b1, \u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5, graphite monochromator). Preliminary orientation matrixes and unit cell parameters were obtained from the peaks of the first 10 frames and then refined using the whole data set. Frames were integrated and corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects using DENZO. The scaling and the global refinement of crystal parameters were performed by SCALEPACK. No absorption correction was made. The crystal structures were solved by the direct method and refined by full-matrix least-squares refinement using the SHELXL-97 computer program. For Zn4O(CO2)6 unit in 1 and 1\u2018\u2018, all zinc atoms and all carboxylic oxygen atoms were statistically disordered. The site occupancy factors were given to 0.5 for Zn(1) atom that sits on a general position and 0.1667 for Zn(2) atom that sits on a three-fold crystallographic axis.  The site occupancy factors were given to 0.5 for all carboxylic oxygen atoms. For desolvated crystal 1\u2018, no disordered atom was found, contrary to 1. The positions of all non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement factors. The hydrogen atoms were positioned geometrically and refined using a riding model. As for the guest molecules of 1, three residual electron densities, which might correspond to the guest molecule, per asymmetric unit were found with severe disorder. Therefore, the identity and number of the guest molecules (three DEF and one EtOH) in 1 were determined on the basis of IR, elemental analysis, and TGA data. The density of the disordered guest molecule was flattened by using the SQUEEZE option of PLATON. The final refinement was made by using the squeezed hkl data. For resolvated crystal 1\u2018\u2018, all atoms of the Zn4O(CO2)6 cluster were  disordered with the same site occupancies as those in 1.
