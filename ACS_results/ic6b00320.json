Once the initial porous volume was filled with CO2 molecules, the further adsorption of CO2 can be promoted by the expansion of pore structure in the second step. When external pressures are reduced, the adsorbed CO2 trapped in the framework is not immediately released. The large hysteresis observed can be attributed to the strong interaction between polar functional groups and CO2.\n\nSelective Sorption Studies\n\nTo explore the selectivity of CO2 capture, CH4 and N2 adsorption isotherms at ambient temperature were performed (b).

The selectivity for CO2 capture was calculated according to ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) based on a dual-site Langmuir-Freundlich (DSLF) simulation (, S11, and S12 in the ). The CO2/CH4 selectivity calculated for a 50/50 CO2/CH4 mixture is 28.6 for 1 at 1 atm and 298 K, and the CO2/N2 selectivity calculated for a 15/85 CO2/N2 mixture is 210.4 at the same condition. On the basis of adsorption isotherms measured and predicted, it can be seen that the selectivity of CO2/N2 is high, since the adsorption capacity of CO2 is evidently higher than that of N2 even at pressure lower than 0.15 atm. In addition, the Henry's law selectivities for CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 were calculated to be 14.5 and 45 at 298 K, respectively (Figures S13-S15 and Table S5 in the ).
