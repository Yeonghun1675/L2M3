The molar susceptibility obeys the Curie-Weiss law with the Curie constant of C = 10.90 cm3 K mol-1 and a positive Weiss constant of \u03b8 = 5.01 K. On the basis of the crystal structure, five main magnetic exchange interactions should be operative, namely, (i)  CuII\ue5f8directly coordinated nitroxide group (J 1), (ii)  GdIII\ue5f8directly coordinated NO group (J 2), (iii) two coordinated NO groups through the GdIII ion (J 3), (iv) CuII-CuII through the pyrimidine ring (J 4), and (v)  copper(II)-nitroxide group through phenyl and pyrimidine rings (J 5). The last magnetic interaction should be weak; however, it may be ferromagnetic according to the spin-polarization mechanism (Chart S1 in the ). The magnetic orbital of the CuII ion is defined by short equatorial bonds, and it is of the d x 2-y 2  type with a very small admixture d z 2 . Because the pyrimidine ring bridges two CuII ions through axial-axial positions and the out-of-plane exchange pathway is involved, the magnetic coupling between two CuII ions via the pyrimidine ring (J 4) is anticipated to be weak. Hence, the magnetic behavior of 1 can be interpreted as that of one linear Cu-rad-Gd-rad-Cu magnetic unit plus an uncoupled CuII ion (Scheme  and Figure S2 in the ). For this linear five-spin system, the magnetic susceptibility data cannot be analyzed by using a Kambe vector-coupling method. Thus, the magnetism package MAGPACK  based on the Hamiltonian   H\u0302 = - 2   J   1    (   S\u0302   Rad 1     S\u0302   Cu 1   +   S\u0302   Rad 2     S\u0302   Cu 2   )  - 2   J   2    (   S\u0302   Rad 1     S\u0302   Gd   +   S\u0302   Rad 2     S\u0302   Gd   )  - 2   J   3     S\u0302   Rad 1     S\u0302   Rad 2     has been employed to simulate the susceptibility data, and a good agreement between the observed and calculated values of the magnetic susceptibility is obtained, yielding the parameters g = 2.10, J 1 = 20.50 cm-1, J 2 = 3.35 cm-1, and J 3 = -6.95 cm-1. These results indicate that the Gd-Rad interaction is ferromagnetic, whereas the magnetic interaction between the radicals through the Gd atom is antiferromagnetic, as was already observed in other gadolinium nitronyl nitroxide compounds. The axial CuII-ON bond will result in orbital orthogonality of the CuII magnetic orbital (d x 2-y 2 ) and the radical \u03c0* magnetic orbital; thus, the magnetic interaction between the CuII ion and the directly coordinated NO group should be ferromagnetic, and the obtained magnetic exchange coupling (J 1 = 20.50 cm-1) is comparable with those found for similar copper(II) nitronyl nitroxide complexes. A magnetization of 12.39 N\u03b2 is reached at 7 T, corresponding to the expected saturation value of 12 N\u03b2. The experimental magnetization value is higher than the magnetization predicted by the Brillouin function for noncoupled one S = 7/2 and five S = 1/2 spins (g = 2.0 and T = 2 K), supporting the ferromagnetic interactions in this compound. Moreover, the fitting of the isothermal magnetization M versus H curve using the same parameter as that for \u03c7M T gave quite good agreement (Figure ), which supported the \u03c7M T simulation above. Furthermore, alternating-current (ac) magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate that there is no magnetic ordering above 2 K for 1 (Figure S7 in the ).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']"}}, {"idx": 8, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig3\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>\u03c7<sub>M</sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic> versus <italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic> plots for <bold>1</bold> (rhombus) and <bold>2</bold> (circle).\nThe solid line represents the calculated behavior for <bold>1</bold>.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr4\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2013-02241f_0003.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 3  \u03c7M T versus T plots for 1 (rhombus) and 2 (circle).

Furthermore, alternating-current (ac) magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate that there is no magnetic ordering above 2 K for 1 (Figure S7 in the ).\n\nFor complex 2, the \u03c7M T value at room temperature is 17.06 cm3 K mol-1, which is also slightly larger than the expected 16.05 cm3 K mol-1 for one uncorrelated DyIII ion (6 H 15/2), two uncorrelated radical (S = 1/2) spins, and three uncorrelated CuII (S = 1/2) ions. Upon cooling, the \u03c7M T value gradually increases and reaches a maximum of 18.86 cm3 K mol-1 at 8.5 K and then rapidly decreases, which indicates that the ferromagnetic interactions dominate in this compound.

At high field, M increases to reach 11N\u03b2 at 70 kOe without clear saturation, suggesting the presence of a significant magnetic anisotropy and possible low-lying excited states in the compound. The temperature dependence of the ac magnetic susceptibility for 2 at different frequencies has been investigated in zero field with an ac field of 3 Oe; no frequency-dependent real (\u03c7') and imaginary (\u03c7\") signals have been observed (Figure S9 in the ). This may result from quantum tunneling of the magnetization. The application of a 2 kOe direct-current (dc) field did not change the ac signal profile (Figure S10 in the ), indicating that the tunneling effects in zero field can be neglected for complex 2.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "magnetic susceptibility": [{"value": "10.94", "unit": "cm3 K mol-1", "temperature": "300 K", "condition": "under 1 kOe"}, {"value": "18.81", "unit": "cm3 K mol-1", "temperature": "2.0 K", "condition": "under 1 kOe"}], "etc": [{"property name": "Curie constant", "value": "10.90", "unit": "cm3 K mol-1", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "Weiss constant", "value": "5.01", "unit": "K", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "2", "chemical formula": ""}, "magnetic susceptibility": [{"value": "17.06", "unit": "cm3 K mol-1", "temperature": "room temperature", "condition": "under 1 kOe"}, {"value": "18.86", "unit": "cm3 K mol-1", "temperature": "8.5 K", "condition": "under 1 kOe"}], "etc": [{"property name": "Curie constant", "value": "17.02", "unit": "cm3 K mol-1", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "Weiss constant", "value": "1.89", "unit": "K", "condition": ""}]}]]], "include_properties": ["magnetic_susceptibility", "etc"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['magnetic_susceptibility', 'etc']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"\",\n            \"symbol\": \"1\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"magnetic susceptibility\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"10.94\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 K mol-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"300 K\",\n                \"condition\": \"under 1 kOe\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"18.81\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 K mol-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"2.0 K\",\n                \"condition\": \"under 1 kOe\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"etc\": [\n            {\n                \"property name\": \"Curie constant\",\n                \"value\": \"10.90\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 K mol-1\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"property name\": \"Weiss constant\",\n                \"value\": \"5.01\",\n                \"unit\": \"K\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"\",\n            \"symbol\": \"2\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"magnetic susceptibility\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"17.06\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 K mol-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"room temperature\",\n                \"condition\": \"under 1 kOe\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"18.86\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 K mol-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"8.5 K\",\n                \"condition\": \"under 1 kOe\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"etc\": [\n            {\n                \"property name\": \"Curie constant\",\n                \"value\": \"17.02\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 K mol-1\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"property name\": \"Weiss constant\",\n                \"value\": \"1.89\",\n                \"unit\": \"K\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 5, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Asymmetric unit found in <bold>1</bold>.
