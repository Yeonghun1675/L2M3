As shown in , the Ar(87 K) adsorption of LIFM-13(Zn) apparently performs a multistep isotherm which is often elucidated as a gate open/closed phenomenon, and related to structural flexibility. The first step of the isotherm exists at P/P 0 < 0.25, and the adsorption amount only reaches 26.7 mL/g with a BET surface area of 76.2 m2/g. Then, the isotherm dramatically rises to P/P 0 = 1 with an adsorption value of 244.3 mL/g and even remains rising upward, suggesting that the adsorption has not reached saturation. The desorption branch shows a large hysteresis, and the desorption curve began to turn downward at P/P 0 of 0.04. On the basis of the Ar(87 K) isotherm of LIFM-13(Zn), we consider that the framework undergoes a swelling process from closed apertures to open apertures. On the other hand, the Ar (87 K) adsorption measurements of LIFM-13(Mg), LIFM-13(Co), and LIFM-13(Ni) perform Type-I isotherms that exhibit their microporous features. There is no obvious stepwise behavior observed in any of the isotherms. The BET surface areas are calculated as 424.7 m2/g for LIFM-13(Mg), 357.3 m2/g for LIFM-13(Co), and 1095.3 m2/g for LIFM-13(Ni). The relatively large surface area of LIFM-13(Ni) should be attributed to its fully removable solvent guest in apertures, and the framework can keep intact after activation, whereas LIFM-13(Mg) and LIFM-13(Co) most likely lost part of their crystallinity during guest removal. However, the pore size distributions calculated by the density functional theory (DFT) method based on Ar(87 K) isotherms of LIFM-13(Ni), LIFM-13(Mg), and LIFM-13(Co) are all around 1.0 nm (Figures S38-S40), proving the isoreticular frameworks of LIFM-13 series. (For the case of LIFM-13(Zn), no fitting models are available for the rare shape of the isotherm, and thus the valid pore size distribution cannot be obtained.) We also performed N2(77 K) adsorption measurements on LIFM-13. Similar results are obtained as those of Ar (87 K). The N2 sorption measurements at 77 K show that LIFM-13(Mg, Co, Zn) is characterized by lower gas uptakes than that of LIFM-13(Ni), indicating that it lost the porosity during the activation procedure.
