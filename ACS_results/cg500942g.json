The solid state luminescent properties of 1-3 and free bpydbH2 were studied at room temperature, as plotted in Figure . The free ligand and 1-3 display two emission bands from 375 to 600 nm upon excitation at 330 nm. For bpydbH2, the maximum emission peaks could be found at 528 nm with a small peak at 436 nm, which may be assigned to the \u03c0*-\u03c0 and \u03c0*-n transitions. 1 exhibits a maximum emission peak at 428 nm and an unconspicuous shoulder at 545 nm, which is consistent with the literature example based on the bpydbH2 ligand.

The slight shift in the range of 420-428 nm relative to the free bpydbH2 ligand (436 nm) for 1-3 may arise from interaction between the ligand and metal ion which is in good agreement with other reported Zn MOFs. There are two ligands coexisting in the framework of 2 and 3, as free bpy ligand only shows weak photoluminescence emission at 486 nm, and the Zn(II) ion do not tend to be oxidized or reduced for its d10 electronic configuration, so the emissions of 2-3 could neither be owing to metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) nor attributed to ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT).

The as-synthesized 3 was immerged in fresh MeOH solution for 12 h three times. The XRD data show the structure of 3 changes after the solvent exchange progress, which indicates the flexible nature of the framework (). An optimized activation progress was selected to remove the solvents in 3. The MeOH-exchanged 3 was outgassed overnight under a vacuum at 100 \u00b0C. 3a (the activated MeOH-exchanged 3) exhibited a moderate CO2 uptake at 195 K, with a maximum value of 83 cm3\u22c5g-1 (Figure ). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area calculated from 195 K CO2 sorption data is 198 m2/g, and the calculated Langmuir surface areas is 287 m2/g. It is interesting to find that 3a showed hysteresis in the desorption of CO2, indicating the structural flexibility of the framework. The N2 and CO2 sorption isotherms were measured at 298 and 273 K and 1 bar (Figure ). 3a showed a moderate CO2 uptake capability with the value 40 cm3\u22c5g-1, which is much higher than that of N2 (8.14 cm3\u22c5g-1). At 298 K and 1 bar, 3a could adsorb 22 cm3\u22c5g-1 CO2, while only 2 cm3\u22c5g-1 N2 was adsorbed (Figure ). To evaluate the CO2/N2 selectivity of 3a, Henry's law of CO2/N2 selectivity was calculated to give 22.5 and 34.7 at 273 and 298 K, respectively (). To better understand the framework-CO2 interactions, CO2 adsorption enthalpy (Q st) of 3a is calculated by the virial method (Figure ). It shows that Q st is 36 kJ\u22c5mol-1 (zero-loading), which is comparable to some well-known MOFs such as MIL-53(Al), HKUST-1, MOF-5, and bio-MOF-1, The high Q st indicates strong interactions between the framework and CO2 guests, which may be owing to the uncoordinated pyridine-N sites in the framework, because free nitrogen atoms in MOFs have been shown to act as Lewis base sites to facilitate CO2 sorption.
