To evaluate the negative effect of mal2- on void space of 1, the mal ligands are subtracted from complex 1. The total void value of the channels without water molecules and noncoordinated nitrate anions slightly increases from 3262.6 to 3610.7 \u00c53, approximately 46.3% of the total crystal volume. This suggests that the incorporation of flexible aliphatic carboxylate anions just slightly reduces the volume of the channels. Moreover, the incorporation of mal2- to Zn-TIPA#1 substructure enhances the yield and the stability of 1, which can be stable for several days when it is exposed to air. By comparison, the complex assembled directly from Zn2+ and TIPA ligand is unstable in air, though it has the same structure with the Zn-TIPA#1 substructure of complex 1. In addition, it is hard to obtain by a similar synthetic procedure for 1. Despite its poor crystal quality and low yield, we still determined its cell parameters of a = 28.368, b = 28.368(13), c = 9.408(4) \u00c5, and \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3 = 90\u00b0, it also crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pnna.

Complex 1 exhibits an intense photoluminescent peak with a maximum at 403 nm upon excitation at 354 nm, and complex 2 exhibits an intense emission with a maximum at 398 nm upon excitation at 367 nm.
