Immersing the as-synthesized 1 in pure methanol slightly led to the reduced d spacing of the structure as shown in methanol-exchanged PXRD pattern (parts a and b Figure ), which was systematically right-shifted. Such a change of PXRD patterns might be attributed to the guest-induced framework transformations because of the shifting of the frameworks, thus the pore space for the encapsulation of solvent molecules in methanol-exchanged 1 is reduced compared with the as-synthesized 1. The shifting of the frameworks within dynamic doubly interpenetrated MOFs has been well established by Kitagawa et al. Although we have not been able to systematically index these patterns and thus rationalize their framework shrink in detail because of the low-resolved PXRD patterns, TGA studies on the as-synthesized and methanol-exchanged 1 have exclusively established that the methanol-exchanged 1 is less porous than the as-synthesized 1, thus the as-synthesized 1 liberated more guest molecules (part b of Figure , black) than methanol-exchanged 1 (part b of Figure , red).
