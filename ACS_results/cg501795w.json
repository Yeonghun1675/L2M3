Meanwhile, another interesting structural characteristic is the chain-by-cluster-by-chain structure constructed from functional tetrahedral Cu4I4 clusters and infinite In(OH)(CO2)2 chains (Figure b). Although not all InO chains are parallel to each other in InOF-7, the shortest distance observed between two neighboring InO chains is approximately 16.2 \u00c5 (Figure c). In addition, the pore volume ratio is calculated to be 42.0% [per unit cell volume (22363.0 \u00c53)]; the total free volume is 9400.6 \u00c53 after the removal of those redundant guest solvent molecules. After the activation process, the experimental N2 sorption isotherm at 77 K confirms its retention of microporosity with a maximal uptake of 155.3 cm3 g-1.
