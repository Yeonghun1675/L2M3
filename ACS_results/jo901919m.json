After 1 h, the reaction was cooled to room temperature and the solution poured into a separatory funnel containing 0.5 M HCl (150 mL). The organic components were extracted with pentane (2 \u00d7 100 mL) and washed successively with 0.5 M HCl (250 mL) and distilled H<sub>2</sub>O (350 mL). The organic extracts were then dried over MgSO<sub>4</sub> and concentrated by rotary evaporation.

General Main Group Diene Synthesis Procedure</title><p>An oven-dried, 100 mL, two-neck, round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar, addition funnel, and reflux condenser was charged with magnesium (1.6 equiv) followed by the addition of dibromoethane (11.0 mol %) in THF (5 mL). After the mixture was stirred for \u223cca. 5 min (initiation of magnesium activation can be noticed by its silver color and ethane gas liberation), 3.0 mol % of anhydrous ZnCl<sub>2</sub> in THF (5 mL) was added. This mixture was added with additional THF (30 mL) and resulted in a whitish-gray solution which was brought to gentle reflux over a period of 15 min. Chloroprene (in 50% xylenes) (1.0 equiv) and dibromoethane (23.0 mol %) in THF (25 mL) were added dropwise to the refluxing reaction mixture over 30 min. After the addition, refluxing was continued for another 45 min. The greenish-gray Grignard solution was transferred by canula into a 250-mL, one-neck, round-bottom flask containing triethoxychlorosilane (0.95 equiv) in THF (25 mL) at room temperature. The reaction mixture was refluxed (1 h), poured into 0.5 M HCl solution (100 mL), and extracted with pentane (2 \u00d7 75 mL). The combined colorless, clear organic layers were washed successively with 0.5 M HCl (75 mL) and water (2 \u00d7 100 mL). After drying over MgSO<sub>4</sub>, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to yield the 2-substituted silyl diene with xylenes as a colorless liquid. This compound was subjected to fractional vacuum distillation to remove xylenes and then purified by flash chromatography. Chloroprene (<bold>1</bold>) (4.575 g, 51.69 mmol) and phenyldimethylchlorosilane (8.034 g, 47.06 mmol) were used according to the procedure above to yield a light yellow crude product (14.38 g) as a mixture of diene and xylenes. The crude product was subjected to fractional distillation at reduced pressure (20 mm, 45 \u00b0C) to produce a brown liquid, which was further purified by flash chromatography (100% pentanes) to yield the title compound as a light yellow liquid in pure form (<bold>5</bold>) (8.36 g, 44.39 mmol, 96.8%): <italic toggle=\"yes\">R</italic>\n<sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">f</italic>\n</sub> 0.63 (100% pentanes); <sup>1</sup>H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl<sub>3</sub>) \u03b4 7.49\u22127.55 (m, 2H), 7.31\u22127.37 (m, 3H), 6.46 (dd, <italic toggle=\"yes\">J</italic> = 17.7, 10.9 Hz, 1H), 5.88 (d, <italic toggle=\"yes\">J</italic> = 3.2 Hz, 1H), 5.51 (d, <italic toggle=\"yes\">J</italic> = 3.2 Hz, 1H), 5.10 (d, <italic toggle=\"yes\">J</italic> = 17.7 Hz, 1H), 5.00 (d, <italic toggle=\"yes\">J</italic> = 10.9 Hz, 1H), 0.43 (s, 9H); <sup>13</sup>C NMR (75 MHz, CDCl<sub>3</sub>) \u03b4 147.6, 141.1, 138.2, 133.9, 130.4, 129.0, 127.8, \u22122.3; HRMS calcd for C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>16</sub>Si (M<sup>+</sup>) 188.1021, found 188.1020.</p><title>Synthesis of 3a,4,7,7a-Tetrahydro-5-[dimethyl(phenyl)silyl]-2-phenyl-<italic toggle=\"yes\">2H</italic>-isoindole-1,3-dione (<bold>9</bold>)</title><p>Diene <bold>5</bold> (0.302 g, 1.603 mmol) and <italic toggle=\"yes\">N</italic>-phenylmaleimide (0.103 g, 0.595 mmol) were dissolved in THF (5 mL) in a sealed tube and purged with N<sub>2</sub>.

After 5 min, anhydrous zinc chloride (1.413 g, 0.010 mol) dissolved in THF (10 mL) was added dropwise, followed by additional THF (35 mL). The reaction mixture was then brought to reflux, and a solution of chloroprene (1) in 50% xylenes (36.5 mL, 0.207 mol) and 1,2-dibromoethane (4.0 mL, 0.05 mol) in THF (40 mL) was added dropwise over 30 min. The reaction mixture was refluxed for an additional 45 min and then cooled to room temperature. The mixture was then transferred via double-ended needle into a 500-mL round-bottom flask equipped with a stir bar and containing triethoxychlorosilane (36.0 mL, 0.180 mol) dissolved in THF (125 mL) and brought to reflux. After 1 h, the reaction was cooled to room temperature and the solution poured into a separatory funnel containing 0.5 M HCl (150 mL). The organic components were extracted with pentane (2 \u00d7 100 mL) and washed successively with 0.5 M HCl (250 mL) and distilled H2O (350 mL). The organic extracts were then dried over MgSO4 and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The resulting light yellow liquid (52.703 g) contains buta-1,3-dien-2-yltriethoxysilane (2) (33.71 g, 0.156 mol, 86.6% by 1H NMR integration) (identical by spectroscopic comparison to material we have reported previously) in xylenes and residual THF. This crude mixture was used in the syntheses described below without further purification.\n\nLarge-Scale Synthesis of (Buta-1,3-dien2-yl)silatrane 3 \n\nTo a dried 500-mL round-bottom flask equipped with a stir bar and reflux condenser were added buta-1,3-dien-2-yltriethoxysilane (2) in xylenes (29.85 g) described above (containing the diene (19.28 g, 0.089 mol) by 1H NMR integrations), triethanolamine (10.51 g, 0.070 mol), and a catalytic amount of KOH (0.439 g, 7.825 mmol), and the mixture was dissolved in THF (250 mL). The solution was brought to reflux and, after 2.5 h, cooled to room temperature and condensed by rotary evaporation to remove approximately half of the solvent. The product was then precipitated with pentane (100 mL) and collected by vacuum filtration followed by drying overnight under high vacuum to yield a white, fluffy solid (13.34 g, 0.059 mol, 83.4%) identical by spectroscopic comparison to material we have reported previously. \n\nLarge-Scale Synthesis of Potassium Bis(5,5'-benzenediolato)(1,3-butadien-2-yl)silicate (4)\n\nTo a dried 500-mL round-bottom flask equipped with a stir bar and reflux condenser was added catechol (10.21 g, 0.092 mol), and the mixture was dissolved in THF (125 mL).

After 2.5 h, reflux was stopped, and the hot solution was gravity filtered. Precipitation with pentane (50 mL) yielded a white solid which was collected and dried by vacuum filtration. The white powder (11.89 g, 0.035 mol, 76.3%) was recrystallized by dissolving in a minimum quantity of hot THF, cooling to room temperature, and cooling at -40 \u00b0C for 1 h. The resulting white flaky solid was collected and dried by vacuum filtration followed by drying overnight under high vacuum (8.49 g, 0.025 mol, 54.5%).\n\nSynthesis of (Buta-1,3-dien-2-yl)dimethyl(phenyl)silane (5). General Main Group Diene Synthesis Procedure\n\nAn oven-dried, 100 mL, two-neck, round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar, addition funnel, and reflux condenser was charged with magnesium (1.6 equiv) followed by the addition of dibromoethane (11.0 mol %) in THF (5 mL). After the mixture was stirred for ~ca. 5 min (initiation of magnesium activation can be noticed by its silver color and ethane gas liberation), 3.0 mol % of anhydrous ZnCl2 in THF (5 mL) was added. This mixture was added with additional THF (30 mL) and resulted in a whitish-gray solution which was brought to gentle reflux over a period of 15 min. Chloroprene (in 50% xylenes) (1.0 equiv) and dibromoethane (23.0 mol %) in THF (25 mL) were added dropwise to the refluxing reaction mixture over 30 min. After the addition, refluxing was continued for another 45 min. The greenish-gray Grignard solution was transferred by canula into a 250-mL, one-neck, round-bottom flask containing triethoxychlorosilane (0.95 equiv) in THF (25 mL) at room temperature. The reaction mixture was refluxed (1 h), poured into 0.5 M HCl solution (100 mL), and extracted with pentane (2 \u00d7 75 mL). The combined colorless, clear organic layers were washed successively with 0.5 M HCl (75 mL) and water (2 \u00d7 100 mL). After drying over MgSO4, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to yield the 2-substituted silyl diene with xylenes as a colorless liquid. This compound was subjected to fractional vacuum distillation to remove xylenes and then purified by flash chromatography. Chloroprene (1) (4.575 g, 51.69 mmol) and phenyldimethylchlorosilane (8.034 g, 47.06 mmol) were used according to the procedure above to yield a light yellow crude product (14.38 g) as a mixture of diene and xylenes. The crude product was subjected to fractional distillation at reduced pressure (20 mm, 45 \u00b0C) to produce a brown liquid, which was further purified by flash chromatography (100% pentanes) to yield the title compound as a light yellow liquid in pure form (5) (8.36 g, 44.39 mmol, 96.8%): R  f  0.63 (100% pentanes); 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) \u03b4 7.49-7.55 (m, 2H), 7.31-7.37 (m, 3H), 6.46 (dd, J = 17.7, 10.9 Hz, 1H), 5.88 (d, J = 3.2 Hz, 1H), 5.51 (d, J = 3.2 Hz, 1H), 5.10 (d, J = 17.7 Hz, 1H), 5.00 (d, J = 10.9 Hz, 1H), 0.43 (s, 9H); 13C NMR (75 MHz, CDCl3) \u03b4 147.6, 141.1, 138.2, 133.9, 130.4, 129.0, 127.8, -2.3; HRMS calcd for C12H16Si (M+) 188.1021, found 188.1020.\n\nSynthesis of 3a,4,7,7a-Tetrahydro-5-[dimethyl(phenyl)silyl]-2-phenyl-2H-isoindole-1,3-dione (9)\n\nDiene 5 (0.302 g, 1.603 mmol) and N-phenylmaleimide (0.103 g, 0.595 mmol) were dissolved in THF (5 mL) in a sealed tube and purged with N2.
