We hypothesized that decreasing the connectivity of [Ru-L1]4- may open some windows on the channel walls and form 3D open channels, which may facilitate the framework interpenetration. To this end, we have designed a similar metalloligand, [Ru-L2]2-, with lower carboxylate density than [Ru-L1]4- to build MOF with Cd(II) ions. Fortunately, we have successfully obtained an interpenetrated Ru-MOF 2. 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c, as revealed by the single-crystal X-ray diffraction study.

The interpenetrated Ru-MOF exhibits not only remarkable thermal stability but also superior photostability for photocatalytic CO2 reduction as compared to its non-interpenetrated counterpart. The improved stability of the interwoven frameworks originates from the numerous interframework supramolecular interactions that prevent single net from collapsing in. These findings indicate that making interpenetration could be an effectively strategy to fabricate highly stable MOF photocatalysts.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 26, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information is available free of\ncharge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications\nwebsite</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5b01045\">10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5b01045</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Detailed thermogravimetric\nanalysis, <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra, and figures (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5b01045/suppl_file/ic5b01045_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Crystal data for <bold>1</bold> (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5b01045/suppl_file/ic5b01045_si_002.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Crystal\ndata for <bold>2</bold> (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5b01045/suppl_file/ic5b01045_si_003.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5b01045.
