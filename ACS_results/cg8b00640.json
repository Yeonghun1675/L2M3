To describe them in detail, we took btrz-Zn and atrz-Zn as typical examples and made a comparison. The differences were found as follows: (1) In btrz-Zn, the two triazolyl rings of btrz are nearly perpendicular to each other since they are linked via the rotatable N-N single bond, and the twisting angle between them is 81.946(3)\u00b0 (d). Conversely, in atrz-Zn, two triazolyl rings and an azo group of the atrz ligand are nearly coplanar to each other due to the formation of a large conjugated system between the two aromatic triazolyl rings and the azo group, and the twisting angle between two triazolyl rings is only 2.664(3)\u00b0 (c). Therefore, btrz-Zn exhibits more flexible frameworks than atrz-Zn because its ligands are more flexible. (2) The ZnII-N bond lengths increase from 2.153(3) \u00c5 in btrz-Zn to 2.169(2) \u00c5 in atrz-Zn (Table S3). Thus, the btrz ligand possesses stronger coordination stability than the atrz ligand. (3) The C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bonding distances between the oxygen atoms of the ClO4 - anions and the C-H groups of the triazole rings are about 2.6333(139) \u00c5 in btrz-Zn, while those in atrz-Zn are about 2.7444(98) \u00c5 (Table S4), suggesting that btrz-Zn has stronger hydrogen-bonding interactions than atrz-Zn. (4) btrz-Zn possesses 1D channels with inner diameter of about 5.6 \u00c5, while that in atrz-Zn has about 6.2 \u00c5 (e,f). Moreover, PLATON calculations showed that the total empty volumes of the cationic framework reduced from 34.1% in atrz-Zn to 33.4% in btrz-Zn. It is possible that the length of the btrz ligand (5.5 \u00c5) is shorter than that of the atrz ligand (7.7 \u00c5, c,d).
