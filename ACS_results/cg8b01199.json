The two compounds crystallize in the monoclinic P21/n space group (Table S1). The asymmetric unit contains one L spacer and one CuX (X = Br, I) unit (a). The two crystal structures are characterized by the presence of Cu2(\u03bc-X)2 dimeric units which are connected by \u03bc-L spacers to give 2D corrugated layers. The copper(I) ions are in a distorted tetrahedral environment of the type CuX2N2, being coordinated to two halogen atoms [Cu1-Br = 2.3990(14), 2.6076(8) \u00c5; Cu1-I = 2.5687(15), 2.7531(8) \u00c5] and to two nitrogen atoms of two linkers L [Cu1-N1 = 2.0821(13), 2.0757(16) \u00c5; Cu1-N3 = 2.0778(15), 2.0598(19) \u00c5, for 3 and 4, respectively]. Within a single layer, the L molecules adopt two different orientations, with a dihedral angle of 64.03\u00b0 in 3 and 63.98\u00b0 in 4 (b). Each Cu2(\u03bc-X)2 unit is connected to four others through four bridging L ligands. The layers show a thickness, that is the distance between parallel planes passing through the external hydrogen atoms, of 9.635 and 9.185 \u00c5 in 3 and 4, respectively. The layers stack parallel along the [-101] crystallographic direction in ABAB fashion, but are superimposed along the [001] crystallographic direction. From a topological point of view, if the copper atoms are considered as nodes, the resulting topology is hcb (c), resembling that of black phosphorus (chair conformation of the hexagonal windows, d). The Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu edges of the hcb net in 3 are equal to 3.324(2) \u00c5 (supported by \u03bc-X) and 7.665(5) \u00c5 (supported by \u03bc-L). In 4, the same distances are equal to 3.106(2) and 7.658(5) \u00c5, respectively. Alternatively, if the barycenter of the Cu2(\u03bc-X)2 units is taken as nodes, the resulting topology is sql, with rhombic windows of edges 8.129 \u00c5 long (b). Adjacent layers are interconnected through \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between L molecules with interplanar separations and distances between the triazinic centroids of 3.3505(4) and 4.458(3) \u00c5 for 3 and 3.3497(5) and 4.381(3) \u00c5 for 4.\n\n3D Coordination Polymers: [CuClL] n  (6) and {[Cu3 L 4]I3} n  (7)\n\nThe crystal structure of 6 belongs to the cubic Pa3\u0305 space group, and the asymmetric unit contains one-third of L and one-third of copper and chlorine atoms, all residing on three-fold rotation axes. L serves as \u03bc3-bridge (a), resulting in a 3D network (b). Copper(I) ions are in a distorted tetrahedral environment of the CuClN3 type, being coordinated to the nitrogen atoms of three \u03bc3-L [Cu-N1 2.1295(13) \u00c5] and a terminal chloride [Cu-Cl1 2.2567(10) \u00c5]. An analysis of the crystal structure reveals that the resulting network is 3-connected with the chiral srs (SrSi2) topology. Both copper(I) ions and \u03bc3-L spacers act as the 3-connected nodes of the network. To fill the large cavities of the framework, a second identical network is entangled to the first one, to give an overall two-fold interpenetrated structure of class IIa, where the two networks are related by a center of inversion (c). The srs net is one of the prototypical net characterized by the presence of helical motifs connected to each other. It is a chiral network with helices having the same helicity. The resulting two-fold array is achiral, being formed by two single srs nets of opposite chirality (related by a center of inversion) (c,d). The interpenetrated framework does not show empty volume. The shortest Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu separations between copper(I) ions of the same and different nets are 7.814(3) and 6.398(3) \u00c5, respectively. The interpenetrated networks reveal face to face stacking interactions between center-of-symmetry-related ligands, with interplanar separation of 3.3135(3) \u00c5 and distance between the triazinic centroids of 3.2892(15) \u00c5. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that 6 is stable up to about 240 \u00b0C and starts to decompose, losing 66% of weight up to 390 \u00b0C, probably due to the loss of L, leaving CuCl as residue (calcd. 33.3%) (Figure S15).\n\nThe cationic 3D network of 7 possesses two types of cavities with diameters of ca. 5.4 and 11.0 \u00c5 (taking into account the van der Waals radii of the atoms decorating the cavities walls), which provide a total potential solvent/anion accessible volume of 3959 \u00c53 (40%, d). The bigger cavities are interconnected by channels with a diameter of at least 2.6 \u00c5 (d). The iodide anions are disordered in these cavities, whose size is bigger than the van der Waals radius of iodine (2.20 \u00c5). \n\nCrystals of compound 1 display, at room temperature, an unresolved emission at 568 nm (\u03c4 = 31.02 \u03bcs; see SI) which is only very slightly blue-shifted (\u03bbem = 564 nm, \u03c4 = 47.14 \u03bcs) at 77 K (). The long lifetimes, the absence of vibrational structure, the long Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu nearest neighbor distance in the crystal structure [3.248 \u00c5, significantly longer than the sum of van der Waals radii of Cu(I) ions, 2.80 \u00c5], and the blue shift at low temperature point to a triplet state of XLCT character at the origin of the emissive behavior of 1.\n\nA similar interpretation can be formulated for 6, which displays a room temperature photoluminescent behavior () comparable to that of 1, though characterized by a more complex and faster decay: an unresolved emission is observed at 560 nm, best fitted with a triexponential decay (\u03c41 = 0.176 \u03bcs, 13%; \u03c42 = 1.41 \u03bcs, 24%; \u03c43 = 6.67 \u03bcs, 63%; see SI). However, differently from 1, a more pronounced (47 nm) blue shift is found going to 77 K (\u03bbem = 513 nm), together with a large increase of the average lifetime (best fitted with a biexponential, \u03c41 = 207 \u03bcs, 99%; \u03c42 = 3.78 ms, 1%; see SI).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "2D Coordination Polymers", "symbol": "3, 4", "chemical formula": "[CuIL] n, [CuBrL] n"}, "crystal system":
