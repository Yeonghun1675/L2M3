Our own interests in ligand design are largely stimulated by needs for multifunctional ligands that are selective chelators for f-element species present in highly acidic nuclear materials solutions. The rational development of useful chelating ligands for f-element ions is a daunting task because the ligands must be stable in concentrated mineral acids and they must select a single metal ion or class of metal ions over protons despite a typical 106-108 concentration excess of H+ over metal. Despite these requirements, some successes have appeared. For example, selected monofunctional phosphonates, phosphine oxides, and organoamides function as liquid-liquid extraction agents at low acid concentrations, although they are not especially effective at high acid concentrations. Siddall suggested that bifunctional ligands that combine these donor groups, such as in 1 and 2, might serve as better ligands and improved extractants for lanthanide (Ln) and actinide (An) trivalent ions because they should adopt bidentate chelate structures in solution. Indeed, 1 (CMP) and 2 (CMPO) are better extractants of trivalent ions in acidic aqueous solutions than the monofunctional component ligands, although this behavior may not result from the formation of bidentate chelate structures in extractant solutions. Unexpectedly, 1 and 2 show increasing distribution ratios (K D = [M]org/[M]aq) with increasing acid strength even at proton concentrations above 4 M. The discovery of this technologically favorable behavior stimulated searches for new ligand families that might also display improved extraction characteristics at high acid concentrations. In this regard, we have reported the design, synthesis, and extraction behavior of bifunctional and trifunctional ligands 3-9, which contain one or more phosphonate or phosphine oxide groups and pyridine N-oxide donor groups. Ligands 3-6 generally bind to metal centers in a bidentate manner; 7 and 8 serve as tridentate ligands, and 9  acts as a tetradentate ligand. The chelate rings formed by 5-9 are seven-membered, and their complexes are more stable than the six-membered chelate complexes of 1-4. In fact, 7 is a superior extractant toward Ln(III) and An(III) ions. From a ligand design perspective, this is an unexpected result because in most cases five-membered chelate rings are more stable than six-membered rings, which are much more stable than seven-membered rings. We are interested in examining other structural features of 7 and 8, and we are particularly interested in the possibility of constraining the rotational flexibility of the donor centers in the trifunctional ligand 7.

The resulting solution was refluxed with an oil bath at 75 \u00b0C (5 h) in order to drive the meso isomer to the threo isomer. The solution was cooled, and the volume was reduced to ~70 mL. Acetone (200 mL) was added and then slowly removed by evaporation. A solid formed, which was collected by filtration and washed with cold ethyl acetate, leaving a light orange solid, 20: yield 17.0 g (65.7%); mp 210-212 \u00b0C.

A sample of 20 (6.8 g, 11.6 mmol) in glacial acetic acid (35 mL) was combined with 30% H2O2 (2.0 mL, 17.6 mmol) and stirred under nitrogen at 63 \u00b0C (16 h). The acetic acid was vacuum evaporated at 23 \u00b0C, and water (10 mL) was added to the residue. The mixture was vacuum evaporated at 23 \u00b0C, and the residue was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (30 mL). This solution was extracted with saturated aqueous NaHCO3/Na2CO3 solution (50 mL), and the water phase (pH = 8.5) was separated and washed with CH2Cl2 (2 \u00d7 30 mL). The CH2Cl2 solution was washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution (20 mL), and the remaining CH2Cl2 solution was dried over Na2SO4. The CH2Cl2 solution was then vacuum evaporated, and the residue was combined with ethyl acetate (20 mL) and held at 0 \u00b0C overnight. The cold solution was filtered, and the solid product was washed with fresh ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 10 mL), leaving a white solid, 10: yield 6.2 g (88.7%); mp 221-222 \u00b0C. Single crystals used in the X-ray diffraction study were obtained from CHCl3/EtOAc mixtures.

Solubility: soluble in CHCl3, benzene, and toluene; insoluble in hexane and heptane. Anal. Calcd for C37H35NO3P2: C, 73.62; H, 5.84; N, 2.32. Found: C, 72.12; H, 6.14; N, 2.25. \n\n Preparation of Complexes 21 and 22. A sample of 10 (0.12 g, 0.20 mmol) in MeOH (20 mL) was combined with La(NO3)3\u22c56H2O (0.3 g, 0.1 mmol) or Nd(NO3)3\u22c56H2O (0.4 g, 0.1 mmol). The mixture was stirred (1 h, 23 \u00b0C). For the La(III) complex, the reaction mixture was treated with ethyl acetate (20 mL); the resulting mixture was filtered, and the filtrate was allowed to slowly evaporate at 23 \u00b0C. After several days, single crystals were obtained. For the Nd(III) complex, ethyl acetate was not used, and single crystals were obtained by slow evaporation of the methanol solution. Infrared spectra (KBr, cm-1): 21, 1224 (m, \u03bdNO), 1146 (m) and 1096 (m) (\u03bdPO); 22, 1232 (m, \u03bdNO), 1146 (m) and 1096 (m) (\u03bdPO). \n\nTreatment of 19 with 2 equiv of Ph2P(O)MgBr at 70 \u00b0C results in smooth replacement of the chloride groups with Ph2P(O) groups. As expected, workup reveals that both meso and threo isomers of 20 are formed in a 1:1 ratio, but the mixture can be driven fully to the threo isomer by refluxing a CHCl3 solution of the mixture for 5 h. Subsequent treatment of 20 with H2O2/CH3COOH at 63 \u00b0C for 16 h produces 10 as a white solid, which is recrystallized and isolated in 89% yield. The overall yield for the 11-step process is approximately 18%, and further optimization is possible.
