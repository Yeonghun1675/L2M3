The spectrum of 2 in (CD3)2SO ( and Figure S7 in the Supporting Information) reveals sharp resonances for all chemically distinct protons in the 1-9 ppm region, consistent with a planar (S = 0) NiII complex. As expected, the H atoms in the chelate portion of the ligand are diastereotopic and, as such, afford distinct chemical shift values for H atoms above and below the Ni-N2S2 square-plane. A similar pattern is observed in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1. The spectrum of 2 changes, however, in protic solvents such as CD3OD and D2O ( and Figures S8 and S9 in the Supporting Information). For instance, the 1H NMR spectrum of 2 in CD3OD exhibits broad features over a wide chemical shift range (2-12 ppm), reminiscent of the type of signals expected for exchangeable protons ( and Figure S8). Because all H atoms are attached to C, this broadening is not a result of exchange. One explanation is the coordination number of 2 increases (binding of py-N, solvent, or both), causing a small degree of paramagnetism (S = 1 for octahedral NiII) to result in the broad spectrum. However, UV-vis of 2 in different solvents and XAS of 2 in the solid-state and in frozen MeOH (vide supra) support identical coordination geometries regardless of medium. Even a small amount of a 5C or 6C NiII may cause a detectable amount of paramagnetic behavior in NMR, but not significant enough to result in any perturbation in the UV-vis or XAS. Indeed, the effective magnetic moment (\u03bceff) of a CD3OD solution of 2 was 0.81 \u03bcB and the observed shift of the  t BuOH indicator (\u0394\u03bd = 5 Hz, \u03c7M = 56 \u00d7 10-6 emu/mol (before diamagnetic correction), 500 MHz spectrometer, 21 \u00b0C) only corresponds to ~2% of that expected for a pure S = 1 system (\u0394\u03bd ~ 300 Hz, \u03c7M ~ 3400 \u00d7 10-6 emu/mol (before diamagnetic correction), under identical conditions). A more probable reason behind the broadened NMR peaks is tetrahedral twisting of the ligand due to H-bonds between S donors and solvent that perturb the square-planar ligand field. Similar solvent effects have been observed in other square-planar NiII systems. For example, the X-ray structure and solid-state magnetic measurements of a NiII-N2S2 complex with imine-N and thiolato-S donors suggest square-planar Ni; however, RT measurements from 1H NMR (broad) and magnetism (\u03bceff = 3.21 \u03bcB) are more consistent with high-spin NiII.

Indeed, L-based events, assigned as thiolate to thiyl oxidation in 3, nearly superimpose onto electrochemical events observed between -0.30 and 0.50 V in 2 (). This result suggests that the irreversible oxidation event (E ox) at -0.67 V is Ni-thiolate based. The E ox value of 1 at -0.62 V is comparable to that of 2, which has been attributed to NiIII-thiolate/NiII-thiyl (from EPR) to form the disulfide-linked complex (vide supra, ). As expected, the oxidation in 2 is more facile (-0.05 V shift in E ox from 1) due to the electron-donating nature of the gem-(CH3)2 groups. Isolating E ox by scanning in the positive direction and then switching to negative potentials revealed an irreversible reduction event (E red) at -1.98 V, assigned as disulfide to thiolate conversion. As observed for 1, E red and E ox of 2 are coupled, as E red is only observed after traversing E ox and not the reverse (Figure S22 in the Supporting Information).

While free alkyl thiolates are typically oxidized at more negative potentials (E ox = -0.68 V for  t BuS- in DMA vs Fc/Fc+), the shift observed in 2 and 3 is due to coordination to the MII centers.

The oxidation of 2 by O2 \u22c5- will result in disulfide product 4 or thiazolidine 5, the latter of which is more likely under the dilute conditions of the AR assay (Scheme S2 in the Supporting Information). With AR\u22c5 being consumed by the oxidized intermediate, resorufin production will decrease to result in the quenched fluorescence observed ().

As with NiSODred  and other models, the FMOs are comparable with slightly more Ni-d\u03c0 versus S-p\u03c0 contribution to the HOMO. Going across the series of \u03b1-C substitutions (H2 (1*) \u2192 Me2 (2*) \u2192 F2 (6*) \u2192 F4 (7*)), one notices several trends with respect to orbital energies (Figure S35 in the Supporting Information). First, the FMOs are slightly destabilized in the Me2 derivative 2* but then are stabilized upon the addition of the F substituents in 6* and 7*. Indeed, the complex with F substitution on both S \u03b1-C atoms (7*) contains the most stabilized FMOs. One notable feature is that the singly F modified \u03b1-C derivative (6*) yields a HOMO and HOMO-1 that are nearly degenerate, likely arising from the stabilization of ligand group orbitals associated with S1 (trans to the carboxamide), which then shifts the S-based contribution in this MO to unsubstituted S2 (trans to the amine). Basically, the decreased basicity of S1 is compensated for by shifting the HOMO contribution over to S2 (Table S4 in the Supporting Information). This result leads to the general conclusion that, regardless of what alterations are made to noncoordinating atoms on the ligand, the HOMO of NiSOD models such as 2 will still contain large S-p\u03c0 character (vide infra). Indeed, analysis of the FMOs of 1*, 2*, 6*, and 7* reveal the same basic electronic structure ( and Figures S36-S38 in the Supporting Information) and the Lo\u0308wdin population analysis for selected MOs are compiled in  and Tables S3-S5 in the Supporting Information. The LUMO is \u03c3* with primary contributions from Ni d x 2-y 2  and p\u03c3 orbitals of all equatorial N/S donors of the ligand. As stated earlier, the HOMO is \u03c0* with principal contributions from Ni-d\u03c0 and S-p\u03c0 orbitals and is in-line with previous computations on 1  and other NiII-N2S2 NiSOD models. The increased Lewis basicity of S1 on going from 1* to 2* results in less Ni-d\u03c0 character (62.7 to 61.9%) and a small increase in S-p\u03c0 (24.6 to 25.9% total S) with the major contribution from S1 (20.4% in 2*; S trans to carboxamide) in the HOMO. However, as F is substituted onto the S \u03b1-C, the Ni-d\u03c0 contributions are highest (68.3% in 6*, 67.3% in 7*) and the S-p\u03c0 contributions are the smallest (13.5% in 6*, 13.1% in 7*). It is important to note that in 6* the true nature of the HOMO is difficult to identify because HOMO-1 is only 0.002 eV away (Figure S37 and Table S4). Intuitively, HOMO-1 may represent the true HOMO in 6* with the primary S contribution from S2 (trans to the amine) due to the single F substitution on the S1 \u03b1-C rendering it less basic. Regardless, these calculations demonstrate that the HOMO in NiSODred models is still covalent, although trending toward more Ni, with respect to Ni and S contributions. However, the MO contributions are tunable by ligand modification that should lead to primarily Ni-based versus thiolate-based electrochemical events, albeit sacrificing a positive shift in the NiIII/II redox potential.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 45, "type": "table", "classification": null, "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl4\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Lo\u0308wdin Population Analysis Derived\nfrom the DFT Calculations for Selected MOs of <bold>2*</bold> from\nOLYP/def2-TZVPP with COSMO\u00ad(DMF)<xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"tbl4-fn1\"></xref>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"9\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col5\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col6\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col7\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col8\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col9\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\"></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">MO no.</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">energy (eV)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">%\u00a0Ni</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">%\u00a0S1</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">%\u00a0S2</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">%\u00a0N1</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">%\u00a0N2</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">type of interaction</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>LUMO+2</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>100</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u20131.0041</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.2</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.1</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>pyridine(\u03c0*)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>LUMO+1</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>99</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u20131.2893</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.5</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.3</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.3</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.2</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.9</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>pyridine(\u03c0*)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>LUMO</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>98</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u20131.5003</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>48.9</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>9.8</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>13.5</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>5.4</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>5</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>Ni(d<sub>\u03c3</sub>)\u2013S1(\u03c3)\u2013S2(\u03c3)\u2013N1(\u03c3)\u2013N2(\u03c3)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>HOMO</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>97</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u20133.0017</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>61.9</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>20.4</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>5.5</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.1</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>Ni(d<sub>\u03c0</sub>)\u2013S1(\u03c0)\u2013S2(\u03c0)\u2013N2(\u03c0)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>HOMO-1</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>96</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u20133.2099</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>68.4</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.7</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>17.2</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.4</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.9</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>Ni(d<sub>\u03c0</sub>)\u2013S2(\u03c0)\u2013N2(\u03c0)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>HOMO-2</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>95</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u20133.3406</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>83.2</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.2</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>8.4</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.2</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.6</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>Ni(d<sub>\u03c3</sub>)\u2013S2(\u03c0)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n<table-wrap-foot>\n<fn id=\"tbl4-fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>Only s and p contributions were tabulated for N\nand S atoms.

These observations lead to several postulates\nas to how this reactivity is deterred in the enzyme. For example:\n(i) structural restrictions imposed by the macromolecule may prevent\ndisulfide as well as other ligand oxidized species, (ii) protonation\nof Cys2 and/or Cys6 will decrease the S nucleophilicity and diminish\nS-character in the HOMO, and (iii) the catalytic cycle could involve\n5C Ni\u00ad(III/II); this geometry would alter the electronic structure\nsuch that the HOMO is primarily Ni-based. Indeed, the degree of covalency in the Ni\u2013SCys bonds of SOD\nrival those found in Fe/S clusters and blue-copper proteins. The NiSOD electronic structure thus presents\nchallenges to the synthetic modeling chemist, where strategies must\nbe employed to prevent autoreduction reactions in addition to formation\nof S-bridged oligomers of uncontrollable nuclearity. Autoredox is\nespecially difficult to overcome with high-valent metals (Ni<sup>III</sup>, Fe<sup>III</sup>) because of the low oxidation potential of alkyl\nthiolates, i.e., M<sup>II</sup>-SR + ox \u2192 [M<sup>III</sup>-SR]\n\u2192 M<sup>II</sup> + 1/2 RSSR. Collectively,\nthe additional reactions associated with metal thiolates introduce\nfurther complications in modeling such active sites. While steric\nenforcement of the thiolate \u03b1-C presents a reasonable modification\nto prevent undesired chemistry, Ni<sup>III</sup>-SR complexes are\nstill very much transiently characterized, and despite interest in\nthis particular species in NiSOD and [NiFe]-hydrogenases, the only structurally characterized monomeric\nNi<sup>III</sup>-SR complex was published \u223c20 years ago in\n1998. In fact, complexes <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> represent the only LMW NiSOD models comprising\nthe \u201cNiSOD-accurate\u201d N<sub>carboxamide</sub>N<sub>amine</sub>S<sub>2</sub> in-plane coordination sphere where isolation and characterization\nof oxidation products has been accomplished. Furthermore, it is quite\ncommon to read the phrase, \u201coxidation of M-SR results in intractable\nspecies\u201d in the synthetic metal thiolate literature. The isolation\nand crystallization of oxidation products such as thiazolidine complex <bold>5</bold> reflect the reactive nature of the Ni<sup>II</sup>-N<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub> coordination sphere of <bold>2</bold>, and by\nanalogy NiSOD, an oxidation path likely turned on, yet never observed\nbefore, by incorporation of the <italic>gem</italic>-(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> groups on the S \u03b1-C. Another common decomposition\nfor Ni<sup>III</sup>-peptido complexes involves H atoms in positions\nthat neighbor the peptide functionality. Indeed, methylation of the\nmethylene groups of the tripeptide Ni-GGG results in a Ni<sup>III</sup> complex stable for days even in the presence of 5 M HClO<sub>4</sub>.

These observations lead to several postulates as to how this reactivity is deterred in the enzyme. For example: (i) structural restrictions imposed by the macromolecule may prevent disulfide as well as other ligand oxidized species, (ii) protonation of Cys2 and/or Cys6 will decrease the S nucleophilicity and diminish S-character in the HOMO, and (iii) the catalytic cycle could involve 5C Ni(III/II); this geometry would alter the electronic structure such that the HOMO is primarily Ni-based. Indeed, the degree of covalency in the Ni-SCys bonds of SOD rival those found in Fe/S clusters and blue-copper proteins. The NiSOD electronic structure thus presents challenges to the synthetic modeling chemist, where strategies must be employed to prevent autoreduction reactions in addition to formation of S-bridged oligomers of uncontrollable nuclearity. Autoredox is especially difficult to overcome with high-valent metals (NiIII, FeIII) because of the low oxidation potential of alkyl thiolates, i.e., MII-SR + ox \u2192 [MIII-SR] \u2192 MII + 1/2 RSSR. Collectively, the additional reactions associated with metal thiolates introduce further complications in modeling such active sites. While steric enforcement of the thiolate \u03b1-C presents a reasonable modification to prevent undesired chemistry, NiIII-SR complexes are still very much transiently characterized, and despite interest in this particular species in NiSOD and [NiFe]-hydrogenases, the only structurally characterized monomeric NiIII-SR complex was published ~20 years ago in 1998. In fact, complexes 1 and 2 represent the only LMW NiSOD models comprising the \"NiSOD-accurate\" NcarboxamideNamineS2 in-plane coordination sphere where isolation and characterization of oxidation products has been accomplished. Furthermore, it is quite common to read the phrase, \"oxidation of M-SR results in intractable species\" in the synthetic metal thiolate literature. The isolation and crystallization of oxidation products such as thiazolidine complex 5 reflect the reactive nature of the NiII-N2S2 coordination sphere of 2, and by analogy NiSOD, an oxidation path likely turned on, yet never observed before, by incorporation of the gem-(CH3)2 groups on the S \u03b1-C. Another common decomposition for NiIII-peptido complexes involves H atoms in positions that neighbor the peptide functionality. Indeed, methylation of the methylene groups of the tripeptide Ni-GGG results in a NiIII complex stable for days even in the presence of 5 M HClO4. While this decomposition reaction is not observed here, its description is warranted for future modeling efforts. As Maroney stated some 30 years ago, \"Ni  III  has no  real existence  with simple alkyl thiolates\". This statement has some truth, as even \"complicated\" thiolates in the NiII complexes 2, [Ni(BEAAM)]-, [Ni(L1)]-, and the sterically demanding [Ni(nbdt)2]- (nbdt = bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-exo-cis-2,3-dithiolate or norbornanedithiolate) do not result in isolable NiIII complexes. Enforcing a five-coordinate pyramidal geometry about the NiII center may be the only way to change the electronic structure to yield a primarily Ni centered redox-active MO to achieve catalysis. Overall, future ligand constructs must consider the aforementioned points and, in particular, the highly covalent nature (Ni-d\u03c0/S-p\u03c0) of the NiSODred HOMO.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 53, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Experimental\nSection</title><title>General Information</title><p>All reagents were purchased from\ncommercial suppliers and used as received unless otherwise noted.\nAcetonitrile (MeCN), methylene chloride (CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>), tetrahydrofuran (THF), diethyl ether (Et<sub>2</sub>O), and pentane\nwere purified by passage through activated alumina columns using an\nMBraun MB-SPS solvent purification system and stored over 4 \u00c5\nmolecular sieves under an N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere before use. <italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>-Dimethylformamide (DMF) was purified\nwith a VAC Solvent Purifier containing 4 \u00c5 molecular sieves and\nstored under similar conditions.

The reaction mixture was stirred at RT for 15 min. To this solution was then added Et3SiH (0.294 mL, 1.84 mmol), which caused the solution to immediately lose its color intensity and become a pale red-brown. After 30 min of stirring at RT, the mixture was concentrated via short-path vacuum distillation to yield a red-pink oil with white solids. The oil was triturated with pentane (4 \u00d7 5 mL) to remove Ph3CH. The resulting oil was then dissolved in 12 mL of CH2Cl2, and to it was added solid NaHCO3 until no more effervescence was observed. After 2 h of stirring, the solution turned from brown to yellow. The insolubles were filtered off through Celite and washed with CH2Cl2.

The NaOMe solution was added to 4 mL of a light yellow MeOH solution of H3N3S2 Me2 (0.3315 g, 1.057 mmol) to yield a dark yellow solution after 1 h of stirring at RT. A 2 mL MeOH solution of NiCl2 (0.1361 g, 1.050 mmol) was then added to the reaction mixture, which immediately became dark red. The red solution was stirred at RT for 18 h. After it was stirred, the solution was filtered over Celite to remove any insolubles and concentrated to a dark solid. This solid was then dissolved in 50 mL of THF and stirred at RT for 1 h. The resulting dark red THF solution was filtered over Celite to remove NaCl. Finally, the filtrate was concentrated to a dark residue, to which a minimal amount of MeCN was added to triturate the solid, and the orange-brown product was collected via vacuum filtration (0.2288 g, 0.5835 mmol, 56%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, (CD3)2SO, \u03b4 from protio solvent): 8.54 (d, 1H, J = 4.3 Hz), 8.37 (d, 1H, J = 7.8 Hz), 7.82 (td, 1H, J = 7.7 Hz, 1.5 Hz), 7.31 (dd, 1H, J = 6.9 Hz, 5.1 Hz), 4.80 (d, 1H, J = 13.5 Hz), 4.39 (d, 1H, J = 13.4 Hz), 3.46 (d, 1H, J = 15.1 Hz), 3.30 (d, 1H, J = 15.1 Hz), 3.01 (d, 1H, J = 12.1 Hz), 2.71 (m, 2H), 2.35 (m, 1H), 1.90 (m, 1H), 1.76 (m, 1H), 1.43 (s, 3H), 1.27 (s, 3H). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CD3OD, \u03b4 from protio solvent): 11.76 (broad s, 1H), 10.14 (d, 1H, J = 6.9 Hz), 8.32 (s, 1H), 8.10 (t, 2H, J = 7.5 Hz), 6.01 (s, 1H), 5.88 (s, 1H), 5.49 (s, 1H), 4.54 (s, 1H), 4.42 (s, 1H), 4.35 (s, 1H), 3.99 (m, 2H), 2.98 (s, 1H), 1.91 (s, 3H), 1.86 (s, 3H). 1H NMR (500 MHz, D2O, \u03b4 from protio solvent): 10.45 (broad s, 1H), 9.92 (d, 1H, J = 6.4 Hz), 8.11 (t, 1H, J = 7.6 Hz), 8.04 (s, 1H), 7.29 (broad s, 1H), 5.34 (s, 1H), 5.15 (s, 1H), 4.06 (d, 1H, J = 14.3 Hz), 3.80 (d, 1H, J = 7.9 Hz), 3.71 (s, 1H), 3.63 (s, 2H), 3.40 (s, 1H), 2.54 (s, 1H), 1.77 (s, 3H), 1.61 (s, 3H).

To this solution was then added 0.228 g (0.727 mmol) of H3N3S2 Me2 in 4 mL of MeOH. After the mixture was stirred at RT for 30 min, a solid batch of Ni(OAc)2\u22c54H2O (0.160 g, 0.643 mmol) was added that generated a deep red-brown solution within seconds. After 2 h of stirring at RT, the reaction mixture was filtered to remove any insolubles and concentrated to dryness. The resultant brown residue was taken up in 4 mL of a MeOH/MeCN (1:1) solution, and 10 mL of Et2O was slowly added to result in the precipitation of 0.271 g of solid (0.664 mmol, >100%, byproducts such as KOAc present in the isolated product). Lustrous red, microcrystalline solids deposited from the mother liquor over 48 h; the FTIR spectrum of the bulk and microcrystalline products indicate the same product. Recrystallization of these solids by slow diffusion of Et2O into a MeOH/MeCN (1:1) saturated solution of the product afforded small red-orange crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction. The spectroscopic properties of this compound were nearly identical with those of 2.\n\nNa[Zn(N3S2 Me2)] (3)\n\nA yellow MeOH solution (3 mL) containing H3N3S2 Me2 (0.1657 g, 0.5286 mmol) was mixed with sodium metal (0.0429 g, 1.87 mmol) to result in vigorous bubbling and a dark yellow homogeneous solution. After 20 min of stirring at RT, a 1 mL MeOH solution containing ZnCl2 (0.0719 g, 0.528 mmol) was added, resulting in immediate precipitation of white solids. After it was stirred at RT for 90 min, the reaction mixture was filtered over Celite to remove the white (NaCl) solid, and the filtrate was stripped to dryness to yield a yellow solid. The yellow solid was dissolved in 30 mL of THF and stirred at RT for 6 h. The light yellow insoluble solid was collected and washed with copious amounts of THF and then stirred in 25 mL of MeCN at RT for 3 h.
