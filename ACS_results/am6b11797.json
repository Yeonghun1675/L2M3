Quantitatively, the quenching effect can be approximately illustrated by the Stern-Volmer Equation I 0/I = 1 + K SV[M], wherein the values I 0 and I are the PL intensities of the suspension of MOF in the absence and presence of analytes, respectively. [M] represents the molar concentration of analytes, and K SV is related to Stern-Volmer quenching constant. Figure S4 shows the Stern-Volmer quenching curve describing I 0/I as a function of Hg2+ concentration in the wide range of 0-600 \u03bcM with a linear fit coefficient of 0.9986 and a K sv value of 9390 M-1, which is superior to the value (4550 M-1) for amino-decorated MOF utilized for detection of Hg2+ in aqueous solution, demonstrating its obvious quenching effect on the PL intensity of 1. Particularly, the quenching can be visually observed under usual UV light, as exemplified in the inset of a. As far as we know, MOF materials as luminescent sensors for Hg2+ are very rare.
