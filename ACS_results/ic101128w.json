The two first signals are assigned to water molecules and have a pronounced chemical shift difference arising for MIL-121_as from the crystallization water and for the activated one by its spontaneous rehydration. The water species in the case of the as-synthesized and activated sample have a strongly different interaction with extra-framework H<sub>4</sub>btec or directly with the framework H<sub>2</sub>btec that already have their hydrogen bonds saturated within the framework.

First, a double quantum to single quantum correlation (DQ-SQ) using a BABA excitation and reconversion of dipolar coupling reintroduction, and second a single quantum-single quantum (SQ-SQ) RFDR sequence were acquired on sample MIL-121_ht to gain more information on the assignment and the nature of interaction between the different protons. These experiments are complementary, where the 2D DQ-SQ spectrum provides short-range interaction, whereas the 2D SQ-SQ RFDR spectrum provides much longer range interaction. The DQ-SQ experiment has a unique characteristic, by showing evidence of dipolar coupling occurring between crystallographically identical sites whereas RFDR experiments sense the dipolar couplings to a much longer distance range.

This result is consistent with the existence of water clusters weakly interacting with the host material. This weak intensity reflects also a small residual dipolar interaction, indicating some water mobility of at least rotational origin. Except from the self-correlated sites, the same results are obtained with the RFDR spectrum recorded with 266 \u03bcs mixing time (Figure a) exhibiting the same correlations previously seen in the DQ experiments. RFDR correlations for long mixing time (2.66 ms) shown in Figure b, involve the water signal of <bold>H</bold>\n<sub>2</sub>O<sub>p</sub> at 3 ppm with the three signals belonging to the framework indicating a long distance between water and the framework.

This is consistent with having <bold>H</bold>\n<sub>2</sub>O<sub>b</sub> in the infinite hydrogen bonding network, a position that shares this geometrical situation.</p>", "clean_text": "On the 1H side only the assignment of two signals per spectrum remain to be validated: the signal at 5.2 ppm observed in the 1H spectrum of MIL-121_as, and 3.1 ppm for MIL-121_ht, and for both compounds the signal at 6.9-7.1 ppm. The two first signals are assigned to water molecules and have a pronounced chemical shift difference arising for MIL-121_as from the crystallization water and for the activated one by its spontaneous rehydration. The water species in the case of the as-synthesized and activated sample have a strongly different interaction with extra-framework H4btec or directly with the framework H2btec that already have their hydrogen bonds saturated within the framework. This is the origin of the strong chemical shift difference. The amount of water present as guest molecules was found to be 0.6H2O per framework Al(OH)[H2btec] unit before activation and became 1.7H2O per Al after removal of extra-framework organic species, with the sample stored in ambient air. The presence of the extra-framework H4btec introduces some hydrophobicity with the aromatic rings, and some volume occupancy in the material. Activation by thermal treatment improves the access of water to the pores by freeing some volume and removing hydrophobicity. 2D 1H-1H experiments have been used to clarify the water situation. First, a double quantum to single quantum correlation (DQ-SQ) using a BABA excitation and reconversion of dipolar coupling reintroduction, and second a single quantum-single quantum (SQ-SQ) RFDR sequence were acquired on sample MIL-121_ht to gain more information on the assignment and the nature of interaction between the different protons. These experiments are complementary, where the 2D DQ-SQ spectrum provides short-range interaction, whereas the 2D SQ-SQ RFDR spectrum provides much longer range interaction. The DQ-SQ experiment has a unique characteristic, by showing evidence of dipolar coupling occurring between crystallographically identical sites whereas RFDR experiments sense the dipolar couplings to a much longer distance range. Figure  shows 2D BABA contour plots of MIL-121_ht acquired with two different mixing times. The connectivities between distinct proton signals are shown as horizontal lines in Figure . The strong correlations between signals at bridging OH, CH, and COOH ppm indicate clearly their presence in vicinity to each other. It confirms their assignment to framework protons of the bridging hydroxide groups and H2btec of the network. The small signal assigned to H 2Ob at 7.1 ppm correlates with the CH of framework H2btec resonance at 7.9 ppm indicating that the corresponding species is at a short distance of the framework organic linker. This signal, however, does not show any correlation with OH groups resonance at 4.3 ppm, indicating a longer distance to OH groups. The signal at 2.4-2.9 ppm assigned to H 2Op, present only an autocorrelation, appears to be very weak in the experiment with short mixing time (133 \u03bcs), and its intensity increases only slightly with longer mixing time (266 \u03bcs). This result is consistent with the existence of water clusters weakly interacting with the host material. This weak intensity reflects also a small residual dipolar interaction, indicating some water mobility of at least rotational origin. Except from the self-correlated sites, the same results are obtained with the RFDR spectrum recorded with 266 \u03bcs mixing time (Figure a) exhibiting the same correlations previously seen in the DQ experiments. RFDR correlations for long mixing time (2.66 ms) shown in Figure b, involve the water signal of H 2Op at 3 ppm with the three signals belonging to the framework indicating a long distance between water and the framework. The correlation between H 2Ob at 7 ppm and COOH at 11.7 ppm and CH at 7.9 ppm signals is also observed in this experiment, revealing a shorter distance between H 2Ob and CH than with COOH.

The first weight loss between 380 and 410 \u00b0C could be assigned to the departure of two CO2 molecules from the non-coordinating -COOH groups (obs.: 10%, calc.: 7.6%). The second step between 410 and 520 \u00b0C is attributed to the decomposition of the ligand (obs.: 69.3%; calc.: 71.5%). The final residue (obs.: 17.6%) is a white powder and corresponds to aluminum oxide Al2O3 (calc.: 16.8%). The TG curve of the as-synthesized product (MIL-121_as) slightly differs since a continuous weight loss is observed between room temperature and 360 \u00b0C. The first step between room temperature and 200 \u00b0C is assigned to the departure of trapped water molecules (obs.: 7.2% or 1.5 H2O/Al). From 200 up to 360 \u00b0C, the second weight loss could be attributed to the removal of the free pyromellitic acid (encapsulated within the channel), and this would correspond to 0.1 H4btec/Al (obs.: 6.1%). This step is not observed for the activated MIL-121_ht form, for which the trapped organic species have been removed. The total decomposition of the organic ligand occurs between 380 and 520 \u00b0C (obs.: 70.5%; calc.: 68.6%). The final residue (obs.: 14%) is a white powder and corresponds to aluminum oxide Al2O3 (calc.: 14.6%). One can notice that the content of the encapsulated species (H4btec, H2O) differs from those obtained from the powder XRD data analysis. The latter gave a chemical formula Al(OH)(H2btec)\u22c50.27H4btec\u22c50.19H2O, while TGA gives Al(OH)(H2btec)\u22c50.1H4btec\u22c51.5H2O. The latter composition is close to the elementary chemical analysis which gave: Al: obs: 6.84% ; calc: 7.74% ; C: obs: 36.13% ; calc: 37.88% ; H: obs: 2.00% ; calc: 2.46% for MIL-121_as. This difference may come from the difficulties to measure the exact amount of adsorbed water in porous matrixes, since this value is sensitive to ambient air moisture. This varies according to the situation of the experiment measurement (TG cell in a laboratory or glass capillary under high flux X-ray from synchrotron radiation). Moreover, there are still some difficulties to accurately locate disordered molecules trapped within one-dimensional (1D) channels of porous frameworks by XRD.\n\nThe porosity of the activated compound of MIL-121 was characterized by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method with the adsorption of liquid nitrogen at 77 K. The BET and Langmuir specific surface areas were 162(6) m2 g-1 and 244(1) m2 g-1, respectively. These values are much lower than the ones determined for the parent compound MIL-53 involving 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate linker (BET: 1140 m2 g-1). The decrease of the specific surface area is due to the steric hindrance of the free non-coordinated -COOH groups within the channels, which reduce the access of other guest molecules.", "data":
