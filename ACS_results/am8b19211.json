In this way, the distance between the corresponding 13C and 15N atoms was obtained. To validate the accuracy of this method, the distances between the 15N atoms and the 13C atoms within the TCBPP linker were analyzed as internal standards, and also to obtain the numerical simulation parameters (Figures S46 and S47). The distance from the 15N atoms in the TCBPP linker to the 13C atoms in RhB molecules at position c peak with a chemical shift of 130 ppm was 3.24 \u00c5, whereas that from 15N atoms to 13C atoms at position a/b with a chemical shift of 12 ppm was 3.37 \u00c5 (A,C,D); both were in the typical range of \u03c0-interactions. Again, this accurate distance measurement pinned the relative position of RhB to the porphyrin \u03c0-interaction sites in the backbone of MOF-526-H2.

The Langmuir model was used for the fitting of the equilibrium uptake of RhB (Q e, mg/g) at different residual concentrations (C e, mol/L), which is consistent with the quantitative ratio between RhB and porphyrin \u03c0-interaction sites in MOFs, 2:1. (E) Comparison of the reversibility and repetitive operation of the state-of-the-art porous carbon (blue curves at the top) and MOF-526 (red curves in the bottom) for the inclusion and release of RhB at the initial concentration of 10 ppm. The kinetics of organic molecules' inclusion remained unaltered for MOF-526 with specific \u03c0-interaction sites after 10 repeated cycles, whereas that of porous carbon decreased after the second cycle because of the lack of specific interaction.
