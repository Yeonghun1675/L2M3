In addition, the semirigid V-shaped carboxylate ligand is conducive to form the interpenetrating structure. Previous examples of eight-connected framework are commonly composed of Co, Cd, Cu atoms and so on. There are few reports on the construction of Zn-MOFs with eight connections. Recently, Long Chen et al. have enumerated an eight-connected net based on two different trinuclear {Zn3} secondary building units, and the FDA2- serves as bridging linker. In this case, NNU-1 is clearly different from the previous, where the {Zn5} cluster as an eight-connected node and the semirigid V-shaped hfipbb2- as bridging linkers to form the bcu net. Moreover, two bcu nets interweave into a two-fold interpenetrating network that is rarely reported before.
