As a result, 5 could be obtained by adding CuI to 1 in DMSO, and 5 could be converted into 1 via addition of CdII in acetonitrile. We infer the stronger solvation of free CdII by DMSO, and CuI by acetonitrile, to drive the solvent-dependent metal exchange that allows 1 and 5 to interconvert. The combination of different solvent stability and differential oxocarbon anion recognition ability allows us to envisage a cycle of loading and release of anions by solvent-mediated interconversion between 1 and 5. The sequence of steps is shown in Figure : (i) To an acetonitrile solution of receptor 1 containing free CuI (4 equiv) was added anion 2 (2.4 equiv), leading to formation of the (2)2\u22c51 complex, i.e., anion loading. (ii) Addition of DMSO stimulated the replacement of the CdII ions of the complex with CuI ions, resulting in transformation of 1 into 5 and thus release of the 2 equiv of 2.
