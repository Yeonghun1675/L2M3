The calculated patterns were generated with Mercury. Thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) coupled to mass spectrometer (STA449 F3 Jupiter-QMS 403C aedo) was used, and TG analysis was performed under the flowing N2 atm at a scan rate of 10 K min-1. Photoluminescence spectra including decay curves and absolute quantum yield were measured on an Edinburgh Instrument FLS920 combined fluorescence lifetime and steady state spectrometer. The steady-state luminescence was excited using unpolarized light from a 450 W xenon CW lamp at 298 K. The photoluminescence quantum yield was measured by using a 150 mm, BaSO4 coated integrating sphere set into the FLS920 sample chamber. The quantum yield was evaluated as the ratio of the emission photon number to absorption photon number. BaSO4 was conducted as the standard sample to record the number of photons which are not absorbed by the test sample. The existence of Ag/Cu and their ratio were determined by means of energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) (S-520/INCA 300, Hitachi/Oxford, Japan) at room temperature.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 26, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>X-ray Crystallography and Data Collection</title><p>Diffraction\nintensities data of <bold>1</bold> were collected on a Rigaku R-AXIS\nSPIDER IP diffractometer using Mo K<sub>\u03b1</sub> radiation (\u03bb\n= 1.54056 \u00c5) at 150(2) K, while the diffraction intensities data\nof <bold>2</bold> were collected on a Oxford Diffraction Gemini R\nCCD diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 1.54178 \u00c5).\nThe structures were solved by direct methods, and all non-hydrogen\natoms were refined anisotropically, through least-squares on <italic toggle=\"yes\">F</italic>\n<sup>2</sup> using the SHELXTL program suite.
