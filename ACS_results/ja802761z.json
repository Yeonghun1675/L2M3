The positioning of the p-xylene molecules allows lateral interactions between the methyl group of one p-xylene molecule and the \u03c0-system of an adjacent p-xylene molecule. Similar arrangements of the \u03c0-system and a methyl group are, for instance, also found in the crystal structure of p-xylene itself and in p-xylene-loaded silicalite. The increasing affinity of MIL-53 for p-xylene at higher intraporous concentrations (Figure ) may then be explained by favorable adsorbate-adsorbate interactions which become possible only when adsorbed p-xylene molecules are close to each other. Note that similar interactions do not occur for the ortho- and meta-isomers since both of their methyl groups already interact with the MIL-53 framework at high degrees of pore filling, as can be perceived from Figure . Regarding the second MIL-53 phase with the Pnma space group, we failed to precisely localize p-xylene in this phase. Molecule positions did not converge onto a specific site. From inspection of difference electron Fourier charts, no considerable electron density due to guest molecules anywhere close to the framework was found. This suggests that this phase contains only a low concentration of p-xylene, and that it is formed when MIL-53ht is exposed to a small dose of p-xylene. Only when the p-xylene concentration is increased is the Imma MIL-53 phase with interacting p-xylene molecules formed.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 32, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Next, <italic toggle=\"yes\">o</italic>-cymene was localized in the host to see whether the strong adsorption of the C<sub>9</sub> and C<sub>10</sub>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">ortho</italic>-isomers can be ascribed to their ability to interact via two side chains simultaneously.
