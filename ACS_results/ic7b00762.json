The UTSA-222 contains two-dimensional intersecting channels with the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area and pore volume of 703 m2 g-1 and 0.344 cm3 g-1, respectively, for the activated sample. It shows moderately high adsorption selectivity for C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/CH4 separations at 1 atm and room temperature.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nSingle Crystal X-ray Structure\n\nSingle-crystal X-ray diffraction studies show that UTSA-222 crystallizes in the trigonal system with a space group of R32. As expected, the Tb(III) ions and ODA2- ligands form [Tb(ODA)]+ metalloligands, which were connected with each other by Tb-O bonds to obtain 2D layers (a) with a Tb\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Tb distance of 6.315(6) \u00c5, and all uncoordinated sites of Tb (III) ions located two sides of the layer (Figure S1).

The shortest Tb\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Tb distance between the layers is 15.64 \u00c5. Simplification of the network structure by TOPOS program reveals that UTSA-222 has the sqc4 topological type with Schla\u0308fli symbol {36.418.53.6} (c).

The solvent-accessible volume is calculated to be 44.8% by using PLATON.\n\nLuminescent Properties of UTSA-222 \n\nThe solid-state photoluminescence of UTSA-222 was investigated at room temperature. The emission spectrum (excited at 398 nm) exhibits five main characteristic emissions of the Tb(III) ions at 489, 544, 583, 621, and 645 nm correspond to the 5D4 \u2192 7F J  (J = 6-2) transition for Tb3+ ions (Figure S2).\n\nGas Adsorption Properties of UTSA-222a \n\nThe permanent porosity was established by the N2 sorption isotherm at 77 K. Prior to gas adsorption measurement, the as-synthesized UTSA-222 was solvent-exchanged with dry acetone, followed by vacuum activation at 353 K to generate activated UTSA-222a. PXRD of UTSA-222a matches with the as-synthesized one, indicating that the 3D framework is intact after activation (Figure S3). As shown in Figure S5, the N2 sorption isotherm shows a type-I adsorption behavior with an uptake of 173.3 cm3 g-1, characteristic of a microporous material. The Langmuir surface area, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) area, and pore volume were 790 m2 g-1, 703 m2 g-1, and 0.344 cm3 g-1, respectively, based on the N2 sorption isotherm at 77 K.\n\nThe unique structure and permanent microporosity of UTSA-222a prompt us to examine its potential applications as an adsorbent for industrially important gases, such as C2H2, C2H4, CH4, and CO2. The sorption isotherms of C2H2, C2H4, CH4, and CO2 were collected up to 1 atm at 273 and 296 K. As shown in , the isotherms are completely reversible and show no hysteresis. At 1 atm, UTSA-222a exhibited a C2H2 uptake of 103.4 and 85.3 cm3 g-1 at 273 and 296 K, respectively. The C2H2 adsorption capacity at room temperature is much higher than that of UTSA-68 (70.1 cm3 g-1), ZJU-30 (51.8 cm3 g-1), MIL-53 (72 cm3 g-1), MAF-2 (70 cm3 g-1), and UTSA-35 (65.0 cm3 g-1) but slightly lower than MOF-508 (90 cm3 g-1). In stark contrast to C2H2, UTSA-222a can adsorb much smaller amount of CO2  (42.7 cm3 g-1) and only tiny amount of CH4 (13.4 cm3 g-1) at 296 K, indicating UTSA-222a has the potential for C2H2/CH4 and C2H2/CO2 separation at ambient conditions. The C2H2/CO2 uptake ratio of UTSA-222a is close to 2.0 at 296 K, which is lower than that of MAF-2 (3.7) but higher than that of other adsorbents (1.0-1.7). As established before, the relatively high C2H2 uptake is mainly attributed to moderate pore sizes and the \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 stacking between C2H2 molecules and phenyls of BPDC2- ligands. Meanwhile, because of the strong Lewis acidity of C2H2, the HC\ue5fcC-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5phenyl interactions could also contribute to the C2H2 adsorption.
