Exchanging DMF for methanol and heating at 160 \u00b0C under dynamic vacuum for 48 h results in the desolvated framework Cr3(BTC)2. Nitrogen gas adsorption measurements performed at 77 K revealed a type I isotherm, indicating BET and Langmuir surface areas of 1810 and 2040 m2/g, respectively. At 298 K, the O2 adsorption isotherm for Cr3(BTC)2 rises steeply to a capacity of 11 wt % at 2 mbar, while the corresponding N2 adsorption isotherm displays very little uptake, gradually rising to a capacity of 0.58 wt % at 1 bar. Accordingly, the material displays an unprecedented O2/N2 selectivity factor of 22. Deoxygenation of the sample could be accomplished by heating at 50 \u00b0C under vacuum for 48 h, leading to a gradually diminishing uptake capacity over the course of 15 consecutive adsorption/desorption cycles.
