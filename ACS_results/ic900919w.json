According to the unique shape of bilayer structure, each bilayer undergoes 90\u00b0 rotation and a certain offset from its neighbor to accomplish efficient packing. Since the grid size is larger than twice the thickness of a benzene ring, 3D intersecting, narrow channels (d 3.2 \u00c5) are retained after interdigitation (Figure ). Nevertheless, these channels (void 25.9%) are occupied by the coordinated MeOH molecules, and no solvent accessible volume can be found in the crystal structure of 1. Similar structures have been observed in the isostructural NH2(CH3)2[NaM(ipa)2] (M = Cd or Co), which also contain similar anionic [M(ipa)2] n  square grids linked by Na(I) ions.
