A review of potential routes revealed three methods most amenable to this aim: (i) activation of pyridine-N-oxide with the phosphonium salt PyBroP, (ii) synthesis of a linear 1,5-dicarbonyl precursor with subsequent oxidation to a pyridine ring, or (iii) a copper-catalyzed Ullman-type reaction with 2,6-dibromopyridine. Although we were able to add a single malonate unit to pyridine-N-oxide with PyBroP, a second addition was not observed upon further reaction of the monosubstituted pyridine-N-oxide intermediate under the same conditions. Additionally, while we were able to isolate the linear precursor tetraethyl 2,6-dioxoheptane-1,1,7,7-tetracarboxylate, exposure of this molecule to the amine sources needed to close the ring (NH3, NH4OH, NH4OAc, or NH2OH) only resulted in decarboxylation of the diethyl malonate components, even at room temperature. Ultimately, we found the Ullman-type reaction to be the most successful, and requiring shorter reaction times than originally reported.

In the\nfirst step, a copper-catalyzed Ullman-type reaction substituted both\nbromine atoms on the pyridine with diethyl malonate units. Attempts\nwere also made with diethyl methylmalonate; however, no reaction was\nobserved. The majority of unwanted side products were then removed\nfrom the crude oil via column chromatography. One impurity that could\nnot be completely eliminated, however, was likely the asymmetric decomposition\nproduct formed by the loss of a single ester group (see the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of the chromatographed oil, ). In spite of this impurity, methylation at the tertiary\ncarbon was performed successfully with methyl iodide and K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> at room temperature under N<sub>2</sub> in anhydrous\nDMF.

Subsequently, the flask was cooled to 0 \u00b0C in an ice bath, and the reaction was quenched with 200 mL of water followed by 200 mL of Et2O.

While the solution was stirred at ambient temperature in a 20 mL vial, 0.3 mL of hydrogen peroxide (34-37% by mass) was slowly added dropwise over 1.5 min. The vial was left to stir uncapped for 24 h, and the solution was then concentrated to 3 mL. Dark purple needles suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained by slow diffusion of acetone into the aqueous solution at room temperature over 3 d. The final product (46.9 mg, 85% yield) was collected by vacuum filtration, and the solids were washed three times with 1.5 mL of methanol. 1H NMR (D2O, 400 MHz) \u03b4 8.30 (t, J = 8.1 Hz, 1H), 7.78 (d, J = 8.1 Hz, 2H), 1.83 (s, 6H).

In the first step, a copper-catalyzed Ullman-type reaction substituted both bromine atoms on the pyridine with diethyl malonate units. Attempts were also made with diethyl methylmalonate; however, no reaction was observed. The majority of unwanted side products were then removed from the crude oil via column chromatography. One impurity that could not be completely eliminated, however, was likely the asymmetric decomposition product formed by the loss of a single ester group (see the 1H NMR spectrum of the chromatographed oil, ). In spite of this impurity, methylation at the tertiary carbon was performed successfully with methyl iodide and K2CO3 at room temperature under N2 in anhydrous DMF. Pure PY(CO2Et)4 was isolated as a white solid in 62% yield (based on 2,6-dibromopyridine) after recrystallization from a dichloromethane solution layered with hexanes and stored at -20 \u00b0C overnight. The ester ligand is soluble in ethereal, halogenated, and polar organic solvents such as acetone and methanol, and it can be stored indefinitely at room temperature.", "data": [["This model's maximum context length is 4097 tokens.
