The btb ligands show completely anti (antianti-anti) and gauche-antigauche conformations in 1 and gauche-antianti conformation in 2, respectively. The polycarboxylate ligands can construct hydrophilic systems with a different gap. The gap of these hydrophilic systems can be filled by water molecules. The size of the water clusters can be controlled by adjusting the gap by the choice of the appropriate organic spacer and polycarboxylate.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 18, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Additional figures for crystal structures, the luminescence spectra, TG and IR.
