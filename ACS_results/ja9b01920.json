The AUBM-4 crystals display not only notable chemical stability but also high photostability and were employed as a photocatalyst for the reduction of carbon dioxide to formate under visible light irradiation. The obtained conversion rate (366 \u03bcmol\u22c5g-1\u22c5h-1) was among the highest reported in the literature. Recyclability of the MOF catalyst was further investigated and showed that our MOF catalyst was highly stable and was successfully regenerated. Finally, DFT calculations were performed and a mechanism for CO2 reduction over AUBM-4 was proposed.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 23, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting\nInformation is\navailable free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.9b01920\">10.1021/jacs.9b01920</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Crystallographic\ndata for AUBM-4 (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.9b01920/suppl_file/ja9b01920_si_001.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Synthesis and characterization of the\u00a0Ru\u00ad(cptpy)<sub>2</sub> linker; synthesis and single X-ray details of AUBM-4 crystals\nin addition to SEMs, BET, TGAs, PXRDs after the chemical stability\ntests; details of the photocatalytic reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> including <sup>13</sup>C NMR and characterization of the MOF after the reaction;\nDFT calculations (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.9b01920/suppl_file/ja9b01920_si_002.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Crystallographic data for Ru\u00ad(cptpy)<sub>2</sub> (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.9b01920/suppl_file/ja9b01920_si_003.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/jacs.9b01920.
