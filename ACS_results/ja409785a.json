The activation energy E a(dc) also decreased with increasing doping amount of the [Rh2 II,II] unit, suggesting the electronic band structure changed with doping. However, the structure of the conducting pathway is essentially invariant, and the dopant P does not provide any energetically relevant electron/hole band. Thus, this electron transport should be dominated by the charge carrier density, i.e., the number of A0/A- sets. Consequently, E a(dc) should be the activation energy for bulk conductivity.
