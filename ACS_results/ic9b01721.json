The low symmetry (C2/c) framework, [Zr6(\u03bc3-O)4(\u03bc3-OH)4(L4)(HL4)2(OH)2(H2O)2], is built upon a rare 10-connected Zr6 cluster. Two-thirds of the ligands bear one nondeprotonated carboxy group, and the framework has a complex trinodal 3,4,10-c, {414.624.87}{43}2{45.6}, underlying net. Supercritical CO2 drying and mild degassing at 120 \u00b0C yielded a porous material with S BET = 1190 m2 g-1. When heated up to ~200 \u00b0C, ZRTE-10 converts to another crystalline framework, ZRTE-11. The latter was identified to be identical to the expected fluorite (flu) observed previously for other tetrahedral ligands. The high symmetry (I4/m) framework is built upon 8-connected Zr6 clusters and has a formula of [Zr6(\u03bc3-O)4(\u03bc3-OH)4(OH)4(L4)2]. The complicated trinodal network of ZRTE-10 and the simple flu net in ZRTE-11 are topologically interrelated via the operation of the merging of two neighbor three-connected nodes to one four-connected one. The thermally induced conversion of ZRTE-10 proceeds with expulsion of one ligand per Zr6 node in the pores of the framework, resulting in a relatively low S BET = 585 m2 g-1 for the activated H4L4@ZRTE-11. A mixed ligand approach for ZRTE-10,11 was attempted using 1,3,5-tetra(carboxyphenyl)benzene (H3L3), which is a truncated analog of H4L4 with one missing branch. The monocrystalline sample of ZRTE-10 obtained in small yields demonstrated only minor inclusion of H3L3. However, the high-yielding (~80%) procedure with HCl as a modulator allows near proportional incorporation of the ligands. The formed materials are semiamorphous with powder XRDs intermediary between pure ZRTE-10 and -11. Thermal treatment of the semiamorphous materials increases their crystallinity and allows S BET = 400-550 m2 g-1 surface areas to be reached for pure H4L4 and H3L3 or their mixture alike. The approach proposes a viewpoint on the H3L3 trifunctional ligand as a model of a ligand platform, suitable for bearing a large functionality on the fourth \"truncated\" branch.

The preparation for low temperature degassing (120 \u00b0C) involved an acetone exchange with short exposition, followed by thorough supercritical CO2 drying (sc-CO2). The procedure allowed the removal of nearly all the DMF, which was confirmed by IR spectroscopy (Figure S21). 1', obtained by the degassing of 1 (or its analogue, prepared using acetic acid), is mostly retained in the framework structure under low temperature degassing (, first signs of conversion to 2' after 24 h of degassing in a capillary; Figure S8, typical 3 h degassing, less precise flat sample-holder measurement). The maximal surface area of 1190 m2 g-1 was registered, with little difference between materials synthesized using formic or acetic acid (, , S14). The simulated value for the solvent-free framework of 1' is 1886 m2 g-1 (); the discrepancy might be explained by the decrease of crystallinity due to start of conversion to 2' and the presence of minor amounts of residual solvent. The converted structure of 2' has a maximum observed porosity of 576 m2 g-1. It is only a fifth of the simulated value of the idealized 2 with a fluorite structure (2' \u2261 2\u22c5H4L4). Evidently, the encapsulated ligand, which is expelled to the pores during conversion, takes its toll. The ligand is larger than the vdW opening of the flu net cage; the openings have a lozenge shape with sides equal to the ligand's branch, . Hence, no ligand's mobility was expected, especially because of the generally low solubility of the H4L4 ligand. The hypothesis was checked experimentally, but no increase of surface area was registered for 2\u22c5H4L4 after soaking in DMF for 2 days and subsequent activation.\n\nThe semiamorphous phases degassed at a low temperature (120 \u00b0C) demonstrated low surface areas, with the remarkable exception of the I/II-PhCOOH sample (763 m2 g-1).

The thermal treatment at ~200 \u00b0C evidently \"equilibrates\" the structures with a tendency toward being near the phase II-type structurally. The considerable surface area of the semiamorphous I/II-HCl-200C might be explained by a lesser amount of the expulsed H4L4 ligand in the pores (indeed, the PXRD pattern of parent I/II-HCl-as corresponds slightly better to phase II than to I according to PXRD). The material prepared without a modulator, I/II-no-modul-200C, demonstrated the lowest surface area, indicating that the use of modulators has a beneficial effect in partial \"crystallization\" at elevated temperatures.\n\nThe mixed-ligand material, I/IId-mix-HCl-200C, had a surface area of 452 m2 g-1, which is right in-between the values for I/II-HCl-200C and I/IId-HCl-200C materials, based on pure H4L4 and H3L3, respectively (400-550 m2 g-1). Even if the increase of the H3L3 share expectedly decreased the surface area, the moderate influence confirms that H3L3 functions similarly to H4L4.
