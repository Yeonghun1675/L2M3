In order to better understand the pore structures, the atomistic Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations were performed to estimate the adsorption isotherms of N2 at 77.35 K for URMOF-1-4 using RASPA, which implements the latest state-of-the-art algorithms for molecular dynamics. As shown in  Figure S18, the GCMC N2 sorption of URMOF-1-4 clearly shows type-I isotherms, and the simulated BET surface areas for URMOF-1, URMOF-2, URMOF-3, and URMOF-4 are estimated as 3295, 3431, 6695, and 5061 m2/g, respectively (Figures S19-S22). The caculated pore volume and the simulated BET surface areas of these URMOFs are listed in . The URMOF-1 and -2 have  almost the same values of surface area and pore volume due to the nature of the isomorphism, while URMOF-3 and -4 show high theoretical surface areas which are up to 6695 and 5061 m2/g, respectively.  plots the simulated pore size distributions (PSDs) by GCMC simulations for URMOF-1-4 without coordinated solvents. The PSD of URMOF-1 shows four peaks at 7.0, 10.9, 12.4, and 17.6 \u00c5, which correspond to the four types of polyhedral cages in structure considering the curvature of the ligand. The maximum probe size of URMOF-1 is 17.6 \u00c5. However, the pore-limiting diameter is only about 7.0 \u00c5, which will hamper the diffusion of larger substrate during catalytic reaction. The PSD of URMOF-2 shows a similar characteristic as URMOF-1. The PSDs of URMOF-3 and -4 are similar to each other and feature a main peak in 17.3 and 19.6 \u00c5, respectively. Compared with URMOF-1 and -2, the pore-limiting diameters of URMOF-3 and -4 are much larger than the former and exceed 12.4 \u00c5. Analysis of the connectivity of the porous space shows that the pore systems in URMOF-3 and -4 are percolated in 3 dimensions ().
