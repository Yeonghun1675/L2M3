The N2 uptake capacity of FIR-5a-ht reaches 305.1 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 1 bar. The BET and Langmuir surface areas are estimated to be 950.8 cm2\u22c5g-1 and 1457.3 m2\u22c5g-1, respectively, which are much larger than those of FIR-4a-ht. Remarkably, the measured pore volume of 0.472 cm3\u22c5g-1 is higher than the estimated value (0.310 cm3\u22c5g-1) from the single crystal structure, which further proves the above statement.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']"}}, {"idx": 13, "type": "text", "classification": ["property"], "content": "<p>The H<sub>2</sub> sorption experiments\nat 77 K for <bold>FIR-4a-ht</bold> and <bold>FIR-5a-ht</bold> were\nalso measured.

It is also notable that additional tetramethylammonium bromide was\nused for the successful synthesis of <bold>FIR-4</bold>, because the\ntetramethylammonium cations may act as structure-directing agents\nfor the construction of this anionic framework. In comparison with\nthe previously reported FIR-1 which has a neutral framework, <bold>FIR-4</bold> presented here shows an anionic host framework with\ncharge-balancing tetramethylammonium cations. Single-crystal X-ray\ndiffraction reveals that <bold>FIR-4</bold> crystallizes in orthorhombic\nspace group <italic toggle=\"yes\">Pna</italic>2<sub>1</sub>. There are four independent Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions in the\nasymmetric unit. The local coordination geometry around each Zn<sup>2+</sup> center is depicted in Figure b.\nThe Zn1, Zn2, and Zn3 atoms are all coordinated by five carboxylate\noxygen atoms from distinct L ligands, respectively, while the Zn4\natom is only coordinated by four carboxylate oxygen atoms and shows\na distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry. Interestingly, four\nindependent Zn centers are bridged by the carboxylate groups from\nL ligands to form a metallic tetramer Zn<sub>4</sub>(COO)<sub>8</sub>. Each Zn<sub>4</sub>(COO)<sub>8</sub> tetramer is further linked\nby two carboxylate groups, giving rise to an infinite anionic chain\nalong the <italic toggle=\"yes\">a</italic> axis (Figure b). The intrachain Zn\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Zn distances are 3.69 \u00c5,\n3.72 \u00c5, 3.53 \u00c5, and 4.84 \u00c5 for Zn1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Zn2,\nZn2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Zn3, Zn3\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Zn4, and Zn4\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Zn1*,\nrespectively. In the structure of <bold>FIR-4</bold>, three adjacent\nparallel chains are joined by the L ligands. Finally, a non-interpenetrated\nthree-dimensional (3D) anionic architecture is created by repeating\nthese joints. This open framework exhibits a honeycomb lattice of\nhexagonal channels along the <italic toggle=\"yes\">a</italic> axis (Figure a), and the aperture for each hexagonal channel\nis approximately 16.5 \u00c5 (excluding van der Waals radii) (Figure c). Remarkably, no interpenetration was observed\nfor this framework. The solvent-accessible volume (including charge-balancing\ncations) of <bold>FIR-4</bold> is estimated by the PLATON program\nto be about 66.2% of the total crystal volume. The free spaces are\noccupied by the structurally disordered DMF solvent molecules and\ntetramethylammonium cations.</p><p>Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) and powder X-ray\ndiffraction pattern\n(PXRD) measurements were carried out to examine the thermal stability\nof this nanoporous framework. The TGA curve of <bold>FIR-4</bold> reveals\na weight loss of 48.69% before 250 \u00b0C, corresponding to the release\nof guest molecules, and no further weight loss is observed until 400\n\u00b0C (Figure S7, ).

For gas adsorption studies, <bold>FIR-4a</bold> was activated by liquid and supercritical CO<sub>2</sub>. The PXRD pattern of desolvated solid <bold>FIR-4a-ht</bold> shows\nthat some main peaks disappear and a few peaks also shift, compared\nto the PXRD pattern of the as-synthesized sample (Figure S8, ). This result indicates that the host framework of <bold>FIR-4</bold> is unstable and may collapse after the removal of the guests.</p><p>TGA curve of <bold>FIR-5</bold> reveals a weight\nloss of 25.4%\nbefore 350 \u00b0C, corresponding to the release of the coordinating\nDMA and H<sub>2</sub>O molecules as well as the guest molecules. No\nobvious weight loss is observed from 350 to 490 \u00b0C (Figure S9, ), indicating a comparatively high degree of thermal stability. The\nTGA of methanol-exchanged sample (<bold>FIR-5a</bold>), prepared by\nsoaking <bold>FIR-5</bold> in methanol, shows that all guest molecules\nand the coordinated solvent molecules can be completely exchanged\nby methanol. Furthermore, the methanol molecules can be easily moved\nfrom the pores by heating <bold>FIR-5a</bold> at 100 \u00b0C for 12\nh under a vacuum, and then a desolvated solid <bold>FIR-5a-ht</bold> is obtained.

The uptake\nof N<sub>2</sub> for <bold>FIR-4a-ht</bold> is only 52.9 cm<sup>3</sup>\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup> at 1 bar.

The measured pore volume from the\nN<sub>2</sub> sorption is 0.082 cm<sup>3</sup>\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup>. These pore parameters are greatly lower than those estimated from\nthe single crystal structure, which further demonstrates that the\nhost framework is unstable and easy to collapse after removal of guest\nmolecules. For <bold>FIR-5a-ht</bold>, the N<sub>2</sub> sorption\nisotherm shows a reversible type I sorption behavior. The adsorption\nbehavior between 0 and 0.01 bar is thus explained by the filling of\nthe microporous, whereas at 0.01 bar the phenyl rings rotate under\npressure, leading to an increase in the observed pore volume.

The Zn-MOF formulated as ((CH3)4N)(Zn4L3)\u22c528DMF (FIR-4; DMF = N,N-dimethylformamide, FIR denotes Fujian Institute of Research) is a nanoporous anionic framework, but it is unstable after the removal of guest molecules. In contrast, the Mg-MOF formulated as Mg3L2(H2O)2(DMA)2\u22c52.5DMA (FIR-5; DMA = N,N-dimethylacetamide) features a neutral framework with (3,8)-connected tfz topology derived from kgd subnets and has high permanent porosity with a Langmuir surface area of 1457 m2\u22c5g-1.\n\nIn this work, the solvothermal assembly between tris((4-carboxyl)phenylduryl)amine ligand with Zn2+ or Mg2+ ions leads to two non-interpenetrating MOFs, namely, ((CH3)4N)(Zn4L3)\u22c528DMF (FIR-4) and Mg3L2(H2O)2(DMA)2\u22c52.5DMA (FIR-5), which are constructed from infinite chain-shaped building units, respectively. FIR-4 is a nanoporous anionic framework, which is unstable after removing guest molecules. In contrast, FIR-5 features a neutral framework and has a high permanent porosity with a Langmuir surface area of 1457 m2\u22c5g-1.\n\n FIR-4 and FIR-5 were solvothermally synthesized by employing different mixed solvents. It is also notable that additional tetramethylammonium bromide was used for the successful synthesis of FIR-4, because the tetramethylammonium cations may act as structure-directing agents for the construction of this anionic framework. In comparison with the previously reported FIR-1 which has a neutral framework, FIR-4 presented here shows an anionic host framework with charge-balancing tetramethylammonium cations. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that FIR-4 crystallizes in orthorhombic space group Pna21. There are four independent Zn2+ ions in the asymmetric unit. The local coordination geometry around each Zn2+ center is depicted in Figure b. The Zn1, Zn2, and Zn3 atoms are all coordinated by five carboxylate oxygen atoms from distinct L ligands, respectively, while the Zn4 atom is only coordinated by four carboxylate oxygen atoms and shows a distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry. Interestingly, four independent Zn centers are bridged by the carboxylate groups from L ligands to form a metallic tetramer Zn4(COO)8. Each Zn4(COO)8 tetramer is further linked by two carboxylate groups, giving rise to an infinite anionic chain along the a axis (Figure b). The intrachain Zn\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Zn distances are 3.69 \u00c5, 3.72 \u00c5, 3.53 \u00c5, and 4.84 \u00c5 for Zn1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Zn2, Zn2\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Zn3, Zn3\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Zn4, and Zn4\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Zn1*, respectively. In the structure of FIR-4, three adjacent parallel chains are joined by the L ligands. Finally, a non-interpenetrated three-dimensional (3D) anionic architecture is created by repeating these joints. This open framework exhibits a honeycomb lattice of hexagonal channels along the a axis (Figure a), and the aperture for each hexagonal channel is approximately 16.5 \u00c5 (excluding van der Waals radii) (Figure c). Remarkably, no interpenetration was observed for this framework. The solvent-accessible volume (including charge-balancing cations) of FIR-4 is estimated by the PLATON program to be about 66.2% of the total crystal volume. The free spaces are occupied by the structurally disordered DMF solvent molecules and tetramethylammonium cations.\n\nThermogravimetric analyses (TGA) and powder X-ray diffraction pattern (PXRD) measurements were carried out to examine the thermal stability of this nanoporous framework. The TGA curve of FIR-4 reveals a weight loss of 48.69% before 250 \u00b0C, corresponding to the release of guest molecules, and no further weight loss is observed until 400 \u00b0C (Figure S7, ). The TGA of CH2Cl2-exchanged sample (FIR-4a), prepared by soaking FIR-4 in CH2Cl2, shows that all DMF molecules can be completely exchanged by CH2Cl2. For gas adsorption studies, FIR-4a was activated by liquid and supercritical CO2. The PXRD pattern of desolvated solid FIR-4a-ht shows that some main peaks disappear and a few peaks also shift, compared to the PXRD pattern of the as-synthesized sample (Figure S8, ). This result indicates that the host framework of FIR-4 is unstable and may collapse after the removal of the guests.\n\nTGA curve of FIR-5 reveals a weight loss of 25.4% before 350 \u00b0C, corresponding to the release of the coordinating DMA and H2O molecules as well as the guest molecules. No obvious weight loss is observed from 350 to 490 \u00b0C (Figure S9, ), indicating a comparatively high degree of thermal stability. The TGA of methanol-exchanged sample (FIR-5a), prepared by soaking FIR-5 in methanol, shows that all guest molecules and the coordinated solvent molecules can be completely exchanged by methanol. Furthermore, the methanol molecules can be easily moved from the pores by heating FIR-5a at 100 \u00b0C for 12 h under a vacuum, and then a desolvated solid FIR-5a-ht is obtained. Compared to the PXRD pattern of FIR-5, the peak positions in the PXRD pattern of FIR-5a-ht have no obvious change, although some peaks are distinctly weakened and broadened (Figure S10, ). These results indicate that the host framework of FIR-5 can be retained after the removal of the coordinated molecules and guest molecules.\n\nTo investigate the permanent porosity of desolvated FIR-4 and FIR-5, the adsorption experiments of N2 were measured at 77 K (Figure a). The uptake of N2 for FIR-4a-ht is only 52.9 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 1 bar. The BET and Langmuir surface areas of FIR-4a-ht were calculated to be 122.6 m2\u22c5g-1 and 185.4 m2\u22c5g-1, respectively. The measured pore volume from the N2 sorption is 0.082 cm3\u22c5g-1. These pore parameters are greatly lower than those estimated from the single crystal structure, which further demonstrates that the host framework is unstable and easy to collapse after removal of guest molecules. For FIR-5a-ht, the N2 sorption isotherm shows a reversible type I sorption behavior. The adsorption behavior between 0 and 0.01 bar is thus explained by the filling of the microporous, whereas at 0.01 bar the phenyl rings rotate under pressure, leading to an increase in the observed pore volume. Subsequently, a gradual, rather than an abrupt, change in the N2 uptake from 0.01 to 0.15 bar is observed. The similar adsorption behavior has also been reported. The N2 uptake capacity of FIR-5a-ht reaches 305.1 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 1 bar. The BET and Langmuir surface areas are estimated to be 950.8 cm2\u22c5g-1 and 1457.3 m2\u22c5g-1, respectively, which are much larger than those of FIR-4a-ht. Remarkably, the measured pore volume of 0.472 cm3\u22c5g-1 is higher than the estimated value (0.310 cm3\u22c5g-1) from the single crystal structure, which further proves the above statement.\n\nThe H2 sorption experiments at 77 K for FIR-4a-ht and FIR-5a-ht were also measured. As shown in Figure b, the adsorption and desorption isotherm curves of FIR-4a-ht do not overlap with each other and show significant hysteresis. The H2 uptake capacity reaches 95.2 cm3\u22c5g-1 (0.85 wt %) at 77 K and 1 bar. In contrast, FIR-5a-ht has a fully reversible H2 uptake of 109.6 cm3\u22c5g-1 (0.98 wt %) at 77 K and 1 bar, a value surpassing that of the most favorable zeolite ZSM-5 (0.7 wt %) and closing to those of recently reported MOFs at the same condition. In addition, the CO2 uptake of FIR-4a-ht and FIR-5a-ht are 33 cm3\u22c5g-1 and 42 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 273 K and 1 bar, respectively (Figure c).\n\nIn summary, by employing a large tris((4-carboxyl)phenylduryl)amine ligand (L) to assembly with Zn2+ or Mg2+ ions, two microporous MOFs FIR-4 and FIR-5 were successfully synthesized and structurally characterized. Both of them are non-interpenetrating 3D frameworks constructed from metal-carboxylate chains linked by the nanosized L ligands.
