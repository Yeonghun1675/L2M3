X-ray diffraction measurements of gold AuEt2DTC needle-like single crystals were performed using diffractometers KUMA KM4 and Oxford Diffraction Xcalibur Eos equipped with a CCD detector and a monochromated Mo sealed tube source (K\u03b1 radiation, \u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5). For high pressure experiments a modified Merrill-Bassett diamond-anvil cell (DAC with the anvils mounted directly on the steel supports) was used. A single crystal of gold(I) complex and a small ruby chip were glued to the culet surface of a diamond anvil. A tungsten gasket 0.1 mm thick and with 0.3 mm diameter hole was mounted. The chamber was filled with methanol used as a hydrostatic medium and closed. The DAC was centered on the diffractometer by the semiautomatic gasket-shadow procedure. The CrysAlisPro program suite was used for the data collection, UB-matrix determination and initial data reduction. Then the reflections intensities were corrected for the DAC absorption and gasket shadowing and diamond-anvil reflections were eliminated. The high pressure X-ray experiments were performed at 0.05, 0.24, 0.58, 0.90, and 1.0 GPa. Because of long unit-cell parameter c exceeding 45 \u00c5 the sample-detector distance was increased to 110 mm, which optimized the experimental conditions between X-rays absorption in air, coverage of recorded data by more distant detector and the resolution of closely located reflections. Another difficulty associated with the large lattice constants was the considerable number of densely distributed sample reflections of which many overlapped with the reflections from the diamond anvils. Hundreds of so overlapped reflections have been scrupulously eliminated. The structures were solved and refined using SHELX programs.
