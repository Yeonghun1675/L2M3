While sterically hindered NHC ligands afforded exclusively monocarbene complexes, only bis-carbenes could be obtained selectively with the less sterically hindered NHCs. The chlorido ligand in monocarbene complex 1a dissociates in water, a behavior that has not been observed in dmso. The complexes were stable in water under neutral or alkaline conditions for days, even under moderate heating. Hydrolysis of NHC ligands was, however, promoted by the addition of a strong \u03c3-donor ligand such as cyanide. Protolysis of Pd-C bonds by addition of Bro\u0308nsted acids is observed in both solvents employed for the reactions (dmso and water). Nevertheless, the selectivity changes notably with solvent. Thus, the reactions in dmso are clean and involve exclusively the Pd-allyl bond under the conditions studied, thereby allowing the use of this route for preparative purposes. In contrast, protolysis of the Pd-allyl and Pd-carbene bonds is competitive in water. The latter is faster for the less sterically hindered NHC ligands and contrasts with the inertness shown by these bonds in an aprotic solvent such as dmso.
