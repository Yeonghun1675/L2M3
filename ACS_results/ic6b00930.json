To evaluate the proton conductivity, alternating-current (ac) impedance analysis was carried out on SCU-6, SCU-7, SCU-6P, and SCU-7P (where SCU-6P and SCU-7P denote treated samples of SCU-6 and SCU-7 after H2PO4 - exchange, respectively). Figure S11 shows typical Nyquist plots measured at 50 \u00b0C and 90% relative humidity. The result shows that SCU-6 and SCU-6P exhibit similar proton conductivities at 7.66 \u00d7 10-7 and 1.63 \u00d7 10-6 S cm-1, respectively. Impressively, SCU-7P improves its proton conductivity by nearly 80 times compared to the original sample, from 1.15 \u00d7 10-6 to 8.77 \u00d7 10-5 S cm-1.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 14, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>In conclusion, the\ncombination of crystallography, elemental analysis, ReO<sub>4</sub>\n<sup>\u2013</sup> removal experiment, and proton-conductivity measurements\non the anion-exchanged samples demonstrates that SCU-7 is truly the\nfirst reported uranyl-based cationic framework material with decent\nanion-exchange capabilities.
