The slightly higher value attained by 2d could potentially be a consequence of the exposed chloride anions associated with the additional CuCl2. Note that neither compound achieves an initial binding enthalpy as high as the 10.1 kJ/mol value attributable to the exposed metal sites in 1. The lack of unsaturated metal centers is further reflected in the volumetric storage capacity of 3d, which reaches 37 g/L at 80 bar and 77 K. This is lower than the record capacity of 60 g/L observed for 1 but is comparable to that observed in 1s and other metal-organic frameworks with no open metal sites.
