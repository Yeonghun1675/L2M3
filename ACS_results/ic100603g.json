Because of CH\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions in \u03b2-1, the layers adopt an ABCDEF stacking mode to generate a chiral 3D supramolecular architecture. To our best knowledge, \u03b1-1 and \u03b2-1 respresent the first isomeric MOFs that were generated from the different stacking arrangements of 2D honeycomb layers to provide achiral or chiral architectures driven by CH\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions. Further studies will focus on the synthesis of other supramolecular isomers with different stacking arrangements of the layers, as well as decoration of the layers to construct novel MOFs based on TMTA ligands.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 16, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>Experimental procedures, structural figures, and TGA as well as crystallographic data in CIF format.
