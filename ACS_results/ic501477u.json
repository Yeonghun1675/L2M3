The PXRD patterns of compounds 1\u2283ClO4 - and 1\u2283BF4 - match exactly with their respective simulated patterns, and this proves the phase purity of the bulk sample (Figures S20 and S21 in the ) after anion exchange. As observed, compound 1'\u2283NO3 - upon air drying transforms to a stable phase (1\u2283NO3 -), which thereby undergoes SCSC transformation after anion exchange to form structures 1\u2283ClO4 - and 1\u2283BF4 -. More interestingly, the PXRD pattern of 1\u2283ClO4 - is also quite similar to the experimental PXRD pattern of compound 1\u2283NO3 -, thereby indicating that compound 1\u2283NO3 - probably is isostructural with 1\u2283ClO4 - and 1\u2283BF4 - (Figure S19 in the ). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of compounds 1\u2283NO3 -, 1\u2283ClO4 -, and 1\u2283BF4 - demonstrates that the compounds were thermally stable up to ~225 \u00b0C with an initial loss because of lattice solvent molecules (Figures S23-S25 and S26-S28 in the ). Guest-inclusion behavior for compounds 1\u2283NO3 -, 1\u2283ClO4 -, and 1\u2283BF4 - was examined by solvent sorption measurements at 298 K. The ethanol sorption profile for compound 1\u2283NO3 - showed a typical hysteretic gate-opening nature (P/P 0 = 0.78) of dynamic frameworks and an uptake amount of about 152 mL g-1 (6.82 mmol g-1). For anion-exchanged compounds 1\u2283ClO4 - and 1\u2283BF4 -, the uptake amounts are 135 mL g1 (6.035 mmol g-1) and 173 mL g-1 (7.74 mmol g-1) (Figure S33 in the ) with similar sorption patterns. The difference is the sorption amount with similar sorption patterns is due to the differential interaction of guest with similar frameworks but containing anions of different shape, size, and electronic nature.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 11, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>UV absorptions were measured in\norder to check the absorption profile\nfor anion-exchanged compounds.
