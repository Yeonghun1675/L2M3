Thermal stability of the new hybrid compounds was evaluated by TG analysis (a and ). Having decomposition temperatures typically below 100 \u00b0C (e.g., 50-60 \u00b0C), the molecular (0D) clusters without tpp have the lowest stability (). Including tpp as the terminal ligand generally enhances structure stability, as a result of the stronger Cu-P bond. Decomposition of structures usually begins with loss of the organic ligand. The remaining residue is identified as copper iodide. As expected, the extended 1D and 2D compounds are significantly more thermally stable than the 0D molecular species due to their extended network structures. Most of them are stable above 150 \u00b0C, with some approaching 200 \u00b0C (). The overall trend is 0D < 1D < 2D (a). These compounds are also air-stable. Our tests show that samples left in air for several months retain their structures and emission intensity. Their water stability was examined by immersing samples in water for an extended period of time. For example, 200 mg each of 1D-Cu2I2(tpp)2(4,4'-dps) (7) and 2D-Cu2I2(4,4'-dps)2 (15) was immersed in water for 24 h and recollected.

Compound 4 (0.11 g, 0.1 mmol) was mixed with excess pz (0.04 g, 0.5 mmol) in 10 mL toluene and kept at 80 \u00b0C for 1 day. (Yield is 67% based on Cu.)\n\nSynthesis of 1D-Cu2I2(5-me-pm)2 (5-me-pm = 5-Methyl-pyrimidine) (11)\n\nSingle crystals were prepared by slow diffusion of 5-me-pm (0.05 g, 0.5 mmol) with 1 (0.15 g, 0.2 mmol) in 10 mL acetone solution. Rod-shaped crystals formed in 2 days. Pure powder sample was obtained by directly mixing 5-me-pm (0.09 g, 1.0 mmol) with 1 (0.76 g, 1.0 mmol)/acetone under magnetic stirring. The reaction was kept overnight and was collected by filtration. (Yield is 64% based on Cu.)\n\nSynthesis of 1D-Cu2I2(5-Br-pm)2 (12)\n\nSlow diffusion of an 5-Br-pm (0.08 g, 0.5 mmol) and 1 (0.15 g, 0.2 mmol) in 10 mL acetone solution at room temperature led to the formation of pure-phased sample containing rod-shaped crystals in 3 days. (Yield is 58% based on Cu.)\n\nSynthesis of 2D-Cu2I2(bpe)2 (bpe = 1,2-bis(4-Pyridyl)ethane) (13)\n\nDifferent from the reported method, the precursor approach was applied. 1 (0.15 g, 0.2 mmol) was fully dissolved in 10 mL acetone and slowly added to bpe (0.38 g, 2.0 mmol) in 2 mL acetone solution at room temperature under stirring in a closely capped reaction vial. Excess amount of ligand was used to ensure complete ligand exchange. Precipitate formed quickly and was collected by filtration after 30 min of continuous stirring. (Yield is 60% based on Cu.)\n\nSynthesis of 2D-Cu2I2(3,3'-bpy)2 (3,3'-bpy = 3,3'-Bipyridine) (14)\n\nSingle crystals of 14 were grown by slow diffusion of 3,3'-bpy (0.16 g, 1.0 mmol) in 2 mL CH2Cl2 into 1 (0.15 g, 0.2 mmol) in 10 mL acetone solution. Green plate-like crystals suitable for SCXRD analysis formed in 3 days. Pure powder sample was obtained by directly mixing 3,3'-bpy (0.16 g, 1.0 mmol) with 1 (0.76 g, 1.0 mmol)/acetone solution. (Yield is 65% based on Cu.)\n\nSynthesis of 2D-Cu2I2(4,4'-dps)2 (4,4'-dps = 4,4'-Dipyridyl sulfide) (15)\n\nIn contrast to the previous method, single crystals of 16 were prepared by mixing 1 (0.38 g, 0.5 mmol)/acetone with excess 4,4'-dps (0.19 g, 1.0 mmol)/acetone and leaving the reaction mixture undisturbed. Rod-shaped crystals formed in 2 days. Pure powder sample was prepared by mixing 4,4'-dps (0.38 g, 2.0 mmol)with 1 (0.38 g, 0.5 mmol) in 20 mL acetone under magnetic stirring. (Yield is 68% based on Cu.)\n\nSynthesis of 2D-Cu2I2(4,4'-bpy)2 (16)\n\nPrecursor method was used for synthesis this compound, which is different from reported method. Pure powder sample was prepared by slowly mixing 1 (0.15 g, 0.2 mmol) in 10 mL acetone with 4,4'-bpy (0.08 g, 0.5 mmol) in 10 mL acetone under magnetic stirring at room temperature for 30 min.
