The two hosts have similar structures in the solid state (Figure ). Both are centrosymmetric, with the two urea carbonyls pointed in opposite directions. Neither host displayed the proposed exo- or endo-bipyridine conformations. Instead, much like Spartan predictions, the 2,2'-bipyridine units adopted twisted anti conformations with N3-C5-C8-N4 dihedral angles for 1 of 24.6\u00b0 and N4-C7-C10-N5 for 2 of 32.1\u00b0. Two diagonal nitrogen atoms face inward toward the macrocycle ring (with dihedral angles of 67.2\u00b0 for 1 and 60.2\u00b0 for 2) with the other two diagonal nitrogen atoms pointing outward the macrocycle (with dihedral angles of 38.6\u00b0 for 1 and 40.1\u00b0 for 2). The void spaces of these cavities calculated from the crystal structures are smaller than the theoretical predictions from Spartan calculations in the gas phase. The cavity size for coordination was determined by the distance between the van der Waals surfaces of two opposite pyridyl nitrogen atoms (N4 to N4a). The value is approximately 2.0 \u00c5 for 1 and 3.0 \u00c5 for 2. In solution, we expect that the bipyridine rings freely rotate and access the exo and endo conformations that are preorganized for metal complexation.
