The Co/Zn bimetallic MOFs were formed by the reaction of mixed-metal salts, Co(NO3)2\u22c56H2O, and Zn(NO3)2\u22c56H2O with H3BTC and pyrazine in DMF at 100 \u00b0C. Variation of the concentration of the reactants resulted in tetragonal (MST-1) and hexagonal (MST-2) phases (see the  for details) as crystalline pink products. The two phases were formed with excellent bulk purity, as seen through a comparison of the simulated and experimental PXRD patterns of the bulk samples (Figures S1 and S2). SCXRD studies showed that both structures are based on a trinuclear M3O cluster with a MO6 octahedron (M = Co/Zn) and two ZnO4 tetrahedra corner-sharing a \u03bc3-O species (). The framework of MST-1 was found to be isostructural to previously reported Zn3O clusters containing MOFs with BTC3- such as MOF-38, NTU-Z11, and MOF-CJ3; however, there exist subtle differences in the compositions and coordination environments of the metals (vide infra). The corresponding analogous monometallic tetragonal MST-1(Zn) was also obtained similarly under the same reaction conditions, as is evident from the PXRD pattern (Figure S3).

The respective Co contents in MST-1(Co-Zn) and MST-2(Co-Zn) were quantified by atomic absorption spectroscopy and corroborated by magnetic susceptibility measurements (Figure S5).

The pink color in Co-doped MST-1(Co-Zn) and MST-2(Co-Zn) is exhibited as a result of the Co2+ ion occupying the octahedral site (analogous to Co-Zn/MOF-4) in both the hexagonal and tetragonal phases.

Thus, the M3O cluster is made up of a corner-sharing of two ZnO4 tetrahedra and one Co/ZnO6 octahedron through a common O atom, \u03bc3-O(7). In contrast to MST-1, the two crystallographically identical Zn sites of the Zn3O cluster in MOF-38, MOF-CJ3, and NTU-Z11, contain trigonal-bipyramidal coordination because of an additional H2O bound to the ZnO4(carboxylate) tetrahedra. In NTU-Z11, the sixth coordination of the octahedral moiety of the Zn3O cluster is replaced by coordinated H2O because the synthesis did not employ any DMF. Important differences also exist in the charge-balancing cations; for example, the charge of the anionic framework of MOF-38  is balanced by triethylammonium cations. For MOF-CJ3, one hydronium balances the charge because the \u03bc3-O atom was protonated, and for NTU-Z11, two coordinated H2O molecules were protonated to balance the charge, which was rather unusual. In our case, MST-1 phases contain one dimethylammonium ion and one hydronium ion (the decomposition product of DMF and protonated H2O, respectively) as charge-balancing cations, while MST-2 also contains dimethylammonium and hydronium as countercations but in a different ratio.

The influence of steric congestion on the overall yield strongly indicates a situation where the reaction is taking place on the metal center inside the pores via the activation of epoxide. This further excludes the role of any Bro\u0308nsted acid, which otherwise would not have any effect over the catalytic output and exemplifies the involvement of a metal Lewis acid center. The loss of catalytic reactivity upon reaction in an organic solvent further supports the competition of solvent molecules with epoxides for the active site, resulting in activity loss (Table S1, entries 6-8).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 20, "type": "table", "classification": null, "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl2\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Co\u2013Zn MOFs\nCatalyzed Ring-Opening Reaction of Propylene Oxide with <italic>N</italic>-Methylaniline<xref rid=\"t2fn1\"></xref>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic content-type=\"header\" id=\"fx1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2016-01288q_0002.tif\"></graphic>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"3\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">entry</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">catalyst</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">yield (%)<xref rid=\"t2fn2\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>1</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<bold>MST-1(Co\u2013Zn)</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>84</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>2</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<bold>MST-2(Co\u2013Zn)</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>89</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>3</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<bold>MST-1(Zn)</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>87</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>4</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<bold>MST-2(Zn)</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>90</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>5</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>none</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>&lt;5</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n<table-wrap-foot>\n<fn id=\"t2fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>Optimized reaction conditions: catalyst (50 mg), <italic>N</italic>-methylaniline (1 mmol), propylene oxide (3 mmol), molecular sieves\n(5 \u00c5, 30 mg), neat; stirred for 14 h at 40 \u00b0C.</p>\n</fn>\n<fn id=\"t2fn2\">\n<label>b</label>\n<p>Yield determined by <sup>1</sup>H NMR.</p>\n</fn>\n</table-wrap-foot>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 21, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<title>Mechanistic Consideration</title><p>On the basis of the reactivity and product profiles, a simplified\nplausible mechanism () for the catalytic process is proposed.
