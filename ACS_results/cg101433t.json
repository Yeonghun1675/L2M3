Hence, the flexible bond can adjust the coordination conformations according to the requirement of the metal atoms. In compounds 1 and 2, there are similar C-S-S-C torsion angles in cpds ligand supporting the metallocyclic motif, which afford the space for the 1D metal-organic nanotube in 1 as well as the rotaxane-like motif in 2. In 3, the C-S-S-C torsion angle has a larger and less corrugated nature, so it is not easy to form the interpenetrating structure. The C-S-S-C torsion angle in 4 has a smaller and more corrugated nature, so it is a benefit for the motif of the helical chain. Based on the above-mentioned information, the flexible S-S spacer can allow cpds ligand to bend or rotate when coordinating to metal centers, to lead to many kinds of structures, such as discrete metallocyclic motifs, helical chains, or interpenetrating structures.
