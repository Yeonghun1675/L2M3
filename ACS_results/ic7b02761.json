Zn1 ions adopt a trigonal bipyramidal geometry, whereas Zn2 ions adopt a distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry. Zn1 and Zn2 are connected via the imidazolate N atoms, N7 and N9, respectively, of the Ade- ligand (a). The completion of the coordination sphere of Zn1 is provided by four carboxylate O atoms from four adjacent btc3- ligands with monodentate binding mode (a). Two terminal H2O molecules are coordinated to Zn2, and the fourth position is occupied by a monodentate carboxylate O atom from the btc3- ligand. These two specific coordination geometries of ZnII present in SION-35 are rarely observed in a single MOF. Each btc3- ligand is bound to five ZnII atoms: four Zn1 and one Zn2 (b). One carboxylate group of btc3- is coordinated solely to Zn1 in a monodentate mode, whereas each of the other two groups is coordinated through a syn-anti coordination mode to two ZnII\ue5f8to two Zn1 and to both Zn1 and Zn2 (b). Both btc3- and Ade- are packed in a zigzag fashion along the c-axis and as in a flat two-dimensional layer along the b- and a-axes (c,d). Through the coordination of the carboxylate O atoms of the btc3- ligand with Zn (Zn1-O4: 2.373(3) \u00c5 and Zn1-O1: 2.113(3) \u00c5) complemented by the system of hydrogen bonds, the Zn-Ade-btc layers are linked to each other propagating the structure into 3 dimensions.

In all other cases, the N sites of adenine were classified as protonated or nonprotonated, and marked, respectively, as red and blue bars in . For the N1 atom, the span of the C6-N1-C2 angle was found to equal 119 \u00b1 3\u00b0 for the deprotonated sites, and the only structure with this site protonated, [Cd(1HAde)(SO4)], was reported with the bond angle of 124.095\u00b0 (a). Considering the bond angle values for SION-31, SION-32, SION-33, SION-34, and SION-35, we observe that the C6-N1-C2 angle has similar values for SION-31, SION-32, SION-33, and SION-35, while such an angle in SION-34 is noticeably larger. Since the former group of angles fall in the range characteristic for deprotonated N1 sites, and the latter one is closer to the literature account on the N1 protonated adenine MOF, the data suggest that, in SION-31, SION-32, SION-33, and SION-35, the adenine ligand is N1 deprotonated, while, in SION-34, the adenine ligand is protonated through N1 (). No published structures were found to be protonated at the N3, and all C2-N3-C4 angles fall in the range of 112 \u00b1 2\u00b0 (b). Respective angles for SION-31, SION-33, SION-34, and SION-35 also fall in this range, which confirms the deprotonation of adenine on N3 (). The respective angle for SION-32, however, is visibly larger (). No literature reference is available, so we resorted to ab initio calculations to confirm the location of protonation. For SION-32 and SION-34, i.e., the two MOFs where the protonation may take place on N1 or N3, we simulated and DFT optimized the respective N1 and N3 protonated structures, thus exploring all possibilities of protonation. The angles found in these DFT relaxed structures are listed in . Comparison between these data and the angles found experimentally () confirms the N3 deprotonation of adenine in SION-34 (DFT: C2-N3-C4 of 114.46\u00b0 in the N3 deprotonated and 117.52\u00b0 in the N3 protonated structure; SCXRD: C2-N3-C4 of 113.7(3)\u00b0), and strongly suggests the protonation of SION-32 on N3 (DFT: C2-N3-C4 of 113.97\u00b0 in the N3 deprotonated and 117.03\u00b0 in the N3 protonated structure; SCXRD: C2-N3-C4 of 117.7(13)\u00b0). In addition, the calculations report an energy difference of 15.4 kcal per mol of HAde residuals in favor of N3 protonation for SION-32. Meanwhile, in SION-34, the N1 protonation is favored by 13.3 kcal/mol, and its DFT-optimized angle distributions for N1 protonated (124.45\u00b0) and N3 deprotonated (114.46\u00b0) are closer to those reported for the structure in .

In the first case, an unexpectedly high value of this angle found at the nonprotonated N7 site, 107.964\u00b0, originated from [Co7(H2O)4(Ade)2(\u03bc3-OH)6(sip)2], an example of a structure with the adenine ligand disordered over two sites. In the second case, the structures with extremely high (114.52\u00b0, [Co3(\u03bc6-TCPB)(\u03bc4-H2TCPB)(7Hade)2]\u22c5H2O) and low (101.109\u00b0, [Cd(7Hade)2Cl2]) C5-N7-C8 angle values turned out to have been reported with relatively high refinement indicators (R 1 = 12.7% and 15.1%, respectively). The C5-N7-C8 angle in SION-33 is very close to the second maximum (), and DFT relaxation of the N7 protonated structure yields C5-N7-C8 and C6-N1-C2 angle values that agree well with the observed angles in the crystal structure (). The relative energy is 12.9 kcal/mol in favor of N7 vs N1 protonation. From this, we reason that the adenine ligand in SION-33 is protonated on N7.
