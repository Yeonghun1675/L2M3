The cell extracts were analyzed by means of Reversed-Phase Liquid Chromatography (RPLC) combined with an electrospray ionization linear ion trap (ESI-LIT) mass spectrometry. As shown in Figure A, the accumulation of 9-ligand was 30-fold higher than that observed for the ligand of the inactive (and less lipophilic) compound 7. This evidence strongly suggests that passive diffusion accounts for membrane crossing for this class of complexes. To verify this hypothesis, a dose-dependent uptake experiment was performed in live cells. Figure B shows the linear relationship between the intracellular concentration of 9-ligand and the extracellular concentration of 9. These results indicate that, in the range of concentrations tested, ligand transport is not saturated and follows the Fick law for passive diffusion.
