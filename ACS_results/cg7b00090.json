The adsorption isotherms of CH<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> and C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub> are also measured at 273 and 298\nK under 1 bar, respectively. The maximum adsorption of <bold>JLU-Liu34</bold> for CH<sub>4</sub> is 16.0 and 9.1 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> is 118.8 and 59.4 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup>, and C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub> is 303.2 and 240.0\ncm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup>, respectively ().

The as-synthesized samples of JLU-Liu34, JLU-Liu35, and JLU-Liu36 were respectively solvent exchanged with CH3CN, EtOH, and CH2Cl2 several times, and all of them were activated for 10 h under 150 \u00b0C before gas adsorption measurement (Figures S5-S7). In order to evaluate the permanent porosity of these isostructural MOFs, N2 adsorption experiments were detected at 77 K. As shown in , JLU-Liu34 and JLU-Liu36 exhibit similar Type I nitrogen gas adsorption isotherms, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area were calculated to be ca. 2496 and 2619 m2 g-1, respectively. The pore size distributions of JLU-Liu34 and JLU-Liu36 calculated by using a nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) method show a microporous feature with a pore size of about 1.2 nm, which is homologous to the crystalline data (b). As shown in Figure S12, JLU-Liu35 exhibits less BET surface area which was calculated to be ca. 1103 m2 g-1. This is because the guest molecules cannot be removed absolutely by solvent exchange or evacuation, which could be confirmed by PXRD and TGA (Figures S10 and S11). Recently, similar structural material UBMOF-9 with high hydrogen storage capacity has been reported, but a systematic study of the other small molecular gas storage performance has not been carried out. Therefore, the CO2 and small hydrocarbon gas adsorption isotherms of JLU-Liu34 and JLU-Liu36 were measured to investigate the roles of amino group in gas sorption and separation properties. At 273 K and atmospheric pressure, the amount of CO2 uptake of JLU-Liu34 and JLU-Liu36 was close and reaches 58.9 and 54.7 cm3 g-1 (ca. 2.63 and 2.46 mmol g-1), respectively. To compare the affinity of JLU-Liu34 and functionalized JLU-Liu36 to CO2, the isosteric heat (Q st) was also calculated (). At zero-coverage, the Q st value of CO2 for JLU-Liu34 and JLU-Liu36 is ca. 22.2 and 26.8 kJ mol-1, respectively. The increased Q st of -NH2 modified JLU-Liu36 could be due to favorable interactions between adsorbed CO2 molecules and the Lewis basic sites in amine groups decorated in the pores. The adsorption isotherms of CH4, C2H6 and C3H8 are also measured at 273 and 298 K under 1 bar, respectively. The maximum adsorption of JLU-Liu34 for CH4 is 16.0 and 9.1 cm3 g-1, C2H6 is 118.8 and 59.4 cm3 g-1, and C3H8 is 303.2 and 240.0 cm3 g-1, respectively (). It is worth mentioning that the maximum adsorption of JLU-Liu34 for C3H8 is higher than many reported MOF materials. At zero loading, Q st of CH4, C2H6, and C3H8 adsorption of JLU-Liu34 is 23.0, 22.2, and 30.2 kJ mol-1, respectively (). For comparison, the maximum adsorption of JLU-Liu36 for CH4 is 14.7 and 8.6 cm3 g-1, C2H6 is 109.5 and 55.6 cm3 g-1, and C3H8 is 291.1 and 223.2 cm3 g-1, respectively. The Q st of CH4, C2H6, and C3H8 adsorption of JLU-Liu36 was calculated to be 15.3, 22.0, and 29.6 kJ mol-1, respectively. These results demonstrate that JLU-Liu36 can inherit most small hydrocarbon gas adsorption capacities of JLU-Liu34, due to their similar BET surface area and pore sizes.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']"}}, {"idx": 24, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig4\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) The N<sub>2</sub> adsorption and desorption isotherms of <bold>JLU-Liu34</bold> and <bold>JLU-Liu36</bold> at 77 K; (b) pore size\ndistribution of <bold>JLU-Liu34</bold> and <bold>JLU-Liu36</bold> calculated\nusing the DFT method.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr5\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cg-2017-00090q_0004.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 4  (a) The N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms of JLU-Liu34 and JLU-Liu36 at 77 K; (b) pore size distribution of JLU-Liu34 and JLU-Liu36 calculated using the DFT method.

This phenomenon also attests to the existence of functional groups and their strong intermolecular interaction with solvents. In spite of these variations, it is worth mentioning that all of these isostructural Zr-MOFs with or without functional groups exhibit better thermal stability than UiO-66 and other MOFs materials. \n\nGas Adsorption Behaviors\n\nInspired by the large void volume of the frameworks, gas adsorption properties of these isostructural materials were studied. The as-synthesized samples of JLU-Liu34, JLU-Liu35, and JLU-Liu36 were respectively solvent exchanged with CH3CN, EtOH, and CH2Cl2 several times, and all of them were activated for 10 h under 150 \u00b0C before gas adsorption measurement (Figures S5-S7). In order to evaluate the permanent porosity of these isostructural MOFs, N2 adsorption experiments were detected at 77 K. As shown in , JLU-Liu34 and JLU-Liu36 exhibit similar Type I nitrogen gas adsorption isotherms, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area were calculated to be ca. 2496 and 2619 m2 g-1, respectively. The pore size distributions of JLU-Liu34 and JLU-Liu36 calculated by using a nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) method show a microporous feature with a pore size of about 1.2 nm, which is homologous to the crystalline data (b). As shown in Figure S12, JLU-Liu35 exhibits less BET surface area which was calculated to be ca. 1103 m2 g-1. This is because the guest molecules cannot be removed absolutely by solvent exchange or evacuation, which could be confirmed by PXRD and TGA (Figures S10 and S11). Recently, similar structural material UBMOF-9 with high hydrogen storage capacity has been reported, but a systematic study of the other small molecular gas storage performance has not been carried out. Therefore, the CO2 and small hydrocarbon gas adsorption isotherms of JLU-Liu34 and JLU-Liu36 were measured to investigate the roles of amino group in gas sorption and separation properties. At 273 K and atmospheric pressure, the amount of CO2 uptake of JLU-Liu34 and JLU-Liu36 was close and reaches 58.9 and 54.7 cm3 g-1 (ca. 2.63 and 2.46 mmol g-1), respectively. To compare the affinity of JLU-Liu34 and functionalized JLU-Liu36 to CO2, the isosteric heat (Q st) was also calculated (). At zero-coverage, the Q st value of CO2 for JLU-Liu34 and JLU-Liu36 is ca. 22.2 and 26.8 kJ mol-1, respectively. The increased Q st of -NH2 modified JLU-Liu36 could be due to favorable interactions between adsorbed CO2 molecules and the Lewis basic sites in amine groups decorated in the pores. The adsorption isotherms of CH4, C2H6 and C3H8 are also measured at 273 and 298 K under 1 bar, respectively. The maximum adsorption of JLU-Liu34 for CH4 is 16.0 and 9.1 cm3 g-1, C2H6 is 118.8 and 59.4 cm3 g-1, and C3H8 is 303.2 and 240.0 cm3 g-1, respectively (). It is worth mentioning that the maximum adsorption of JLU-Liu34 for C3H8 is higher than many reported MOF materials. At zero loading, Q st of CH4, C2H6, and C3H8 adsorption of JLU-Liu34 is 23.0, 22.2, and 30.2 kJ mol-1, respectively (). For comparison, the maximum adsorption of JLU-Liu36 for CH4 is 14.7 and 8.6 cm3 g-1, C2H6 is 109.5 and 55.6 cm3 g-1, and C3H8 is 291.1 and 223.2 cm3 g-1, respectively. The Q st of CH4, C2H6, and C3H8 adsorption of JLU-Liu36 was calculated to be 15.3, 22.0, and 29.6 kJ mol-1, respectively. These results demonstrate that JLU-Liu36 can inherit most small hydrocarbon gas adsorption capacities of JLU-Liu34, due to their similar BET surface area and pore sizes.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name":
