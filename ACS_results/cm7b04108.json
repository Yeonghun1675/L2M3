By controlling the water content in the synthesis of CALF-33, intermediate amounts of ester hydrolysis at the susceptible site are possible giving CALF-33-Et  3-x   H   x   (0 < x < 1). Initially, CALF-33-Et  2.53  H  0.47  was synthesized and structural retention confirmed (Figures S25 and S26). N2 sorption at 77 K (Figure S40) indicates that CALF-33-Et  2.53  H  0.47  has a Langmuir surface area of 1076 m2 g-1 (BET = 895 m2 g-1), larger than the surface areas observed for either the full ester or monohydrolyzed materials. This increased surface area could be a result of two factors: (1) additional pore texturing, whereby the presence of some ethyl esters causes additional surfaces for adsorption as they protrude into the pore, and (2) the lower molecular weight caused by losing some ethyl ester, when compared to CALF-33-Et  3 . While a 50% hydrolyzed material may have been expected to give CO2 uptake halfway between CALF-33-Et  3  and CALF-33-Et  2  H, surprisingly, the CO2 sorption for CALF-33-Et  2.53  H  0.47  was only slightly higher than the unhydrolyzed analogue.

Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD; Figure S13) confirms that the unhydrolyzed and monohydrolyzed frameworks form isostructural materials by comparing with the simulated pattern from crystallography. As the two bookend structures have been previously communicated, their sorption behavior will only be summarized here prior to presenting more detailed analysis of the system. From N2 sorption at 77 K (Figure S14), CALF-33-Et  3  has a Langmuir surface area of 1017 m2 g-1 [BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) = 842 m2 g-1], which compares well to the simulated surface area range 916-1021 m2 g-1 (1.8 \u00c5 probe radius); the range arises as uptake depends on the orientation of the esters. Despite the high surface area, CALF-33-Et  3  has a low CO2 uptake of 0.92 mmol g-1 at 278 K and 1200 mbar (Figure S17). From N2 sorption at 77 K (Figure S18), CALF-33-Et  2  H has a Langmuir surface area of 950 m2 g-1 (BET = 810 m2 g-1), corresponding well to the simulated surface area of 969 m2 g-1 (1.8 \u00c5 probe radius). Hydrolysis of a single ester results in nearly double the CO2 uptake to 1.83 mmol g-1 at 278 K and 1200 mbar (Figure S21). This outcome is congruent with the removal of a hydrophobic group and a new surface with an acidic site as well as possibly more exposed metal sites. To probe water stability, a freshly activated sample of CALF-33-Et  3  was exposed to water, yielding a dramatic structural change by PXRD (Figure S22). Even exposure to ambient air caused a structural change and decrease in Langmuir surface area of 287 m2 g-1 (Figures S22 and S23), giving CALF-33-Et  3 , a hydrolytic stability classification of 1C.
