The EuIII ions display different coordination geometries with coordination numbers of 8, 9, and 10. The Eu1 ion is located in an inversion center and 10-coordinated to 10 carboxylate O atoms from 6 TBAPy4- ligands (Figure S1). The Eu2 ion is nine-coordinated to eight carboxylate O atoms from six TBAPy4- ligands and one water molecule. Eu3 and Eu4 both have a coordination number of 8 but exhibit different coordination environments. The Eu3 ion is coordinated to seven carboxylate O atoms from six TBAPy4- ligands and one \u03bc3-O atom (Figure S1), while the Eu4 ion is eight-coordinated by four carboxylate O atoms from four TBAPy4- ligands, two \u03bc3-O atoms, and two water O atoms. The Eu-O bond distances vary from 2.322(4) to 2.894(5) \u00c5 (Table S1). As shown in a, the Eu1, Eu2, and Eu2C atoms are bridged by the carboxylate groups to give a centrosymmetric linear trinuclear Eu3(COO)6 cluster with a Eu1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Eu2 separation of 4.04 \u00c5.

The Eu3\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Eu4, Eu3\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Eu4J, and Eu4\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Eu4J separations in the Eu4(\u03bc3-O)2 cluster are 4.29, 3.98, and 3.96 \u00c5, respectively. As depicted in c, the linear trinuclear Eu3(COO)6 and tetranuclear Eu4(\u03bc3-O)2(COO)8 clusters are bridged by carboxylate groups to generate a 1D europium carboxylate rod extending to the c axis. The trinuclear Eu3(COO)6 and tetranuclear Eu4(\u03bc3-O)2(COO)8 clusters are alternately arranged in the 1D rod (c). The 1D rodlike lanthanide carboxylates are commonly observed in the lanthanide compounds. However, such a lanthanide carboxylate rod constructed from two types of different clusters are rarely observed. The three crystallographically independent TBAPy4- ligands adopt three coordination modes bridging seven or eight metal ions (Figure S2). As depicted in e, each TBAPy4- ligand bridges four 1D europium carboxylate rods and links the 1D rods to give a 3D framework featuring 1D channels with an irregular aperture propagating along the c axis. The disordered DMF solvent molecules fill the channels and account for 31.2% of the volume of the unit cell. The phase purity of the bulk materials was confirmed by PXRD (Figure S3). The results of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of JXNU-5 show that the first weight loss occurred from 30 to 330 \u00b0C (Figure S4), which is the loss of all guest molecules and coordinated water molecules (weight loss: measured, 20.58%; theoretical, 20.51%). The TGA curve of the ethanol-exchanged JXNU-5 sample indicates that the guest molecules can be removed from the framework below 90 \u00b0C.

The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Langmuir surface areas are 406 and 591 m2 g-1 derived from the N2 adsorption isotherm. The total pore volume of 0.22 cm3 g-1 obtained from the N2 adsorption experiment is close to the calculated one (0.24 cm3 g-1) from the crystal data. By analysis of the N2 adsorption isotherm using the nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) model to give the narrow distribution of the micropores at 4.6 and 6.7 \u00c5 (Figure S5, inset).
