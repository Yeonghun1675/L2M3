The colorless needles were collected as a monophasic material. A suitable crystal was selected for an X-ray crystallographic study. The structure of 1 can be best described by a supramolecular open network, built up from the strongly hydrogen-bonded covalent chains. Figure  depicts a fragment of the chain with the atomic labeling scheme, which contains centrosymmetric dimer units of [Fe2(hedpH)2]2-. In this dimer unit, each Fe atom adopts a distorted octahedral coordination geometry with the six O atoms from three equivalent hedpH3- ligands. The Fe-O bond lengths fall in the range 2.066(2)-2.312(2) \u00c5, close to those in FeII(C2H5PO3)\u22c5H2O [2.05(1)-2.35(1) \u00c5]. The bond valence sum for Fe is 1.98. The hedpH3- ligand is bis-chelated and bridges the Fe atoms through the O(1), O(2), O(4), and O(5) atoms from phosphonate moieties and O(7) from the hydroxy group. The O(4) atom serves as a \u03bc3 bridging ligand which links the two iron octahedra through edge sharing, thus forming infinite double chains along the [100] direction (Figure ). The Fe1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Fe1A distance is 3.354 \u00c5. The P-O(Fe) lengths [1.504(2)-1.524(2) \u00c5] are comparable to those in Na2Cu15(hedp)6(OH)2(H2O) [1.501(9)-1.525(8) \u00c5]. Between the chains, there exists a very strong hydrogen-bonding interaction through O(3) and O(6). The O(3)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O(6i) distance is 2.427(2) \u00c5, and the O(3)-H(11)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O(6i) bond angle is 170.2\u00b0 (symmetry code for i: 2 - x, 0.5 + y, 0.5 - z). Very strong hydrogen bonds have been observed in CsMnHP3O10  [O\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O distance 2.372(12) \u00c5] and many hydrogen phosphates such as CaHPO4. Consequently, comparing with the protonated P-O(H) [1.561(2), 1.571(2) \u00c5] and the pendant P\ue5fbO [1.502(2), 1.514(2) \u00c5] distances in [NH3(CH2)4NH3]Ni(hedpH2)2(H2O)2, the bond length of P(1)-O(3)(H) [1.549(2) \u00c5] in 1 is significantly shorter whereas that of the P(2)\ue5fbO(6) [1.538(2) \u00c5] is much longer. A three-dimensional supramolecular framework is therefore constructed by the assembly of [Fe2(hedpH)2] n  2  n  - chains through strong hydrogen bonding, with one-dimensional channels created along the a axis (Figure ). The [NH3(CH2)4NH3]2+ cations and water molecules reside in the channels with extensive hydrogen-bonding interactions. The three shortest N\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O distances are 2.789(3), 2.788(2), and 2.824(2) \u00c5 for N(1)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O(1), N(1)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O(6ii), and N(1)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O(5ii) (symmetry code for ii: 1 - x, -y, -z), respectively. The bond lengths and angles for [NH3(CH2)4NH3]2+ are normal.
