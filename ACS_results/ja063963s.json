The presence of three steps indicates the existence of a canted spin phase (CS): P\u2192CS, CS(+)\u2192(AF)\u2192CS(-), and CS\u2192P, respectively. Upon increasing the temperature, the hysteresis and spin flip at H c disappear relative to one another at ca. 60 K, and the metamagnetic spin flip (AF\u2192P or CS\u2192P at H a) disappears at ca. 95 K (Figure b), consistent with the peak temperature in \u03c7T (Figure ). Thus, the metamagnetic-like nature with a large hysteresis in 2 likely originates from interlayer antiferromagnetic interactions coupled with a strong anisotropy arising from the [Ru2] n  + units; each layer allows for a long-range ferromagnetic order. Such a high-temperature long-range ordering is possible in cases involving double-exchange interaction, and the resonance scheme of charge transfer (probably, due to electron-hopping transfer), which possibly occurs with a charge delocalization spreading over a layer, is expected to play a critical role in 2. As a preliminary experiment, the conductivity of pellets of 1b and 2 was measured at room temperature, and a value 100 times larger was observed for 2 (4.6 \u00d7 10-4 S\u22c5cm-1) than was observed for 1b.
