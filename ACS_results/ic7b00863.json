The asymmetric unit is composed of one nickel center and two pybz ligands. The nickel(II) center is coordinated to two nitrogen atoms and four chelating carboxylate oxygen atoms from two different pybz ligands, which exhibits a twisty octahedral geometry (a). The pybz adopts a tridentate mode to link two nickel centers. The Ni-O and Ni-N distances are in the scope of 2.043(3)-2.199(2) \u00c5.

When pybz ligands are regarded as one linker, each nickel atom is connected to its four neighbors. This feature brings about a diamond network, where Ni\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Ni edges are ~12.9 \u00c5, and the maximum size is ~22.5 \u00c5.

The first step loss of ~13.5% is observed between room temperature and 220 \u00b0C, which is equivalent to the total weight of solvent DMF molecule (calcd 13.8%). The diffraction patterns of 1 from 30 to 220 \u00b0C are similar, showing that the overall framework is stable up to 220 \u00b0C after removal of uncoordinated DMF guest molecule. Thus, combined TG and XRD results indicate that 1 has excellent thermal stability at least up to 220 \u00b0C (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information).\n\nSorption Properties\n\nThe sorption properties of 1 were studied with CO2 and N2 to give Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and pore distribution. The gas-sorption isotherms of CO2 for 1 at 195 K show a type I behavior characterized by a saturated adsorptive capacity of 66 cm3/g at relatively low pressure (). The data with a pressure range of P/P o = 0.07 to 0.13 was used to fit BET model; the apparent surface area of 1 is 228 m2/g (Figure S4a in the Supporting Information), and a Langmuir surface area of 341 m2/g was obtained (Figure S4b in the Supporting Information). As shown in , the pore-size distribution of ~0.78 nm is obtained from nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT), consistent with the theoretically calculated pore size by single-crystal structure.
