Not only that, but 2 forms hydrogen bonds between -POH groups of opposite sides of the channel, leading to a more compact and robust structure (). With an increase of temperature (by applying a thermal treatment at 110 \u00b0C or higher) some hydrogen bonds are broken and a new SC-SC transformation is observed. This follows the same mechanism as for 2, in which some of the remaining water molecules are removed from the channels of the framework. With only one water molecule per asymmetric unit, 3 is maintained mainly by hydrogen bonds between -POH groups of opposite sides of the channels. As for the previous transformation, there is a visible decrease in solvent accessible volume (reduction to 0.2% per unit cell). However, the metal centers of opposite sides of the channels seem to be slightly farther apart (10.5525(10) and 8.9763(9) \u00c5 for 2 and 10.7455(9) and 9.0513(7) \u00c5 for 3) (). This is due to the spatial distribution of the organic linkers. While in 1 and 2 the ligands form lozenge-based tunnels when connected to the metal centers, in 3 they exhibit a more rectangular shape.

The latter may be explained by kinetic reasons dictated by the larger water content in this sample, which responds differently when exposed to the initial dry 20% RH environment (the measurements were carried out with increasing temperature, at each RH). Nevertheless, the range of activation energies is in line with those reported for other MOFs and suggests the structural diffusion of protons (along the water domains formed in the vicinity of the acidic phosphonate groups) as the dominating charge transport mechanism in these materials. Unfortunately, the amount of absorbed water should be rather low in this humidity range (\u226480% RH) and, as a result, the magnitude of the conductivity is rather low, only marginally exceeding 10-5 S cm-1 at 94 \u00b0C and 80% RH.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 68, "type": "table", "classification": null, "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl3\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Activation Energy in eV for the Protonic\nConductivity Measured under Variable Relative Humidity</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"5\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col5\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\"></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\" nameend=\"col5\" namest=\"col2\" rowsep=\"1\">activation\nenergy (eV)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\"></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">20<xref rid=\"tbl3-fn1\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">40<xref rid=\"tbl3-fn1\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">60<xref rid=\"tbl3-fn1\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">80<xref rid=\"tbl3-fn1\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>predried pellet</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.35</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.37</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.44</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.40</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>as-prepared pellet</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.26</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.40</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.48</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.46</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n<table-wrap-foot>\n<fn id=\"tbl3-fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>RH (%).</p>\n</fn>\n</table-wrap-foot>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 69, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig7\" position=\"float\">\n<label>7</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Arrhenius plots of the protonic conductivity\nof (H<sub>3</sub>O)\u00ad[Y<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>5</sub>btp)\u00ad(H<sub>4</sub>btp)]\u00b7H<sub>2</sub>O\n(<bold>3</bold>) samples (predried pellet, open symbols; as-prepared\npellet, solid symbols).

Compound 4 loses 2.6% (calculated ca. 2.7%) of its weight between ambient temperature and ca. 70 \u00b0C, corresponding to the release of 0.5 molecule of methanol. As expected, after the release of the methanol molecules, the thermal behavior of compound 4 is very much identical to that of 3 (Figure S11).\n\nConclusions\n\nA new family of materials exhibiting unique multifunctionality was prepared using a methodology based on microwave-assisted synthesis (MWAS). The three novel open-framework phase-pure MOFs [Y(H5btp)]\u22c55.5H2O (1), [Y(H5btp)]\u22c52.5H2O (2), and (H3O)[Y2(H5btp)(H4btp)]\u22c5H2O (3) were obtained in bulk quantities. 1 is isolated using a simple, fast, and high yield synthetic process, when compared to more conventional methodologies, while 2 and 3 are obtained by single-crystal to single-crystal (SC-SC) transformations: 2 is formed after filtration of 1, and 3 is prepared by heating 2 at 110 \u00b0C overnight. The structural relationships between the three networks and their breathing effect were thoroughly studied. It was verified that, after the removal of lattice water molecules at moderate temperatures, the crystalline three-dimensional framework is maintained. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction showed that the three structures are virtually the same, a binodal 6,6-connected network with a total Scha\u0308fli symbol of {413.62}{48.66.8}, with the sole difference being the number of crystallization water molecules. The present study further indicates that the yttrium coordination environment is composed exclusively of phosphonate oxygens, i.e., there are no water molecules coordinated to the metal centers. This structural feature clearly contributes to the observed mechanical robustness and thermal stability of the materials, particularly evident for material 3, which shows an outstanding thermal stability up to ca. 600 \u00b0C.
