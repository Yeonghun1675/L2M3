The three-dimensional periodic structure is generated by binuclear M(II) paddlewheel secondary building units (SBUs) connected via the tritopic 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate organic linker. The framework features two kinds of intersecting pores with diameters of about 10 and 15 \u00c5 (cyan and green spheres, respectively; see ). The theoretical porosity amounts to 69% of the volume as calculated with a probe radius of 1.2 \u00c5. However, as-synthesized, the samples contain a large amount of solvent molecules, hosted in the pores. Moreover, the M(II) ions expand their coordination attaching an additional ligand, opposed to the M-M bond; see b. The nature of the linkage between guest molecules and host framework as well as the role of guest molecules in modifying materials properties have not been deeply investigated despite the paramount importance and notoriety of this class of MOFs.

The strength of this coordination was estimated from the energy difference among the optimized geometries calculated with either periodic-DFT or gas-phase DFT of paddlewheel, water molecule, and paddlewheel with chemisorbed water molecules. Depending on the kind of calculation, the obtained range is 50-65 kJ/mol, which classifies this interaction as a weak chemisorption (just above the classical limit of 0.5 eV, or 48 kJ/mol), although, as discussed above, the nature of the interaction is strongly dictated by electrostatics and therefore not enormously different from that of physisorption through a hydrogen bond. Sites where negative charge is in excess are, instead, identified close to O atoms of the carboxylate groups, whereas the H terminations of the aromatic rings are mildly positive. The negative charge sites are suitable for accepting H-bonds from guest molecules. Because this interaction is weaker (and without any orbital contribution), the attachment to these sites is mainly a physisorption.
