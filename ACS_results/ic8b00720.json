To further validate that the weight loss observed at 120 \u00b0C is exclusively due to the water molecules, we performed TG-MS analysis and the m/z value of 18 g/mol unambiguously confirms that there are no other fragments of the framework released except water molecules (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). Nevertheless, the removal of the four guest water molecules alone (expected weight loss 9.25% only) does not account for the entire weight loss (18.39% (for 1) and 18.46% (for 2)) observed at 120 \u00b0C. As proven already through TG-MS analysis, no other fragments except water molecules are removed at this temperature, and therefore, the remaining weight loss (apart from the guest molecule weight loss) can be attributed to the loss of four more coordinated water molecules on the repeating dimeric unit of both Dy(III) and Gd(III) ions in 1 and 2, respectively.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']"}}, {"idx": 18, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Powder X-ray Diffraction\nStudies</title><p>To check the bulk phase purity of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> and to confirm whether crystallinity was retained even after\nthe removal of the coordinated water molecules on both Dy\u00ad(III) and\nGd\u00ad(III) ions, we have performed PXRD measurements at room temperature\n().

The temperature-independent nature of the magnetic susceptibility from 300 to 30 K for both 2 and 2' signifies that both Gd(III) ions behave like paramagnets. The increase in \u03c7M T value for 2 and decrease in \u03c7M T value for 2' are attributed to the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between the Gd(III) dimeric repeating units, respectively.

Tong and co-workers and Evangelisti and co-workers have been elegantly shown this phenomenon in unrelated reports. The largest MCE value reported for a dense [GdF3] n  PCP (71.6 J kg1- K-1 (\u0394H = 70 kOe)), where all the Gd(III) centers are linked through the lightest and smallest fluoride linker, which is responsible for the unprecedented magnetic density observed among the MCE materials reported so far. Since the size of the linker reached its limit already, the present work indeed shows an alternative strategy to improve the MCE efficiency of isotropic metal complexes containing a 3D network. Although 2' still possesses other passively contributing diamagnetic linkers (fumarate and oxalate), enhancing MCE efficiency through amorphization (removal of passively contributing terminal neutral ligands coordinated to the metal along with solvent molecules in the crystal lattice) appears to be a promising strategy and presents an alternate approach to address the problem of finding linkers smaller and lighter than fluoride.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 57, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<title>Conclusion</title><p>To conclude, employing\nfumarate (L<sub>1</sub>) and oxalate as pillared ligands, two three-dimensional\nPCPs based on lanthanide ions (Dy\u00ad(III) and Gd\u00ad(III)) were isolated\nas single crystals and their crystal structures were characterized\nby single-crystal X-ray diffraction.

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals the molecular formula of the complexes as [Ln2(L1)2(H2O)4(ox)] n \u22c54nH2O (where Ln = Dy (1), Gd (2)). Consistent with the same unit cell parameters obtained for both complexes, they are structurally analogous to each other. The loss of solvent water molecules in the crystal lattice and the coordinated water molecules on the respective lanthanide ions results in an amorphous phase of 1 and 2 upon activation of PCPs. The amorphous phase molecular formula [Ln2(L1)2(ox)] n  (where Ln = Dy (1'), Gd (2')) and the stability of the 3D network were satisfactorily substantiated by various experimental techniques (TGA, TG-MS, EXAFS, XANES, PXRD, and elemental analysis). Magnetization relaxation dynamics performed on 1 and 1' show two different frequency-dependent out-of-phase susceptibility signals (slow relaxation and fast relaxation processes) in the presence of an external magnetic field. The SINGLE_ANISO calculation performed on the individual Dy(III) fragment reveals a large tunneling probability associated with the ground Kramers state, which is responsible for the absence of zero field SIM behavior in 1. Further, POLY_ANISO calculations suggest that a weak antiferromagnetic coupling between the Dy(III) ions lead to a singlet ground state with various excited states close to the ground state of 1. This scenario triggers the under-barrier relaxation mechanism and rationalizes the absence of zero field SIM behavior in 1. Magnetocaloric effect (MCE) efficiency was measured on the isotropic analogues of 1 in its crystalline and amorphous phases (2 and 2'). The MCE efficiency of 2' (52.48 J kg-1 K-1 at 3.0 K for \u0394H = 70 kOe) is 26% larger than that for 2 (41.61 J kg-1 K-1 at 3.0 K for \u0394H = 70 kOe), discloses a new synthetic strategy.
