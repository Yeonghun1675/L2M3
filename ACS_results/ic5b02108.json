The microscope was used to locate a single crystal that appeared to be lying flat on the stage window, and spectra were recorded of the sample after activation (under He) and under 1 bar of CO2. Two orthogonal directions of polarized light were employed, both parallel to a crystal edge (c), and the spectra are shown in a. In the absence of CO2, the IR spectrum recorded with polarization along the ab plane of the crystal (P1 as shown in c) shows a single intense \u03bd(OH) stretch at 3660 cm-1, as observed in the unpolarized spectra. The spectrum recorded with polarization P2 (oriented 90\u00b0 to P1, along c-axis) is markedly different, with an almost complete absence of the \u03bd(OH) absorption. In the crystal structure, all the -OH groups in the framework are found pointing into the channels (in the ab plane), with no component along the c-axis (along the channels). Therefore, the polarized IR results are consistent with the polarization in P1 being aligned with the ab plane containing the -OH groups and P2 being aligned along the c-axis of the structure, orthogonal to the -OH groups and hence hardly interacting with the -OH dipole. Having identified the directionality of the crystal, the same orientations were investigated on loading the sample with 1 bar of CO2 (b). With polarization P1, the -OH vibration is still intense and, as with the unpolarized spectra, is shifted to lower energy (accompanied by a degree of peak broadening), indicative of a hydrogen bonding interaction with adsorbed CO2. The CO2 combination bands are again both present at 3696 and 3591 cm-1; the higher energy CO2 band is a combination of the \u03bd1 and \u03bd3 symmetric and antisymmetric vibrations, both of which are oriented along the O\ue5fbC\ue5fbO bond axis, leading to the potential assignment of the 3696 cm-1 band in the P1 polarized IR spectrum to the presence of a CO2 molecule hydrogen-bonded in an \"end-on\" fashion to and aligned along the same axis as the -OH groups. This combination band has a lower relative absorbance as a fraction of the \u03bd(OH) band when compared with the unpolarized spectra peaks [A 3696:A(OH)3660 = 0.14:1 with polarization P1 vs A 3696:A(OH)3660 = 0.28:1 with unpolarized IR light], suggesting that there must be additional adsorbed CO2 present in other positions in the pore, not aligned with this polarization. Indeed, on rotating the polarization to orientation P2, the CO2-loaded spectrum changes significantly (b). As in the activated sample, the \u03bd(OH) stretch at 3660 cm-1 is almost completely removed, although this time a very weak, but well-defined, band at 3657 cm-1 remains (with approximately 10% of the absorbance of the corresponding peak observed for P1). The presence of this residual band indicates a degree of bending of the -OH group out of the ab plane, as a direct result of the interactions with adsorbed CO2 adjacent to the -OH group. Most notably, the CO2 combination bands increase in absorbance by a factor of ~1.6 compared with the same bands observed at P1, commensurate with the presence of CO2 molecules in an orientation much better aligned with the P2 polarization than P1. This suggests the presence of a second (or more) binding site within the framework and that, at 1 bar, the CO2 molecules at the second site have higher occupancy than the end-on CO2 molecules hydrogen-bonded to the -OH groups.

Significant enhancement of CO2 adsorption capacity by up to 49% was observed by doping with Fe(III), reflecting the increased structural integrity of the Fe-doped material giving a more ordered material with more accessible pores. Thus, Fe-doping can be used to improve the materials properties of the host while also monitoring the effects of the heteroatom center within a parent framework without the requirement of synthesizing the isostructural MFM-300(Fe2). In situ single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies of CO2-loaded materials revealed, on a molecular level, key details into the preferred binding sites within the pores of these materials that were in excellent agreement with the results of the in situ polarized IR spectroscopic study of CO2-loaded MFM-300(Ga2). The adsorbed CO2 molecules in MFM-300(Ga2) hydrogen bond with the free -OH groups on the surface of the pores, and a previously unobserved pattern of intermolecular dipole interactions was found to stabilize the two CO2 molecules within the pores. The CO2 molecule at site I binds to the -OH group in an end-on fashion [H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O1s = 1.883(10) \u00c5] and also interacts with the CO2 molecule at site II. In contrast, the adsorbed CO2 molecules in MFM-300(Ga1.83Fe0.13) form only very weak hydrogen bonds with free -OH groups [H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O1s = 2.259(12) \u00c5], and a traditional \"T-shaped\" CO2 intermolecular dipole interaction was responsible for the stability of the CO2 molecular chain. The reduction on the strength of the hydrogen bond is also reflected in the isosteric heat of adsorption for CO2 uptake. In addition to the enhancement of the gas adsorption properties, Fe-doping has also shown a positive effect on specific catalytic reactions such as the ring-opening reactions of styrene oxide. We anticipate that the strategy developed here, based upon mixing transition and main group metal nodes in MOFs, can lead to the design and discovery of new materials with improved properties and functions.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 54, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information is available\nfree of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications\nwebsite</ext-link> at\nDOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5b02108\">10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5b02108</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Experimental details, additional figures,\ngraphs, and\ntables (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5b02108/suppl_file/ic5b02108_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Crytallographic data (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5b02108/suppl_file/ic5b02108_si_002.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5b02108.

A similar difference in BET surface area between Al- and Ga-containing\nisostructural materials has been also observed in [Al\u00ad(BTB)] and [Ga\u00ad(BTB)]\n(BTB<sup>3\u2013</sup> = benzenetribenzoate), where the surface areas are reported as 1045 and 62 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup>, respectively. The BET surface areas\nfor MFM-300\u00ad(Ga<sub>2</sub>) are reproducible over many batches of\nmaterial. This discrepancy could be due to a number of factors: not\nall the void space within a porous material is necessarily accessible\nby the gaseous substrate in the BET and gas adsorption experiments,\nwhile the bulk powder sample may not correspond precisely to the idealized\nstructure determined by single-crystal diffraction due to partial\ncollapse of the framework and/or blocking of pores by phase changes\nand different domains within the material. Notwithstanding the full\nstructural analysis of these materials, it remains possible that residual\nfree solvent molecules or reactant molecules remain in the pores,\nleading to blocking effects limiting gas entry and uptake. The phase\npurity of the as-synthesized bulk samples has been confirmed by high-resolution\nsynchrotron X-ray powder diffraction data, which do not show the presence\nof bulk impurities (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5b02108/suppl_file/ic5b02108_si_001.pdf\">Figure S4</ext-link>).

The CO2 isotherms at 273 K show type-I behavior with reversible uptake (). The pore size distributions (PSDs) for both MFM-300(Ga2) and MFM-300(Ga1.87Fe0.13) show one broad peak at approximately at 5.5 \u00c5, close to the approximate diameter of the channel window (6.7 \u00c5).

The values for BET surface area and pore size obtained from the N2 isotherms are in good agreement with those calculated from CO2 (). These surface areas are considerably lower than that of the isostructural MFM-300(Al2) (1370 m2 g-1), taking into account the increased formula weight by ~21% on going from Al to Ga.
