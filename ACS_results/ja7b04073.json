To obtain mechanistic insight into the emission properties of 1  ch  and 1  ac , we carried out time-dependent (TD) DFT calculations based on the single-crystal structures. The results of these calculations indicated that the aurophilic interactions should be responsible for the destabilization of the HOMO energy level of 1  ch  relative to that of 1  ac  ().
