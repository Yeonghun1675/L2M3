From the single-component isotherms the wt% of CO2 (0.15 atm) and N2 (0.85 atm) was found to be 4.64% and 0.22%, respectively. The potential for a material to perform separations from a mixed gas stream can be estimated using IAST. In terms of prediction, IAST gives the closest approximation of binary gas selective adsorption performance from single-component isotherms. IAST calculations performed on [Cu(bcppm)H2O]-ac yield a selectivity for CO2/N2 (15/85 wt% mixture) of 590 at 293 K and 1 atm. Table  shows that [Cu(bcppm)H2O] outperforms all but one state-of-the-art MOF and zeolite materials. This is remarkable, given that the material lacks both unsaturated metal centers and amine groups. However, we note that the total CO2 uptake capacity of [Cu(bcppm)H2O] is moderate compared to high surface area MOFs such as MOF-74. During the course of this work, SIFSIX-3-Zn, a material that also displays exceptional CO2/N2 selectivity, was reported. SIFSIX-3-Zn has more-regular square-shaped channels with dimensions of 3.84 \u00c5 and lined with Lewis basic groups on the SiF6 anions that notably enhance the uptake of CO2 into the material, giving a Q st of -45 kJ mol-1 at low loading.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 29, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig5\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>5</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) CO<sub>2</sub> and\nN<sub>2</sub> isotherms at 293 K.
