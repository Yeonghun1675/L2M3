Diamagnetic corrections were made with Pascal's constants for all constituent atoms. The magnetic properties of 1 were measured in the 2-300 K temperature range and shown as \u03c7M T and \u03c7 M  versus T plots (see Figure S4, ). The experimental \u03c7M T value at 300 K is 2.67 cm3 K mol-1, which is slightly larger than the spin-only value (1.875 cm3 K mol-1 with g = 2.0) expected for the uncoupled CoII ion. This is due to the occurrence of an unquenched orbital contribution typical of the 4T1g ground state in six-coordinated CoII complexes. As the temperature decreases, the \u03c7M T value decreases, indicating the presence of antiferromagnetic interactions. Upon cooling, the \u03c7M T values continuously decrease to 1.26 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K. In fact, as described above, the Co\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Co distances in complex 1 are 5.9, 6.7, 13.6 \u00c5, respectively.
