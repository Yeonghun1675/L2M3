Ar sorption in MOF-324 shows a reversible Type I isotherm at 87 K, which indicates that this compound possesses permanent porosity (Figure ). The apparent surface area and pore volume based on the Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) plot method for MOF-324 were estimated to be 1780 m2 g-1 and 0.59 cm3 g-1, respectively, from these data. In the case of MOF-326, a steep N2 uptake was observed in the low-pressure region accompanied by a small step at P/P 0 = 0.01. The small hysteresis ranging from P/P 0 = 0.1 to 0.3 may be attributed to the flexibility of the framework due to the long organic linker with protruding ethyl groups. The Langmuir surface area of MOF-326 calculated from the N2 uptake is 1680 cm2 g-1, and the estimated pore volume was found to be 0.55 cm3 g-1. MOF-325 did not show permanent porosity (<10 m2 g-1) in our experiments despite the fact that the crystal structure implies that there is enough void space for gas diffusion. It is presumed that the triangular cluster of MOF-325 may not be sufficiently rigid to support permanent porosity.\n\nThe profile of the N2 (77 K) isotherm for IRMOF-61 is unique for IRMOFs; there is a small step at P/P 0 = 0.015 followed by a large step (P/P 0 = 0.4) with an unusual hysteresis (Figure ). N2 uptake at the first step (150 cm3 g-1) corresponds to 7 N2 molecules in each formula unit (Zn4O(EDB)3). If the a- and b-sites on a Zn4O unit are occupied, N2 density around the interweaving section (i.e., a small pore along the c-axis) can be higher than other adsorption sites, and this could be the driving force of a guest-induced structural transition and/or framework shifting during uptake (e.g., a gating phenomenon). In contrast, N2 uptake below the second step (350 cm3 g-1) corresponds to 16 N2 molecules in each formula unit. Although there is no information about specific adsorption sites for N2, it is likely that the most of the strong binding sites in IRMOF-61 should be occupied by N2 molecules. Therefore, we attribute the second hysteresis to a phase transition of guest molecules in the pore, a known but uncommon phenomenon in MOFs.
