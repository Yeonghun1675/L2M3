The Sr center adopts a distorted square antiprism geometry, as determined by the donor atoms around the Sr(II) center, as illustrated in  in the Supporting Information. The Sr center is eight-coordinated through seven oxygens (O1, O2, O2', O3, O3', O4, and O6) from five Hbtc2- ligands and one oxygen (O7) from a water molecule. The bond length of Sr-O falls in the range from 2.5049(65) \u00c5 to 2.7191(67) \u00c5. The oxygen (O1, O2, O3, O4) atoms from the carboxylate groups (1, 2) of the ligand are coordinated to the Sr center in monodentate, chelating and bridged coordination modes, resulting in the formation of a two-dimensional (2D) layered structure (c). The 2D layers of compound 1 are extended into a 3D network through a third carboxylate group of an Hbtc2- ligand. The pillar ligand functions as a bridge between two layers (b). The H2O molecules are stabilized around the layers by (O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O) hydrogen bonding interactions {(O5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O7 = 2.6075(104) \u00c5); (O4\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O7 = 2.6828(91) \u00c5); (O1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O7 = 2.6574(113) \u00c5)} (see  in the Supporting Information).

Since then, only a few reports on semiconducting properties of MOFs have appeared, in which Zn and Mg are mainly used as the metal nodes. Considering the importance of strontium and its composites as effective semiconducting materials, we envisaged that research directed toward strontium-organic frameworks would provoke great interest, because different organic ligands could be used, thus resulting in diverse structures with enhanced properties. Herein, we report on our investigations on the bandgap and semiconducting properties of a new type of Sr-based metal-organic framework [Sr(Hbtc)(H2O)] n  (1). Importantly, its band gap of 2.3 eV is comparable to that of other commonly used semiconducting materials (e.g., CdSe, CdTe, ZnTe, GaP, etc.). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a Sr-based MOF as a potential semiconductor in optoelectronic devices. The direction of this work may provide an effective path toward remarkable new applications of semiconducting MOFs in the future.\n\nThermogravimetric Analysis and Powder X-ray Diffraction Studies\n\nA thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of 1 indicates that the coordinated water molecules were lost in the temperature range of 65-270 \u00b0C (see  in the Supporting Information). The observed weight loss of 5.5% is consistent with the calculated value (5.7%). After the loss of water molecules, the framework began to decompose with a continuous weight loss of 57.4% up to a temperature of 520 \u00b0C, which can be attributed to the loss of the coordinating ligand. The transition can also be observed during the heating of the compound, as shown in the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) plot (see  in the Supporting Information). The results of powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) experiments showed that all of the peaks that were displayed in the measured patterns at room temperature closely matched those in the simulated patterns (see  in the Supporting Information).\n\nFor allowed direct transitions, the optical band gap for compound 1 is determined by preparing a Tauc Plot ([F(R) \u00d7 \u210f\u03c5]2 vs \u210f\u03c5) (b). Extrapolation of this line to the photon energy axis yields a semiconductor band gap of 2.31 eV. \n\nPhotoluminescence Study\n\nA PL spectrum of 1 at a different power of excitation was obtained for direct bandgap observation. A very strong luminescence due to charge transfer is observed at room temperature under illumination from a 266 nm pulsed laser, as shown in . The spectrum is composed of two separated peaks centered at ~330 and 640 nm. The luminescence in the low-frequency region is further shown in the inset of . The strong luminescence at ~330 nm can be explained as a ligand-based emission, as shown in  in the Supporting Information. A relatively weak emission peak at 640 nm can be assigned to ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). The peak at ~640 nm indicates the existence of an optical band at ~1.94 eV, which is further confirmed with theoretical calculations.\n\nSimulation Data\n\nThe electronic properties, such as the density of states and band-gap energy, were calculated using DFT.
