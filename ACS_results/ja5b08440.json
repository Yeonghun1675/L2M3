Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) reveals a reduction in intensity of the stretches assigned to terminal -OH groups on the polyhafnium node (Supporting Information), indicating potential functionalization of the free -OH and -OH2 ligands of the Hf nodes. Single-crystal X-ray analysis (, close up of the node) of the FeCl3-activated material confirms the presence of Fe atoms coordinated to the Hf6 node in place of some of the terminal -OH and -OH2 ligands normally present on this eight-connected node. Crystallographically, the data indicate that there are eight locally degenerate positions (, circled in orange), which are each 25% occupied, giving a formal two Fe atoms per node. This new, postsynthetically-metalated structure that contains Fe in the porphyrin struts as well as two additional Fe atoms on the Hf6 nodes will be referred to as Fe@Hf-2.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']"}}, {"idx": 15, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig4\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Differential PDFs for Fe@Hf-<bold>2</bold> containing\npeaks at\ndistances matching the main Fe\u2013Hf interactions at the Hf<sub>6</sub>-node.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr4\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ja-2015-08440w_0009.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 4  Differential PDFs for Fe@Hf-2 containing peaks at distances matching the main Fe-Hf interactions at the Hf6-node.
