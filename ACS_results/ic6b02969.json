Nitrogen sorption measurements for Zr-CAU-28 were carried out at -196 \u00b0C and water sorption measurements were performed at 25 \u00b0C. The nitrogen sorption isotherm of Zr-CAU-28 shows a type I curve progression as defined by the IUPAC (). This isotherm type demonstrates the microporosity of the compound.

The expected specific surface area was calculated using Materials Studio, assuming a spherical diameter of 3.6 \u00c5 as approximation for the nitrogen molecule, and amounts to 1264 m2/g. Therefore, we assume that the smaller trigonal channels, which are theoretically accessible, are experimentally inaccessible to N2 molecules due to a subtle shrinkage of the framework or kinetic diffusion limitations at such low temperatures. The water sorption measurement at RT shows two steps in the isotherm but a strong hydrophilicity and thus a major uptake below a relative humidity of 20%.

The isotherm shows a water loading capacity of around 34 wt % at 92% relative humidity.\n\nCe-CAU-28\n\nSome of us recently developed procedures which allow the synthesis of Ce4+-based analogues of zirconium MOFs like Ce-UiO-66, which exhibits interesting catalytic properties. These reaction conditions are also suitable to obtain compounds based on diverse linker molecules like 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)benzene (Ce-CAU-24),  1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (Ce-MOF-808), 2,2'bipyridine-5,5'-dicarboxylic acid (Ce-UiO-67-Bipy), or pyrazoledicarboxylic acid (Ce-DUT-67-PZDC) and further analogues exhibiting UiO-66 structure. Following this approach we also successfully obtained Ce-CAU-28, the Ce4+-based analogue of Zr-CAU-28, after short reaction times in mixtures of water and DMF. The compound is isostructural to the zirconium based counterpart and its structure could be confirmed by Rietveld refinement (see Figure S6). While Zr-CAU-28 can be obtained under green, aqueous conditions, Ce-CAU-28 is only formed using DMF as solvent and thus also contains organic solvent molecules inside the pores, as observed by elemental analysis, NMR, and IR spectroscopy (Tables S2, S3 and Figure S7, S8). Moreover, the thermal properties are substantially different.

Ce-CAU-28 could not be fully activated and thus exhibits a maximum specific surface area of only S BET = 360 m2/g and a micropore volume of 0.15 cm3/g () after activation at 70 \u00b0C under vacuum overnight (p \u2264 10-2 kPa). Higher and lower activation temperatures did not lead to increased porosity. Moreover the PXRD data measured after nitrogen sorption indicates a substantial loss in crystallinity (see Figure S9).
