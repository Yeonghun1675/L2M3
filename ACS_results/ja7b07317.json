Furthermore, four weak hydrogen-bonding contacts\nare observed leading to O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O distances in the 3.0\u20133.3\n\u00c5 range. Finally, electrostatic interactions must also be considered\nsince attractive interactions are reinforced by O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7K\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O\njunctions involving terminal W\ue5fbO groups of the POM unit (O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7K\ndistances, \u223c3.0 \u00c5) and by ether or methanolic groups of\nthe glucopyranose moieties belonging to the \u03b3-CD. The structure\nof POM@2CD assembly derives from the former and consists of one Dawson\nunit [P<sub>2</sub>W<sub>18</sub>O<sub>62</sub>]<sup>6\u2013</sup> sandwiched by two \u03b3-CD disposed on the two opposite longitudinal\nfaces of the POM at 180\u00b0 from each other (see b). The cohesion forces of\nthe supramolecular 1:2 arrangement are ensured by three hydrogen-bonding\ncontacts with O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O distances of \u223c3.0 \u00c5,\nsupported by electrostatic interactions involving bridging Na<sup>+</sup> and Cs<sup>+</sup> cations (see Figure S4, <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.7b07317/suppl_file/ja7b07317_si_001.pdf\">SI</ext-link> section 4). A third POM:\u03b3-CD stoichiometry has been\nobtained, giving an assembly where the [P<sub>2</sub>W<sub>18</sub>O<sub>62</sub>]<sup>6\u2013</sup> ion is closely embedded by three\n\u03b3-CDs as a paddle wheel arrangement (see c). As already observed for the 1:1 and 1:2\nstoichiometries, the primary faces of the three \u03b3-CD units are\ndirected toward the central POM moiety. Interestingly, the three \u03b3-CDs\nare related through a <italic>C</italic>\n<sub>3</sub> axis and held\ntogether through three short hydrogen-bonding contacts (O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O\n= 2.69 \u00c5). Furthermore, three equivalent rubidium cations are\nalso involved within the POM@3CD arrangement, as nodes that associate\nthe POM with two \u03b3-CDs through seven Rb\u2013O contacts (Rb\u2013O\n= 2.83\u20133.22 \u00c5) (see Figure S5, <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.7b07317/suppl_file/ja7b07317_si_001.pdf\">SI</ext-link> section 4). At last, three additional hydrogen-bonds (O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O\n= 2.93 \u00c5) ensure direct interactions between POM and \u03b3-CD.\nThese results have to be correlated with those previously reported\nby Stoddart et al. on superstructures involving CDs and the Keggin-type\n[PMo<sub>12</sub>O<sub>40</sub>]<sup>3\u2013</sup> anion. In all cases, the three structures exhibit similar\ntypes of molecular recognition wherein POM unit is facing \u03b3-CD\nthrough its primary face as two complementary moieties usually described\nas hydrogen bond acceptor and donor, respectively. In these structural\nexamples, the Keggin or Dawson ions do not penetrate deeply into the\ncavity of the macrocyclic host but rather interact through multiple\nweakly bonding interactions array with the hydrophilic OH groups lining\nthe primary faces of the CDs. Actually, such a situation is significantly\npronounced with the Dawson anion, a species larger than the [PMo<sub>12</sub>O<sub>40</sub>]<sup>3\u2013</sup> Keggin-type anion. Besides, it should be also worth noting the\nrole of the alkali ions (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Rb<sup>+</sup>, or Cs<sup>+</sup>), which participate also in the reinforcement\nof the supramolecular POM\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7CD associations in the\nsolid state packing. Nevertheless, Stoddart et al. mentioned that\nthe La<sup>3+</sup> countercation presents as fully hydrated aqua\nion [La\u00ad(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>9</sub>]<sup>3+</sup> displays only very\nweak ionic interactions with the [PMo<sub>12</sub>O<sub>40</sub>]@2CD\nsupramolecular complexes. In our case, probably due to their low enthalpy\nhydration, alkali ions are then able\nto interact directly with the OH groups of the rims (see Figures S3\u2013S5, <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.7b07317/suppl_file/ja7b07317_si_001.pdf\">SI</ext-link> section 4). In this case, such a situation\nprecludes the usual face-to-face organization observed within the\n[PMo<sub>12</sub>O<sub>40</sub>]@2CD arrangement. At last, it should be mentioned that in the 3D packing\nof the POM@2CD and POM@3CD, some close contacts and partial inclusions\nbetween \u03b3-CDs can be depicted in addition to the POM\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7CD\ninteractions.</p>", "clean_text": "Single-Crystal X-ray Analysis\n\nPOM@nCD Arrangements with n = 1, 2, or 3\n\nRemarkably, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of single crystals obtained from POM/\u03b3-CD mixtures revealed three different stoichiometries depending on the used POM/\u03b3-CD ratio (see ).

In the structure of the 1:1 complex (see a), the Dawson ion appears literally put down on the primary face of the \u03b3-CD. Structural analyses revealed only one short ion-dipole contact W\ue5fbO\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C-OH (O\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C = 2.68 \u00c5), while the remaining similar interactions appear weaker as reflected by O\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C distances longer than 3.2 \u00c5. Furthermore, four weak hydrogen-bonding contacts are observed leading to O\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O distances in the 3.0-3.3 \u00c5 range. Finally, electrostatic interactions must also be considered since attractive interactions are reinforced by O\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5K\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O junctions involving terminal W\ue5fbO groups of the POM unit (O\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5K distances, ~3.0 \u00c5) and by ether or methanolic groups of the glucopyranose moieties belonging to the \u03b3-CD. The structure of POM@2CD assembly derives from the former and consists of one Dawson unit [P2W18O62]6- sandwiched by two \u03b3-CD disposed on the two opposite longitudinal faces of the POM at 180\u00b0 from each other (see b). The cohesion forces of the supramolecular 1:2 arrangement are ensured by three hydrogen-bonding contacts with O\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O distances of ~3.0 \u00c5, supported by electrostatic interactions involving bridging Na+ and Cs+ cations (see Figure S4, SI section 4). A third POM:\u03b3-CD stoichiometry has been obtained, giving an assembly where the [P2W18O62]6- ion is closely embedded by three \u03b3-CDs as a paddle wheel arrangement (see c). As already observed for the 1:1 and 1:2 stoichiometries, the primary faces of the three \u03b3-CD units are directed toward the central POM moiety. Interestingly, the three \u03b3-CDs are related through a C 3 axis and held together through three short hydrogen-bonding contacts (O\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O = 2.69 \u00c5). Furthermore, three equivalent rubidium cations are also involved within the POM@3CD arrangement, as nodes that associate the POM with two \u03b3-CDs through seven Rb-O contacts (Rb-O = 2.83-3.22 \u00c5) (see Figure S5, SI section 4). At last, three additional hydrogen-bonds (O\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O = 2.93 \u00c5) ensure direct interactions between POM and \u03b3-CD. These results have to be correlated with those previously reported by Stoddart et al. on superstructures involving CDs and the Keggin-type [PMo12O40]3- anion. In all cases, the three structures exhibit similar types of molecular recognition wherein POM unit is facing \u03b3-CD through its primary face as two complementary moieties usually described as hydrogen bond acceptor and donor, respectively. In these structural examples, the Keggin or Dawson ions do not penetrate deeply into the cavity of the macrocyclic host but rather interact through multiple weakly bonding interactions array with the hydrophilic OH groups lining the primary faces of the CDs. Actually, such a situation is significantly pronounced with the Dawson anion, a species larger than the [PMo12O40]3- Keggin-type anion. Besides, it should be also worth noting the role of the alkali ions (Na+, K+, Rb+, or Cs+), which participate also in the reinforcement of the supramolecular POM\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5CD associations in the solid state packing. Nevertheless, Stoddart et al. mentioned that the La3+ countercation presents as fully hydrated aqua ion [La(H2O)9]3+ displays only very weak ionic interactions with the [PMo12O40]@2CD supramolecular complexes. In our case, probably due to their low enthalpy hydration, alkali ions are then able to interact directly with the OH groups of the rims (see Figures S3-S5, SI section 4). In this case, such a situation precludes the usual face-to-face organization observed within the [PMo12O40]@2CD arrangement. At last, it should be mentioned that in the 3D packing of the POM@2CD and POM@3CD, some close contacts and partial inclusions between \u03b3-CDs can be depicted in addition to the POM\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5CD interactions.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 8, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig2\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Structural representation of the supramolecular POM@nCD\nalong their\nX-ray diffraction analysis showing (a) the 1:1, (b) 1:2, and (c) 1:3\narrangements.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr2\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ja-2017-073173_0002.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 2  Structural representation of the supramolecular POM@nCD along their X-ray diffraction analysis showing (a) the 1:1, (b) 1:2, and (c) 1:3 arrangements.
