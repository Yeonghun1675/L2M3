Similar changing was observed in the 31P NMR spectrum where narrowing of a broad signal (\u03b4 = 23.5 ppm) was observed after the addition of 20 \u03bcL of methanol-d 4 or 120 \u03bcL of trifluoroethanol. These data allow us to conclude that the molecular aggregates are formed in the chloroform solution through the coordination of the diethoxyphosphoryl group to the zinc atom as observed by X-ray study in the solid state. The chemical shifts of pyrrolic protons as well as the protons of the diethoxyphosphoryl group are less pronounced than for Zn-porphyrins having intramolecularly connected diethoxyphosphoryl groups or for Zn-porphyrin dimers where the P\ue5fbO\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Zn coordination bond occurs. The P\ue5fbO\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Zn bond in 2Zn assembly is weaker compared to the intermolecular bonds of Zn-phosphoryl porphyrin dimers.
