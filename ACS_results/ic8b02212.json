From the PXRD, we can see that the as-synthesized PXRD patterns of FJU-35 are in good agreement with the simulated pattern, but it readily loses framework integrity and porosity when exposed to air for 2 days or after activation (a and S1). This is consistent with the structural analysis that conjectures that the coordination H2O molecules and asymmetric formic acids in CdII-O-CdII chains of FJU-35 may cause instability. In comparison, powder X-ray diffraction patterns for simulated, as-synthesized, and activated samples of FJU-36 agree well (b), demonstrating that the framework of FJU-36 is stable. The TGA curve shows that FJU-35 starts to lose solvent molecules at room temperature and loses 27.65% of the solvent molecules at 180 \u00b0C, corresponding to the loss of solvent molecules DMF and H2O in the channels (calcd 28.57%) (Figure S6). Further weight loss of 5.35% at 180-282 \u00b0C should be attributed to [(CH3)2NH2]+ cation, coordination H2O, and HCOOH (calcd 5.44%). After that, the sample is still continuously releasing weight without a noticeable platform. This is also reflected in FJU-35 instability due to the loss of a large number of solvent molecules. The TGA curve of FJU-36 shows a 15.31% weight loss, which is attributed to the loss of guest molecules DMF and H2O (calcd 15.82%) (Figure S6).

From the PXRD, we can see that the as-synthesized PXRD patterns of FJU-35 are in good agreement with the simulated pattern, but it readily loses framework integrity and porosity when exposed to air for 2 days or after activation (a and S1). This is consistent with the structural analysis that conjectures that the coordination H2O molecules and asymmetric formic acids in CdII-O-CdII chains of FJU-35 may cause instability. In comparison, powder X-ray diffraction patterns for simulated, as-synthesized, and activated samples of FJU-36 agree well (b), demonstrating that the framework of FJU-36 is stable. The TGA curve shows that FJU-35 starts to lose solvent molecules at room temperature and loses 27.65% of the solvent molecules at 180 \u00b0C, corresponding to the loss of solvent molecules DMF and H2O in the channels (calcd 28.57%) (Figure S6). Further weight loss of 5.35% at 180-282 \u00b0C should be attributed to [(CH3)2NH2]+ cation, coordination H2O, and HCOOH (calcd 5.44%). After that, the sample is still continuously releasing weight without a noticeable platform. This is also reflected in FJU-35 instability due to the loss of a large number of solvent molecules. The TGA curve of FJU-36 shows a 15.31% weight loss, which is attributed to the loss of guest molecules DMF and H2O (calcd 15.82%) (Figure S6). After that, a plateau appears at 226-380 \u00b0C, indicating a more robust framework with higher thermal stability. To further establish the framework stability of FJU-36, variable-temperature PXRD tests were performed on the as-synthesized sample. The result shows that FJU-36 can be stable to close to 350 \u00b0C, indicating that FJU-36 has high thermal stability (Figure S2). Such superior stability in FJU-36 is a beneficial factor in the exploration of MOFs as functional materials for practical applications.\n\nGas Adsorption Properties\n\nIn order to examine the permanent porosity of FJU-35 and FJU-36, gas adsorption studies were performed. Prior to the gas adsorption measurements, the FJU-35 and FJU-36 were immersed in the CH3OH to replace the guest molecules, followed by evacuation at 80 \u00b0C until the degassed vessel reached 5 \u03bcmHg, generatong the fully desolvated samples FJU-35a and FJU-36a. It has been observed that FJU-35a could only adsorb a little N2 (8.0 cm3/g) and CO2 (14.0 cm3/g) at 77 K (a) and 273 K (Figure S11), respectively, which showed the collapse or at least partial decomposition of the framework. In contrast, the FJU-36a displays fully reversible type-I sorption behavior with a N2 sorption amount of 131.2 cm3/g (STP) at 77 K, revealing their microporous characters (a). According to the N2 adsorption isotherm, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Langmuir surface areas are estimated to be 409.0 and 554.2 m2/g, respectively. The calculated pore volume of FJU-36a is 0.203 cm3/g. The pore size distribution analysis by nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) utilizing N2 adsorption data at 77 K shows that FJU-36a exhibits pore distribution around 5-15 \u00c5, which is close to the sizes of two channels in the framework (b).\n\nPhotoluminescence (PL) Behaviors and Sensing Properties\n\nMetal-organic frameworks constructed from Cd ion and \u03c0-conjugated organic ligands generally exhibit excellent photoluminescence, and they are therefore potential candidates for fluorescence probes. FJU-35 and FJU-36 with different CdII-O-CdII chains may bring unexpected fluorescence properties. To detect the fluorescence characteristics of FJU-35 and FJU-36, solid-state photoluminescence spectra of both compounds and their free ligands were tested at room temperature (). The photoluminescence spectrum of the free ligand H3PTB exhibits maximum peaks at 516 nm at excitation of 350 nm, which may originate from the ligand-centered electronic \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0* transition. FJU-35 and FJU-36 display similar fluorescence emission spectra upon excitation at 350 nm with a strong emission peak and a weak emission shoulder peak at 396 and 557 nm, respectively. The strong emission peak could be assigned to metal chain centered emission, which originates from the CdII-O-CdII charge transfer (O \u2192 CdII) excited state. The weak shoulder peak at 557 nm can be attributed to the ligand-centered \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* and or n \u2192 \u03c0* transition with a red shift (41 nm) with respect to free H3PTB, and the weaker emission on FJU-35 may be caused by more sensitive CdII-O-CdII chains.
