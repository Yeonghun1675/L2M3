The conversion rates of the 4 and 8 h reactions were compared with the standard 16 h reaction (, entries 4).

To get the single crystals, the reaction solution was heated in an oven at 90 \u00b0C and then was cooled to room temperature. Red block shaped crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction were collected and washed three times with dmf, followed by diethyl ether and dried in air for further analysis.\n\n{[Pr2(MnLCl)2(NO3)2(dmf)6(H2O)2]\u22c5xH2O} n  (1)\n\nYield: 20 mg (21% as single crystalline material).
