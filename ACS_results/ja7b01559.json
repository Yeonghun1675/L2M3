Furthermore, Im-Fe-MOF has very stable performance under water atmosphere contributed from the immobilized imidazole by coordination bonds, while the conductivity of Im@Fe-MOF would decrease to a comparable value with that in Fe-MOF after being washed once with water due to the leaching of imidazole. These detailed investigations by utilizing the ideal crystalline model system demonstrate that the immobilized and regularly arranged imidazole in the framework by coordination bonds could be more helpful for the formation of proton-conductive pathways under humidity condition comparing to the imidazole molecules with disordered distribution in pore spaces. This investigation results are meaningful for understanding the proton conduction affected by imidazole and instructive for further design of new proton-conducting materials.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 19, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information\nis available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.7b01559\">10.1021/jacs.7b01559</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Detailed information\nregarding the experimental methods,\nsyntheses, powder XRD patterns, gas sorption, impedance analysis (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.7b01559/suppl_file/ja7b01559_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>CIF file for\nFe\u2013MOF (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.7b01559/suppl_file/ja7b01559_si_002.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>CIF file for Im\u2013Fe\u2013MOF (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.7b01559/suppl_file/ja7b01559_si_003.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/jacs.7b01559.
