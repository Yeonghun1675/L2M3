The compound was characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C), elemental analysis, vibrational spectroscopy (IR), DTA, and sensitivity measurements. In order to develop new photosensitive and environmentally benign primary explosives, various energetic transition metal complexes were synthesized and characterized. Energetic coordination compounds (ECCs) consist of nitrogen-rich ligands, oxidizing anions (perchlorate, nitrate), and a transition metal. The synthetic route to these complexes is straightforward, cost-effective and fulfills environmental needs. For the first time, 14 novel coordination compounds based on 5-DTM as chelating neutral ligand were synthesized and extensively characterized by IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, DTA, and sensitivity measurements. In addition, X-ray crystal structures were determined for 13 complexes to get better insights into the interesting and challenging complex units. The 5-DTM chloride complexes 2-4 show different coordination spheres depending on the inserted transition metal (copper(II) favors chloride, while cobalt(II) and nickel(II) prefer aqua ligands). The preparation of the 5-DTM copper(II) nitrate and perchlorate complexes (nitrate: 11 and 12; perchlorate: 14 and 15) was strongly dependent on the concentration and volume of the solvent, and yielded two different coordination isomers in each case. In addition, a polymeric copper(II) sulfate complex 9 was obtained showing a mixed coordination mode of 5-DTM, which is built up by three nonequivalent copper(II) centers and four types of ligands (water, sulfate, neutral, and deprotonated 5-DTM molecules). The perchlorate complex 15 is an extremely sensitive (much more sensitive than lead and silver azide) primary explosive and showed heavy detonations during the hot plate and hot needle tests. The compound has an astonishing high thermal stability with a decomposition temperature of 233 \u00b0C (the water containing perchlorate complex exploded at a temperature as low as 85 \u00b0C). Dehydration of compound 12 to 13 had no effect on the sensitivities but instead had an effect on the explosive power.

Only the cobalt chloride complex 3 had a higher decomposition temperature (243 \u00b0C). Compound 11 has an endothermic signal at 97 \u00b0C which presumably indicates the loss of coordinated aqua ligands (Figure S5). TGA (thermal gravimetry analysis) measurements with a heating rate of \u03b2 = 2 \u00b0C min-1 in a nitrogen atmosphere in open Al2O3 crucibles with a PerkinElmer TGA4000 thermogravimetric analyzer have shown that compound 12 loses its crystal water at temperatures lower than 100 \u00b0C (Figure S6). Drying of 12 at 60 \u00b0C yielded the dehydrated complex 13 without decomposition. A higher heating rate (e.g., 5 \u00b0C min-1) leads to decomposition of the complex right after dehydration (Figure S5).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "copper(II) chloride complex 2", "symbol": "2",
