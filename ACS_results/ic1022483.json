Found (%): C, 41.9; H, 4.6; N, 8.5; F, 17.4.\n\n[Cu2Piv4Cu(hfac)2L2]\u22c53C7H8 \n\nA solution of [Cu(hfac)2L2] (0.1 g, 0.1 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (5 mL) was added to the solution of [Cu2Piv4(MeOH)2] (0.063 g, 0.1 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (1 mL). The solvent was then removed with an air flow, and the residue was dissolved in toluene (3-4 mL). The resulting dark blue solution was filtered. After 5-7 days, dark blue prisms were filtered off. Yield: 82%. Found (%): C, 49.4; H, 5.6; N, 6.5; F, 12.6. Calculated for C73H96N8O16F12Cu3 (%): C, 49.8; H, 5.5; N, 6.4; F, 12.9.\n\n[CuPiv2L2]\u22c52CH2Cl2 \n\nA solution of L (0.112 g, 0.48 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (3 mL) was poured in the solution of [Cu2Piv4(MeOH)2] (0.07 g, 0.12 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (2 mL). The resulting dark blue solution was filtered, and hexane (3 mL) was added to it very slowly. After 1-2 days, oblong dark violet crystals precipitated. They were filtered off and washed with hexane (2 mL). Yield: 98% (0.18 g). Found (%): C, 48.0; H, 6.7; N, 13.5. Calculated for the partially desolvated C33H54N8O8Cl2Cu product (%): C, 48.0; H, 6.6; N, 13.6.\n\n[Cu(hfac)2(L1)2]\n\nA mixture of Cu(hfac)2 (0.0540 g, 0.11 mmol) and L1 (0.0500 g, 0.23 mmol) was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (2 mL). Ethanol (4 mL) was carefully added to the resulting solution in such a way that an ethanol layer covered CH2Cl2. After 5 h, long orange crystals formed. They were filtered off, washed with cold ethanol, and dried in air. Yield: 88%. The complex is readily soluble in acetone, CH2Cl2, and CHCl3, but is sparingly soluble in methanol and ethanol. Calculated for C32H36N8O6F12Cu (%): C, 41.8; H, 3.9; N, 12.2; F, 24.8. Found (%): C, 41.7; H, 4.0; N, 11.8; F, 24.7.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "4,4,5,5-Tetramethyl-2-(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-5-yl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazole-1-oxyl", "symbol": "L1", "chemical formula":
