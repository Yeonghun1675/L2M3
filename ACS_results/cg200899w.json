BVS calculations indicate that Fe1 and the central Fe3 cations are divalent, presumably generated by reduction of Fe3+ cations by the DMF solvent, while Fe2 cation is trivalent (Fe1, 1.90; Fe2, 3.03; Fe3, 2.14). The magnetic measurements (see below) confirm this oxidation state assignment. The distance between the central Fe3 cation and the surrounding Fe2 cation is 3.1025(2) \u00c5, a little shorter than the distances found in 1; the distance between Fe3 and Fe1 is 3.3458(1) \u00c5. There are two types of coordination modes for l-tartrate ligands (). In both types, the ligand further coordinates to one more iron cation with its carboxylate and hydroxyl groups. One tartrate ligand uses one oxygen atom from the carboxylate group to connect another iron cation, which causes a significant difference between the extended structures in 1 and 2: the water molecule coordinated to Na+ in 1 is replaced by the oxygen atom (O14) from one carboxylate group of an adjacent cluster; the Fe1-O bond length is 2.098(5) \u00c5, indicating relatively strong bonding between the clusters.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 22, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig3\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Ball-and-stick representation of Fe<sub>7</sub>Sb<sub>6</sub>O<sub>8</sub>(<sc>l</sc>-tartrate)<sub>6</sub> cluster in <bold>2</bold>.
