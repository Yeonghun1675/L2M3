Then we measured breakthrough curve of 1 under the mixture of C2H4 and CO2 (C2H4/CO2 = 80:20 (vol)) at 298 K (Figure ). Total pressure of the gas mixture was 0.74 MPa, space velocity was 1.2 min-1, and consequently relative pressures of CO2 and C2H4 were 0.59 and 0.15 MPa, respectively. The breakthrough curve suggests a clear separation property of CO2 over C2H4 under kinetic conditions. Composition of gas in outlet is almost 100% of C2H4 and no detection of CO2. After 60 min of retention time, it reaches breakpoint and goes back to the original gas fraction in the mixture.
