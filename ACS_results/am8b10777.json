The delivery of electrons to the photoelectron trap reagent O2 results in OH\u22c5 radicals with the interaction of water, which are used for the following oxidation reaction. As the behavior of photogenerated charge carriers is important for the photodegradation process, PEC (photoelectrochemical) behavior was performed to investigate the photoelectric interactions in 1 (). The photocurrent response is recorded under visible or NIR light irradiation with ON-OFF switches of 60 s. For control experiments, the blank sample is obtained from FTO glass only. The electrodes indicate the photocurrent responses as high as 0.3 \u03bcA\u22c5cm-2 and 0.1 \u03bcA\u22c5cm-2 under visible and NIR light irradiation, respectively. The different optical densities for visible light and NIR light of used xenon lamp light source account for the difference in current density. These results confirm that electron-hole pairs in 1 can be excited by both visible and NIR light irradiation. The process is the first and most essential step of a photocatalytic reaction. Therefore, it is evidence that 1 has visible and NIR light photocatalytic activity. As known, only UV light responsive character of POMs restricts their application in photocatalysis for the catalysts can usually utilize only less than 5% of the solar light. Embedding POMs into MOFs is one of the most promising strategies to enlarge the range of solar absorption. Control experiments are carried out to investigate the factors (MOF metal Cu(II), ligand and POM) that affect the photocatalytic performance of 1 (see Figures S9 and S10). At the same reaction condition, [HCPBPY]3[PW12O40]2 (without Cu(II) ion), Cu2Cl(trz)8[PW12O40] (different N-heterocyclic ligand), and H2K2[Cu(CPBPY)(H2O)3][P2W18O62]\u22c58H2O (different POM) give conversion of 24.1% in 45 min, 56.7% in 60 min, and 96.9% in 40 min, respectively (Figures S12 and S13). These results indicate the POM [PW12O40]3- embedded in the cavity of copper-viologen framework enlarges light absorption range and increases photocatalytic efficiency of the catalyst. Viologen is an electron deficient molecule and it is well-known as light sensitizing components having been widely utilized in solar energy conversion. Multi-interactions between the guest cluster and the host frame not only help for stabilizing the included active catalytic component but also enhance the electron-hole separation of it, showing an interesting synergistic catalytic structural mode (Figure S2). The absorption of 1 in UV-vis-NIR range is strengthened and widened via overlapping bands of O-W, ligand field d-d transitions of copper complex and the transitions of the host framework, which helps for the enhancement of solar energy utilization and photocatalytic activity. In addition, compound 1 also shows highly efficient catalytic ability in their photodegration reactions for other organic dyes methyl orange and rhodamine B (Figures S17-S20).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 10, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig5\" position=\"float\">\n<label>5</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Photocurrent responses (0.4 V bias) of <bold>1</bold> in 0.5 M Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> electrolyte under visible light (blue) and\nNIR light (red), as well as the FTO glass under NIR light as a blank\nsample (black).</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr5\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"am-2018-10777n_0005.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 5  Photocurrent responses (0.4 V bias) of 1 in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte under visible light (blue) and NIR light (red), as well as the FTO glass under NIR light as a blank sample (black).
