Each tail was refined with soft constraints on bond lengths and angles, and the occupancy factors of the two disordered parts were refined to 0.583(14)/0.417(14). The C28 atom is common to the two tails. The two tails are as follows: C28(H285,H286) - C29(H291,H292) - C32(H321,H322) - C33(H331,H332) - C36(H361,H362) - C38(H381,H382,H382) or C28(H283,H284) - C30(H301,H302) - C31(H313,H314) - C34(H341,H342) - C35(H353,H354) - C37(H371,H372,H373).\n\n 2\u22c5KNO3 \n\nC40H64KN5O15; Z = 2; crystal dimensions: 0.20 \u00d7 0.23 \u00d7 0.28 mm; cell dimensions: a = 9.5165(8) \u00c5, b = 13.8803(7) \u00c5, c = 17.6742(12) \u00c5, \u03b1 = 90\u00b0, \u03b2 = 99.517(7)\u00b0, \u03b3 = 90\u00b0, V = 2302.5(3) \u00c53; monoclinic, space group P2/c; \u03c1calcd = 1.290 g cm-3; \u03bc = 0.185 mm-1; 18294 measured reflections, 2287 unique, 641 with I > 2\u03c3(I). Final R factors R 1 = 0.1155 and wR 2 = 0.1170; 126 parameters, 259 restraints including shift-limiting restraints on all parameters; maximal residual electron density is -0.38/0.52 e\u22c5\u00c5-3. The crystal, although not particularly small, was a very weak scatterer, needing a 124 h data collection with frame counting times in between 100 and 500 s. Even after this long exposure, only 641 independent reflections with I > 2\u03c3(I) could be extracted. The structure solution with Superflip was done using nondefault settings. Only the K atom was refined anisotropically. Restraints on 6 distances were needed in order to stabilize the refinement. The H atoms were positioned geometrically and refined with riding constraints. Disorder was observed in the C6 tail but was not modeled, because of the very poor data-to-parameter ratio, which led finally to a relatively high agreement factor.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name":
