Figure S2a,b () shows the fluorescent changes of 1 upon gradual addition of ATP and ADP (0-16 equiv), respectively, giving F max/F 0 values of 70 and 80 for ATP and ADP, respectively (see Figure S3 (); F max is the maximum fluorescence intensity of 1 at 434 nm with the addition of ATP/ADP, and F 0 is the initial fluorescence intensity of 1 at 434 nm without the addition of ATP/ADP). It is worth noting that the maximum fluorescence enhancement reached upon addition of ca. 16 equiv of ATP/ADP instead of 2 equiv of ATP/ADP is probably due to the fact that the reaction is reversible between 1 and ATP/ADP, and not all ATP and ADP forms 2:1 adducts with 1 at 2 equiv of ATP/ADP. A similar phenomenon has also been found in other reported reaction systems of metal complexes with polyphosphates, in which the maximum fluorescence enhancements were reached upon addition of ca. 30 and 40 equiv of PPi, respectively. To our knowledge, a chemosensor displaying such high F max/F 0 values toward ATP and ADP has not been documented so far. Moreover, it is interesting to note that the emission intensities of 1 do not change in the presence of other anions such as fluoride, chloride, carbonate, sulfonate, nitrate, acetate, etc. (see Figure S4, ), indicating the fluorescence imaging of ATP and ADP in living cells will not be affected by these anions.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 21, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>ATP, CTP, GTP, TTP, and UTP all contain the same triphosphate groups;\nthus, the different fluorescence changes between ATP and other nucleotide\ntriphosphates are mainly attributed to the different nucleobases.\nTo investigate the unique role of the adenine in this recognition\nprocess, the fluorescence changes of <bold>1</bold> with the addition\nof ATP (0\u20131 equiv) were further studied.

We demonstrated that the chemosensor 1 selectively recognizes adenosine polyphosphates on the basis of a unique binding mode. That is, the two Zn(II) ions in 1 can catch two ATP or ADP anions through coordination interactions between Zn(II) and the polyphosphate groups, and the two anthracene moieties in 1 can interact with adenine groups from two ATP or ADP anions through stacking interactions to form a sandwichlike structure; these multiple recognition interactions between 1 and ATP/ADP enhance the affinity and selectivity of 1 toward ATP/ADP, demonstrating that the selectivity can be enhanced through increasing the recognition sites of a chemosensor toward a certain nucleoside polyphosphate. Though \u03bc2-PPi anions can alternately link [Zn2L]4+ cations in 2 to generate a 1D coordination polymer of {[Zn2L](P2O7)} n , the results of competitive binding experiments of 1 with ATP/ADP in the presence of PPi demonstrate that the binding of 1 with ATP/ADP is almost completely unaffected by PPi anions, probably due to the stronger affinity of 1 toward ATP/ADP resulting from the multiple recognition interactions between 1 and ATP/ADP. In addition, 1 can be used for fluorescence imaging of adenosine polyphosphates in living cells. We believe that these novel findings are important for designing new chemosensors to increase the selectivity and binding ability for a certain nucleoside polyphosphate.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 32, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Tables, figures, and CIF files\ngiving association constants, Cartesian coordinates for the calculated\nstructures, Job plots, fluorescence spectra, distribution diagrams, <sup>31</sup>P NMR spectra in DMSO-<italic toggle=\"yes\">d</italic>\n<sub>6</sub>, and\nX-ray crystallographic data for <bold>1</bold>\u00b71.5H<sub>2</sub>O\u00b72CH<sub>3</sub>CN and <bold>2</bold>\u00b719H<sub>2</sub>O.\nThis material is available free of charge via the Internet at <uri xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">http://pubs.acs.org</uri>.</p>", "clean_text": "Tables, figures, and CIF files giving association constants, Cartesian coordinates for the calculated structures, Job plots, fluorescence spectra, distribution diagrams, 31P NMR spectra in DMSO-d 6, and X-ray crystallographic data for 1\u22c51.5H2O\u22c52CH3CN and 2\u22c519H2O.
