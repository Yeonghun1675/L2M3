A yield of 220 mg, 87% (based on H6TCPP) was obtained for Ga-PMOF-bs-th, [Ga2(H2TCPP)(OH)2]\u22c53DMF\u22c53H2O.\n\nOptimized batch reactor synthesis of In-PMOF-bs-th: H6TCPP (15 mg, 1.9 \u00d7 10-2 mmol), DMF (724 \u03bcL), and 0.5 M aqueous In(NO3)3\u22c5H2O solution (75.6 \u03bcL, 3.8 \u00d7 10-2 mmol) were added to the 2.0 mL reactor. The reactor was heated for 48 h at 120 \u00b0C and cooled down to rt in 6 h. The resulting product was washed two times each with DMF and acetone. A yield of 292 mg, 96% (based on H6TCPP) was obtained for In-PMOF-bs-th [In2(H2TCPP)(OH)2]\u22c53DMF\u22c54H2O. Both MOF syntheses can be scaled up in 30 mL Teflon reactors by using the 12-fold amount of all reactants, the same molar ratio of metal to linker (2:1), the same temperature-time program, and the same washing procedures.\n\nUltrasound-assisted synthesis could only be achieved for the In-PMOF. In-PMOF-bs-us was synthesized in glass-vials (V max = 7.0 mL) by mixing H6TCPP (51 mg, 6.5 \u00d7 10-2 mmol), DMF (4 mL), and 0.5 M aqueous In(NO3)3\u22c5H2O solution (257.0 \u03bcL, 12.9 \u00d7 10-2 mmol). The glass vial was ultrasonicated in a water bath for 7 h. The final temperature of the water bath was 50 \u00b0C. The resulting product was centrifuged for 30 min at 20000 rpm and washed three times with ethanol by subsequent centrifugation, each time for 30 min at 20000 rpm. A yield of 68 mg, 85% (based on H6TCPP) was obtained for In-PMOF-bs-us, [In2(H2TCPP)(OH)2]\u22c53DMF\u22c54H2O.\n\nContinuous-flow synthesis of Ga-PMOF-cf and In-PMOF-cf was carried out using a two-syringe-pump flow reactor setup as previously described. The MOFs were obtained using concentrations of 0.1 mol L-1 of Ga(NO3)3 and H6TCPP in a mixture of 94 vol % DMF and 6 vol % water. For the synthesis of In-PMOF-cf, corresponding solutions with a concentration of 0.05 mol L-1 were used. The solutions were injected into a flow reactor (V = 15 mL) with flow rates of 0.167 mL min-1 for metal and 0.084 mL min-1 for the linker solution respectively, giving a total reaction time of 60 min. The different flow rates for metal and linker solution led to a molar metal-to-linker ratio of 2 to 1. During the reaction the flow reactor was kept at a temperature of 100 \u00b0C. In a second experiment a flow rate of 0.125 mL min-1 for both starting materials was used (molar ratio metal-to-linker 1:1) and the reaction temperature was raised to 120 \u00b0C. The products were collected and isolated by centrifugation for 15 min at 15000 rpm and washed three times with ethanol by subsequent centrifugation, each time for 15 min at 15000 rpm. The formation of Ga-PMOF-cf at 100 \u00b0C yielded 397 mg, 71% (based on H6TCPP) with a space-time yield of 648 kg m-3 d-1. The corresponding synthesis of In-PMOF-cf at 100 \u00b0C was also carried out, but the reaction product contains X-ray amorphous impurities. Hence a detailed characterization of this product was not carried out. To confirm that In-PMOF-cf was obtained a Pawley fit was performed (Figure S5).", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "Ga-PMOF-bs-th", "symbol": "", "chemical formula":
