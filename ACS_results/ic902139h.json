The first-principles bottom-up calculations performed in this work indicate that such behavior is caused by the large separation between the singlet ground state and the first triplet excited state compared to the thermal energy at the region of temperatures where the 1D-3D magnetic transition occurs. However, as shown in Figure , such an energy difference can be changed by increasing the splitting of the triplet states, which is determined by the value of J inter. Therefore, as the final step in our study of the 1D to 3D transition in low-dimensional materials, we simulated the behavior of the magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity curves for a hypothetical CuPz(NO3)2 crystal in which all J inter parameters would be increased by a multiplying factor. The changes in the macroscopic properties will be rationalized by looking at the changes in the energy spectra of the spin states of the crystal (which are the magnetic states in the magnetic model space).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 45, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>Two initial cases were studied: (1) the <italic toggle=\"yes\">J</italic>\n<sub>intra</sub>/<italic toggle=\"yes\">J</italic>\n<sub>inter</sub> ratio is 5 times smaller, 13.24 obtained by multiplying all <italic toggle=\"yes\">J</italic>\n<sub>inter</sub> by 5 without changing their sign, and (2) the <italic toggle=\"yes\">J</italic>\n<sub>intra</sub>/<italic toggle=\"yes\">J</italic>\n<sub>inter</sub> ratio is 10 times smaller, 6.62, once again obtained by multiplying all <italic toggle=\"yes\">J</italic>\n<sub>inter</sub> by 10 without changing their sign (note that we have preserved the 1D character of the magnetic topology).
