Each Dy<sup>3+</sup> ion is eight-coordinated by one\nPNO oxygen atom (O1), one carbonyl oxygen atom (O2), two phenoxide\noxygen atoms (O3), one methoxide oxygen atom (O4), two carboxylate\noxygen atoms (O5 and O6), and one imine nitrogen atom (N3), forming\na hula-hoop-like coordination geometry (b). The Dy\u2013O distances are in the\nrange of 2.322\u20132.449 \u00c5. The coordination geometry and\nbond length around Dy<sup>3+</sup> ions are similar to those in other\nreported dysprosium-containing complexes. Two L<sup>2\u2013</sup> ligands coordinate two Dy<sup>3+</sup> ions in an antiparallel fashion, with the tridentate part (O1, N3,\nand O2) and the bidentate <italic>o</italic>-vanillin group (O2a and\nO3) forming a dinuclear subunit. Within the dinuclear subunit, two\nDy<sup>3+</sup> ions are bridged by two phenoxide \u03bc-oxygen atoms\nfrom two ligands with Dy\u2013O bond lengths of 2.328 and 2.403\n\u00c5, a Dy\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Dy distance of 3.648 \u00c5, and a Dy\u2013O\u2013Dy\nangle of 100.9\u00b0 (a). The dihedral angle between the Dy<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> plane and the benzene ring has a small value of 13.29\u00b0, indicating\nan almost coplanar configuration between them. Previous studies have\nreported three dinuclear and one 2D dysprosium complexes based on\ncarbohydrazine Schiff-base ligands, in which two dysprosium ions are\nbridged by phenoxide oxygen atoms. Among these four dysprosium complexes, the Dy<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> plane and the benzene ring are all nearly in\nthe same plane and the bond lengths of Dy\u2013O<sub>phenoxide</sub> are similar to each other, falling in the range of 2.311\u20132.401\n\u00c5, while the angle of Dy\u2013O\u2013Dy is drastically different.\nTwo of these known compounds have quite large Dy\u2013O\u2013Dy\nangles of 106.4\u00b0 and 107.7\u00b0 and display pronounced ferromagnetic\ninteractions, whereas the other two show relatively smaller Dy\u2013O\u2013Dy\nangles of 100.1\u00b0 and 104.3\u00b0 and exhibit antiferromagnetic\ninteractions between Dy<sup>3+</sup> ions. Therefore, we surmise that\nthe angle of Dy\u2013O\u2013Dy may have a great influence on the\nmagnetic interactions between Dy<sup>3+</sup> ions. Two carboxylate\ngroups adopt the <italic>syn</italic>\u2013<italic>syn</italic> bridging\nmode, further connecting adjacent Dy<sup>3+</sup> ions within the\ndinuclear core, which is not observed in previously reported dinuclear\ndysprosium carbohydrazine complexes. Notably, similar to our previously\npublished 1D chain compound, the PNO part of L<sup>2\u2013</sup> coordinates to the Dy<sup>3+</sup> ions of a neighboring dinuclear\nsubunit, resulting in a 2D (4,4) layer structure based on Dy<sub>2</sub> units (c).\nThus, complex <bold>1</bold> is a rare example of a 2D layer complex\ncontaining dinuclear dysprosium subunits based on the pyridine-<italic>N</italic>-oxidecarbohydrazine Schiff-base ligand, in which the dinuclear\ncore is connected by phenolate oxygen atoms and acetate groups via\nthe <italic>syn</italic>\u2013<italic>syn</italic> bridging mode.\nThe network topology of <bold>1</bold> is similar to that of another\n2D Dy<sup>3+</sup>-containing compound with slow magnetic relaxation\nreported by Yamashita et al.; however, the linkages within and between\nthe dimer units are quite different.

Each Dy3+ ion is eight-coordinated by one PNO oxygen atom (O1), one carbonyl oxygen atom (O2), two phenoxide oxygen atoms (O3), one methoxide oxygen atom (O4), two carboxylate oxygen atoms (O5 and O6), and one imine nitrogen atom (N3), forming a hula-hoop-like coordination geometry (b). The Dy-O distances are in the range of 2.322-2.449 \u00c5. The coordination geometry and bond length around Dy3+ ions are similar to those in other reported dysprosium-containing complexes. Two L2- ligands coordinate two Dy3+ ions in an antiparallel fashion, with the tridentate part (O1, N3, and O2) and the bidentate o-vanillin group (O2a and O3) forming a dinuclear subunit. Within the dinuclear subunit, two Dy3+ ions are bridged by two phenoxide \u03bc-oxygen atoms from two ligands with Dy-O bond lengths of 2.328 and 2.403 \u00c5, a Dy\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Dy distance of 3.648 \u00c5, and a Dy-O-Dy angle of 100.9\u00b0 (a). The dihedral angle between the Dy2O2 plane and the benzene ring has a small value of 13.29\u00b0, indicating an almost coplanar configuration between them. Previous studies have reported three dinuclear and one 2D dysprosium complexes based on carbohydrazine Schiff-base ligands, in which two dysprosium ions are bridged by phenoxide oxygen atoms. Among these four dysprosium complexes, the Dy2O2 plane and the benzene ring are all nearly in the same plane and the bond lengths of Dy-Ophenoxide are similar to each other, falling in the range of 2.311-2.401 \u00c5, while the angle of Dy-O-Dy is drastically different. Two of these known compounds have quite large Dy-O-Dy angles of 106.4\u00b0 and 107.7\u00b0 and display pronounced ferromagnetic interactions, whereas the other two show relatively smaller Dy-O-Dy angles of 100.1\u00b0 and 104.3\u00b0 and exhibit antiferromagnetic interactions between Dy3+ ions. Therefore, we surmise that the angle of Dy-O-Dy may have a great influence on the magnetic interactions between Dy3+ ions. Two carboxylate groups adopt the syn-syn bridging mode, further connecting adjacent Dy3+ ions within the dinuclear core, which is not observed in previously reported dinuclear dysprosium carbohydrazine complexes. Notably, similar to our previously published 1D chain compound, the PNO part of L2- coordinates to the Dy3+ ions of a neighboring dinuclear subunit, resulting in a 2D (4,4) layer structure based on Dy2 units (c). Thus, complex 1 is a rare example of a 2D layer complex containing dinuclear dysprosium subunits based on the pyridine-N-oxidecarbohydrazine Schiff-base ligand, in which the dinuclear core is connected by phenolate oxygen atoms and acetate groups via the syn-syn bridging mode. The network topology of 1 is similar to that of another 2D Dy3+-containing compound with slow magnetic relaxation reported by Yamashita et al.; however, the linkages within and between the dimer units are quite different. In the reported compound, within the Dy2 dimer, the nine-coordinated Dy3+ ions are bridged by \u03bc3-\u03b71:\u03b72 carboxylate groups and the dimer units are further connected by a photosensitive carboxylate ligand to form a 2D layer structure. The adjacent layers are further linked by weak intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions between amide nitrogen atoms and a hydrogen atom of the benzene ring (C11-H11A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5N2, C11\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5N2 = 3.303 \u00c5, \u2220C11-H11A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5N3 = 138.75\u00b0), producing a complicated 3D framework (Figure S1).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 11, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Dinuclear unit (a), coordination polyhedral\naround the Dy<sup>3+</sup> ion (b), and 2D network (c) in <bold>1</bold>.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr2\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2016-01014p_0002.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Dinuclear unit (a), coordination polyhedral around the Dy3+ ion (b), and 2D network (c) in 1.

Complex 1 exhibits temperature- and frequency-dependent ac signals under a zero dc field with an effective anisotropy barrier of 33.6 K. Interestingly, complex 1 possesses reversible magnetic behavior upon adsorption and desorption of CH3OH and water guest molecules. Compared to 1, the desolvated sample 1a shows distinct temperature- and frequency-dependent signals under a zero dc field with an effective energy barrier of 42.0 K. Therefore, the desorption and adsorption of guest CH3OH and water molecules can be conveniently used to mediate the magnetic properties of 1 and its desolvated form.

The TGA curve of 1 exhibits three main steps of weight loss between room temperature and about 600 \u00b0C (Figure S9). The initial weight loss of 13.0% below 100 \u00b0C corresponds to the release of one interstitial water molecule as well as two CH3OH solvent molecules (calcd 13.1%). The weight loss of 5.9% in the temperature range of 100-180 \u00b0C stems from the release of one lattice DMF molecule (calcd 5.8%). Above 200 \u00b0C, the mass sharply decreases, which is assigned to thermal decomposition of the L2- ligand, leaving a residue of Dy2O3 with a final weight of 29.7% (calcd 29.8%).\n\nIt is interesting to note that when we very gently heat the sample of 1 at 35 \u00b0C under vacuum for 6 h or expose it to air for 1 month at room temperature, a dehydrated phase with the formula of [Dy(L)(OOCCH3)]\u22c50.5DMF (1a) can be obtained. The thermal stability of 1a was also explored by TGA analysis, which revealed no weight loss below 100 \u00b0C (i.e., the absence of CH3OH and water guest molecules) but two weight loss steps at higher temperatures (Figure S9). The first weight loss of 6.9% below 180 \u00b0C, consistent with the calculated value of 6.7%, corresponds to the release of half of an interstitial DMF molecule. The second weight loss occurs in the temperature range of 200-700 \u00b0C and can be attributed to decomposition of the L2- ligand, giving rise to a residue of Dy2O3 with a final weight of 34.1% (calcd 34.3%). In the XRD pattern of 1a, the peaks at around 10\u00b0 shift to a higher 2\u03b8 range compared to those of the as-synthesized 1, and a new sharp peak appears at ca. 12\u00b0, indicating structural transformation to lower symmetry upon the release of water and CH3OH molecules ().\n\nMagnetic Behavior of Complex 1a \n\nTo study the effect of desolvation on the magnetic properties, we measured the magnetic susceptibility of 1a in the temperature range of 2-300 K. As shown in , the experimental \u03c7M T value of 27.81 cm3 mol-1 K obtained at room temperature is slightly smaller than the excepted value (28.34 cm3 mol-1 K) for two uncoupled dysprosium ions in the ground state 6H15/2 with g = 4/3. The \u03c7M T value decreases slowly upon a decrease in the temperature from 300 to 100 K, after which it decreases more rapidly to reach 10.24 cm3 mol-1 K at 2 K. Thermal evolution of the magnetic susceptibility of 1a is similar to that of 1, which is attributed to depopulation of the Stark sublevels and/or interdimer antiferromagnetic interactions.
