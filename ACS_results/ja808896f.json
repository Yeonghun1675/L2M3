The samples were held under a dynamic vacuum (<10-3 torr) at 300 \u00b0C for MAMS-2 and MAMS-3, or 170 \u00b0C for MAMS-4, for 5 h to remove the free guest solvent molecules (DMF or DMA) and coordinated aqua ligands. Before the measurement, the sample was evacuated again by using the \"outgas\" function of the surface area analyzer for 1 h at 300 \u00b0C for MAMS-2 and MAMS-3 or 170 \u00b0C for MAMS-4. A sample of about 100.0 mg was used for N2 (99.999%) adsorption measurement and was maintained at 77 K with liquid nitrogen. In the hydrogen storage measurement, high purity hydrogen (99.9995%) and a 100.0 mg sample were used. The regulator and pipe were flushed with hydrogen before they were connected to the analyzer. The internal lines of the instrument were flushed three times by utilizing the \"flushing lines\" function of the program to ensure the purity of H2. The measurement was maintained at 77 K with liquid nitrogen. Similar to the procedures used for H2 measurement at 77 K, highly pure O2 (99.99%), CO (99.99%), CH4 (99.997%), C2H4 (99.5%), C3H6 (99.5%), iso-C4H10 (99.5%), SF6 (99.8%), and CO2 (99.99%) were used for their respective gas adsorption measurements.
