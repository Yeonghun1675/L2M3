Extensive gas-sorption studies in representative and important MOFs functionalized with free aromatic -OH groups such as the IRMOF-8 and DUT-6 (or MOF-205), denoted here as 1 and 2, revealed a high CO2/CH4 selectivity for 1 (13.6 at 273 K and 1 bar) and a high NH3 uptake of 16.4 mol kg-1 at 298 K and 1 bar for 2.\n\nGas-Sorption Properties\n\nSupercritical processing using carbon dioxide (SCD) was applied in all cases, except 4 due to low reaction yield, in order to establish permanent porosity without structural collapse.  Although the as-made MOFs are stable in air under ambient conditions as powder X-ray diffraction data (PXRD) show (see the ), the corresponding evacuated solids are expected to be unstable in the air due to the well-known limited stability of the Zn4O(-CO2)6 cluster toward hydrolysis. Therefore, as we describe in detail in the  related to gas-sorption studies, all manipulations were performed with special care to avoid the exposure of samples to moisture. The degree of structural integrity and pore evacuation was evaluated by powder X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and 1H NMR measurements in digested samples (see the ). Figure a shows nitrogen sorption isotherms recorded at 77 K. In addition, argon adsorption isotherms at 87 K were also recorded (see Figure b for 2 and the  for 1, 3, and 3m). Porosity data extracted from these isotherms are summarized in Table . In the case of 2, a remarkable maximum nitrogen uptake of 1363 cm3 g-1 was recorded, corresponding to a total pore volume of 2.01 cm3 g-1. These values are very close to those reported for the nonfunctionalized analogues DUT-6 (1380 cm3 g-1/2.02 cm3 g-1) and MOF-205 (1410 cm3 g-1/2.16 cm3 g-1), indicating that -OH groups in 2 do not reduce the accessible space. Careful BET calculations using consistency criteria revealed an ultrahigh surface area (SABET) of 4354 m2 g-1, in excellent agreement with the accessible surface area (4671 m2 g-1, see Table ) calculated from the crystal structure, indicating that 2 is structurally intact after pore evacuation. The latter is also confirmed by PXRD where a high degree of crystallinity is retained after removal of the guest molecules (see ). The nitrogen adsorption isotherm shows a distinct condensation step in the relative pressure range P/P o 0.04-0.14 (Figure a,b, suggesting the presence of small mesopores, in full agreement with the crystallographic data. These results were also confirmed by argon adsorption measurements at 87 K (maximum Ar uptake 1529 cm3 g-1 and SABET 4405 m2 g-1, see Figure b). In addition, accurate high resolution micropore analysis using Ar at 87 K allowed us to calculate the pore size distribution, total pore volume, and surface area in 2 using Non-Local Density Functional Theory (NLDFT). Accordingly, after a successful fitting of the isotherm data using a suitable NLDFT kernel, the pore size distribution curve (see the ) shows three distinct peaks centered at 23 \u00c5, 16 \u00c5, and 13 \u00c5, in agreement with the crystallographic analysis. Also important, the NLDFT calculated surface area is 4543 m2 g-1, in excellent agreement with the corresponding BET value.\n\nIn the case of the other -OH functionalized MOFs, 1, 3, and 3m, these show lower SABET compared to the corresponding values calculated from the single-crystal structures (see Table ). However, we note that for 1 the observed SABET 1927 m2 g-1 is the highest among the reported values for the nonfunctionalized analogue IRMOF-8 prepared by different groups. Given that the 1H NMR spectrum of an acid-digested sample of evacuated 1 shows only traces of solvent molecules (see the ), its reduced surface area is attributed to partial framework damage during the pore activation process, as PXRD data show (). In particular, the PXRD pattern of evacuated 1 shows only a relatively broad Bragg peak at the low angle region, indicating a large degree of structural damage after removal of the guest molecules. On the basis of PXRD data, reduced crystallinity was also observed in the cases 3 and 3m (). Compared to 2, which retains its crystallinity (see ) and porosity after solvent removal, a significantly smaller pore aperture in 1, 3, and 3m due to their micropore nature and the presence of -OH groups could result in enhanced framework-solvent interactions, through relatively strong hydrogen bonds, and in this way affects framework integrity during the pore activation process.\n\nThe CO2 adsorption isotherms for 1 and 2 at 195 K up to 1 bar pressure are shown in Figure c. Due to its ultrahigh surface area, 2 shows a remarkable saturation uptake of 1083 cm3 g-1 (214 wt %) at 1 bar (1 shows 75 wt %), which represents one of the highest reported values, rendering this solid potentially very interesting for CO2 storage. The corresponding S-shaped isotherm captures the presence of micro- and mesopores in 2, as indicated by the distinct step at ~380 Torr. Interestingly, the desorption branch of the isotherm shows a hysteresis which is not typical for nonflexible MOFs and could be related to the presence of -OH groups. This is supported by the fact that 1 shows also a hysteretic CO2 adsorption isotherm, despite its significantly smaller pore size compared to 2.\n\nFinally, the combination of ultrahigh surface area and -OH groups in 2 prompted us to investigate how this solid performs and compares with other MOFs in ammonia adsorption at room temperature. Figure d shows the corresponding sorption isotherm for 2 and for its nonfunctionalized analogue DUT-6(MOF-205), for comparison. The observed NH3 uptake for 2 at 1 bar is 16.4 mol kg-1, which is higher compared to the reported values for other MOFs as well as COFs. Compared with DUT-6(MOF-205) which shows a lower maximum uptake (12 mol kg-1), 2 shows a significantly higher uptake at the low pressure region, with the first data point to be 4.7 mol kg-1 at 0.76 Torr (versus 0.8 mol kg-1 at 0.76 Torr, see inset of figure d) indicating a stronger binding, presumably due to the acid-base interaction between the -OH groups and NH3 molecules. However, as in the case of all reported MOFs based on late, first row transition metal cations, ammonia adsorption is not fully reversible in both 2 and DUT-6(MOF-205), and the framework does not hold its integrity as powder XRD and N2 sorption at 77 K showed.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "IRMOF-8", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "selectivity": [{"value": "13.6", "unit": "", "substrate":
