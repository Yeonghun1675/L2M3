The organic ligands BTMB in both 1 and 2 adopt the U- and Z-type coordination modes (the U-type BTMB organic ligands in 1 were used to form the CBPQT4+ system) inclined to a formation of rotaxane structures because of their long chain structure and flexibility. In addition, the six-coordinated TM centers promote the formation of 1 and 2 as well (there are two kinds of coordination numbers (4 and 6) in 2).

Hence, the photocatalytic activity of H2 evolution under visible-light irradiation for 1-5 has also been investigated and compared to the previous literatures. In , H2 is continuously produced under visible-light radiation in this catalytic system. The total amount of H2 was 12.2 \u03bcmol (at a rate of 29.6 \u03bcmol g-1 h-1) in 6 h for 1. It almost possesses the same activity as that of well-known catalysts, such as phosphoniobate-based/amino-functionalized TiIV/dye-sensitized Pt@UiO-66(Zr) frameworks, post-synthesis modification of MOF-253-Pt, as well as some high active POMs based PMOFs. Compared with 1, the blank experiment (without catalyst) was also performed with the total amount of H2 producing <0.1 \u03bcmol in 6 h. The photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of 1 was also studied in methanol (100%) and water (100%), respectively. The total amount of the H2 in methanol was similar with that in 100 mL 20% methanol solution and much higher than that in water (100%), as shown in Figure S25. Additionally, the same experiments were also taken to investigate the photocatalytic H2 evolution activities of 2-5 and were shown to be a little less active than 1 (). From the result of photocatalytic H2 evolution, it is suggested that 1-5 is highly active for photocatalytic H2 evolution under visible-light irradiation. The little difference of the H2 evolution rate can be caused by the different E g values and different structures among the five compounds. In addition, long-tern stability for H2 evolution of 1-5 as the catalysts under visible-light irradiation was studied as well. In Figure S24, it is shown that 1-5 are very stable and reusable for at least three times.
