The asymmetric unit of 1 contains one Cd(II) ion, half of 1,4-bib, half of glut2-, and two lattice water molecules. The hexa-coordinated Cd(II) centers form a distorted octahedral geometry with CdO4N2 coordination environment (a). The four oxygen atoms (O1, O2, O1 a , O2 a ) from two carboxylate groups of two different glut ligands and two nitrogen atoms (N1 and N1 a ) from two different 1,4-bib ligands binds with the Cd1 center to form the secondary building unit.

Similar to that of 3, the asymmetric unit of 4 contains one metal center, Mn(II) ion, one 3,5-pydc2- ligand, one 1,4-bib ligand, and two lattice water molecules though coordination and geometry are different from 3. The hepta-coordinated central Mn(II) ion takes up a distorted pentagonal bipyramidal geometry. In this geometry, four oxygen atoms (O1, O2, O3 a , and O4 a ) from two different 3,5-pydc2- ligands and three nitrogen atoms (N1 and N4 b ) from two different 1,4-bib ligands and another nitrogen atom (N5 c ) from another different 3,5-pydc2- ligand are coordinated to the metal ion (a).

The TOPOS analysis reveals that the structure of 6 can be represented as a 4-connected uninodal net with corresponding Schla\u0308fli symbol of {44.62}(d).

The dehydrated framework is stable up to 324 \u00b0C showing no weight loss, and after that temperature, it sharply falls and decomposes into unidentified products.\n\nIn compound 4, the TGA curve shows weight loss 7.31% (calcd. 7.46%) at 204 \u00b0C, supporting the loss of two water molecules, which starts at 125 \u00b0C. The dehydrated framework is stable up to 350 \u00b0C and then forms unidentified products after that temperature. For compound 5 the weight loss is 15.15% (calcd. 15.26%), within the temperature range of 60-110 \u00b0C, which corresponds to the release of four lattice water molecules, and the dehydrated framework found stable up to 320 \u00b0C without showing any further weight loss, and finally collapses into unidentified products during further heating above 320 \u00b0C. Compound 6 loses its single crystallinity at room temperature owing to quick release of lattice water; the dehydrated compound is stable up to 295 \u00b0C and after that temperature the compound decomposes into unidentified products.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "crystal system": [{"value": "tetragonal", "condition": "unit cell has three edges
