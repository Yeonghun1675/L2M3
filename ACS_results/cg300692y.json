In this approach, the thiocyanate ion replaces the perchlorate ion in the precursor and simply acts as a terminal ligand to give the twisted-ribbon structure. However, the cyanide ion functions not only as a strong bridging coligand but also induces the rearragement of the precuror to give the unusual triple-rail ladder structure.
