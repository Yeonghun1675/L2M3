Also, when wet KI starch test paper is placed with the TCuI\u22c5I2 or TCuI\u22c5ICl solids in the same chamber, no color change was observed after an extended period of time (e.g., 7.0 h, see ), indicating minimal emission of the I2 and ICl species at RT. Faster kinetics of I2 uptake can therefore be achieved under heated conditions. For example, at 77 \u00b0C (or up to 95 \u00b0C), under ambient pressure (I2 vapor pressure being 0.014 atm at 77 \u00b0C), the TCuI powder adsorbs I2 and fully reaches the stoichiometric adsorption capacity (as in TCuI\u22c5I2) within half an hour, as indicated by gravimetric methods (e.g., the TGA plot as shown in Figure b) and the intensity profile in the PXRD pattern (Figure c). The effective uptake of I2 suggests that the TCuI solid can be used for iodine capturing under relatively mild conditions (e.g., protective masks for workers handling leaks/splashes of iodine agents). For the more demanding applications, for example, capturing radioactive iodine species as nuclear waste under  fuel reprocessing conditions (typically at 150 \u00b0C, with acids present),the applicability of this material remains unclear.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 24, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig3\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>TGA plots of (a) an as-made powder sample\nof TCuI; (b) TCuI\u00b7I<sub>2</sub> (prepared by vapor diffusion\nat 77 <sup>o</sup>C); (c) TCuI\u00b7ICl (by vapor diffusion at RT).</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr4\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2014-00677t_0002.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 3  TGA plots of (a) an as-made powder sample of TCuI; (b) TCuI\u22c5I2 (prepared by vapor diffusion at 77 oC); (c) TCuI\u22c5ICl (by vapor diffusion at RT).
