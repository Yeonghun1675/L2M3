Conversely, in this sample, the asymmetric and symmetric stretching bands of trans ligands are evidenced at 537 and 519 cm-1 respectively. According to a D 4h  symmetry of the ZrO4F2 unit, only the symmetric vibration should be Raman active. Actually, this was the case of the highly symmetric zirconium derivative that we recently obtained and characterized (ZPIP in ref ): a single band at 544 cm-1 was observed and assigned to the trans F\u03b1ZrF\u03b2 symmetric stretching. However, due to the presence of the carboxylate group in cis position with respect to F atoms, a symmetry lowering (C 2v ) can be assumed for 1a, thus allowing both symmetric and asymmetric modes to be detected with the absorption and the scattering techniques. Two Raman bands at 547 and 525 cm-1 are also measured for the nicotinic derivative. As well as the previous case, the symmetric and asymmetric stretching of Zr-F bonds are both Raman and IR active due to the low symmetry of the metal coordination structure (C s), and a 20 cm-1 separation is measured between the two spectral components. Notwithstanding these similarities, a different position of Raman bands suggests different sites of F ligands in the coordination shell of Zr. In fact, the results obtained for 2 could support the assignment to a cis arrangement of fluorine ligands, in agreement with the situation already observed for Pt-F compounds.
