A typical synthesis involved adding 55 mmol of MnCl\u22c56H2O, 84 mmol of 2,2-dimethylsuccinic acid, and 140 mmol of KOH to 9 mL of water (i.e., corresponding to a mixture of 1:1.5:2.5:200). This mixture was placed in a 23 mL Teflon-lined Parr autoclave and heated at 140 \u00b0C for 3 days, after which the resulting product was filtered off and washed with water. After drying for an hour at 60 \u00b0C, inspection of the product showed that it contained colorless rod-shaped crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction and nanoindentation studies. Phase purity was confirmed from powder X-ray diffraction patterns (see Figure S1 in the ) collected on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer, using a linear position detector and Cu K\u03b1 radiation. The purity of bulk MnDMS was confirmed by microanalysis, which indicated that MnDMS contained 33.24% C and 4.61% H (calcd 33.20% and 4.64%, respectively).", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "MnDMS", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "[Mn(C6H8O4)(H2O)]"}, "processes": [{"synthesis method": "hydrothermal synthesis", "precursor": [{"name": "MnCl\u22c56H2O", "amount": "55", "unit": "mmol"}, {"name": "2,2-dimethylsuccinic acid", "amount": "84", "unit": "mmol"}, {"name": "KOH", "amount": "140", "unit": "mmol"}], "solvent": [{"name": "water", "amount": "9", "unit": "mL"}], "reducing agent": [{"name": "", "amount": "", "unit": ""}], "surfactant": [{"name": "", "amount": "", "unit": ""}], "pressure": "", "temperature": "140\u00b0C", "time": "3 days", "heating rate": "", "cooling rate": ""}, {"synthesis method": "filtration", "time": "", "atmosphere": "", "pressure": ""}, {"synthesis method": "washing", "washing solution": "water", "amount": ""}, {"synthesis method": "drying", "pressure": "", "temperature": "60\u00b0C", "atmosphere": "", "time": "1 hour"}], "yield": "", "other properties": ["colorless rod-shaped crystals", "suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction and nanoindentation studies", "Phase purity was confirmed from powder X-ray diffraction patterns", "The purity of bulk MnDMS was confirmed by microanalysis"]}]], "include_properties": ["washing", "drying", "filtration", "solvothermal_synthesis"], "intermediate_step": {"text-synthesis-type": "['solvothermal_synthesis', 'filtration', 'washing', 'drying']", "text-synthesis-struct": "```JSON\n[{\"meta\":{\"name\":\"MnDMS\", \"symbol\":\"\", \"chemical formula\":\"[Mn(C6H8O4)(H2O)]\"}, \"processes\":[{\"synthesis method\": \"hydrothermal synthesis\", \"precursor\":[{\"name\":\"MnCl\u22c56H2O\", \"amount\":\"55\", \"unit\":\"mmol\"}, {\"name\":\"2,2-dimethylsuccinic acid\", \"amount\":\"84\", \"unit\":\"mmol\"}, {\"name\":\"KOH\", \"amount\":\"140\", \"unit\":\"mmol\"}], \"solvent\":[{\"name\":\"water\", \"amount\":\"9\", \"unit\":\"mL\"}], \"reducing agent\":[{\"name\":\"\", \"amount\":\"\", \"unit\":\"\"}], \"surfactant\":[{\"name\":\"\", \"amount\":\"\", \"unit\":\"\"}], \"pressure\":\"\", \"temperature\":\"140\u00b0C\", \"time\":\"3 days\", \"heating rate\":\"\", \"cooling rate\":\"\"}, {\"synthesis method\":\"filtration\", \"time\":\"\", \"atmosphere\":\"\", \"pressure\":\"\"}, {\"synthesis method\":\"washing\", \"washing solution\":\"water\", \"amount\":\"\"}, {\"synthesis method\":\"drying\", \"pressure\":\"\", \"temperature\":\"60\u00b0C\", \"atmosphere\":\"\", \"time\":\"1 hour\"}], \"yield\":\"\", \"other properties\":[\"colorless rod-shaped crystals\", \"suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction and nanoindentation studies\", \"Phase purity was confirmed from powder X-ray diffraction patterns\", \"The purity of bulk MnDMS was confirmed by microanalysis\"]}]\n```"}}, {"idx": 6, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Crystal structure of Mn(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>4</sub>)(H<sub>2</sub>O) layered hybrid framework.
