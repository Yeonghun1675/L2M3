As a matter of fact, one way to resolve this dilemma is to estimate the oxidation state of the V<sup>4+</sup> ions in the structure by calculating the well-known bond-valence sum rule. Calculating the bond-valence sum (BVS) for vanadium atom in the VO<sub>6</sub> coordination octahedron, one obtains the value of BVS of 4.35 for the refined model and 3.94 for the calculated one. Because the oxidation state of vanadium is deduced being +4, both BVS values agree well with it, confirming the validity of the proposed structural model for VO(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub>. However, a better agreement is obtained with the DFT model confirming the necessity to properly describe both the vanadyl bond and the more regular geometry of the octahedron around V<sup>4+</sup> ions. In other words, although the DFT arrangement is more regular than the Rietveld one, it also leads to a strong V\u2212O bond alternation. The present analysis leads to the conclusion that the discrepancy between the Rietveld and DFT models is mainly due to the low crystallinity of the investigated material, leading to strong uncertainties. However, if the XRD pattern exhibits the features typical of a low crystalline product and the initial structure of the DFT geometry optimization was far from the final solution, both techniques converged independently toward the same architecture. Such results clearly illustrate the interest to support XRD analysis by DFT relaxation in the case of poorly crystallized samples.</p>", "clean_text": "In summary, the DFT structural model is more regular than the Rietveld one, both in terms of bond lengths and angles.
