Here we select a desolvated sample (4a) of compound 4 as the sensor and benzene, toluene, p-xylene, and mesitylene as the analytes for the chemical-sensing study. The solvent-free framework 4a is obtained by calcination of the synthetic samples under vacuum at 100 \u00b0C for 4 h, and the photoluminescence behavior has been measured (). 4a displays a broad emission around 687 nm that originated from the copper(I) halide cluster.

Moreover, the quantum yields of 68% and 13% for 4 and 4a, respectively, also confirm that the emission has greatly weakened. The chemical-sensing study is performed by soaking 4a crystal powder in selected guest solvents, followed by luminescence testing. While the powder of 4a is suspended in each guest liquid (4a\u2283guest), the fluorescence spectra are recorded under excitation at 380 nm, and photographs are taken after excitation at 365 nm using a commercial ultraviolet (UV) lamp.

In the emission spectra, the enhancing or quenching of characteristic Tb3+ emissions can be clearly observed. However, the emission peak of the copper(I) halide cluster has been covered when the Tb3+ emissions sharply enhance in benzene, toluene and p-xylene solvents. In order to clearly record how the emission originating from the copper(I) halide cluster has changed in different guest solvents, we select compound 2 with a single emission band as the sensor. The chemical-sensing tests have been conducted in the same manner as that of 4a by soaking a desolvated sample (2a) of compound 2 in benzene, toluene, p-xylene, and mesitylene solvents ().
