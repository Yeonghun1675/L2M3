This tetramer has a relatively flat configuration with the uranyl bonds (U\ue5fbO = 1.774(9)\u22121.783(9) \u00c5 and 1.767(4)\u22121.786(5) \u00c5 for <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold>, respectively) pointing upward and downward from the equatorial plane. In the 8-fold coordination, four of the oxygen atoms of the hexagonal equatorial plane belong to carboxylate groups (U\u2212O = 2.561(7)\u22122.656(7) \u00c5 and 2.555(3)\u22122.660(3) \u00c5 for <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold>, respectively) and the last remaining oxygen atoms are oxo groups, which are also bonded to a third uranium atom (U\u2212O = 2.214(7)\u22122.258(7) \u00c5 and 2.220(4)\u22122.260(3) \u00c5 for <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold>, respectively). The assignment of the latter oxygen to a \u03bc<sub>3</sub>-oxo species (O6) is in good agreement with the bond valence calculation considerations (calc: 2.07). In the 7-fold coordination, the four remaining oxygen atoms of the pentagonal bipyramid are from carboxylates (U\u2212O = 2.379(7)\u22122.442(7) \u00c5 and 2.373(3)\u22122.442(3) \u00c5 for <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold>, respectively), and two of them are common to the adjacent uranium cation U2 (O7 and O8). The U2-centered polyhedra share a common oxo edge to each other, which also share a common oxo edge to the U3-centered polyhedra, forming the tetranuclear unit (UO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>(\u03bc<sub>3</sub>-O)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub>. Two distinct uranium\u2212uranium distances are observed within this tetramer (U2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7U2 = 3.7135(6) and 3.7228(3) \u00c5, and U2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7U3 = 3.9659(5) and 3.9691(3) \u00c5, for <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold>, respectively). Such a structural motif is known for uranyl crystal chemistry and was previously encountered in different phases. Other variations of tetramers were also described with only a 7-fold coordination for uranium. One of the carboxylate arms of the two distinct phthalate ligands bridges the uranium cations via both chelate and monodentate connection modes toward the uranyl cations U2 and U3, respectively. The second carboxylate arm has a <italic toggle=\"yes\">syn</italic>\u2212<italic toggle=\"yes\">anti</italic> bidentate bridging mode between the 7-fold coordinated uranyl cations of the tetranuclear and dinuclear units. The phthalate groups are pentadentate, adopting a configuration \u03bc<sub>5</sub>-\u03b7<sub>1</sub>:\u03b7<sub>2</sub>:\u03b7<sub>1</sub>:\u03b7<sub>1</sub>. The organic linker allows for a connection of the two types of building bricks along the direction [011], generating infinite anionic organic\u2212inorganic chains [(UO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>O(OH)(H<sub>2</sub>O)(1,2-bdc)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>\u2212</sup> (Figure ). The electroneutrality of the structure is ensured by the presence of potassium or ammonium cations which are located along the <italic toggle=\"yes\">a</italic> axis and connect the chains to others along that direction (Figure ). There are two crystallographic sites for potassium or ammonium cations: one of them (K2 or N2) is 50% statistically occupied. K1 is located nearby the dinuclear uranyl unit on special position <italic toggle=\"yes\">1a</italic> (0 0 0) and is 10-fold coordinated with K\u2212O distances ranging from 2.906(10) to 3.224(8) \u00c5. The second K2, located between two tetranuclear uranyl units, is 6-fold coordinated with K\u2212O distances in the range 2.809(11)\u22122.994(11) \u00c5. These KO<sub>6</sub> and KO<sub>10</sub> polyhedra generate pillars between the inorganic chains and form a layered neutral network K(UO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>O(OH)(H<sub>2</sub>O)(1,2-bdc)<sub>2</sub> with the benzene rings of the phthalate groups perpendicularly pointing along the (b,c) plane. The three-dimensional cohesion of the structure is ensured by the occurrence of weak \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 interactions between the benzene rings, with C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7C distances close to \u22483.8 \u00c5. An identical arrangement is also observed for the ammonium form, except the occurrence of hydrogen bond interactions (N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O = 2.92\u22123.21 \u00c5) with some oxygen of the inorganic building units.</p>", "clean_text": "Compounds 2 and 3, A(UO2)3O(OH)(H2O)(1,2-bdc)2 (A = K, NH4), are identical and built up from two distinct inorganic building blocks connected to each other through the phthalate ligands. The first building unit, lying on an inversion center (1/2 0 0, 1d), is a dinuclear species containing two uranyl cations in a 7-fold coordination (Figure ). It corresponds to one independent crystallographic site (U1) for uranium, which has two short uranyl bonds (U\ue5fbO = 1.773(9)-1.778(10) \u00c5 and 1.764(4)-1.767(4) \u00c5 for 2 and 3, respectively). The coordination of the UO2 2+ cation is completed by five oxygen atoms located in a pentagonal plane. Two of them (O13) are sharing between two uranium atoms through a common edge. Bond valence calculations give values close to 1.07 and 1.18 for this oxygen, reflecting the occurrence of a \u03bc2-hydroxo group bridging the uranyl cations. Two other oxygen atoms (O9 and O11) belong to the carboxylate groups of the two different phthalate linkers, with U-O distances ranging from up to 2.364(4) and 2.382(8) \u00c5. The last oxygen (O15) is in the terminal position of the equatorial plane (U1-O15 = 2.439(8) and 2.438(4) \u00c5 for 2 and 3, respectively) and is assigned to an aquo species (bond valence of 0.47). It results in a coordination surrounding for uranium (UO2)O2(\u03bc2-OH)2(H2O) corresponding to a dimeric block (UO2)2O4(\u03bc2-OH)2(H2O)2. The distances between the uranium centers are 3.8534(7) and 3.8662(3) \u00c5 (for 2 and 3, respectively) within the dimer. The existence of such a dinuclear unit with 7-fold coordination sharing a hydroxo edge is not so common for uranium, although there are more examples with uranyl in an 8-fold surrounding. Previous works report such a dimer in an uranyl formate or uranyl mixed formate-oxalate, for instance. The second building unit is tetranuclear (Figure ), containing two independent crystallographical uranium sites and lying on another inversion center (1/2 1/2 1/2, 1 h). It consists of two uranium cations in 8-fold coordination (U2) with a hexagonal bipyramid environment and two uranium cations in 7-fold coordination (U3) with a pentagonal bipyramid polyhedron.

In the 8-fold coordination, four of the oxygen atoms of the hexagonal equatorial plane belong to carboxylate groups (U-O = 2.561(7)-2.656(7) \u00c5 and 2.555(3)-2.660(3) \u00c5 for 2 and 3, respectively) and the last remaining oxygen atoms are oxo groups, which are also bonded to a third uranium atom (U-O = 2.214(7)-2.258(7) \u00c5 and 2.220(4)-2.260(3) \u00c5 for 2 and 3, respectively).

The U2-centered polyhedra share a common oxo edge to each other, which also share a common oxo edge to the U3-centered polyhedra, forming the tetranuclear unit (UO2)4(\u03bc3-O)2O12. Two distinct uranium-uranium distances are observed within this tetramer (U2\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5U2 = 3.7135(6) and 3.7228(3) \u00c5, and U2\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5U3 = 3.9659(5) and 3.9691(3) \u00c5, for 2 and 3, respectively).
