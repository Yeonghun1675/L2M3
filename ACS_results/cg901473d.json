TGA-DTA analyses were performed in air at a heating rate of either 10 K/min (298 to 1173 K) or 1 K/min (298 to 423 K) using an Universal V2.5H TA Instruments. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded on a Siemens D5000 counter diffractometer working with a K\u03b1 radiation at 293 K. CHN analyses were performed at the University College London (UK). Melting points were determined with an oil bath 3937-S Buchi device. SEM coupled with EDX were performed with a Gemini Digital Scanning Microscope 982 with 1 kV accelerating voltage using an aluminum sample holder. For EDX measurements samples were coated with a thickness of 25 nm of gold to make it conductive using 208 HR Cressington Sputter coater. The gas adsorption study for C1 was carried out on a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 porosimeter. Prior to analyses and in order to remove eventual surface adsorbed/coated DMF after synthesis, fresh crystals of C1 were soaked in water and filtered under a vacuum. Samples of 60-100 mg were then outgassed under a vacuum at 150 \u00b0C or at room temperature. Both N2(g) and H2(g) adsorption-desorption isotherms were recorded at 77 K in a relative pressure range from 0.0010 to 0.995 (with respect to N2(g)). The same samples were subjected to Hg porosimetry measurements using a Micromeritics Autopore IV. A penetrometer with an appropriate stem volume was chosen in order to record significant Hg intrusion. Prior to analysis, the sample was evacuated at r.t. and Hg was then forced into the sample under pressure up to 30000 psi (corresponding to a minimum pore size of 6 nm according to the Washburn equation).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 52, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<title>Single Crystal X-ray Analyses</title><p>The X-ray intensity data for <bold>L2</bold> and <bold>C1</bold> were collected at 120 K with a MAR345 image plate using MoK\u03b1 (\u03bb = 0.71069 \u00c5) radiation.
