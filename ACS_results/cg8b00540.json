However, the 1H NMR spectroscopic data provided clear evidence for the formation two different cyclobutane rings. Reduction in intensity of the doublet at 8.86 ppm due to 3F-spy monomer and appearance of the doublet at 8.76 ppm and multiplet at 5.00 ppm are an indication the cyclobutane formation, namely, 1,3-bis(4'-pyridyl)-2,4-bis(3'-fluoro-phenyl)cyclobutane (rctt-3F-ppcb). Furthermore, new peaks observed at 4.06, 3.80, 3.48, and 3.37 ppm appear to indicate the formation of cyclobutane that is possibly less symmetrical and aliphatic due to the shielded chemical shift values compared to the HT dimer peak at 5.00 ppm. As mentioned, the cross-coupling arising from the orthogonal alignment of the olefin bonds of fumarate and 3F-spy leads to the formation of such a heterodimer in the solid state, namely, 1-(4'-pyridyl)-2,3-bis(carboxylic acid)-4-(3'-fluoro benzene)cyclobutane (pfcb). From the time dependent 1H NMR plot of 3 (shown in Figure S20), it was found that the formation of pfcb is concurrent with the homodimer, rctt-3F-ppcb after 2 h of UV irradiation. The percentage of heterodimer pfcb that formed appears to plateau off at 16% after 6 h of irradiation. On the other hand, the homodimer, rctt-3F-ppcb formation reached 20% conversion. The 19F-NMR spectrum of 3F-spy in 3 showed a singlet at -112.65 ppm, while 4 obtained after UV irradiation for 6 h gives three singlet peaks at -112.65, -112.75, -112.84 ppm (Figure S21).
