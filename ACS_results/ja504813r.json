They present a number of features that lead to the following conclusions: (1) CDLs of hydrazones and acylhydrazones have been generated through component exchange reactions implementing different types of catalytic processes involving metal ions, organocatalyst, and strain activation. (2) The CDL of the four acylhydrazones E- 1  A  1  C,  1  A  3  C,  2  A  1  C, and  2  A  3  C undergoes adaptation by orthogonal constitutional response to two external agents: the addition of metallic cation and light irradiation (Schemes  and ). Metalloselection is observed on addition of zinc cations which drive the amplification of Zn( 1  A  3  C)2 by selection of the fittest constituent  1  A  3  C, with simultaneous reorganization increasing the amount of agonist  2  A  1  C and decreasing the amounts of the antagonists  1  A  1  C and  2  A  3  C. Photoselection proceeds by irradiation of the system, leading to photoisomerization of E- 1  A  1  C into Z- 1  A  1  C with amplification of the latter, up-regulation of  2  A  3  C and down-regulation of  1  A  3  C and  2  A  1  C. (3) The adaptation processes are reversible via the intermediate restoration of the full library. (4) This CDL forms a square CDN that displays network switching as it undergoes orthogonal adaptation in response to metallo- and photoselection. (5) The overall distribution of constituents within a CDN and its regulation may be considered as an information storage and processing system depending on and characteristic of the agent(s) acting on it. The information can be erased via the reversibility of the process. Moreover, one may note that, on removal of the effector/stimulus, the system enters an out-of-equilibrium state where it keeps memory of the encoded information, thus ensuring fast recall on renewed presentation of the agent.
