In addition, complexation of 4-6 with the Ag+ ion was again confirmed by high-resolution ESI-MS or MALDI-TOF measurements with a base peak or peak at m/z 1091.4313, 1107.3245, and 1323.5214 corresponding to [4 + Ag]+, [5 + Ag]+, and [6 + Ag]+, respectively. These results further suggested that the Ag+ ion is bound to the ether ligands at the lower rim of calix[4]crown-4s. Although the high-resolution ESI-MS measurements indicate a 1:1 binding stoichiometry in all cases, we were unable to confirm the 1:1 binding stoichiometry of 1a\u22c5AgCF3COO and 1b\u22c5AgCF3COO complexes in solution by the Job plots based on the change of chemical shift of 1H NMR data, which show an asymmetric graph deviating from a 1:1 binding stoichiometry (see the Supporting Information). The discrepancy could arise from the change in chemical shift induced by conformational change of calix[4]crown-4s upon Ag+ ion binding, in addition to complexation-induced chemical shift. The binding constants of 1a\u22c5Ag+, 1b\u22c5Ag+, 1c\u22c5Ag+, and 1d\u22c5Ag+ complexes were estimated to be 91, 91, 47, and 30 M-1, respectively, which were determined by the nonlinear curve fitting analysis with data obtained from 1H NMR titrations in CDCl3:CD3COCD3 (10:1), indicating that the binding interaction is not very strong. Even though potassium ion does not form a complex with calix[4]crown-4 as revealed from the 1H NMR titration study, reversibility of this assembling process can easily be achieved by stirring the complex with KI at ambient temperature in which the complexation-induced chemical shifts disappear in the 1H NMR spectrum upon addition of KI.
