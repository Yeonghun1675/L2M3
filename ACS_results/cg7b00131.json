By fitting the linear plot to the Stern-Vo\u0308lmer equation at lower concentrations of TNP, K SV was calculated as 1.36 \u00d7 104 M-1, with the detection limit being calculated as low as 0.49 \u03bcM, approximately 110 ppb. The very low detection limit makes MOF-2 a good candidate as a chemosensor to detect the existence of trace TNP in water. Moreover, with using a hand-held UV lamp (\u03bbmax = 365 nm), the TNP induced fluorescence quenching of MOF-2 can be easily distinguished by the naked eye (), demonstrating the applicability of MOF-2 for real-time detection of TNP. As shown in a and S17, in the SV plot the nonlinear feature at higher concentration of TNP indicates the simultaneous attendance of both static and dynamic quenching mechanisms in sensing. To explore the mechanism, time-resolved fluorescence quenching experiments were performed by monitoring the fluorescence decays of MOF-2 before and after addition of TNP and other nitro explosives. The decay profiles showing only slight changes in the lifetime values (Table S4) were recorded for all selected analytes, of which the mean lifetime of excited state was found to be 2.09 ns without TNP and 1.85 ns with TNP (400 \u03bcL), respectively.
