The reaction mixture was worked up with water, followed by the addition of DCM. The organic layer was washed with a brine solution and collected. It was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and purified by column chromatography with silica gel (60-120 mesh size) using a 1% MeOH/DCM mixture as the eluent. Yield: 90 \u00b1 5% (50 \u00b1 5 mg). The complex was crystallized by layering hexane over a solution in DCM. The crystal data are given below.\n\nDEsC\n\nParaformaldehyde (0.1 g, 3.3 mmol) and N-methylglycine (0.11g, 1.32 mmol) were taken in a 25 mL two-neck round-bottomed flask equipped with a condenser attached with a Schlenk line. A total of 5 mL of dry THF was added and refluxed for 20 min until an off-white suspension appeared because of the in situ generation of imine. A solution of DEsP (0.2 g, 0.33 mmol) in 10 mL of dry THF was added to the previous reaction mixture and refluxed for 24 h with constant monitoring by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). After a period of 5 h, the same amounts of paraformaldehyde and sarcosine were added until ~30% conversion to the desired chlorin had taken place. THF was removed under reduced pressure. Chlorin was separated by column chromatography with silica gel (60-120 mesh size). First, DEsP was eluted with 90% DCM/hexane and chlorin with 2% MeOH/DCM as a greenish-purple oily solid, which was further purified by crashing out with pentane from a solution in MeOH. Yield: 40 \u00b1 2% (87 \u00b1 3 mg).\n\nFeDEsC\n\nTo a solution of DEsC (50 mg, 0.075 mmol) in 15 mL of dry degassed THF was added 2,4,6-collidine (20 \u03bcL, 0.15 mmol) in a Schlenk flask equipped with a stopper, and the solution was stirred for 10 min in a glovebox. FeBr2 (64 mg, 0.3 mmol) was added, and the flask was brought outside of the glovebox and refluxed for 3 h on the Schlenk line. After cooling to room temperature, THF was evaporated in a rotary evaporator and worked up with DCM. The organic layer was washed with a brine solution and collected. It was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and purified by column chromatography with silica gel (60-120 mesh size) using 4% MeOH/DCM mixture as the eluent. Yield: 87 \u00b1 2% (42 \u00b1 2 mg).\n\nZnDEsC\n\nTo a solution of DEsC (50 mg, 0.075 mmol) in THF was added Zn(OAc)2\u22c52H2O (82.1 mg, 0.37 mmol), and the solution was stirred for 5 h at room temperature. THF was removed under reduced pressure and purified by column chromatography with silica gel (60-120 mesh size) using a 4% MeOH/DCM mixture as the eluent. Yield: 95 \u00b1 2% (45 \u00b1 2 mg).\n\nTPC\n\nParaformaldehyde (0.1 g, 3.3 mmol) and N-methylglycine (0.11g, 1.32 mmol) were taken in a round-bottomed flask equipped with a Dean-Stark apparatus, attached with the Schlenk line. A total of 60 mL of dry toluene was added and refluxed for 20 min until an off-white suspension appeared, indicating in situ generation of the Schiff base. Solid TPP (0.2 g, 0.33 mmol) was added to the previous reaction mixture and refluxed for 72 h with constant monitoring by TLC. After a period of 5 h, the same amounts of paraformaldehyde and sarcosine were added until ~50% conversion to the desired chlorin had taken place. Toluene was removed in vacuo and chlorin separated by column chromatography with silica gel (100-200 mesh size). First. the unreacted TPP was eluted with DCM and TPC with some other impurities with 1% MeOH/DCM as a greenish-purple oily residue. It was then dissolved in THF, and 50 mg of Zn(OAc)2\u22c52H2O was added and stirred overnight. THF was removed in vacuo and ZnTPC separated by column chromatography with basic alumina. ZnTPC was eluted with 2% MeOH/DCM as a greenish-purple solid. Acidic workup with dilute HCl removed zinc from the cavity. The organic layer was dried over activated MgSO4, filtered, and evaporated to obtain a greenish-purple solid, which was immediately stored in a glovebox. Yield: 4-5% (10 \u00b1 1 mg).\n\nFeTPC\n\nTo a solution of TPC (10 mg, 0.015 mmol) in 5 mL of dry degassed THF was added 2,4,6-collidine (5 \u03bcL, 0.03 mmol) in a Schlenk flask equipped with a stopper, and the solution was stirred for 10 min in a glovebox. FeBr2 (13 mg, 0.6 mmol) was added, and the flask was brought outside the glovebox and refluxed for 3 h on the Schlenk line. After cooling to room temperature, THF was removed in vacuo and worked up with DCM. The organic layer was washed with a brine solution and collected. It was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and purified by column chromatography with silica gel (60-120 mesh size) using a 2% MeOH/DCM mixture as the eluent. After solvent evaporation, it was a purple-greenish oily residue that could not be solidified by crashing out with any binary or ternary solvent mixture with a wide range of polarities.
