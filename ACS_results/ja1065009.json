In many cases, such open structures do not have permanent porosity because collapse occurs upon removal of solvent guest molecules. Gratifyingly, the MCPs prepared by the copolymerization technique have high stability before and after evacuation. For example, upon discovery, UMCM-2 was the highest surface area MCP, with a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Langmuir surface area of 5200 and 6060 m2/g, respectively. Recently, this record was exceeded by a material prepared through the same strategy with a different linker length ratio (L d/L t = 1.03). In addition, UMCM-1 and UMCM-2 have very high N2 saturation uptake (UMCM-1: 1500 cm3/g; UMCM-2: 1490 cm3/g).
