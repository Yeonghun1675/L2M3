The 6-c nodes and 3-c nodes in the moo topology are achieved here by Fe/Sc/Al-SBU and Cu-SBU, respectively. The Fe/Sc/Al-SBU is formed by coordinating carboxylate in H2PyC with Fe3O/Sc3O/Al3O, while the Cu SBU is identical to that in MOF-818 (A). This allows us to simulate the crystal structure of MOF-919, where the large cage yys and liu polyhedra are present. The formula of MOF-919 is supposed to be [M3(\u03bc3-O)(OH)3][Cu3(\u03bc3-O)(\u03bc-PyC)3(H2O)6]2 (M = Sc, Al, and Fe) based on the charge balance and previous reports. Each yys cage is formed by linking 20 supertetrahedra (E), where the supertetrahedron is constructed by four Fe/Sc/Al-SBUs and four Cu-SBUs (B). Each liu cage is formed by linking 28 supertetrahedra (H). Within the yys and liu cages, both Cu-SBUs and Fe/Sc/Al-SBUs function as the vertices to give a total number of 50 and 70, respectively. All 30 Fe/Sc/Al-SBUs correspond to 2-c vertices in the polyhedra and 20 Cu-SBUs function as 3-c vertices in the yys cage, while 42 Fe/Sc/Al-SBUs and 28 Cu-SBUs in the liu cage act as 2-c and 3-c vertices, respectively (F and I). The size of yys and liu cages and accurate angles at both types of vertices are given by the crystal structure of MOF-919 (Table S8, SI). The face symbol of the yys cage is [1012], where 12 10-member rings are present. The face symbol of the liu cage is [1012.124], where 12 10-membered rings and four 12-membered rings are present (). The observed singular octahedra morphology of the crystals confirmed the phase purity of MOF-919, with an average particle size of 4 \u03bcm (Figure S20, SI). The sharp peaks in the PXRD patterns obtained before and after activation indicate the high crystallinity of MOF-919 (H, S8, S9, and S12 to S14, SI). MOF-919 can be formed by linking Cu-SBUs with Fe-SBUs, Al-SBUs, and Sc-SBUs, to generate three iso-reticular structures, MOF-919-Fe, MOF-919-Al, and MOF-919-Sc, respectively. The PXRD pattern of MOF-919-Sc collected at the synchrotron X-ray source exhibits interpretable diffractions beyond q = 1.76 \u00c5-1 (H and S15, SI). Rietveld refinement of the PXRD profile leads to the resolution of MOF-919-Sc, where the intensity and position of most diffraction peaks match well with those calculated on the basis of simulated structure with the space group of Fd3\u0305m. A relatively high residue, however, was generated (R wp = 23.2%). One reason is the huge number of atoms (116000) in the large cubic unit cell [a = 116.6990(0) \u00c5] and the large pore volume, where the influence of solvent molecules is not negligible. Another reason is the extremely low q values of the first few peaks (111, 220, 311, etc.), making the geometry and optics of the diffractometer critical for the collection of low -q peaks with accurate intensities. The optics of the synchrotron beamline designed for wide-angle X-ray diffraction is no longer suitable to give an accurate peak intensity at low q. This is reflected in the obvious deviation of the low-q peak intensity in comparison to that of the high-angle peak in the Rietveld refinement of the synchrotron PXRD data here. In light of this, we collected the 2D-SAXS patterns of the same sample to access accurate intensities of the low-q peaks. Rietveld refinement of the SAXS pattern showed less deviation from the simulated pattern, especially at the low-q region, and a smaller residue was achieved, R wp = 19.4%, even with a limited number of independent diffractions (E,F and S18, SI).
