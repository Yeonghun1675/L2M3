For complex 2, the solvent molecules are highly disordered which were subtracted from the reflection data by the SQUEEZE method as implanted in PLATON program. The exact determination of solvent molecules in 2 was obtained from the TGA curves and elemental analysis (EA) results, which corroborates the presence of three lattice water molecules per formula unit of 2. Moreover, the coordinated water molecule (O4W) in 5 was also disorder, which was refined without fixing H atoms on it. All calculations were carried out using SHELXS 97, SHELXL 97, PLATON v1.15, ORTEP-3v2, WinGX system Ver-1.80, and TOPOS.

As a result the dehydrated framework of 2 shows a type-II () surface adsorption for N2 with a very low uptake. This is possibly due to the blocking of the windows of unidirectional pore channels through the adsorption of larger sized N2 molecules (kinetic diameter = 3.6 \u00c5). Interestingly, it shows selective CO2 uptake over N2 ( and S23) up to a value of 31 cc/g at 195 K and 1 bar pressure with a moderately large hysteresis in between the adsorption-desorption curve. This hysteresis can be attributed to the strong adsorbate-adsorbent interaction and slow kinetics of adsorption. The CO2 uptake of dehydrated 2 can be commensurate with the interaction of quadrupolar CO2 with the electron-rich azo (-N\ue5fbN-) moiety and uncoordinated polar -NO2 group additively or individually. Dehydrated framework of 2 also shows 11 cc/g and 5 cc/g for CO2 adsorption at 273 K and room temperature (i.e., at 298 K) respectively (Figure S24) with a moderate hysteresis in between the adsorption and desorption curve corroborating the strong adsorbate-adsorbent interaction. Using Clausius-Clapeyron equation on the CO2 adsorption data of 2 measured at 273 and 298 K, the isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption (Q st) at zero loading has been calculated, which is ~36 kJ/mol (Figure S25); the value reduces with the uploading of adsorbate suggesting the filling of their maximum affinity sites. The value of isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption (Q st) of 2 is comparable to the other MOFs reported in the literature at the same condition. The dehydrated framework of 3 exhibits type-V selective CO2 adsorption over N2 ( and S26). In the dehydrated framework of 3, unidirectional guest water filled channels (Figure S22) exist only along the b-axis. As discussed before, it is quite obvious to show nearly nonporosity on N2 adsorption due to its larger size (kinetic diameter = 3.6 \u00c5) compared to CO2 gas molecules (kinetic diameter = 3.3 \u00c5) possibly due to the blocking of unidirectional channels by incoming N2 molecules. But the dehydrated 3 shows very appreciable uptake of CO2 at 195 K with type-V adsorption profile. It has been observed that no considerable uptake occurs up to 0.36 bar; after that a sharp uptake up to 119 cc/g at 1 bar pressure. This gate-opening phenomena in CO2 adsorption profile of 3 at P = 0.36 bar which may be corroborated to the expansion of flexible wavy 2D sheets present in 3. The adsorption profile generates a reversible incomplete desorption branch with a large hysteresis which can be ascribed to the similar adsorbate-adsorbent interaction mentioned earlier. This highly selective CO2 adsorption for 3 can be explained in terms of strong interaction in between Lewis acidic C atom of quadrupolar CO2 molecule and Lewis basic polar azo (-N\ue5fbN-) moiety of azbpy ligand and uncoordinated polar -NO2 groups. Though the -NO2 groups and -N\ue5fbN- moieties are pore oriented in both the dehydrated frameworks of 2 and 3, the larger pore size of 3 (10.8 \u00d7 3.8 \u00c52) in comparison to 2 (6 \u00d7 3 \u00c52) can be attributed simply for the higher uptake capacity of CO2 for 3. At 273 K and room temperature (i.e., at 298 K), the dehydrated framework of 3 exhibits 13 cc/g and 4 cc/g for CO2 adsorption respectively (Figure S27).

Finally, the interdigitated framework of 4 exhibits a negligible amount of surface adsorption for N2 and ~14 cc/g for CO2 at 195 K up to 1 bar pressure due to its nonporous nature ( and S29). A small hysteresis was observed in between the adsorption and desorption profile of CO2 due to the interaction of quadrupolar CO2 with an azo-functionalized framework.

It has been noticed that all the complexes exhibit completely different intriguing architectures of diverse dimensionality and topology along with their different functionality which are originated by changing the transition metal ions. The steric effect of the -NO2 group exerts an effect on the versatile coordination modes of NO2-bdc2- coligand, which might have facilitated the formation of diverse structures with different topology. Regarding the functionality, porous compounds 2 and 3 show their significant CO2 adsorption over N2 selectively along with H2O over EtOH which has been explored in the light of their framework structure. The appreciable amount of CO2 uptake by both 2 and 3 occurred probably due to the strong interaction between the electron-rich Lewis basic azo (-N\ue5fbN-) moiety of azbpy ligand and uncoordinated polar -NO2 groups with the Lewis acidic CO2 molecule which has a quadruple moment. In compound 3, the water uptake capacity after P/P 0 = 0.12 is sharply increased indicating the presence of open metal sites in the dehydrated framework of 3. Compound 4 shows lower although selective uptake capacity for CO2 over N2, due to its lower solvent accessible void.

The structure analysis indicates the formation of a wavy 1D ladder constructed by NO2-bdc2- and azbpy linker with Zn(II) ion. The asymmetric unit of 1 contains one Zn(II) ion, one azbpy, one NO2-bdc2-, and one coordinated water molecule. The penta coordinated Zn(II) centers form a distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry with ZnO4N coordination environment (a and S6).

Compound 1 shows a weight loss of 3.72% (calcd, 3.78%) at 125 \u00b0C for one coordinated water molecule, which starts to release at 105 \u00b0C (Figure S20). Then the dehydrated framework of 1 is stable up to 250 \u00b0C without any further weight loss; after that it collapses into an unidentified product upon further heating. For 2, the weight loss has been observed of 10.75% (calcd. 10.53%) at 113 \u00b0C, which corroborates with the loss of three lattice water molecules that begin to be lost at 87 \u00b0C (Figure S20). After complete removal of all guest water molecules the dehydrated framework is stable up to 270 \u00b0C and finally collapses into an unidentified product upon further heating. The TGA plot of compound 3 (Figure S20) shows a two step weight loss where the first step indicates the loss of two lattice water molecules at 101 \u00b0C (found, 6.77%; calcd, 6.43%) and the second step for strongly bounded one coordinated water molecule (found, 3.11%; calcd, 3.43%) at 140 \u00b0C. The dehydrated framework is stable up to 315 \u00b0C without any further weight loss; after that it collapses into an unidentified product on further heating. In complex 4, the TGA curve shows no significant weight loss up to 350 \u00b0C due to the absence of any solvent molecules, finally leading to the formation of unidentified products on further heating (Figure S20) after 350 \u00b0C. Finally, compound 5 shows a weight loss of 9.9% (calcd, 9.97%), within the temperature range of 150-200 \u00b0C, which is attributed to the release of five coordinated water molecules, and the dehydrated framework is stable up to 370 \u00b0C without any weight loss, which finally collapses into an unidentified product during further heating above 370 \u00b0C (Figure S20).\n\nFrom the space filling model of compound 2 (Figure S21), it is observed that it contains the guest water filled 1D channels only along the c-axis, not in the other direction. As a result the dehydrated framework of 2 shows a type-II () surface adsorption for N2 with a very low uptake. This is possibly due to the blocking of the windows of unidirectional pore channels through the adsorption of larger sized N2 molecules (kinetic diameter = 3.6 \u00c5). Interestingly, it shows selective CO2 uptake over N2 ( and S23) up to a value of 31 cc/g at 195 K and 1 bar pressure with a moderately large hysteresis in between the adsorption-desorption curve. This hysteresis can be attributed to the strong adsorbate-adsorbent interaction and slow kinetics of adsorption. The CO2 uptake of dehydrated 2 can be commensurate with the interaction of quadrupolar CO2 with the electron-rich azo (-N\ue5fbN-) moiety and uncoordinated polar -NO2 group additively or individually. Dehydrated framework of 2 also shows 11 cc/g and 5 cc/g for CO2 adsorption at 273 K and room temperature (i.e., at 298 K) respectively (Figure S24) with a moderate hysteresis in between the adsorption and desorption curve corroborating the strong adsorbate-adsorbent interaction. Using Clausius-Clapeyron equation on the CO2 adsorption data of 2 measured at 273 and 298 K, the isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption (Q st) at zero loading has been calculated, which is ~36 kJ/mol (Figure S25); the value reduces with the uploading of adsorbate suggesting the filling of their maximum affinity sites. The value of isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption (Q st) of 2 is comparable to the other MOFs reported in the literature at the same condition. The dehydrated framework of 3 exhibits type-V selective CO2 adsorption over N2 ( and S26). In the dehydrated framework of 3, unidirectional guest water filled channels (Figure S22) exist only along the b-axis. As discussed before, it is quite obvious to show nearly nonporosity on N2 adsorption due to its larger size (kinetic diameter = 3.6 \u00c5) compared to CO2 gas molecules (kinetic diameter = 3.3 \u00c5) possibly due to the blocking of unidirectional channels by incoming N2 molecules. But the dehydrated 3 shows very appreciable uptake of CO2 at 195 K with type-V adsorption profile. It has been observed that no considerable uptake occurs up to 0.36 bar; after that a sharp uptake up to 119 cc/g at 1 bar pressure. This gate-opening phenomena in CO2 adsorption profile of 3 at P = 0.36 bar which may be corroborated to the expansion of flexible wavy 2D sheets present in 3. The adsorption profile generates a reversible incomplete desorption branch with a large hysteresis which can be ascribed to the similar adsorbate-adsorbent interaction mentioned earlier. This highly selective CO2 adsorption for 3 can be explained in terms of strong interaction in between Lewis acidic C atom of quadrupolar CO2 molecule and Lewis basic polar azo (-N\ue5fbN-) moiety of azbpy ligand and uncoordinated polar -NO2 groups. Though the -NO2 groups and -N\ue5fbN- moieties are pore oriented in both the dehydrated frameworks of 2 and 3, the larger pore size of 3 (10.8 \u00d7 3.8 \u00c52) in comparison to 2 (6 \u00d7 3 \u00c52) can be attributed simply for the higher uptake capacity of CO2 for 3. At 273 K and room temperature (i.e., at 298 K), the dehydrated framework of 3 exhibits 13 cc/g and 4 cc/g for CO2 adsorption respectively (Figure S27). Like 2 using Clausius-Clapeyron equation the isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption for 3 has been calculated which (Q st) is 36 kJ/mol (Figure S28) and behaves similarly like 2 discussed above. For 3 the Q st value of CO2 adsorption is also comparable to the other reported MOFs at the same condition. Finally, the interdigitated framework of 4 exhibits a negligible amount of surface adsorption for N2 and ~14 cc/g for CO2 at 195 K up to 1 bar pressure due to its nonporous nature ( and S29). A small hysteresis was observed in between the adsorption and desorption profile of CO2 due to the interaction of quadrupolar CO2 with an azo-functionalized framework. Like 2 and 3, it contains the void spaces in the 2D sheet but may be compensated due to the presence of additional mono coordinated azbpy ligand into the pore and mutual interwovening of two 2D sheets. The dehydrated framework of 4 exhibits the CO2 adsorption capacity up to 8 cc/g and 1.4 cc/g at 273 and 298 K (Figure S30) respectively with a moderate hysteresis corroborating the adsorbate-adsorbent interaction. Like 2 and 3, the calculation of isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption (Q st) for the dehydrated framework of 4 at zero coverage shows 47 kJ/mol (Figure S31) signifying moderately high CO2 interaction with the polar framework of 4, which gradually decreases with uploading of adsorbents due to the similar reason discussed above.
