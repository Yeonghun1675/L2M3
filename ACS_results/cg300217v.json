The \u03c7T product has a value of 14.0 cm3 K mol-1 at 300 K, in agreement with the expected value for three noninteracting Mn(II) ions with g = 2.1 and S = 5/2. With lowering of temperature, the \u03c7T product decreases slightly, until a sharp decrease is observed below 100 K. The value reaches to 4.2 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K, as expected for a ground state spin of S = 5/2. The coupling between metal centers is weakly antiferromagnetic, as expected for Mn(II) ions bridged by carboxylate ligands. The experimental susceptibility data can be modeled using the Kambe or equivalent operator approach. The spin Hamiltonian of eq  can be analytically solved to find the eigen-values of each spin level, which can in-turn be used to write a Van Vleck equation (eq ) to model the magnetic susceptibility data.

N2 and H2 did not diffuse into the pores of 1 even at 77 K and showed only surface adsorption (2.5 cm3 g-1 for N2 and 7.5 cm3 g-1 for H2 at P/Po = 1). Although the channel size (~6 \u00c52) is large enough compared to the kinetic diameter of N2 and H2 (2.9 and 3.6 \u00c5, respectively), this may be attributed to the 1D channel systems running along crystallographic c axis (Figure ) in all the frameworks, and there are no additional effective channels along the a or b axis. Therefore, at very low temperatures (77 K), N2 or H2 molecules probably interact strongly with pore aperture and block other molecules to pass through, and resulting only in surface adsorption.\n\nHowever, CO2 adsorption experiment for 1 showed typical type I adsorption isotherm at 195, 273, and 298 K confirming the microporous nature of 1.
