Intermolecular \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking in these complexes dominates supramolecular assembly, and distinct modes can be tuned by altering the electron-richness or -deficiency of the aromatic moiety. This affords a rationale for the frequent occurrence of \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction in silver aryl-ethynide and related complexes, thereby pointing the way to future designs of multidimensional metal-organic frameworks with this weak intermolecular interaction.
