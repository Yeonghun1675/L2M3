A total of 5 mg of compound Cd-EDDA was dispersed in 10 mL of a Hg2+ solution with a concentration of 0.3 mM. After immersion for 5 min and 5 h, respectively, the concentrations of Cd2+ and Hg2+ in the filtrate solution were introduced for ICP determination. The Cd2+ concentration in the filtrate solution dramatically increased from 2.67 \u03bcM (5 min) to 11.9 \u03bcM (5 h); however, the added Hg2+ concentration remained nearly unchanged as the immersing time increased (Table S2 in the SI). There is no doubt that the Cd2+ cations are leached from Cd-EDDA. Further, powder XRD of the residues of mixed suspensions of Cd-EDDA and Hg2+ was employed to monitor the structure changes during Hg2+ solution treatment.
