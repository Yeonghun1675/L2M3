Similarity in the indexed cell parameters of 1'\u22830.75MeOH and 1'\u22830.75H2O with 1' also supports this observation (see the ). This suggests that the open channels in the shrunken state 1' are accessible to small molecules like H2O and MeOH but not to the larger EtOH molecule. However, after completion of the second step in the MeOH adsorption profile, the PXRD pattern of 1'\u22834.0MeOH (point D) is almost similar to that of the as-synthesized compound 1, suggesting structural transformation upon MeOH inclusion. The difference in the indexed cell parameters of 1'\u22834.0MeOH [a = 12.5063(20) \u00c5, b = 14.8556(26) \u00c5, c = 15.0106(24) \u00c5, and V = 2788.78(80) \u00c53] and 1'\u22830.75MeOH also supports the structural transformation. Increases in the a and b parameters and unit cell volume compared to 1' are indicative of a structural expansion upon MeOH inclusion. The PXRD patterns recorded at intermediate points in the second step during MeOH adsorption clearly indicate that structural transformation commences at or near point B and completes at point C. On the other hand, the PXRD pattern of 1'\u22832.75H2O is not similar to that of 1' or 1 and the indexed cell parameter of 1'\u22832.75H2O [a = 10.9444(81) \u00c5, b = 13.1747(68) \u00c5, c = 15.5292(78) \u00c5, and V = 2239.15 \u00c53 (see the )] but rather suggests structural contraction upon H2O adsorption. This indicates that, although H2O and MeOH adsorption profiles show double-step profiles, the mechanisms of adsorption are different. It is worth mentioning that the PXRD patterns of 1'\u22832.75H2O and 1'\u22834.0MeOH are not similar, and this is further supported by different indexed cell parameters from the PXRD patterns. These results suggest that 1' adsorbs H2O molecules, maintaining a narrow pore; in contrast, MeOH molecules open the pore. Framework contraction upon H2O adsorption is probably because of its strong coordinating ability toward the unsaturated NiII center and hydrogen-bonding interaction between the framework and adsorbed H2O molecules in the pore. The higher uptake in the case of MeOH adsorption can be rationalized by taking into consideration both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interaction through -CH3 and -OH groups, respectively, with the framework. Because larger EtOH molecules hardly penetrate into the narrow pore, an initial uptake is not observed in the isotherm of 1', only exhibiting single-step gate-opening behavior.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 9, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Vapor adsorption isotherms of <bold>1\u2032</bold>: (a) H<sub>2</sub>O and EtOH at 298 K; (b) MeOH at 293 K. <italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>\n<sub>0</sub> is the saturated vapor pressure of the adsorbates at respective temperatures.
