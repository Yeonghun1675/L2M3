Finally, the product was washed with deionized water, until no Br- ions could be detected in the filtrate (elem anal. found: C, 28.10; H, 4.16; N, 4.15. Calcd: C, 28.09; H, 3.93; N, 4.10).\n\nFe-MIL-101_NH2, Fe3O(solv)3Cl(NH2-BDC)3\u22c5msolv\u22c5nguest (solv = H2O, DMF; guest = NH2-H2BDC, HCl)\n\nFe3O(solv)3Cl(NH2-BDC)3\u22c5msolv\u22c5nguest (solv = H2O, DMF; guest = NH2-H2BDC, HCl) is typically synthesized from a mixture of 0.225 g (1.242 mmol) of NH2-H2BDC in 7.5 mL of DMF with a solution of 0.675 g (2.497 mmol) of FeCl3\u22c56H2O in 7.5 mL of DMF. After thermal treatment in a stainless steel autoclave (30 mL total volume) for 24 h at 110 \u00b0C, the reaction product is recovered by filtration, washed with DMF, and then dried at ambient conditions (0.93 g Fe-MIL-101_NH2; the yield could not be determined due to the large amount of solvents in the highly porous structure). The formation of the MIL-101 structure is confirmed by excellent agreement of the experimental X-ray powder pattern with the theoretical powder pattern of Cr-MIL-101 (Figure ). EDX analyses of different samples of Fe-MIL-101_NH2 show varying molar ratios of Fe/Cl higher than 1/3, indicating different degrees of protonation of the amino groups. This is due to sample preparation (molar ratios) and the workup procedure. The IR spectrum shows no band due to the presence of free NH2-H2BDC molecules in the pores (Figure S3, ).", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "Fe-MIL-53_NH2, Fe(OH)NH2-BDC\u22c50.3NH2-H2BDC", "symbol": "",
