They feature a rare type of water-soluble tetracopper(II) core, capable of efficiently promoting mild and selective hydrocarboxylations of propane and n-butane to the corresponding carboxylic acids. Besides, this work provides a contribution to the sweeping area of crystal engineering, namely, toward the development of aqueous-medium processes and the synthesis of rare water-soluble coordination polymers. Further research toward the exploration of H3bes in the design of metal-organic materials and the search for their diverse applications is currently underway in our group.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 20, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Synthetic procedures, full experimental details, additional structural representations (Figures S1\u2212S9) and bonding parameters (Tables S1\u2212S6) for <bold>1</bold>\u2212<bold>3</bold>, the proposed mechanism for hydrocarboxylation (Scheme S1), and crystallographic files in CIF format.
