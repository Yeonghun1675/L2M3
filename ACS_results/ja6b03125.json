To more accurately evaluate the OER activity of MAF-X27-OH, we fabricated electrodes by growing the MOF crystals directly on Cu foil, hereafter denoted as MAF-X27-OH(Cu), by placing the substrate in the reaction system for synthesizing MAF-X27-Cl, followed by ion exchange treatment. Three electrodes with different morphologies and mass loadings were prepared (), giving much improved OER performances with overpotentials as low as 292 mV at 10 mA cm-2 () and turnover frequency up to 0.019/0.25 s-1 at overpotential of 300/400 mV, being the best values among known catalysts (). Noted that the Faraday efficiency of MAF-X27-OH(Cu) for OER was also measured to be virtually 100% (), confirming that the observed electrochemical data originates from water oxidation rather than other side reactions.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 13, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig4\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<p>LSV curves of MAF-X27-OH,\nMAF-X27-OH\u00ad(Cu) (samples 1\u20133),\nCo\u00ad(OH)<sub>2</sub>, and Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> at pH = 14.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr4\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ja-2016-03125q_0005.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 4  LSV curves of MAF-X27-OH, MAF-X27-OH(Cu) (samples 1-3), Co(OH)2, and Co3O4 at pH = 14.
