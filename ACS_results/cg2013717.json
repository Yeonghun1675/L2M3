Therefore, structure of 1 is described in detail to represent their frameworks. The asymmetric unit of 1 contains two crystallographically independent Yb(III) cations, two Heimda ligands, one formate group, and three coordinated waters, as well as one lattice water molecule. As illustrated in Figure S1a, , the two Heimda ligands have the same coordination mode. They both display the \u03bc3-kN,O:kO,O':kO' mode to connect two Y(III) ions. Both kinds of the Y(III) ions are octacoordinated, exhibiting a slightly distorted square antiprism geometry, but in different coordination environments. The Y(1) ion is coordinated with two imidazolyl nitrogen atoms from Heimda ligands and five carboxylate oxygen atoms of the Heimda ligands with O1N6 donor set, and the coordination sphere of Y(1) ion is completed by another oxygen atom from a terminal water molecule. The Y(2) ion is coordinated to eight oxygen atoms, among which four are from carboxylate groups of Heimda ligands, two are from the formate groups, and the remaining two belong to water molecules. Both carboxylic groups adopt bidentate and monodentate modes (see Scheme a). Each Heimda ligand uses the 4-carboxylate group oxygen and 5-carboxylate group oxygen to chelate Y(2) ion.

These dimers are grafted on to the 1-D infinite ribbon chains along the crystallographic c axis (see Figure a). The dihedral angles between the neighboring imidazole rings of Heimda ligands sharing the common Y(III) ion are 78.55\u00b0 and 14.63\u00b0, respectively. The completely deprotonated H3eimda acts as a pentadentate ligand, and the next Heimda ligand further acts as a linker using the 4-carboxylate oxygen and its symmetric partners, consequently connecting these 1-D chains into a 2-D grid along the a axis, as displayed in Figure b, and the adjacent binuclear units are further linked together by the \u03bc2-O bridge from the 5-carboxylate group to form a parallelogram configuration.

The individual nets are undulated, and it is comparable to the lamellae array of a series of lanthanide complexes based on pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate. The formate groups in 1, meantime, connect the neighboring Y(2) ions in an end to end fashion, resulting in the infinite 1-D {[Y(HCOO)]2+} n  chains (see Scheme b and Figure c), and they are further propagated into a doubled chain network linked by the H3eimda ligand along the c crystal direction, which is similar to many reported compounds with formate as the bridging ligand; thus it is interesting to perform magnetic studies evaluating the eventual exchange interactions between the metal centers.

The formate and Heimda ligands alternately linked the neighboring Y(1) and two Y(2) ions giving rise to a hexametal parallelogram aggregate along the ac plane as shown in Figure S1c, . The adjacent 2-D coordination networks are further interlinked by the Y(2) chains incorporating formate groups via the 5-carboxylate groups from the third Heimda attached the Y(1) ion to fabricate a highly ordered claylike double layer architecture consequently, as demonstrated in Figure b.

Comparing the average Ln-N and Ln-O bond lengths among the polymers 1, 2, and 3 reveals that in the case of 2, the average lengths become a little bit longer than those of 3 and 1 arising from the lanthanide contraction effect. It was also found that within the one-dimensional chain, both the separation of Ln(2)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Ln(2) (bridged by formate) and separation of Ln(1)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Ln(2) (bridged by Heimda) along the c axis display a decreasing trend from 6.998 to 6.902 \u00c5, and from 6.615 to 6.542 \u00c5, respectively, which are also consistent with the lanthanide contraction, as shown in Table  for details.

It should also be pointed out that the formate ligand plays an important role in coordination chemistry, which may adopt versatile three-atom binding modes such as monodentate, chelating, and bridging in the syn-syn, syn-anti, and anti-anti configurations. Interestingly, all of the bridging modes can be comparable to the corresponding ones in azide or thiocyanate compounds. Remarkably, in this case, formate anion serves as a bridging ligand in an end to end fashion as that in 1, linking the adjacent Nd(2) ions to form the 1-D polymeric chain along ab plane, also acting as a barrel brace to enhance the robustness of the 1-D nanotubular networks. Another outstanding feature is that along edge of the hexameric metal-organic crown, the two adjacent Nd(1) ions and another Nd(2) ion were connected by two Hpimda ligands to form a triangle array, as demonstrated in Figure S7, . In this 2-D sheet, the Nd6 and Nd3 rings share their edges giving rise to a network with 3464 topology, so-called interesting Kagome\u0301 lattice arrangement, as displayed in Figure , but these 2-D motifs are arranged in a herringbone pattern and a little inclined. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the rare examples of a lanthanide-organic Kagome\u0301 lattice based on the formate mediator in coordination polymers. A better insight into the nature of the intricate framework of 4 by the application of a topological approach reveals that in the spectacular 2-D layer along the bc plane, each Nd(1) center acts as a 3-connected node to connect three Hpimda and the Hpimda ligand serves as the planar 3-connected node linking three Nd(III) ions while the Nd(2) ion also acts as a 3-connected node connecting one oxalate and two formate ligands, resulting in a 4\u22c582 topology of the layer. Oxalate ions further connect these layers to afford a 3,4-connected binodal 3-D framework with the Schla\u0308fli symbol of (4\u22c562\u22c583)(4\u22c56\u22c58) and vertex symbol of (4\u22c56\u22c56\u22c58\u22c58\u22c5107)(4\u22c56\u22c58), as depicted in Figure S8, .

The photoluminescent properties of 4 are different from those of Nd-Cd-organic frameworks based on imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylate. This is probably attributed to introduction the electron-donating species (propyl groups) and gauche coligand of oxalate, thus facilitating the electron transfer in this case. The luminescence spectra recorded of polymer 4a is similar to the solvated phase of 4; however the intensities of the emission bands for the dehydrated species are significantly enhanced. It is because the coordinated and lattice water molecules were removed from the inner coordination sphere of Nd(III).

The polymers <bold>1</bold>, <bold>2</bold>, and <bold>3</bold> showed similar thermal behavior;\nhere the complex <bold>2</bold> was used as a representative. The\nTG curves indicate that the framework of <bold>1</bold> exhibits an\ninitial mass loss of 8.72% corresponding to the dissociation of the\ntwo lattice and four coordinated water molecules, and the further\nweight loss of <bold>1</bold> begins above 260 \u00b0C, which is attributed\nto the release of the formate groups (calcd. 3.41%). The polymer <bold>1</bold> began to decompose upon further heating and underwent a\nrapid and significant weight loss of 33.2% in the temperature range\nof 450\u2013550 \u00b0C, which corresponds to the destruction of\nthe Heimda organic ligands (calcd. 34.2%). The TG curves of <bold>4</bold> display mainly three steps of weight loss processes. The\nfirst one occurred at ca. 195 \u00b0C with a weight loss of 14.3%,\nwhich corresponds to the release of four lattice water molecules and\nsix coordinated water molecules together in one step, ten water molecules\nper formula, with a calculated value of 13.2%. The second process\nmight include a large range of ca. 310 to 440 \u00b0C. It is attributed\nto the departure of the formate moiety per molecule with a weight\nloss of ca. 4.02%. The third process began from ca. 550 \u00b0C, corresponding\nto decomposition the two Hpimda organic ligands, as well as two oxalates.\nThe residue weight of 44.6% is close to the calculated value, assuming\nthe final product of Nd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.

The first one occurred from\nca. 60 to 350 \u00b0C with a weight loss of 4.61%, which can be attributed\nto the release of minor of waters impurity and one molecule of the\nformate per formula unit, with a calculated value of 4.33% (based\non one formate). The second process might cover a large range from\nca. 410 to 720 \u00b0C, during which the complex underwent a rapid\nand significant weight loss of 50.40% upon further heating, which\ncorresponds to the destruction of the Hpimda ligand as well as two\noxalates in one step. It is nearly in accordance with the calculated\nvalue of 51.42%, based on the single-crystal structure analysis. The\nresidue of 45.43% is close to the calculated 46.62% of the total sample\nmass as shown in Figure S17, .</p><title>Nitrogen Gas Adsorption Studies</title><p>After the guest and\ncoordinated waters are liberated, a microporous polymer <bold>4a</bold> is obtained, which has extended 1-D tunnels and possesses permanent\nmicroporosity, and the permanent microporosity is further confirmed\nby the nitrogen gas adsorption isotherm.

The Horvath\u2013Kawazoe\n(HK) model indicates a pore diameter of ca. 8.7 \u00c5, which is nearly\nconsistent with the crystal X-ray analysis. The adsorption isotherm\nis not saturated, and a higher nitrogen uptake is expected at higher\npressure.

This behavior is indicative\nof the existence of weak ferromagnetic interactions between adjacent\nGd(III) ions.

The polymers 1, 2, and 3 showed similar thermal behavior; here the complex 2 was used as a representative. The TG curves indicate that the framework of 1 exhibits an initial mass loss of 8.72% corresponding to the dissociation of the two lattice and four coordinated water molecules, and the further weight loss of 1 begins above 260 \u00b0C, which is attributed to the release of the formate groups (calcd. 3.41%). The polymer 1 began to decompose upon further heating and underwent a rapid and significant weight loss of 33.2% in the temperature range of 450-550 \u00b0C, which corresponds to the destruction of the Heimda organic ligands (calcd. 34.2%). The TG curves of 4 display mainly three steps of weight loss processes. The first one occurred at ca. 195 \u00b0C with a weight loss of 14.3%, which corresponds to the release of four lattice water molecules and six coordinated water molecules together in one step, ten water molecules per formula, with a calculated value of 13.2%. The second process might include a large range of ca. 310 to 440 \u00b0C. It is attributed to the departure of the formate moiety per molecule with a weight loss of ca. 4.02%. The third process began from ca. 550 \u00b0C, corresponding to decomposition the two Hpimda organic ligands, as well as two oxalates. The residue weight of 44.6% is close to the calculated value, assuming the final product of Nd2O3. For 4a, the weight loss processes were combined into two main steps due to the water molecules being liberated. The first one occurred from ca. 60 to 350 \u00b0C with a weight loss of 4.61%, which can be attributed to the release of minor of waters impurity and one molecule of the formate per formula unit, with a calculated value of 4.33% (based on one formate). The second process might cover a large range from ca. 410 to 720 \u00b0C, during which the complex underwent a rapid and significant weight loss of 50.40% upon further heating, which corresponds to the destruction of the Hpimda ligand as well as two oxalates in one step. It is nearly in accordance with the calculated value of 51.42%, based on the single-crystal structure analysis. The residue of 45.43% is close to the calculated 46.62% of the total sample mass as shown in Figure S17, .\n\nNitrogen Gas Adsorption Studies\n\nAfter the guest and coordinated waters are liberated, a microporous polymer 4a is obtained, which has extended 1-D tunnels and possesses permanent microporosity, and the permanent microporosity is further confirmed by the nitrogen gas adsorption isotherm. The nitrogen adsorption isotherms for the activated sample 4a were measured at 77 K. As illustrated in Figure , type III sorption behavior, which is characteristic of solids with micropores, is observed in the relative pressure range of P/P 0 = 0-1.0. The adsorption isotherm shows a smooth rise at low pressure and a plateau after saturation, then a very slow stepping up at 0.82 P/P 0 region, which is characteristics of microporous adsorbents, and what occurred before 0.85 P/P 0 can be attributed to the process of the nitrogen filling into the micropores. The isotherm goes up steeply above P/P 0 = 0.85 and reaches the high-point with the maximum adsorption of 312 cm3 (STP)/g of N2 at 77 K and 760 Torr, displaying much nitrogen absorbed and some mesopore formed by powder interspaces of the dehydrated material, or may be attributed to N2 condensation on crystallite surface. Fitting the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation to the adsorption isotherm of N2 for 4a gives the estimated BET surface area of 296 m2/g. By use of the Dubinin-Radushkevich equation, the specific pore volume of 4a is estimated to be 0.145 cm3/g (void = 20.2%) calculated with N2 adsorption data in region of 0.1-0.95P 0, which is nearly in aggrement with the V P value calculated from the crystal structure with PLATON. This value is significantly smaller than the corresponding values of the coordination framework based on 8-connected {Co3(OH)} clusters. But it is higher than that of binary lanthanide polymer [Tb2(bdc)3]\u22c54H2O. The Horvath-Kawazoe (HK) model indicates a pore diameter of ca. 8.7 \u00c5, which is nearly consistent with the crystal X-ray analysis. The adsorption isotherm is not saturated, and a higher nitrogen uptake is expected at higher pressure. The profile of adsorption isotherm may be compared with the chromium naphthalene dicarboxylate open framework with giant pore. \n\nMagnetic Properties\n\nThe temperature dependence of the \u03c7M T product and \u03c7M for 2 is illustrated in Figure . At room temperature, the value of and \u03c7M T is ca. 8.77 cm3 mol-1 K, which is somewhat larger than the theoretical value of 7.88 cm3 mol-1 K, the expected value for a free Gd(III) ion with S = 7/2, g = 2.0. Upon cooling, this value gradually increases up to the maximum of 9.04 cm3 mol-1 K until 76 K, whereas below that the \u03c7M T quickly decreases continuously to a value of 7.13 cm3 mol-1 K at 2 K. This behavior is indicative of the existence of weak ferromagnetic interactions between adjacent Gd(III) ions. According to the Gd(III) ion having a 8S7/2 (L = 0) ground-state configuration, which is spherically symmetric and is therefore not susceptible to crystal field effect, and the large Gd\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Gd separation through the carboxyl bridge allows us to consider that the crystal structure of 2 would behave as a uniform chain of Gd(III) ions, bridged by Heimda ligands, from a magnetic point of view (see Figure a). Having this in mind and taking into account the large value of the local interacting spin [S = 7/2], the classical spin expression derived by Fisher to describe the magnetic behavior of a uniform chain with large spins eq  applies for 2. In this expression, u is the Langevin function defined as 1  \u03c7 =   N   g   2     \u03b2   2     3 K T   S  ( S + 1 )   [   1 + u   1 - u   ]    u = coth[JS(S + 1)/(KT)] - KT/[JS(S + 1)] where N, \u03b2, k, and g have their usual meanings and J is the exchange coupling parameter between adjacent spins. We neglect all exchange interactions between nearest-neighbor Gd(III) ions, including that of being connected by formate. The best least-squares fitting parameters are J = +0.038 cm-1, g = 2.02, and R = 1.3 \u00d7 10-5 (R is the agreement factor defined as R = \u2211[(\u03c7M)obs - (\u03c7M)calc]2/\u2211[(\u03c7M)obs]2). Beyond 50 K, the temperature dependence of the reciprocal susceptibilities (1/\u03c7M) obeys the Curie-Weiss law [\u03c7M = C/(T - \u03b8)] above 40 K with \u03b8 = 0.11 K, C = 8.71 cm3 K mol-1, and R = 6.14 \u00d7 10-5. (See Figure S22, ). The \u03b8 value also supports the presence of weak ferromagnetic interaction within the polymer 2. The magnetic behavior in this case is similar to the reported compounds with formate as the bridging ligand. It is found that the reported ferromagnetic gadolinium compounds with bridging carboxylic motifs have J values between 0.024 and 0.080 cm-1, and the Gd-O-Gd angle values are in the region of 114\u00b0 to 119\u00b0, while Gd\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Gd distances are between 3.937 and 6.516 \u00c5.
