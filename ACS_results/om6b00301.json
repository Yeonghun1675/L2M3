This can be explained by the extra steric bulk of the Pn* ligand compared to the nonsubstituted analogue, in particular the steric clash of the methyl group on the WT position, with the bridgehead (BH, C4/C8) carbon on the other pentalene ligand. It is expected this would move the energetic minimum of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to a lower torsion angle. 1  M  (M = Zr, Hf) are formally 20-electron complexes. The two highest energy electrons would therefore be expected to be found in an antibonding orbital; however the previously mentioned DFT study found the HOMO of the Pn2M species to be purely localized on the Pn framework. 1  M  could be expected to have a HOMO of similar makeup to Pn2M, and as such, the slight lengthening in the M-Pn* distances compared to other species reported (vide infra) is attributed to steric factors.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 12, "type": "table", "classification": null, "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Comparison of Calculated and Found\nBond Lengths and Angles<xref rid=\"tbl1-fn1\"></xref>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"4\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">species</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">average\nM\u2013C<sub>BH</sub> (\u00c5)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">average\nfold angle (deg)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">torsion angle (deg)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<bold>1</bold>\n<sub>\n<bold>Zr</bold>\n</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.30(1)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>26.0(11)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>41.6(5)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>(\u03b7<sup>8</sup>-Pn)<sub>2</sub>Zr</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.34</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>27.7</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>50.6</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<bold>1</bold>\n<sub>\n<bold>Hf</bold>\n</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.27(1)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>26.7(11)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>42.8(6)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>(\u03b7<sup>8</sup>-Pn)<sub>2</sub>Hf</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.32</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>28.9</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>49.3</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n<table-wrap-foot>\n<fn id=\"tbl1-fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>C<sub>BH</sub> are the bridgehead\n(BH) carbons, C4 and C8.</p>\n</fn>\n</table-wrap-foot>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 13, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Both <bold>1</bold>\n<sub>\n<bold>Zr</bold>\n</sub> and <bold>1</bold>\n<sub>\n<bold>Hf</bold>\n</sub> exhibit very simple room-temperature <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra\nrevealing two sharp resonances in a 24:12 ratio.\nThis implies that the Pn* ligands can easily oscillate from the torsion\nangle minima, and thus all the non-wingtip (NWT) Me protons are equivalent\nat room temperature. <bold>1</bold>\n<sub>\n<bold>Zr</bold>\n</sub> and <bold>1</bold>\n<sub>\n<bold>Hf</bold>\n</sub> were also characterized by high-resolution\nmass spectrometry revealing signals at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> = 462.1864 (<bold>1</bold>\n<sub>\n<bold>Zr</bold>\n</sub>)\nand 552.2288 (<bold>1</bold>\n<sub>\n<bold>Hf</bold>\n</sub>) and the subsequent\nfragmentation of the loss of Pn* from the molecular ion.</p>", "clean_text": "Both 1  Zr  and 1  Hf  exhibit very simple room-temperature 1H NMR spectra revealing two sharp resonances in a 24:12 ratio.
