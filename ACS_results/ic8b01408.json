The structural characterization of MOF-1  des , based on X-ray crystallography, shows that the removal of DMF molecules results in a phase transition from monoclinic space group P21/c in MOF-1  as  to orthorhombic space group Pcc2 in MOF-1  des  with a pronounced volume overall shrinkage of about 17.9% in orthogonal directions, resulting in a collapsed, nonporous framework (b,d and S9). In particular, phase transition is accommodated by folding up of \"wine-rack\" type array while the tetrahedral coordination geometry of Zn2+ centers and the framework topology remains invariant (Figures S10 and S11). \n\nTo assess the porosity changes associated with the reversible phase transformation, the N2 adsorption isotherm at 77 K of MOF-1  des  was measured and its profile reveals a remarkable adsorption behavior which is different from all six previous reports of isotherm types with a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 437 m2 g-1 within the relative pressure range of 0.05 < P/P 0 < 0.3 (a and S21-S23). During the adsorption, almost negligible adsorption of N2 uptake (1.01 cm3 g-1) at low relative pressures (0.15) can be observed. However, the relative pressure rapidly shifts to relatively low pressure at 8.19 \u00d7 10-4 following a sharp step in the adsorption isotherm, which indicates the \"gate-opening\" phenomenon with the saturation uptake of 145.6 cm3 g-1 (b). The significant hysteresis of the desorption isotherm is markedly different from the adsorption branch. The stepwise adsorption isotherm coupled with an uncommon hysteresis loop can be explained by a dynamic structural phase transformation between np phase and lp phase. Also noteworthy is the fact that the dynamic structural transformations with gas-induced gate-opening behavior are fully reproducible over at least four adsorption-desorption cycles (c). Similarly, consistent with the first, second, third, and fourth adsorption-desorption cycles, a phase transformation also occurs. However, the follwing adsorption step gradually shifts to higher relative pressures, and the maximum uptake of N2 reduces to 116.2, 113.6, and 111.3 cm3 g-1, respectively (c, insert).
