We recollected the crystal data of 1, which revealed that part of 1,2,4-H3btc reacted with piperazine to form the L ligand. After carefully comparing the structure of 1 with the previously reported structure, we found that they were almost the same. The previous data were not good, and therefore the partial occupancy of piperazine was not solved. In this work, with high-quality single crystals and other characterization tools, we were able to decide on the exact structure. Herein, we redescribe the crystal structure of 1. It features a 3D porous network with 1D nanotubular open channels. The asymmetric unit consists of two InIII centers, one \u03bc2-OH group, one btc ligand, 0.4 Hbtc, 0.6 L ligand, and one lattice water molecule, in which the L ligand is derived from 1,2,4-H3btc and piperazine via an in situ ligand reaction (Figure S1). The C13, C14, C15, C16, and C18 atoms of the Hbtc and L ligands are disordered. The ratio between the Hbtc and L ligands was decided by elemental analysis and 1H NMR integral results. The binuclear InIII subunits are connected through \u03bc2-OH groups to form an extended zigzag {In-OH-In} n  chain along the b axis (Figure S2). Furthermore, the four extended infinite chains were connected by the btc and L or Hbtc ligands to form a 1D nanotubular open channel that runs through the crystallographic b axis with a cross section of approximately 16.3 \u00d7 15.5 \u00c52 (a,b).

In order to confirm the in situ formed L ligand, 13C CPMAS NMR spectroscopy of the as-synthesized 1 and H3btc ligand was performed. As shown in Figure S3, the chemical shifts around 170 ppm are ascribed to the carboxylate C atoms and the chemical shifts around 135 ppm are ascribed to the aromatic C atoms.

At the same time, as shown in entries 5-8, 57.2%, 75.7%, 93.9%, and 93.4% yields of PC can be achieved when catalyst 1 with amounts from 26 to 56 \u03bcmol were employed. Therefore, it can be concluded that the amount of the catalyst has an important influence on the yield of PC. In other words, the concentration of the catalytic site determines the catalytic efficiency. A total of 46 \u03bcmol of catalyst afforded a satisfied yield of PC, so this catalyst loading amount was fixed for the following experiments. In addition, CO2 cycloaddition with epoxides substituted with different functional groups has also been tested over 1. With an increase of the molecular sizes of epoxide substrates, the yield of formation of cyclic carbonates just slightly decreased. The yields of butylene carbonate, 3-butoxy-1,2-propylene carbonate, and styrene carbonate were 90.7%, 85.3%, and 73.2%, respectively (, entries 9-11). This could be ascribed to the hindrance effect of the pores in 1 for different epoxides and corresponding products with large sizes, which slows the diffusion of the reactant and results in a decrease of the yield. A control experiment was carried out using InCl3/TBAB as the homogeneous catalyst for conversion of styrene oxide, while a 91.5% yield (TOF 169.4 h-1; , entry 12) of styrene carbonate was achieved under the same conditions. This can further evidence that the reactions took place inside the pores and the hindrance effect of the pores affected the reaction directly.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 22, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch2\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Cycloaddition of CO<sub>2</sub> with Different Epoxides</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr2\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2016-00050d_0008.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 2  Cycloaddition of CO2 with Different Epoxides   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 23, "type": "table", "classification": null, "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Cycloaddition of\nCO<sub>2</sub> and Epoxide Using Different Catalysts under Various\nReaction Conditions<xref rid=\"t1fn1\"></xref>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"fx1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2016-00050d_0010.tif\"></graphic>\n<table-wrap-foot>\n<fn id=\"t1fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>Reaction conditions:\nepoxide, 20 mmol; TBAB, 0.5 mmol; CO<sub>2</sub> pressure, 2 MPa;\nreaction temperature, 80 \u00b0C; reaction time, 4 h.</p>\n</fn>\n<fn id=\"t1fn2\">\n<label>b</label>\n<p>Yields were determined by GC.</p>\n</fn>\n<fn id=\"t1fn3\">\n<label>c</label>\n<p>Moles of yielded cyclic carbonate per\nmole of catalyst per hour.</p>\n</fn>\n</table-wrap-foot>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 24, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>The reaction was also carried out with <bold>1</bold> as catalyst\nat 1 atm CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere and room temperature.

We recollected the crystal data of 1, which revealed that part of 1,2,4-H3btc reacted with piperazine to form the L ligand. After carefully comparing the structure of 1 with the previously reported structure, we found that they were almost the same. The previous data were not good, and therefore the partial occupancy of piperazine was not solved. In this work, with high-quality single crystals and other characterization tools, we were able to decide on the exact structure. Herein, we redescribe the crystal structure of 1. It features a 3D porous network with 1D nanotubular open channels. The asymmetric unit consists of two InIII centers, one \u03bc2-OH group, one btc ligand, 0.4 Hbtc, 0.6 L ligand, and one lattice water molecule, in which the L ligand is derived from 1,2,4-H3btc and piperazine via an in situ ligand reaction (Figure S1). The C13, C14, C15, C16, and C18 atoms of the Hbtc and L ligands are disordered. The ratio between the Hbtc and L ligands was decided by elemental analysis and 1H NMR integral results. The binuclear InIII subunits are connected through \u03bc2-OH groups to form an extended zigzag {In-OH-In} n  chain along the b axis (Figure S2). Furthermore, the four extended infinite chains were connected by the btc and L or Hbtc ligands to form a 1D nanotubular open channel that runs through the crystallographic b axis with a cross section of approximately 16.3 \u00d7 15.5 \u00c52 (a,b). The only channel is further connected by the btc and L ligands to give rise to a 3D porous structure (c,d). In addition, the total accessible volume of the unit cell was estimated to be 2346.6 \u00c53 using PLATON, which accommodates lattice solvent molecules and is approximately 34.6% of the unit-cell volume (6775.1 \u00c53). In order to confirm the in situ formed L ligand, 13C CPMAS NMR spectroscopy of the as-synthesized 1 and H3btc ligand was performed. As shown in Figure S3, the chemical shifts around 170 ppm are ascribed to the carboxylate C atoms and the chemical shifts around 135 ppm are ascribed to the aromatic C atoms. In contrast to the 13C CPMAS NMR spectra of 1,2,4-H3btc, the new chemical shifts around 45 ppm for 1 are ascribed to the C atoms of piperazine. Compared with 1,2,4-H3btc, two new peaks at \u03b4 3.1 and 3.3 of the 1H NMR spectrum of 1 (Figure S4) were assigned to the hydrogen signals of piperazine, which further verified that part of 1,2,4-H3btc reacted with piperazine to form the L ligand. Furthermore, the ratio between the Hbtc and L ligands is confirmed by the 1H NMR integral results.\n\nThermal and Chemical Stability\n\nThe phase purity of 1 was verified by PXRD studies. The diffraction pattern of 1 was consistent with the calculated pattern, which indicated the high phase purity of the freshly prepared 1 (Figure S5). PXRD at varying temperatures in air was also carried out to investigate the thermal stability of 1. As shown in Figure S6, the experimental diffraction patterns of 1 were all consistent with the calculated ones from ambient temperature to 300 \u00b0C with a temperature increase gradient of 50 \u00b0C. The diffraction pattern had no obvious change until the temperature increased to 350 \u00b0C, where the peaks at 12, 13, and 16\u00b0 disappeared, which indicated that 1 remained stabile until the environmental temperature exceeded 300 \u00b0C. The high thermal stability of 1 also made it possible to use it in broad temperature ranges. The chemical stability of 1 was tested by refluxing 1 in boiling organic solvents [hexane, propylene carbonate (PC), dimethyl sulfoxide, alcohol], water, and even a 0.01 M HCl solution for 24 h (). The unaltered PXRD patterns indicated that the crystallinity of 1 was well retained after solvent treatment. It is reported that the greater basicity of the pore would benefit from increasing the stability of the framework and the azolate-based MOFs usually exhibit excellent stability. It can be concluded that the robustness of 1 could be attributed to the coordinated piperazine, which increases the basicity of the pores. This kind of exceptional thermally and chemically stable MOF is quite rare among the reported MOFs. TGA curves of 1 and activated 1 are shown in Figure S7, which indicates that the weight loss in the temperature range from 25 to 150 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of guest water molecules. The difference between the as-synthesized 1 and activated 1 could be ascribed to the removal of a guest water molecule during the activation process. Therefore, the as-prepared 1 possesses high thermal stability and chemical stability and is completely insoluble in organic solvents.\n\nGas Adsorption\n\nThe gas adsorption properties of 1 were investigated by N2 adsorption analyses at 77 K and CO2 adsorption analyses at 298 and 273 K. As shown in , there is almost no N2 adsorption at 77 K for 1. However, 1 exhibits selective uptake for CO2. When the pressure P (actual pressure) approaches 101 KPa, the CO2 uptake reaches 75.0 cm3 g-1 at 273 K and 57.3 cm3 g-1 at 298 K, respectively. The CO2 adsorption isotherms reveal that the adsorption enthalpies (Q st) of 1 at zero surface coverage is 20.8 kJ mol-1 using the Virial equation from sorption isotherms at 273 and 298 K (Figure S9), which implies that 1 has a high binding ability to CO2. The observed value (20.8 kJ mol-1) is higher than those of most \"bench-mark MOFs\", such as MOF-5 (17 kJ mol-1) and UMCM-1 (12 kJ mol-1), and is similar to that of CuBTTri (21 kJ mol-1). When the adsorption amount is converted to the numbers of CO2 adsorbed in each molecule, it can be seen that ca. 2.4 CO2 molecules per asymmetric unit of 1 are captured at 1 bar. The exposed open metal sites and protruded basic piperazine in the pore are proposed to play critical roles in the considerable CO2 adsorption. Selective adsorption of CO2 over N2 is promising for application in CO2/N2 separation, which may be utilized in capturing greenhouse gas for environmental protection.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "1", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "porosity": [{"probe": "PLATON", "value": "34.6", "unit": "%", "condition": "total accessible volume of the unit cell"}], "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "300", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "stable", "condition": "PXRD at varying temperatures in air"}, {"value": "25 to 150", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "loss of guest water molecules", "condition": "TGA curves"}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "0", "unit": "", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "", "condition": "N2 adsorption analyses"}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "75.0", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "temperature": "273 K", "pressure": "101 KPa", "condition": "CO2 adsorption analyses"}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "57.3", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "101 KPa", "condition": "CO2 adsorption analyses"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["porosity", "decomposition_temperature", "gas_adsorption"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['porosity', 'decomposition_temperature', 'gas_adsorption']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"1\",\n            \"symbol\": \"1\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"porosity\": [\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"PLATON\",\n                \"value\": \"34.6\",\n                \"unit\": \"%\",\n                \"condition\": \"total accessible volume of the unit cell\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"decomposition temperature\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"300\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"stable\",\n                \"condition\": \"PXRD at varying temperatures in air\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"25 to 150\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"loss of guest water molecules\",\n                \"condition\": \"TGA curves\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"N2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"0\",\n                \"unit\": \"\",\n                \"temperature\": \"77 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"N2 adsorption analyses\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"CO2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"75.0\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"273 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"101 KPa\",\n                \"condition\": \"CO2 adsorption analyses\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"CO2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"57.3\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"298 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"101 KPa\",\n                \"condition\": \"CO2 adsorption analyses\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 23, "type": "table", "classification": ["Property"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Cycloaddition of\nCO<sub>2</sub> and Epoxide Using Different Catalysts under Various\nReaction Conditions<xref rid=\"t1fn1\"></xref>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"fx1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2016-00050d_0010.tif\"></graphic>\n<table-wrap-foot>\n<fn id=\"t1fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>Reaction conditions:\nepoxide, 20 mmol;
