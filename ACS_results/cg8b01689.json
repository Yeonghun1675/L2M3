The hcb topology is often observed in uranyl carboxylate compounds, as the formation of this topology is highly favored from 3-connected nodes and 2-connected linkers. Of the five edge transitive 2-periodic nets that exist, only hcb is composed of 3-connected vertices. Thus, hcb is the only viable topology for these building blocks. Upon solvent exchange to ethanol, single crystal X-ray diffraction studies of 2-EtOH elucidated a stacking structure similar to 2-DMF with C2/c symmetry and hcb topology. Along the b axis, the unit cell length of 2-EtOH remained similar to that of 2-DMF; however, the cell lengths decreased by approximately 6 \u00c5 along the a axis and increased by approximately 4 \u00c5 along the c axis. Encouraged by these results which demonstrated the structural dynamism of NU-1302,we dried the crystals by employing sc-CO2 to obtain 2-SA which crystallized in the P 1 space group, indicating a more dramatic phase change. 2-SA retained the same hcb topology and node-linker coordination observed in 2-DMF and 2-EtOH.\n\nThe structural flexibility of 2-SA was further probed by CO2 adsorption-desorption measurements at 195 K because a phase change, from monoclinic (2-EtOH) to triclinic (2-SA), was observed after supercritical activation.
