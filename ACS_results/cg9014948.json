The surface area of FMOF-2 was obtained by performing N<sub>2</sub> adsorption at 77 K. A typical type I isotherm with 378 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>\u22121</sup> of surface area with a microporous nature was found (Figure  and ). Gas sorption experiments using various gases at room temperature were performed by means of an HPVA-100 volumetric device. FMOF-2 (\u223c177 mg) was placed in a sample chamber and activated at 210 \u00b0C under a vacuum for several hours prior to the sorption measurements. Low pressure experiments were performed by dosing in the sample chamber 0.1 bar of CO<sub>2</sub> every 10 min. The volume adsorbed per gram of material was plotted against the pressure (Figure ). At this pressure (1 bar), the calculated weight percentage was found to be close to 4.5 wt %. The measurements were repeated several times by evacuating the sample and pressurizing with CO<sub>2</sub> again. The same weight percentage was obtained within \u00b1 5%. The absence of hysteresis during desorption of CO<sub>2</sub> has been found to be very common for microporous materials. In addition, the absence of a saturation point at 1 bar in the CO<sub>2</sub> sorption plot suggests that FMOF-2 may show higher adsorption values at high pressure; therefore, we conducted high pressure experiments with CO<sub>2</sub> at ambient conditions. The measurements were repeated by evacuating the sample and pressurizing with CO<sub>2</sub>; a type I relationship with a step in the adsorption isotherm of CO<sub>2</sub> at approximately 15 bar was observed (Figure ). Although not common, such a step during the absorption of gases has been observed in similar systems. At 30 bar, the calculated CO<sub>2</sub> weight percentage in FMOF-2 was found to be 22% (5.1 mmol/g), which is relatively low compared to other MOF\u2019s reported in the literature such as MOF-177 (33.5 mmol/g at 42 bar) and MIL-101c (40 mmol/g at 50 bar). In order to get some insight into the mechanism behind the CO<sub>2</sub> step adsorption, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) experiments using variable temperature and pressure were performed. The PXRD analysis of freshly synthesized FMOF-2 at variable temperatures under a vacuum indicates considerable change in the powder pattern between 120 and 140 \u00b0C. This behavior could be ascribed to the framework contraction upon solvent removal (). In addition, it was not possible to generate the original phase by simply returning to the original temperature. Pressurizing the sample up to 500 psi of CO<sub>2</sub> at room temperature did not produce transformation back to the original pattern as expected (). Nevertheless, changes observed in the variable temperature PXRD measurements and the step in the adsorption isotherm in the CO<sub>2</sub> sorption experiments all suggest the breathing motion of FMOF-2 upon solvent loss and CO<sub>2</sub> inclusion. Several experiments were repeated on a freshly synthesized sample to rule out the possibility of experimental error, and CO<sub>2</sub> sorption experiments showed a step adsorption between 15 and 20 bar. Additionally, the apparent high flexibility of metal coordination may allow large framework expansion or contraction without any apparent bond breaking. The same material was explored further to identify the selectivity toward nitrogen and methane. Experiments with all pure gases on these materials at low pressures (1 bar) showed very little or no uptake of N<sub>2</sub> or CH<sub>4</sub> (Figures  and ). The selective sorption of CO<sub>2</sub> over N<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> may be due to a combination of small pore size and selective binding to the walls of the framework. The latter is particularly important since perfluorinated compounds have been proven to show remarkable favorable electrostatic interactions with CO<sub>2</sub>. On the basis of the selectivity between CO<sub>2</sub> over methane and nitrogen, we tested FMOF-2 toward H<sub>2</sub>S and SO<sub>2</sub>. The gas sorption experiments were carried out using a custom built volumetric analyzer loaded with a known amount of FMOF-2. The pressure drop was recorded as a function of time, and the calculated weight capacities of SO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>S at 1 bar pressure and room temperature were found to be 14.0 and 8.3%, which is comparable to the MOFs reported in the literature (Figure ). In addition, both gas adsorption/desorption plots show hysteresis being particularly clear for SO<sub>2</sub> showing a step at around 1.2 bar as observed for CO<sub>2</sub> absorption at high pressure. These results confirm once again the breathing motion of FMOF-2 upon gas absorption and desorption. In order to check the structural stability of FMOF-2 after H<sub>2</sub>S and SO<sub>2</sub> experiments, PXRD measurments under pressure were performed, which indicate no change in the PXRD pattern of FMOF-2 and confirm the structural stability ().
