It can be seen that, when Al3+ concentrations gradually increase, the fluorescent intensity of 1 gradually decreases. As shown in c and d, the fluorescent intensity linearly decreases with Al3+concentration varying from 5 to 60 \u03bcM. The fluorescent detection limit of 1 for Al3+ is calculated by the following equation: detection limit = 3\u03c3/k (k represents the slope between the fluorescent intensity vs log Al3+; \u03c3 represents the standard deviation of blank determination). To further investigate the correlation between quenching result and Al3+ concentration, the linear fluorescent intensity vs Al3+ concentration plot was made (d), which can be fitted through the equation I 0/I = 1 + K sv[Al3+] (I 0 and I are the fluorescent intensities of 1 before and after adding Al3+, respectively; K sv is the quenching rate constant; and [Al3+] represents the concentration of Al3+). The K sv value is calculated to be 1.445 \u00d7 104 L\u22c5mol-1, and a low detection limit (0.19 \u03bcM (S/N = 3)) indicates a high quenching-efficiency constant of Al3+ in the emission of 1. Further, the recyclable performance of 1 was also investigated; the samples of 1 were added into an aqueous solution of Al3+ to completely form 1-Al3+, and then 1-Al3+ was simply washed with water several times. The results show that the fluorescent intensity of compound 1 can be partially resumed through the simple method of using water to wash the 1-Al3+ sample (Figure S5). As for 1, the discussions were given as follows: (1) PXRD patterns of the initial samples and recovered samples after five cycles of quenching and recovery test are also compared and are almost identical (Figure S6), which indicates high stability of coordination framework 1. (2) Besides intensity change, there is not any emission band shift caused by Al3+. (3) The amount of the uploading Al3+ ions, especially for those recycling experiments (Table S2), has be measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), which is in proportion to the luminescent quenching of 1. (4) The fast and simple regeneration method showed that interactions between 1 and Al3+ ions in the detecting process should be weak.

The high quenching efficiency and selectivity make 1 able to be used as a potential bifunctional luminescence chemosensor for both Al3+ and MnO4 - ions in the aqueous solutions. These results open up the exploration of new aspects of a multifunctional 3D heterometallic alkaline earth-lanthanide nanoporous framework, which exhibits unique applications in sensitive detecting of these environment pollutants. The result also represents that these \u03c0-electron-rich asymmetrical aromatic polycarboxylate linkers have great applications in the synthesis of these novel metal-organic frameworks with intriguing structural motifs and excellent luminescent-sensing properties. On the basis of this work, further design, construction, and functional-properties investigation of microporous metal-organic frameworks based on these \u03c0-electron-rich asymmetrical rigid building blocks are also underway in our laboratory.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 39, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information is available\nfree of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications\nwebsite</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00111\">10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00111</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Selected bond\nlengths (\u00c5) and angles (deg) of <bold>1</bold>, TGA curve of <bold>1</bold>, PXRD patterns of <bold>1</bold> at different temperatures,\nsolid-state photoluminescent spectra of H<sub>3</sub>L ligand and <bold>1</bold> as well as <bold>1</bold> dispersed in water solutions,\nand luminescence intensity of compound <bold>1</bold> after five runs\nof recycling for Al<sup>3+</sup> (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00111/suppl_file/ic6b00111_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Listing of crystallographic data for <bold>1</bold> (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00111/suppl_file/ic6b00111_si_002.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00111.

Because the structural motifs of these organic\nlinkers and inorganic\u2013organic coordination polymers can be\ndesigned and tuned, the fluorescent emission strength and wavelength\nof these materials can be deliberately adjusted. Through the rational\nincorporation of diverse metal centers (such as 3d, 4d, or 4f metal\ncenters) and different conjugated aromatic organic linkers, it is\na quite efficient synthetic method for constructing novel types of\nphotoluminescent coordination materials. It is well-known that a double\nbond consisting of \u03c3 and \u03c0 bonds and the emission peaks\nof aromatic organic linkers are generally assigned as \u03c0* \u2192\nn or \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* transitions. The H<sub>3</sub>L ligand contains large, rigid terphenyl aromatic\nbackbones and is expected to generate strong photoluminescence emissions.\nPrevious investigations also confirm that coordination frameworks\ncan further effectively change the emission wavelength and strength\nof aromatic organic linkers through rational incorporation of different\ncentral metal ions (such as 3d, 4d, or 4f metal centers). Thus, we\nare greatly motivated to determine photoluminescent properties of\nfree H<sub>3</sub>L ligand and <bold>1</bold> in the solid state and\nin aqueous solution, respectively.

For the H<sub>3</sub>L ligand the strong fluorescent\nemissions can be ascribed to large aromatic terphenyl chromospheres,\nand the observed strong emission bands can be assigned as \u03c0\u2013\u03c0*\ntransition.

Further these neighboring 2D inorganic Ba-O-La connectivities are interlinked via terphenyl groups forming a 3D microporous heterometallic BaII-LaIII metal-organic framework of 1. As shown in , 1D microporous channel with dimensionality of 9.151(3) \u00c5 \u00d7 10.098(1) \u00c5 can be observed along the crystallographic a axis (defined by the atom-to-atom distance of the corner metal ions). A PLATON program analysis demonstrates that there is ~27.0% of the crystal volume (1775.4 \u00c53 potential solvent areas) accessible to guest molecules. The large volume value can be compared with those previously reported microporous MOFs. Rao and co-workers also elaborate the typical examples of inorganic-organic hybrid materials. As is illustrated in the previous literature and is seen from these kinds of hybrid materials, there are only a few microporous coordination frameworks with 2-D or 3-D inorganic connectivity. 1 also represents a novel example of I 2 O 1-type inorganic-organic microporous heterometallic alkaline earth-lanthanide 3D microporous framework.\n\nTo determine the thermo-stability of nanoporous structures, we investigated the thermal decomposition process of 1\u22c53DMF. As shown in Figure S1, thermal decomposition of 1\u22c53DMF exhibits three weight loss processes, and it is finally composed into the corresponding oxides. The first weight loss process of 13.25% varying from 25 to 150 \u00b0C is due to the loss of three lattice DMF molecules (calcd 12.74%). Subsequently, the second weight loss process of 7.05% varies from 160 to 350 \u00b0C, corresponding to the removal of one coordinated DMF molecule and three coordinated water molecules (calcd 7.39%). In the third weight loss process, the complex is finally decomposed into BaO and La2O3 with a residual weight of 36.53% (calcd 36.21%). A sample of 1\u22c53DMF was heated at 130 \u00b0C in the oven for 24 h to afford the desolvated Ba-La complex 1. To determine the thermal stability of 1, it was heated under different temperatures for 6 h, and then corresponding PXRD patterns of these samples after heating were investigated. As shown in Figure S2, the framework began to collapse when all the coordinated DMF and coordinated water molecules are removed above 160 \u00b0C.\n\nPhotoluminescent properties of 1 \n\nAromatic organic ligands and their coordination polymers have received great attention for their unique photoluminescent properties and their great application prospects as luminescent materials, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Because the structural motifs of these organic linkers and inorganic-organic coordination polymers can be designed and tuned, the fluorescent emission strength and wavelength of these materials can be deliberately adjusted. Through the rational incorporation of diverse metal centers (such as 3d, 4d, or 4f metal centers) and different conjugated aromatic organic linkers, it is a quite efficient synthetic method for constructing novel types of photoluminescent coordination materials. It is well-known that a double bond consisting of \u03c3 and \u03c0 bonds and the emission peaks of aromatic organic linkers are generally assigned as \u03c0* \u2192 n or \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* transitions. The H3L ligand contains large, rigid terphenyl aromatic backbones and is expected to generate strong photoluminescence emissions. Previous investigations also confirm that coordination frameworks can further effectively change the emission wavelength and strength of aromatic organic linkers through rational incorporation of different central metal ions (such as 3d, 4d, or 4f metal centers). Thus, we are greatly motivated to determine photoluminescent properties of free H3L ligand and 1 in the solid state and in aqueous solution, respectively. As shown in Figure S3, at ambient temperature, the free H3L ligand has strong luminescent emissions in the solid state, which exhibits the broad emission peak with a maximum at 445 nm (\u03bbex = 370 nm), while its emission spectrum in water solutions is at 374 nm. For the H3L ligand the strong fluorescent emissions can be ascribed to large aromatic terphenyl chromospheres, and the observed strong emission bands can be assigned as \u03c0-\u03c0* transition. In comparison with that of free H3L ligand, upon excitation at 370 nm, the 3D metal-organic framework 1 exhibits strong emission bands with a maximum around 410 nm. On the other hand, when the crystalline materials were ground into powder samples and suspended in the water solutions, 1 exhibits a strong luminescent emission peak with maximum at 374 nm upon excitation at 340 nm, which can be assigned to the luminescence from intraligand emission because similar luminescent bands can be observed for the free H3L ligand in the water solutions.
