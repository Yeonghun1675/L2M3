Their crystal structure is based on two crystallographically\nindependent actinide centers (), which exhibit the same coordination geometry: the\nmetals An1 and An2 are 8-fold-coordinated by three oxo groups (O1\nand O2), four carboxyl oxygen atoms (labeled O<sub>C</sub>, from phthalate\nmolecule), and one aquo species (O1W and O2W). It defines a distorted\nsquare-antiprismatic geometry (AnO<sub>8</sub>), with typical U\u2013O\nbond lengths of 2.178(4)\u20132.376(4) \u00c5, U\u2013OW bond\ndistances of 2.616(5)\u20132.626(4) \u00c5, and U\u2013O<sub>C</sub> bond distances in the range 2.329(4)\u20132.483(4) \u00c5. Because\nof actinide contraction, the corresponding\nNp\u2013O bond distances are slightly shorter than the corresponding\nU\u2013O distances, with Np\u2013O bond distances of 2.185(3)\u20132.362(3)\n\u00c5, Np\u2013OW bond distances of 2.617(3)\u20132.625(3) \u00c5,\nand Np\u2013O<sub>C</sub> bond distances in the range 2.338(3)\u20132.484(3)\n\u00c5. The oxo groups are shared between three adjacent actinide\ncenters with a \u03bc<sub>3</sub>-bridging configuration, whereas\nthe aquo species are situated in a terminal position. The assignments\nof the \u03bc<sub>3</sub>-O/H<sub>2</sub>O groups are in good agreement\nwith bond-valence-sum calculations, which\ngive values of 2.03 and 2.11 for O1 and O2 in the U-based compound\n(expected value: 2.0). For the aquo species, bond-valence-sum calculations\ngive 0.26 and 0.25 for O1W and O2W in the U-based compound (expected\nvalue: 0.4). The existence of the \u03bc<sub>3</sub>-O bridging groups\nleads to the formation of an infinite ribbon, with AnO<sub>8</sub> units sharing two edges with the adjacent one (). Within this chain, the interatomic\nU\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7U distances are 3.6645(4) and 3.7094(5) \u00c5\nfor U1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7U2 and U1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7U1, respectively.\nIn the Np analogue, the Np\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Np distances are 3.6438(4)\nand 3.7031(5) \u00c5 for Np1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Np2 and Np1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Np1,\nrespectively. For comparison, An\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7An distances are\nslightly longer with the values of 3.866(1) and 3.842(1) \u00c5 in\nthe fluorite-type structure of UO<sub>2</sub>\n and NpO<sub>2</sub>, respectively.\nThe occurrence of such an infinite one-dimensional (1D) network is\nrather uncommon in the An<sup>IV</sup> coordination polymers, which\nusually exhibit discrete monomeric or polynuclear complexes instead.\nIn fact, a similar chain structure has been previously reported for\nAn<sup>IV</sup> with terephtalate (bdc) [U<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(bdc)<sub>2</sub>(DMF)]. Another type\nof infinite chain network occurs with acetate ligands. In this case, however, the connection of the\nbicapped square-antisprimatic polyhedra (UO<sub>10</sub>) via a trans\nedge-sharing mode generates straight ribbons instead of the zigzag\nribbons found in compounds <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>. A cis\nedge-sharing connection mode was encountered in the uranium sulfate\nU\u00ad(OH)<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>), in\nwhich U is 8-fold-coordinated in square-antiprismatic geometry. Within\none inorganic chain of compounds <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>, which is aligned along with the <italic>a</italic> axis, there\nis one type of phthalate molecule bridging two pairs of An1\u2013O\u2013An2\nsubunits, where each carboxylate arm adopts a syn\u2013syn configuration\nin a bidentate bridging mode between the An1 and An2 centers (). A second type\nof phthalate molecule plays the role of linking the two adjacent chains\nwith the same syn\u2013syn bidentate connection fashion.

Their crystal structure is based on two crystallographically independent actinide centers (), which exhibit the same coordination geometry: the metals An1 and An2 are 8-fold-coordinated by three oxo groups (O1 and O2), four carboxyl oxygen atoms (labeled OC, from phthalate molecule), and one aquo species (O1W and O2W). It defines a distorted square-antiprismatic geometry (AnO8), with typical U-O bond lengths of 2.178(4)-2.376(4) \u00c5, U-OW bond distances of 2.616(5)-2.626(4) \u00c5, and U-OC bond distances in the range 2.329(4)-2.483(4) \u00c5. Because of actinide contraction, the corresponding Np-O bond distances are slightly shorter than the corresponding U-O distances, with Np-O bond distances of 2.185(3)-2.362(3) \u00c5, Np-OW bond distances of 2.617(3)-2.625(3) \u00c5, and Np-OC bond distances in the range 2.338(3)-2.484(3) \u00c5. The oxo groups are shared between three adjacent actinide centers with a \u03bc3-bridging configuration, whereas the aquo species are situated in a terminal position. The assignments of the \u03bc3-O/H2O groups are in good agreement with bond-valence-sum calculations, which give values of 2.03 and 2.11 for O1 and O2 in the U-based compound (expected value: 2.0). For the aquo species, bond-valence-sum calculations give 0.26 and 0.25 for O1W and O2W in the U-based compound (expected value: 0.4). The existence of the \u03bc3-O bridging groups leads to the formation of an infinite ribbon, with AnO8 units sharing two edges with the adjacent one (). Within this chain, the interatomic U\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5U distances are 3.6645(4) and 3.7094(5) \u00c5 for U1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5U2 and U1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5U1, respectively. In the Np analogue, the Np\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Np distances are 3.6438(4) and 3.7031(5) \u00c5 for Np1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Np2 and Np1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Np1, respectively. For comparison, An\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5An distances are slightly longer with the values of 3.866(1) and 3.842(1) \u00c5 in the fluorite-type structure of UO2  and NpO2, respectively. The occurrence of such an infinite one-dimensional (1D) network is rather uncommon in the AnIV coordination polymers, which usually exhibit discrete monomeric or polynuclear complexes instead. In fact, a similar chain structure has been previously reported for AnIV with terephtalate (bdc) [U2O2(bdc)2(DMF)]. Another type of infinite chain network occurs with acetate ligands. In this case, however, the connection of the bicapped square-antisprimatic polyhedra (UO10) via a trans edge-sharing mode generates straight ribbons instead of the zigzag ribbons found in compounds 1 and 2. A cis edge-sharing connection mode was encountered in the uranium sulfate U(OH)2(SO4), in which U is 8-fold-coordinated in square-antiprismatic geometry. Within one inorganic chain of compounds 1 and 2, which is aligned along with the a axis, there is one type of phthalate molecule bridging two pairs of An1-O-An2 subunits, where each carboxylate arm adopts a syn-syn configuration in a bidentate bridging mode between the An1 and An2 centers (). A second type of phthalate molecule plays the role of linking the two adjacent chains with the same syn-syn bidentate connection fashion. This connection generates the formation of organic-inorganic layers of [AnO(H2O)(1,2-bdc)]2 in the ab plane (). Free water molecules (OW3) are intercalated between the hybrid sheets stacking along the c axis. The O3W species reveal strong hydrogen-bonding interactions with the attached water molecule O2W [O3W\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5H2WA-O2W = 2.088(10) \u00c5 in 1; O3W\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5H2WA-O2W = 2.016(6) \u00c5 in 2]. Cohesion of the structure is caused by the van der Waals interaction between the benzene rings. However, on the basis of TGA, the water content of the U compound was determined to be 0.5 H2O per U2O2 unit, instead of the 1 H2O revealed by XRD (see the  section). This difference might reflect disorder with a partial occupancy for the free water molecules of the O3W type. The solid-state UV-visible absorption spectrum (Figure S3d) collected for compound 1 shows a typical f-f transition for U4+, which consist of a broad band between 600 and 700 nm with some resolved components at 629, 654, and 678 nm (assigned to the transitions 3H4 \u2192 1G6, 3H4 \u2192 1D2, and 3H4 \u2192 3P0, respectively).

The CCI-based Np network sheets are further linked to each other through the hexatopic mellitate molecules. Two types of crystallographically independent mellitate linkers (labeled A and B) are observed in the structure of 4 (). The both mellitate molecules use seven oxygen atoms of the carboxylate arms to coordinate to the neptunium atoms. Two of the carboxylate arms exhibit a syn-syn bidentate bridging mode toward the neptunium centers (toward Np2 and Np3 and also Np2 and Np4 for A; toward Np1 and Np6 and also Np4 and Np5 for B; ). One other carboxylate arm adopts a syn-anti bidenate bridging fashion (toward Np8 and Np10 for A; toward Np8 and Np7 for B), and the other carboxylate arm is chelating to one Np center (Np9 for A; Np7 for B). The remaining two carboxylate groups are not bound to the neptunium centers: one exists in its protonated form with elongated C-OH bonds [1.289(12) and 1.318(12) \u00c5 for A and B, respectively] and short C\ue5fbO bonds [1.222(12) and 1.210(12) \u00c5 for A and B, respectively], and the other is not protonated, with the C-O bond distance ranging from 1.229(11) to 1.245(12) \u00c5. The observed inorganic Np layer network is stacked along the c axis via the mellitate linkers (). Free water molecules are intercalated between the layers, showing hydrogen-bonding interactions between the terminal aquo species bound to Np and the remaining nonbonded carboxylate groups. In total, 12 distinct water species have been identified from the SC-XRD analysis.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 26, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig6\" position=\"float\">\n<label>6</label>\n<caption>\n<p>View of the asymmetric unit of <bold>4</bold> showing the connection mode of the 10 crystallographically independent\nneptunium centers linked to each other through \u201cneptunyl\u201d\noxo groups (i.e., CCI).
