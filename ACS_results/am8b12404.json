According to the ionic radii of Co(II), Zn(II), and Cd(II), which are 70, 74, and 95 pm, respectively, the crystallography results (Figure S5) show that although the general manner of the components bonding is very close, the ionic radius influences the space group chosen by the frameworks, and Cd(II), which has a larger ionic radius than the other two metals, selects a different space group. Studies of single-crystal X-ray (Table S1) show that the two TMU-40 structures with zinc and cobalt metal nodes are crystallized in the P21/c  space group, but TMU-40(Cd) selects the Pbca space group, which is more symmetrical than the P21/c  one.

The average length of the M-O and M-N bonds and the length of hydrogen bonds in all three structures are shown in , which shows an increasing trend with increase in the metal ion radius. Also, computed void spaces per unit cell for frameworks after removing the solvent are 19.6% (485.9 \u00c53) for TMU-40(Zn), 20.8% (531.9 \u00c53) for TMU-40(Co), and 20.8% (1071.6 \u00c53) for TMU-40(Cd) ( and S6). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for all three structures are well suited to those that are simulated from the single crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD) data (Figure S7), which confirm the purity of the TMU-40. To study the porosity of the frameworks, the adsorption-desorption measurements of N2 gas at 77 K and 1 bar pressure were performed on the structures. The obtained results show that the samples containing zinc, cobalt, and cadmium have a surface area (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET)) of 200.5, 257.8, and 218.3 m2/g, respectively (Figure S8).", "data":
