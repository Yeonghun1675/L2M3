The maximum CO2 uptake at 1 atm for desolvated 1 are 135.4, 50.7, and 44.8 cm3 g-1 at 195, 273, and 298 K, respectively (Figure a). These values for both compounds are moderately high and comparable to the recently reported values. Such selectivity and difference in sorption properties of two isostructural MOFs, 1 and 2, are very uncommon. It is well-known that the flexibility in frameworks, in most cases, causes selective sorption of gases by guest-directed framework rearrangements. However, it could also be possible that flexible framework can rearrange the pore structure in response to guest stimuli having large framework-guest interaction and adsorb gases or molecules of similar sizes without any selectivity. The maintenance of framework integrity was proven by identical PXRD patterns before and after heat treatment for 1 (Figure a). However, for 2, careful examination of PXRD (Figure b) shows slight shifting of peaks toward lower 2\u03b8 values after desolvation. Hysteresis obtained in H2 and N2 sorption isotherms, measured at 77 K, confirm the flexible nature of 2. Such desorption kinetics might also be related to the structural features of desolvated 2 with narrow pore apertures, whereas the favored diffusion of the slightly larger CO2 molecules (3.189 \u00c5) at 195 K should be related to both the flexibility of the framework at higher temperatures as well as higher kinetic energy of the CO2 molecules.

While 2 shows a weight-loss of ~5% (expected = 4.3%) in the range 60-180 \u00b0C attributable to the lattice water molecules (Figure S4, ). Decomposition of 1 and 2 can be achieved beyond 410 \u00b0C.\n\nGas Adsorption Studies\n\nTo evaluate porosity of 1 and 2 as well as their gas adsorption ability, gas adsorption measurements are performed using N2, H2, and CO2 under different experimental conditions. Both 1 and 2 are activated by immersing the crystals in DCM for 3 days at room temperature to replace guest molecules from the lattice by DCM, and after that, it is heated to 120 \u00b0C for 12 h under vacuum to remove all solvent molecules. Permanent porosity of 1 and 2 are confirmed by gas sorption measurements at low pressure with N2, H2 at 77 K, and CO2 at 195, 273, and 298 K. The BET surface area of 2, calculated from N2 adsorption isotherm, is found to be 359 m2 g-1 with pore volume equal to 0.16 cm3 g-1. Compound 2 shows H2 uptake of 103.8 cm3 g-1 (0.92 wt %) at 1.0 atm with large hysteresis, while no hysteresis is observed for CO2. The maximum CO2 uptake at 1 atm are 160.4, 52.7, and 44.1 cm3 g-1 at 195, 273, and 298 K, respectively (Figure b). However, N2 and H2 do not diffuse into the pores of 1 at 77 K and show only surface adsorption (7.4 cm3 g-1 for N2 and 1.8 cm3 g-1 for H2 at P/P o = 1). Although the channel size is large enough compared to the kinetic diameter of N2 and H2 (3.6 and 2.9 \u00c5, respectively), this may be attributed to the 1D channel systems running along crystallographic c axis (Figure c) in all the frameworks, and there are no additional effective channels that can be observed along the a or b axis. Interestingly, a CO2 adsorption experiment for 1 shows a typical type I adsorption isotherm, confirming the microporous nature of 1. The maximum CO2 uptake at 1 atm for desolvated 1 are 135.4, 50.7, and 44.8 cm3 g-1 at 195, 273, and 298 K, respectively (Figure a). These values for both compounds are moderately high and comparable to the recently reported values. Such selectivity and difference in sorption properties of two isostructural MOFs, 1 and 2, are very uncommon. It is well-known that the flexibility in frameworks, in most cases, causes selective sorption of gases by guest-directed framework rearrangements. However, it could also be possible that flexible framework can rearrange the pore structure in response to guest stimuli having large framework-guest interaction and adsorb gases or molecules of similar sizes without any selectivity.
