In other words, the electron-rich N-substituents slightly diminish the \u03c0-acidity of NDIs, and they might display more negative first reduction potential. Because the difference in the electronic effect of two organic tectons is extremely small, the \u03c0-acidity of DPMNI does not appear to be much different from that of DPNDI. The cyclic voltammogram of DPMNI exhibits two quasi-reversible processes in the cathodic region at E 1/2 values of -0.98 and -1.51 V, which correspond to the reduction of DPMNI to its radical anion and dianion states, respectively (as shown for DPMNI in Figure S8).
