The enantiomeric pairs (1M and 1P) assembled by spontaneous resolution have been successfully separated. This study shows the successful integration of multiple NLO behaviors within one chiral MOF structure: the noncentrosymmetric feature of the structure brings the chiral MOF high SHG efficiency; the incorporation of the spirocenter ligand into the framework can efficiently produce two-photon-excited PL with a larger-action cross-sectional value compared with the organic linker.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 18, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The\nSupporting Information is available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at\nDOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b00671\">10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b00671</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Synthetic routes\nto the ligand, powder X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis,\nstructure analysis, CD, PL, SHG, and 2PEF spectra and analysis, and\ncrystal data (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b00671/suppl_file/ic8b00671_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b00671.
