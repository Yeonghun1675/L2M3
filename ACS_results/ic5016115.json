NdIII ions possess large unquenched orbital angular momentum associated with the internal nature of the valence f orbitals. The orbitally degenerate ground state is therefore easily split by spin-orbit coupling and by crystal-field effects. The magnetic properties of NdIII ions are strongly influenced by this. At room temperature, the value of the product \u03c7M T (where \u03c7M is the molar magnetic susceptibility) is 16.38 cm3 K mol-1. This value is lower, but in reasonable agreement, with that calculated for 13 noninteracting NdIII ions of \u03c7M T = 21.32 cm3 K mol-1 (4I9/2, g = 8/11), taking into account electron-electron interactions, spin-orbit coupling, and antiferromagnetic interactions (below). The \u03c7M T product decreases immediately from room temperature to around 50 K and then decreases more rapidly, reaching a value of 6.53 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K. The decrease of \u03c7M T upon reduction of the temperature can be ascribed to a combination of the exchange interactions between the NdIII ions and the progressive depopulation of excited Stark sublevels, derived from the splitting of the free ion ground state by the crystal field. A quantitative analysis of the exchange is precluded because of the complexity of the structure. It is likely, however, from both the profile of the plot and the lower than expected room temperature \u03c7M T value, compared to that of the expected uncoupled value, that the exchange is dominated by antiferromagnetic interactions.
