The IR spectrum of <bold>1</bold> displays a medium-intensity\nabsorption band at 1510 cm<sup>\u20131</sup>, which can be attributed\nto the so-called breathing of the pyrazolyl rings. The absence of\nIR bands due to N\u2013H stretching clearly indicates that in <bold>1</bold> the ligand is deprotonated. On the contrary, in the case\nof species <bold>2</bold>\u2013<bold>7</bold>, the medium-intensity\nabsorption bands centered in the range 3200\u20133450 cm<sup>\u20131</sup> can be attributed to the stretching vibrations of the N\u2013H\ngroups, as expected for the bipyrazolyl ligand in its neutral form.\nIn <bold>2</bold>, the broadness of this band (extending in the range\n2700\u20133400 cm<sup>\u20131</sup>) suggests that the N\u2013H\ngroups are involved in strong hydrogen-bond interactions (see the\ndescription of the crystal structure and the caption to Figure ). Again in <bold>2</bold>, the weak bands at 3444\nand 1655 cm<sup>\u20131</sup> can be ascribed to the stretching\nand bending vibrations of the clathrated water molecules.

In particular,\nas originally proposed by Lever, the presence of a single band in\nthe overtone region is indicative of a noncoordinated nitrate anion.

In the IR spectrum of <bold>4</bold>, the fine\nsplitting of the strong broad band in the region 1000\u20131100\ncm<sup>\u20131</sup> along with the presence of a weak band at 767\ncm<sup>\u20131</sup> and a medium broad one at 684 cm<sup>\u20131</sup> indicate BF<sub>4</sub>\n<sup>\u2013</sup> coordination at the silver(I)\nions.

The IR spectrum of 1 displays a medium-intensity absorption band at 1510 cm-1, which can be attributed to the so-called breathing of the pyrazolyl rings. The absence of IR bands due to N-H stretching clearly indicates that in 1 the ligand is deprotonated. On the contrary, in the case of species 2-7, the medium-intensity absorption bands centered in the range 3200-3450 cm-1 can be attributed to the stretching vibrations of the N-H groups, as expected for the bipyrazolyl ligand in its neutral form. In 2, the broadness of this band (extending in the range 2700-3400 cm-1) suggests that the N-H groups are involved in strong hydrogen-bond interactions (see the description of the crystal structure and the caption to Figure ). Again in 2, the weak bands at 3444 and 1655 cm-1 can be ascribed to the stretching and bending vibrations of the clathrated water molecules. A detailed analysis of the IR spectra of 2-7 may also give hints about the interactions involving the anions. Thus, in the spectrum of 2, the bands at 1396 and 1326 cm-1 and the very weak one in the overtone region (1700-1800 cm-1) can be ascribed to the nitrate group (asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes and combination of symmetric stretching and in-plane bending, respectively). In particular, as originally proposed by Lever, the presence of a single band in the overtone region is indicative of a noncoordinated nitrate anion. The IR spectrum of 3 shows two absorption bands characteristic of the perchlorate group: a strong and broad one in the region 1110-1050 cm-1 and a medium and broad one at 697 cm-1. In the IR spectrum of 4, the fine splitting of the strong broad band in the region 1000-1100 cm-1 along with the presence of a weak band at 767 cm-1 and a medium broad one at 684 cm-1 indicate BF4 - coordination at the silver(I) ions. Analogously, the IR spectrum of 5, displaying a strong broad band at 809 cm-1 and a medium broad one at 670 cm-1, is in accordance with the existence of interactions between the PF6 - anion and the silver(I) centers.  IR spectra of 6 and 7 show a number of strong absorptions in the 1180-1100 cm-1 region, due to the asymmetric and symmetric vibrations of the SO3 - groups and  vibration of the S-O moiety.

The capsule was heated up to the melting point of PE (98 \u00b0C), while its content was stirred to give a homogeneous dispersion. The dispersion was then left to cool at room temperature; after solidification, the loaded polymer matrix was removed from the capsule and  placed in contact with a hot quartz surface (130 \u00b0C): within a few minutes, the matrix melted and distributed homogeneously onto the quartz surface to give a thin liquid layer. After reduction of the quartz surface temperature down to 80 \u00b0C, the polymeric matrix layer turned into a soft solid film, suitable to be cut into small disks of 6 mm diameter and of thickness in the range 0.8-1.0 mm (see Figure ). An unloaded PE disk was prepared and used as negative control. A PE disk with embedded silver nitrate was also prepared and used as positive control.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "[Ag2(BPZ)]", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "C6H4Ag2N4"}, "processes":
