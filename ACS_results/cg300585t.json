The acylamide ligand shows photoluminescence at 404 nm, confirming that the emission around 380 nm is derived from the \u03c0-\u03c0* transition of organic ligands (). The 550 nm emission may be due to metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT). Moreover, the UV-vis absorption spectra at room temperature in the solid shows two broad absorption bands at 200-400 nm, 400-550 nm, where it is obvious that the absorption in the visible region is weaker that that in the UV region, which is consistent with the photoluminescence intensity of blue and yellow emission, and the tunable photoluminescence properties (). To our best of knowledge, the instances of MOFs featuring white light emission is still highly rare, and similar tunable photoluminescence dependent on excitation wavelength and direct white light emission was only observed in two cases, but for Ag(I) two-dimensional (2D) coordination polymer and In(III) 3D coordination polymer rather than the Zn(II) 3D porous MOF reported here.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 17, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig3\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>The emission\nspectrum of <bold>1</bold> under different excitation wavelengths\n(left), and the CIE chromaticity coordinates of the emissions spectrum\nexcited at 320\u2013410 nm (right).</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr3\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cg-2012-00585t_0003.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 3  The emission spectrum of 1 under different excitation wavelengths (left), and the CIE chromaticity coordinates of the emissions spectrum excited at 320-410 nm (right).
