Thermal analysis results also showed that compound A is a good candidate for high-energy-density material applications because it features superior thermostability with high decomposition. The kinetic parameters of its exothermic process were studied by Kissinger's and Ozawa-Doyle's methods. An investigation of the fluorescent properties of these compounds revealed that they may be potential blue fluorescent materials.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 45, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting\nInformation\nis available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.cgd.5b01772\">10.1021/acs.cgd.5b01772</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Additional structure\nfigures, PXRD patterns, and TGA\ncurves (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.cgd.5b01772/suppl_file/cg5b01772_si_002.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p><p>Additional structure\nfigures, PXRD patterns, and TGA\ncurves (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.cgd.5b01772/suppl_file/cg5b01772_si_002.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p><p>CCDC <ext-link ext-link-type=\"ccdc\" xlink:href=\"1413530\">1413530</ext-link>\u2013<ext-link ext-link-type=\"ccdc\" xlink:href=\"1413535\">1413535</ext-link> contain the supplementary crystallographic data\nfor this paper.

In our work, photoluminescent properties were investigated in the\nsolid state at ambient temperature. On complexation of organic ligands\nwith Zn\u00ad(II) ions, intense blue emission was observed at 446 nm for <bold>A</bold>, 430 nm for <bold>A1</bold>, 440 nm for <bold>A2</bold>,\n380 and 400 nm for <bold>A3</bold>, 430 nm for <bold>A4</bold>, and\n427 nm for <bold>A5</bold> under excitation at 330 nm (). The free HATZ ligand displays\nlight photoluminescence with an emission maximum at 325 nm, in accordance\nwith previous reports, whereas Zn\u00ad(II) ions are difficult\nto oxidize or reduce due to their d<sup>10</sup> configuration. Taking\nthe emission bands of these free carboxylate co-ligands into consideration,\nthey may be assigned to a characteristic of intraligand emission,\nas reported for other Zn\u00ad(II) CPs constructed from mixed N and O donor\nligands. The maximum emission peaks of compounds <bold>A</bold> and <bold>A5</bold> are similar to those of the free co-ligands,\nand the emission bands of compounds <bold>A1</bold> and <bold>A4</bold> are relatively red-shifted (44 nm for <bold>A1</bold> and 72 nm\nfor <bold>A4</bold>). The difference in the emission behavior for\ncompounds <bold>A1</bold> and <bold>A4</bold> is probably derived\nfrom the various dicarboxylate co-ligands, which may affect the rigidity\nof solid-state crystal packing and further influence their luminescence\nemission bands. Compound <bold>A3</bold> shows an obvious blue shift\nof 25 nm compared with that of the L<sup>3</sup> ligand, but it exhibits\nan intense emission with two band peaks that can be assigned to the\nnaphthalene unit of the L<sup>3</sup> ligand. Furthermore, compared\nwith isoreticular compound <bold>A1</bold>, the emission intensity\nof compound <bold>A2</bold> becomes stronger, which is probably due\nto the fact that the incorporation of N atoms with lone-pair electrons\npromotes the production of triplet excitons through an n\u2212\u03c0*\ntransition.</p>", "clean_text": "{[(CH3)2NH2]0.5[Zn(L2)0.5(ATZ)1.5]\u22c51.5H2O\u22c50.5DMF} n  (A2)\n\nPale yellow block crystals were formed in 62% yield based on Zn(ATZ)2.

The relatively high thermal stability is presumably caused by the strong structural reinforcement, and the extensive network may act as an energy sink to suppress decomposition.\n\nPhotoluminescent Properties\n\nThe luminescent properties of CPs with d10 metal centers and \u03c0-conjugated organic linkers have attracted intense interests due to their potential applications in chemical optical sensors and light-emitting devices. In our work, photoluminescent properties were investigated in the solid state at ambient temperature. On complexation of organic ligands with Zn(II) ions, intense blue emission was observed at 446 nm for A, 430 nm for A1, 440 nm for A2, 380 and 400 nm for A3, 430 nm for A4, and 427 nm for A5 under excitation at 330 nm (). The free HATZ ligand displays light photoluminescence with an emission maximum at 325 nm, in accordance with previous reports, whereas Zn(II) ions are difficult to oxidize or reduce due to their d10 configuration. Taking the emission bands of these free carboxylate co-ligands into consideration, they may be assigned to a characteristic of intraligand emission, as reported for other Zn(II) CPs constructed from mixed N and O donor ligands. The maximum emission peaks of compounds A and A5 are similar to those of the free co-ligands, and the emission bands of compounds A1 and A4 are relatively red-shifted (44 nm for A1 and 72 nm for A4). The difference in the emission behavior for compounds A1 and A4 is probably derived from the various dicarboxylate co-ligands, which may affect the rigidity of solid-state crystal packing and further influence their luminescence emission bands. Compound A3 shows an obvious blue shift of 25 nm compared with that of the L3 ligand, but it exhibits an intense emission with two band peaks that can be assigned to the naphthalene unit of the L3 ligand. Furthermore, compared with isoreticular compound A1, the emission intensity of compound A2 becomes stronger, which is probably due to the fact that the incorporation of N atoms with lone-pair electrons promotes the production of triplet excitons through an n-\u03c0* transition.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "A2", "chemical formula": "{[(CH3)2NH2]0.5[Zn(L2)0.5(ATZ)1.5]\u22c51.5H2O\u22c50.5DMF} n"}, "chemical formula weight": [{"value": "367.68", "unit": "g/mol", "condition": ""}], "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "320 to 380", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "collapse of the main framework", "condition": ""}], "peak spectrum": [{"value": "3308, 3182, 2794, 2355, 1667, 1566, 1441, 1366, 1253, 1166, 1103, 1015, 777, 664, 476", "unit": "cm-1", "type": "IR", "condition": "KBr"}, {"value": "446", "unit": "nm", "type": "photoluminescent", "condition": "solid state at ambient temperature, excitation at 330 nm"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["chemical_formula_weight", "decomposition_temperature", "peak_spectrum"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['chemical_formula_weight', 'decomposition_temperature', 'peak_spectrum']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"\",\n            \"symbol\": \"A2\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"{[(CH3)2NH2]0.5[Zn(L2)0.5(ATZ)1.5]\u22c51.5H2O\u22c50.5DMF} n\"\n        },\n        \"chemical formula weight\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"367.68\",\n                \"unit\": \"g/mol\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"decomposition temperature\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"320 to 380\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"collapse of the main framework\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"peak spectrum\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"3308, 3182, 2794, 2355, 1667, 1566, 1441, 1366, 1253, 1166, 1103, 1015, 777, 664, 476\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm-1\",\n                \"type\": \"IR\",\n                \"condition\": \"KBr\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"446\",\n                \"unit\": \"nm\",\n                \"type\": \"photoluminescent\",\n                \"condition\": \"solid state at ambient temperature, excitation at 330 nm\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 28, "type": "table", "classification": ["Property"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl2\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Structrual Comparison\nof Compounds <bold>A1</bold>\u2013<bold>A5</bold>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"6\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col5\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col6\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">compound</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">interpenetration</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">space group</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">topology</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<italic>a</italic> (\u00c5)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">accessible vol.
