The longer lifetimes of 3 and 5 than the reported Eu3+ or Tb3+ complexes are indicative of our successful synthetic strategy because no water molecules are involved in coordination.

Also, the intrinsic quantum yield (\u03b7) of the 5D0 Eu3+ excited state could be estimated to be 41% based on the emission spectra and lifetime of complex 3. Considering that complexes 1, 3, and 5 emit the primary colors (blue, red, and green) and that they are isostructural, we expect to obtain white-light emission through the doping of Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions in the La3+ complex. A series of codoped complexes with different doping ratios were obtained. It was found that two excitation peaks (centered at 294 and 350 nm, respectively) appear in the excitation spectra of the codoped materials when the maximum intensity of the characteristic emission line of Eu3+ (612 nm) or Tb3+ (545 nm) was monitored (see Figure , inset), while only one broad peak centered at 350 nm was obtained when the blue emission based on the ligand (425 nm) was monitored. All of these facts show that when excited at 294 nm, the ligand can sensitize Eu3+/Tb3+ emission effectively, and that when excited at 350 nm, the energy was only partially transferred to the emission level of Eu3+/Tb3+. This leads to residual emission due to the ligand. So, the partial self-emission from ligands, in combination with Eu3+ and Tb3+, was utilized to obtain a pure white-light-emitting material. The CIE chromaticity coordinates for the La-Zn heterometallic compounds doped with Eu and Tb of different molar ratios excited at different wavelengths are listed in Table S1 in the . It can be seen that the MOF emission color can be fine-tuned by varying the codoping ratio and that when La3+, Eu3+, and Tb3+ were codoped in the molar ratio of 50:22:28, pure white-light emission (Figure ) was obtained with CIE chromaticity coordinates (0.3285, 0.3306) upon excitation at 350 nm. However, by a shift of the excitation wavelength from 350 to 294 nm, a yellow-light emission was obtained with CIE chromaticity coordinates (0.3736, 0.5096). The codoped materials may therefore provide a promising and convenient approach to obtain uniform white-light-emitting or tunable luminescent MOF.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 11, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig3\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Emission spectra of complexes <bold>1</bold> (a), <bold>3</bold> (b),\nand <bold>5</bold> (c) in the solid state at room temperature.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr3\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2011-01425v_0003.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 3  Emission spectra of complexes 1 (a), 3 (b), and 5 (c) in the solid state at room temperature.
