Similarly, a guest selectivity for cyclohexane over decahydronaphthalene was also observed in a process similar to that using cyclopentane and decahydronaphthalene. The results clearly exhibit a different capability for selective absorption in a sequence of cyclohexane > cyclopentane > decahydronaphthalene. Notably, for guest selectivity for cyclohexane, cyclopentane, and decahydronaphthalene using 1 as absorbents may be the result of the synergy effect between the size and geometry of the solvent and the shape of the framework cavity. In terms of the guest selectivity for cyclohexane or cyclopentane in the mixed solvent of cyclopentane and decahydronaphthalene, or cyclohexane and decahydronaphthalene, the size of the solvent is critical for the structural transformation. In these corresponding mixtures, crystalline samples of 1 prefer to selectively absorb the solvents with smaller sizes, such as cyclohexane and cyclopentane. Nevertheless, the guest selectivity for cyclohexane in the mixture of cyclohexane and cyclopentane may be attributed to the synergy effect between the size and geometry of the solvent and the shape of the framework cavity. In other words, the shape of the cavity of 1 only allows the preferential diffusion of the solvents with suitable size and geometry into the framework.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 19, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig4\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Selective absorption\nof cyclohexane, cyclopentane, and decahydronaphthalene by <bold>1</bold>.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr5\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2014-008457_0004.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 4  Selective absorption of cyclohexane, cyclopentane, and decahydronaphthalene by 1.
