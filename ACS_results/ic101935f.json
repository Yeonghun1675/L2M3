In the case of 4-phenylbenzaldehyde, a slightly elongated, linear molecule (0.61 nm \u00d71.33 nm), showed a 58% (65%) conversion. As for benzophenone, which is an angular molecule (0.66 nm \u00d71.14 nm), with the potential product extending in all three directions in an approximately trigonal plane fashion, reacted negligibly. The distinct conversion rates reflect size and shape selectivity of the two mesoporous catalysts. It is evident that these catalytic reactions happened within the mesopores of the two MOFs. If the reactions were catalyzed only on the external surface of the MOF crystals, we would see little difference in the conversion rates among the three substrates. An additional advantage of using PCNs-100 and -101 as catalysts is that they are easily isolated from the reaction suspension by a simple filtration and can be recycled with no observable loss of activity. The PXRD (powder X-ray diffraction) patterns of PCN-100 and -101 before and after the reactions were collected and examined; no loss of crystallinity was found, indicating high stability of the two mesoporous catalysts.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 30, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig7\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>7</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Conversion (%) vs time (min) for Knoevenagel condensation reaction of butyl cyanoacetate with benzaldehyde (a), 4-phenylbenzaldehyde (b) or benzophenone (c) in DMSO-<italic toggle=\"yes\">d</italic>6 catalyzed by PCNs-100 and \u2212101, respectively.
