The Cu1 and Cu2 atoms in 2 have the same coordination environment as the Cu atoms in complex 1, but with a distorted metal site geometry and a slightly longer Cu-Cu distance [2.4168(5) \u00c5 for 2a and 2.4282(9) \u00c5 for 2b; see Figure ]. Because of the geometric and bonding constraints of pp(ac)2 2-, the Namide-Cu bonds for Cu1 and Cu2 twist away from the pyridyl ring plane, resulting in a distorted square-planar geometry for both Cu centers and an average \u03c44 value of 0.11. The second amidate side arm of each ligand reaches over the same side of the Cu1-Cu2 unit to coordinate to the third Cu atom in 2, forming a two-coordinate, nearly linear \"handle\" above the mixed-valence Cu1-Cu2 \"basket\", similar in concept to \"picnic basket\" porphyrins. The relatively short Cu-Cu distances (average Cu1.5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5CuI distance of 2.758 \u00c5 for 2a and 2.750 \u00c5 for 2b) suggest the possibility of orbital overlap between the mixed-valence moiety and the CuI. The only other structurally characterized mixed-valence Cu trimer, reported by Setsune et al., has Cu-Cu distances of 2.51-2.60 \u00c5. Ward et al. reported a CuI 3 trimer with Cu-Cu distances of 2.92-3.61 \u00c5 that could be oxidized to a mixed-valence species.
