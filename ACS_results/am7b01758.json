On the basis of these 2D sheets, coordination polymer I is further connected reciprocally along c-axis to generate a 3D neutral architecture (as shown in d).\n\nLuminescent Properties of I and II\n\nLuminescent properties of cadmium compounds based on various \u03c0-conjugated organic ligands have been inspiring great attention owing to their promising applications in the aspects of chemical sensors. In the present work, the fluorescence properties of coordination polymers I and II together with the free H2DPT ligand were measured in solid state at ambient temperature, as depicted in a. The fluorescence emission and excitation values of H2DPT are at 542 nm (\u03bbex = 370 nm), which is attributed to the transition course from the lowest excited singlet state to the singlet ground state. The strong emission spectra of I and II are located at 491 and 520 nm (\u03bbex = 370, 404 nm), respectively, exhibiting blue shift with the wavelengths of 51 and 22 nm compared to free H2DPT ligand, which may be ascribed to the perturbation brought about by coordination interaction of the ligand with the coordinated metal centers, the rigidity versus flexibility of the organic ligands, and their different architectures. Furthermore, the fluorescence decays of the ligand H2DPT and coordination polymers in the solid state at ambient temperature are fitted into double-exponential decay laws with the following formula: I = A 1 exp(t/\u03c41) + A 2 exp(t/\u03c42), where \u03c41 and \u03c42 are defined as the fast and slow components of the luminescence lifetimes, while A 1 and A 2 denote the pre-exponential factors. The fitted fluorescence lifetimes \u03c41 and \u03c42 are 1.07 \u03bcs (45.48%) and 9.48 \u03bcs (54.52%) for the free ligand H2DPT, 0.92 \u03bcs (59.66%) and 9.34 \u03bcs (40.34%) for I, and 0.85 \u03bcs (44.74%) and 9.20 \u03bcs (55.26%) for II. As a result, the average decay times (\u03c4*) may be determined by the equation as follows: \u03c4* = (A 1\u03c41 2 + A 2\u03c42 2)/(A 1\u03c41 + A 2\u03c42), giving the corresponding average lifetimes of 5.65, 5.45, and 4.38 \u03bcs, respectively, which are shorter than that of the emissions caused by the triplet state (>10-3 s); thus, emissions may result from a singlet state. In addition, lifetimes of I and II are shorter than that of the free ligand H2DPT, which is mainly due to the increasing efficiency of nonradiative pathways (see details in b-d). \n\nMagnetic Studies\n\nThe variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility data for coordination polymer I was investigated at 1000 Oe in the range from 2 to 300 K. The plots of \u03c7M T and \u03c7M versus T are shown in a. The \u03c7M T value is 1.51 cm3 mol-1 K at 300 K, which is the order expected for single Ni(II) ion (s = 1, g > 2.0). The \u03c7M T values decrease reposefully from room temperature to 20 K, then the \u03c7M T value sharply decreases to 0.65 cm3 mol-1K at 2 K upon cooling, which exhibits the behavior of anti-ferromagnetic exchange interactions between Ni(II) ions. The temperature-dependent character of the reciprocal susceptibility \u03c7M -1 versus T of I obeys the Curie-Weiss law in the 300-2 K range (b), giving C = 1.48 cm3 mol-1 K, \u03b8 = -5.9 K, which further demonstrates anti-ferromagnetic interactions between magnetic centers. These phenomena verify the existence of the anti-ferromagnetic interaction, and the carboxyl groups adopt coordination mode to metal centers, which may be contributing to the transport of anti-ferromagnetic coupling interactions.
