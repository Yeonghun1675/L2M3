Compared to other catalytic systems, CPs have great potential as heterogeneous catalyst for the reaction not only because their unique structural features, including crystallinity, active-site uniformity, high surface area, and porosity, but also due to their atomistically well-defined isolated active sites with uniformly fixed configuration and suitable channel size throughout the solid, which endow them with spatial confinement effect and catalyze the reaction with regioselectivity. In addition, the catalytic active sites of the CPs 1-3 are arranged periodically with the distance of neighboring Cu(I) ions more than 6 \u00c5, which can effectively avoid synergic activity among Cu(I) ions, yielding products with the high selectivity. Therefore, the catalytic systems with CuI-CPs as catalysts in H2O under air at room temperature not only remain environmental friendly conditions but also express high selectivity in the reactions that C-H bonds of arylalkanes are directly activated to ketones.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 24, "type": "table", "classification": null, "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl2\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Direct C\u2013H Bonds Activation of Arylalkanes\nto Ketones Catalyzed by <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>3</bold>\n<xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"t2fn1\"></xref>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic content-type=\"header\" id=\"fx2\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2017-021064_0008.tif\"></graphic>\n<graphic id=\"GRAPHIC-d7e1271-autogenerated\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2017-021064_0009.tif\"></graphic>\n<table-wrap-foot>\n<fn id=\"t2fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>Reagents and conditions:\narylalkanes (1.0 mmol), TBHP (1.5 mmol), and catalyst (0.05 mmol),\nH<sub>2</sub>O (5 mL), room temperature, air, 4 h.</p>\n</fn>\n<fn id=\"t2fn2\">\n<label>b</label>\n<p>8 h.</p>\n</fn>\n</table-wrap-foot>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 25, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The mechanism for the oxidation of alkanes to the\ncorresponding ketones catalyzed by the Cu\u00ad(I)-based CPs were proposed\nbased on previous report ().
