The dispersed solution of activated 1 in DMF medium reveals a selective and remarkable quenching effect in the presence of Fe(III) ions and moderately toward Fe(II)/Cu(II) ions. Such sensing of NACs and Fe(III) is reversible in nature and probably occurred through host-guest interaction and competitive absorption of excitation energy, respectively. Other lanthanide-MOFs with this ligand have been synthesized, and further studies are currently underway to examine their potential applications.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 31, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information\nis available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.cgd.6b00930\">10.1021/acs.cgd.6b00930</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Additional experiments\nand structural figures, X-ray\ncrystallographic data, TGA, and PXRD patterns of <bold>1</bold> (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.cgd.6b00930/suppl_file/cg6b00930_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.cgd.6b00930.
