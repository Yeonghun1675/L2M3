Although Cu(II) ions with coordination numbers of 5 (or 6) are known in copper complexes with some other ligands, axial coordination to Cu(II) centered within a porphyrin core is rare. This, along with the strong Jahn-Teller effect in this metal ion may explain the long axial coordination distance in 3. The central-Cu ion deviates slightly by 0.120(1) \u00c5 from the mean plane of the four surrounding N(pyrrole)-atoms toward the axial ligand. The Cu-N(pyridyl) axial line is perpendicular to the Cu-N4(pyrrole) plane. It deviates, however, by 13.7(1)\u00b0 from the plane of the axially approaching pyridyl ring. Neighboring polymeric chains are densely packed in the crystalline phase, the zigzag assemblies interdigitating into one another in an efficient manner. The polymeric zigzag chain structure observed in 3 is similar to that observed earlier for the ZnIIT4PyP analogue.

With transition d-metal ions, in addition to the discrete exocyclic complexes, it can form zero-dimensional oligomeric and 2D polymeric arrays by coordination through exocyclic metal linkers. The MT3PyP derivative has been also engaged successfully in the construction of one-dimensional (compound 3), as well as 2D, polymeric arrays by self-coordination through the metal ion (CuII or ZnII) in the porphyrin core. In view of the remarkable supramolecular isomerism revealed by the MT4PyP analogue, additional MT3PyP-based self-coordinated polymeric aggregates of isomeric connectivity schemes are also envisioned. To our knowledge, the unique polymeric structure types 4-6 have not been observed before with any pyridylporphyrin building blocks. The isomorphous compounds 4 and 5 represent doubly interwoven single-framework coordination polymers composed of the tetrahedral conformer of CuIIT3PyP and a tetranuclear (CuICl)4 or (CuII)4 clusters of complementary tetrahedral topology, as connecting nodes. The conformational and coordination versatility of the T3PyP building block is exhibited to an even wider extent in the formation of the coordination polymeric framework 6. In this structure, both conformers of T3PyP are expressed, and the different and simultaneous coordination modes through metal ions within the porphyrin core as well as external metal ion linkers are manifested. Then, in addition to porphyrin units that are components in the polymeric array, another porphyrin entity is incorporated into the crystal lattice as a template.

Yield: 92% (based on porphyrin).\n\nT3PyP (0.007 mmol) and SnCl2\u22c52H2O (0.028 mmol) were dissolved in 3 mL of 1:1 methanol/DMF mixture. This solution was placed in a sealed reactor and heated at 120 \u00b0C for 3 days in a dry bath. Then, slow cooling of the resulting product for 6 h yielded X-ray quality red rhomb crystals of the SnCl2T3PyP complex. Yield: 44% (based on porphyrin).\n\nT3PyP (0.008 mmol) and Cu(OAc)2\u22c52H2O (0.032 mmol) were dissolved in 3 mL of 1:1 ethanol/DMF mixture and placed in a sealed reactor. Then, one drop of concentrated hydrochloric acid was added to increase the reactants solubility, and the reactor was heated to 100 \u00b0C for 3 days in a dry bath. Red crystals were obtained after slow cooling for 6 h. Yield: 56% (based on porphyrin).\n\nT3PyP (0.008 mmol) and CuCl2\u22c52H2O (0.042 mmol) were dissolved in 3 mL of 1:1 ethanol/DMF mixture and placed in a sealed reactor. The latter was heated to 100 \u00b0C for 3 days in a dry bath. Slow cooling for 6 h yielded X-ray quality red crystals of this compound. Yield: 65% (based on porphyrin).\n\nT3PyP (0.008 mmol) and CuI (0.047 mmol) were placed in sealed reactor in 2 mL of 1:1 ethanol/DMF solution and heated to 120 \u00b0C for 3 days in a dry bath. After slow cooling, X-ray quality very small purple cube crystals were obtained after several hours. Yield: 88% (based on porphyrin).\n\nT3PyP (0.008 mmol) and anhydrous MnCl2 (0.038 mmol) were placed in a sealed reactor in 3 mL of 1:1 ethanol/DMF mixture and heated to 120 \u00b0C for 3 days in a dry bath. After slow cooling for 6 h, the resulting solution was filtered and kept undisturbed for slow evaporation. X-ray quality purple crystals were obtained after two months. Yield: 15% (based on porphyrin).\n\nYb(NO3)3\u22c55(H2O) (0.160 mmol) and T3PyP (0.013 mmol) were dissolved in 4 mL of 1:1 ethanol/o-dichlorobenzene mixture. This solution was refluxed overnight, filtered, and carefully covered with a top layer of benzene. Big red crystals in decent yield were obtained after one month.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "T3PyP freebase", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "processes": [{"synthesis method": "chemical
