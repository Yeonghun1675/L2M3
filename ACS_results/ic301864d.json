Experimental\n\nX-ray crystallographic data for 1 were collected from a single crystal sample mounted on a loop fiber (crystal size: 0.20 \u00d7 0.08 \u00d7 0.02 mm). Data were collected using a Bruker smart diffractometer equipped with an APEX II CCD Detector, a graphite monochromator (Cu K\u03b1 radiation, \u03bb = 1.54178 \u00c5). The crystal-to-detector distance was 5.0 cm, and the data collection was carried out in 512 \u00d7 512 pixel mode. The initial unit cell parameters were determined by a least-squares fit of the angular setting of strong reflections, collected by a 10.0 degree scan in 33 frames over four different parts of the reciprocal space (132 frames total). Geometry: All esds (except the esd in the dihedral angle between two l.s. planes) are estimated using the full covariance matrix. The cell esds are taken into account individually in the estimation of esds in distances, angles, and torsion angles; correlations between esds in cell parameters are only used when they are defined by crystal symmetry. An approximate (isotropic) treatment of cell esds is used for estimating esds involving l.s. planes. Refinement: Refinement of F 2 against ALL reflections. The weighted R-factor wR and goodness of fit S are based on F 2, conventional R-factors R are based on F, with F set to zero for negative F 2. The threshold expression of F 2 > 2\u03c3(F 2) is used only for calculating R-factors(gt) and so forth and is not relevant to the choice of reflections for refinement. R-factors based on F 2 are statistically about twice as large as those based on F, and R-factors based on ALL data will be even larger. The data reduction included a correction for Lorentz and polarization effects with an applied multiscan absorption correction (SADABS). The crystal structure was solved and refined using the SHELXTL program suite. Direct methods yielded all non-hydrogen atoms. All hydrogen atom positions were calculated geometrically and were riding on their respective atoms. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters.
