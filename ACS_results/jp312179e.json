Like all the MOFs displaying the MIL-53 topology, it is built from 1D chains of MO6 (M = Ga here) octahedra sharing OH vertices (running along the c axis) which are linked by terephthalate ligands to generate a 3D framework with rhombus-shaped channels. Moreover, liquid and solid state 19F NMR analyses evidence the presence of fluorine in the framework. The amount of fluorine determined by liquid state 19F NMR analysis is 0.7 wt % (Figure S1, ) which corresponds to a F/OH ratio around 1/9; i.e., one among ten bridged positions is occupied by one fluorine atom (nine others by OH groups).
