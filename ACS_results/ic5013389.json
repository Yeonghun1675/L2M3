Calculations indicate that an end-on coordination of dioxygen is the most favored structure for the adduct, but the dioxygen binding free energy is endoergic by about +10 kcal mol-1 for both [Co(TN  Bn  )]  -  and [Co(TEt)]  - . This thermodynamic bias against dioxygen coordination is qualitatively consistent with the low conversion to the cobalt superoxo complex that was observed experimentally. Quantitatively, the magnitude is higher than anticipated from the experimental K eq values, which is a typical problem for M-O2 binding energies obtained from DFT calculations. The computed Co-O and O-O bond lengths of 1.92 and 1.27 \u00c5 are within the ranges of 1.86-1.97 and 1.24-1.30 \u00c5 typically observed for the respective distances in reported six-coordinate cobalt(III) superoxo species. Relative to molecular oxygen, the O-O bond is only lengthened by ca. 0.06 \u00c5, indicating that charge donation into the dioxygen moiety is small. Characterization as a superoxo ligand is also indicated by the computed Mulliken charges for proximal and distal oxygen atoms of -0.13 and -0.22 e-, respectively, and corresponding spin charges of 0.39 and 0.63 e-, respectively. All of these data are consistent with a weak interaction of dioxygen with the metal center. Still, strong dioxygen coordination is not a prerequisite for electrocatalytic dioxygen reduction, as evidenced by Arnold's studies of a tripodal cobalt tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine complex.

The remainder of the salt was removed through successive crystallizations from CH2Cl2 and a final crystallization from acetone. The solvent from the final crystallization was removed, and the resulting oil was purified by column chromatography [4% methanol (MeOH) in CH2Cl2] with silica (neutralized with 1% NEt3 in CH2Cl2).

The product was dried further by washing with diethyl ether (3 \u00d7 10 mL) and drying under vacuum (18 h). A solution of the dried product (500 mg, 1.54 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (70 mL) was added to a solution of tren (75 mg, 0.51 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (2 mL).

The hydrochloride salt became soluble within 10 min. To the reaction was added hydroxybenzotriazole (227 mg, 1.48 mmol, 1.0 equiv). The reaction was cooled to 0 \u00b0C in an ice bath, and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC; 306 mg, 1.48 mmol, 1.0 equiv) was added as a solution in CH2Cl2 (5 mL). After 15 min, (2-aminoethyl)bis(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (300 mg, 1.23 mmol, 0.83 equiv) was added, and the reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature. After stirring for 72 h, a white precipitate had formed on top of the solution. The solids are byproducts from the coupling reaction (including a DCC hydration product, dicyclohexylurea) that are partially soluble in CH2Cl2. The solvent was removed, and MeCN (50 mL) was added to fully precipitate the byproducts. The solution was filtered through Celite, the filtrate was dried with Na2SO4, and the solvent was removed under vacuum.

Synthesis of NEt  4  [Co(TEt)] \n\nA solution of NEt4Cl (47 mg, 0.28 mmol) in CH3CN (4 mL) was added to solid K[Co(TEt)] (116 mg, 0.283 mmol). The suspension was stirred at room temperature for 3 days. The reaction was filtered to obtain KCl as a white solid and the product NEt  4  [Co(TEt)] as a blue filtrate. The filtrate was concentrated to ca. 2 mL and passed through a microfiber glass filter plug to remove any residual KCl, and Et2O (12 mL) was added to the solution. Pure product slowly crystallized after cooling to -10 \u00b0C. Combining metalation with cation exchange is feasible; however, these reactions consistently resulted in lower overall purity. This is due to the similar relative solubilities of NEt  4  [Co(L)] and any contaminating ligand, which hinders reprecipitation or crystallization attempts.
