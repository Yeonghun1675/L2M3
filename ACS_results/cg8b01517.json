There is one zinc(II) ion, one phosphite anion (HPO3)2-, a half deprotonated carboxylate ligand (L2-), and one protonated dimethylamine cation (NH2(CH3)2)+ (see (a)) in the asymmetric unit, indicating a formula of [H2N(CH3)2]2[Zn2L(HPO3)2]. The zinc ion is tetrahedrally coordinated by one carboxylate oxygen atom and three phosphite oxygen atoms with the Zn-O bond lengths ranging from 1.9326(19) to 1.9715(18) \u00c5 and O-Zn-O bond angles from 100.32(8) to 127.62(11)\u00b0 (see Tables S2 and S3). In the phosphite anion, the P-O bond lengths are in the range of 1.511(2) to 1.5212(19) \u00c5, and the P-H bond length is 1.37(2) \u00c5, showing a pseudopyramid geometry. The O-P-O and O-P-H bond angles range from 103.9(10) to 127.62(11)\u00b0, which are all comparable to those of other zinc phosphites. Each phosphite group bridges three zinc(II) ions via its three oxygen atoms. These ZnO4 and HPO3 tetrahedrons assemble via a corner sharing mode into a two-dimensional (2D) layer in the bc-plane with Zn4P4 eight-membered rings (see (b)). The dicarboxylic acid ligand is fully deprotonated and shows a trans bis-monodentate coordination mode, which is similar to BDC and BPDC. The 2D zinc phosphite layers are further connected by these carboxylate ligands to form a three-dimensional (3D) framework structure with narrow channels (4.743(0) \u00d7 21.937(11) \u00c52) running along the b-axis and methyl groups dangling on the walls (see (c)). The total potential solvent area volume is determined to be 359.3 \u00c53, which is about 21.9% of the unit cell volume (1643.3 \u00c53). The channels are filled with protonated dimethylamine cations, which originate from the hydrolysis of DMF and form plenty of N-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O and C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O interactions with neighboring carboxylate oxygen atoms and phosphite oxygen atoms (see Table S4). Weak \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions between neighboring phenyl rings are also observed (see Table S5). N2 sorption/desorption analyses were carried out to examine the porosity of compound 1 at 77 K. It shows typical type-I gas uptake isotherms (see Figure S2). The total N2 uptake and BET surface area are determined to be 19.925 cm3 g-1 (STP) and 17.701 m2 g-1, respectively.\n\nCompound 1 is thermal stable up to 280 \u00b0C (see Figure S3). Upon further heating, two overlapping weight losses (69.4%) occur in the range of 280-600 \u00b0C, corresponding to the removal of one dicarboxylate ligand and two protonated dimethylamine molecules in each formula (61.5%). The chemical stability of compound 1 was also investigated by immersing the crystalline samples into water, boiling water, HCl, and NaOH solutions. It was found that it could retain its crystallinity in water for 1 week, boiling water for 2 days (see Figure S1), and a wide pH range (3-11) of HCl and NaOH solutions for 1 day (see ), demonstrating its remarkable chemical stability. As we know, the number of chemical stable MOF compounds is still limited. The present work suggests that zinc phosphite carboxylates could be an alternative strategy for the development of stable MOF materials.\n\nThe solid state emission spectra of compound 1 and ligand H2L were recorded at room temperature (see Figure S4). By exciting at 315 nm, compound 1 displays a broad emission band with a maximum lying at about 359 nm, which could be attributed to the intraligand \u03c0* \u2192 \u03c0 transition, because it resembles the free ligand (355 nm) and the character of Zn(II) ions, which are difficult to oxidize or reduce. The slight red shift compared with H2L could be ascribed to the coordination of the ligand to the metal centers.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "Compound 1", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "[H2N(CH3)2]2[Zn2L(HPO3)2]"}, "crystal system": [{"value": "monoclinic", "condition": ""}], "space group": [{"value": "P21/c", "condition": ""}], "porosity": [{"probe": "N2", "value": "19.925", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "condition": "77 K"}], "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "N2", "value": "17.701", "unit": "m2 g-1", "condition": "77 K"}], "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "280", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "stable", "condition": ""}, {"value": "280-600", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "removal of one dicarboxylate ligand and two protonated dimethylamine molecules", "condition": ""}], "peak spectrum": [{"value": "359", "unit": "nm", "type": "emission", "condition": "exciting at 315 nm"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["crystal_system", "space_group", "porosity", "surface_area", "decomposition_temperature", "peak_spectrum"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['crystal_system', 'space_group', 'porosity', 'surface_area', 'decomposition_temperature', 'peak_spectrum']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"Compound 1\",\n            \"symbol\": \"1\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"[H2N(CH3)2]2[Zn2L(HPO3)2]\"\n        },\n        \"crystal system\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"monoclinic\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"space group\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"P21/c\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"porosity\": [\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"N2\",\n                \"value\": \"19.925\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n                \"condition\": \"77 K\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"surface area\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"BET\",\n                \"probe\": \"N2\",\n                \"value\": \"17.701\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2 g-1\",\n                \"condition\": \"77 K\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"decomposition temperature\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"280\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"stable\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"280-600\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"removal of one dicarboxylate ligand and two protonated dimethylamine molecules\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"peak spectrum\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"359\",\n                \"unit\": \"nm\",\n                \"type\": \"emission\",\n                \"condition\": \"exciting at 315 nm\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 7, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) The coordination environments of the ligand L<sup>2\u2013</sup> and zinc ion in <bold>1</bold>.
