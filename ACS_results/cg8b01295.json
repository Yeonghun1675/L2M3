The c(Na+) was continuously decreased as time went on, and kept in line with the amount of the residual OIV measured by the UV-vis spectra. This phenomena suggested that both OIV- and Na+ were absorbed simultaneously from the solution. Since the unit cell volume of the new phases 1-adsorb or 2-adsorb was larger than that of 1\u22c54H2O or 2\u22c5H2O, some OIV- and Na+ ions might squeeze into the free space in-between the 2D layers of 1\u22c54H2O or 2\u22c5H2O, which caused the expansion between the layers. The driving force of such an insertion was supposed to be the H-bonding and electrostatic interactions between the 2D layer and OIV-/Na+, which might cause the elimination or addition of the lattice H2O molecules from/into the layer structures. These interactions did lead to the decrease or increase of lattice H2O molecules in 3 and 4. SEM and TEM images (Figure S9) revealed that there was no obvious stratification of the complexes after adsorption, which demonstrated that some interactions were still maintained between the 2D layers.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 24, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<title>Photocurrent Responses</title><p>The cyclic\nvoltammograms (CV)\nand photocurrent responses of the parent complexes <bold>1</bold>\u00b74H<sub>2</sub>O and <bold>2</bold>\u00b7H<sub>2</sub>O and their OIV composites <bold>3</bold> and <bold>4</bold> were examined by the method described\nin our previous work.

Both compounds show two-dimensional layer structures derived from interconnecting dinuclear [Zn2(1,2,3-BTC)2(H2O)2] units through the bfps bridges and the [Zn(H2O)4] species (1\u22c54H2O) or interlinking dinuclear [Zn2(1,3,5-HBTC)2] units via pairs of bfps bridges and pairs of 1,3,5-HBTC dianions (2\u22c5H2O). They display high absorptive capacities toward Orange IV (OIV) in water, i.e., 718 mg\u22c5g-1 (1\u22c54H2O) and 794 mg\u22c5g-1 (2\u22c5H2O), respectively.

These CPs could adsorb Orange IV (OIV) with capacities of 718 mg\u22c5g-1 and 794 mg\u22c5g-1, respectively. Compared with those of the two parent CPs, the resulting two CP-OIV composites exhibited enhanced photocurrent responses.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nSynthesis and Structural Characterization\n\nCompounds 1\u22c54H2O and 2\u22c5H2O were prepared via the one-pot hydrothermal reactions of Zn(OAc)2\u22c52H2O, bfps, and 1,2,3-H3BTC (or 1,3,5-H3BTC) in a molar ratio of 3:1:2 or 1:1:1. Changing the molar ratios of reactants and the pH values of the solutions could not increase their yields. The two compounds were air and moisture stable, and insoluble and stable in water and common organic solvents such as CHCl3, CH2Cl2, CH3CN, CH3OH, and CH3CH2OH, which was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns (Figure S1). Their elemental analyses were in agreement with their chemical formulas. The IR spectra of 1\u22c54H2O and 2\u22c5H2O showed strong bands for C\ue5fbO of bfps at 1690 and 1700 cm-1, respectively. The characteristic bands at 1570, 1467, 1430, and 779 cm-1 for 1\u22c54H2O, and 1565, 1476, 1421, and 724 cm-1 for 2\u22c5H2O were assigned as the C-N stretching vibrations of the pyridyl ring of bfps. Strong peaks at 1384 cm-1 for 1\u22c54H2O and 2\u22c5H2O may be attributed to the carboxylate groups. The broad peaks at ~3400 cm-1 indicated the presence of the coordinated and crystal lattice water molecules. Thermogravimetric analyses of 1\u22c54H2O and 2\u22c5H2O (Figure S3a) revealed that after the elimination of water molecules before 190 \u00b0C (1\u22c54H2O, weight loss 15.3%, calcd 16.4%) and 210 \u00b0C (2\u22c5H2O, weight loss 3.7%, calcd 3.0%), these compounds came to lose the bfps and 1,2,3-BTC (or 1,3,5-HBTC) ligands at higher temperatures, and finally they left the ZnO residue at 570 \u00b0C (1\u22c54H2O: 25.3%, calcd. 22.3%) and 640 \u00b0C (2\u22c5H2O: 15.0%, calcd 13.6%), respectively.\n\nThe resulting CP-OIV composites were separated by centrifugation and rinsed repeatedly with water, and named as 3 and 4, respectively. Their colors were obviously changed from pale yellow into dark-yellow (). The UV-vis spectra of 3 and 4 showed broad absorptions between 360 and 520 nm (Figure S2a). Elemental analyses for C, H, N, and S coupled with the zinc contents obtained by using inductive coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP) (3: 10.92%, calcd 11.05% and 4: 6.25%, calcd 6.30%) tentatively confirmed their chemical formulas to be 1\u22c52.0OIV (3) and 2\u22c51.1OIV\u22c52.5H2O (4), which also matched well with the results calculated from the above-mentioned UV-vis measurements. According to the survey X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) spectra (Figure S4) of 1\u22c54H2O, 2\u22c5H2O, 3, and 4, peaks attributed to Zn 2p3/2 were all found at ~1022 eV, suggesting the Zn centers in these complexes all maintained the oxidation state of +2. In addition, the S 2p peak at ~168 eV in 3 and 4 could be attributed to the existence of the OIV- anion. The IR spectra of 3 and 4 (Figure S5) showed the bands related to the C = O (1690 cm-1), the py group (1595, ~1570, ~1467, and 1430 cm-1) and the -COO- group (1385 cm-1) of the bfps ligand, and the bands of -SO3 - (~1123, ~1037, and 1008 cm-1) of the OIV- anion. The thermogravimetric analysis of 3 and 4 (Figure S3b) showed the weight loss of water molecules at 105 \u00b0C (3: 7.1%, calcd 6.1% and 4: 4.6%, calcd 4.3%). Upon heating up to 630 \u00b0C, it showed the combined loss of bfps, 1,2,3-BTC (or 1,3,5-HBTC), and OIV species, and finally left ZnO as a residual component (3: 14.9%, calcd 13.8% and 4: 7.7%, calcd 7.8%).\n\nAccording to , the PXRD patterns of the bulk samples of 1\u22c54H2O and 2\u22c5H2O correlated well with those simulated from the their corresponding single crystal data. Nevertheless, the PXRD patterns of 3 and 4 indicated that the main structures of 1\u22c54H2O and 2\u22c5H2O were partially maintained, while some new peaks (marked with squares and circles in the patterns, respectively for 3 and 4) which did not belong to those of OIV were also observed. Pawley fittings of the PXRD patterns (Pawley refinement using TOPAS-Academic program) of 3 or 4 were employed, which demonstrated that two phases might coexist in each case. Therefore, 3 may consist of 1\u22c54H2O and a new phase, namely, 1-adsorb, which was indexed to have the rough unit cell parameters: triclinic, a = 9.763(4) \u00c5, b = 12.302(5) \u00c5, c = 15.822(6) \u00c5, \u03b1 = 81.48 (3)\u00b0, \u03b2 = 116.93 (4)\u00b0, \u03b3 = 73.14 (3)\u00b0, V = 1532.1(14) \u00c53 (Figure S6). Similarly, 4 may contain 2\u22c5H2O and another new phase, namely, 2-adsorb, which held the following unit cell parameters: triclinic, a = 9.587(2) \u00c5, b = 12.029(7) \u00c5, c = 13.404(4) \u00c5, \u03b1 = 100.23 (2)\u00b0, \u03b2 = 109.54 (3)\u00b0, \u03b3 = 104.52 (3)\u00b0, V = 1350.6(11) \u00c53 (Figure S7).\n\nAs presented in , the four compounds brought about the recurring anodic photocurrents of 0.32 \u03bcA (1\u22c54H2O), 2.46 \u03bcA (2\u22c5H2O), 7.48 \u03bcA (3), and 7.62 \u03bcA (4), respectively. The photocurrents of the OIV composites 3 and 4 were 23.4 times and 3.1 times higher than those of 1\u22c54H2O and 2\u22c5H2O. Such an enhancement in photocurrent responses was assumed to be the introduction of the light-adsorptive OIV species, which caused a remarkable reduction in the band gap from 1\u22c54H2O (3.46 eV) to 3 (1.98 eV) or from 2\u22c5H2O (3.43 eV) to 4 (2.00 eV, Figure S2b, measured form the solid-state diffusion-reflectance spectra) and was helpful to the electron transportation. Notably, when the OIV contents of 4 were larger than that of 3 (based on the above-mentioned absorptive capacities 718 mg\u22c5g-1 and 794 mg\u22c5g-1 for 1\u22c54H2O and 2\u22c5H2O), the photocurrent of 4 was slightly larger than that of 3.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "35.6", "unit":
