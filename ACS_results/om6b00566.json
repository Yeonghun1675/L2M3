PhSiH3 (6.2 \u03bcL, 50 \u03bcmol) was added at -30 \u00b0C. While the tube was kept in the cooling bath, the temperature was raised slowly to room temperature. A uniform batch of colorless blocklike crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction grew over the time of 1 week. The crystals were separated from the mother liquor and washed twice with cold pentane (500 \u03bcL at -30 \u00b0C each) to be measured. Yield: 23 mg, 86%. Dissolving the complex in C6D6 gave immediate decomposition into homoleptic species and gave a precipitate of presumably CaH2. Anal. Calcd for (AdAmDIPPCaH)3\u22c52THF, C113H166Ca3N6O2: C, 77.08; H, 9.50. Found: C, 77.50; H, 9.42. The elemental analysis matches better with for a product in which one molecule of THF is lost during workup. (AdAmDIPPCaH)3\u22c5THF, C109H158Ca3N6O: C, 77.53; H, 9.43.
