Equimolar reactions using each binuclear complex and their brominated complexes produced needle-shaped single crystals suitable for X-ray crystallography of the target two-legged MX-ladder compounds (for details, see the ). The crystal structures of 1 and 2 were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD). Two-legged MX ladder 1 crystallizes in the P21/c space group. As shown in Figure , 1 has a clear two-legged ladder structure, where two bromide-bridged platinum MX chains constitute its legs. Compound 1 is an analogue of {[PtBr(dien)]2(bpy)}Br4\u22c52H2O, where the counteranion is NO3 - instead of Br-. Interchain separation through the rung bpy is 11.186 \u00c5. The bridging Br- are well-ordered, deviating from the midpoint between adjacent Pt ions, and there are two crystallographically independent Pt sites in the unit cell, indicating that the electronic state within one MX leg corresponds to the PtII/PtIV mixed-valence CDW (\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5PtII\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Br-PtIV-Br\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5) state. As is clearly seen in Figure a, all rung bpy and dien units are well-ordered and are arranged with 2-fold periodicity within the ladder. It should be noted that there are two types of Pt-Pt distances along the MX leg (5.730 or 5.683 \u00c5). In the longer Pt-Pt (5.730 \u00c5) part, PtII\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Br (Pt2-Br2) and PtIV-Br (Pt1-Br2) distances are 3.296 and 2.477 \u00c5, respectively. For the shorter Pt-Pt (5.683 \u00c5) part, PtII\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Br (Pt2-Br1) and PtIV-Br (Pt1-Br1) distances are 3.213 and 2.487 \u00c5, respectively. Interestingly, a unique \"zigzag\"-type MX leg quite different from {[PtBr(dien)]2(bpy)}Br4\u22c52H2O is formed in 1 (Figure b), which is the first example of an MX ladder with \"zigzag\" MX legs. Considering the deviations of each Br- within the ladder structure of 1, it was found that a pair of out-of-phase CDWs is achieved, where the opposite site of PtII along the rung is PtIV, and vice versa. Compound 1 is the second example of an MX ladder with out-of-phase CDW valence arrangement (the first example is shown in ref ). In addition, this valence arrangement of a pair of out-of-phase CDWs is also three-dimensionally ordered between adjacent ladders, where in-phase- and out-of-phase-type arrangements are formed along the a- and c-axes, respectively, as shown in Figure c. NO3 - anions are located among the adjacent ladders interacting with amine groups of the dien units (O1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5N6, O3\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5N3, O7A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5N8, O9A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5N5, and O12A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5N3) through hydrogen bonds (Figure d).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 23, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Two-legged ladder structure, (b) MX leg structure\nfrom a side view of the ladder, (c) perspective view of 3-D packing,\nand (d) hydrogen bonds (light-blue dotted lines) between the ladder\nlattice and NO<sub>3</sub>\n<sup>\u2013</sup> of <bold>1</bold> at\n100 K.

Figure  shows the correlation between the d and E CT estimated from optical measurements on several MX chains and two-legged MX ladders reported so far. In the case of a single MX chain system, a linear correlation between the d and E CT can be seen (denoted by the dotted line in Figure ). As described above, in 1 and 3, four types of Pt-X distances could be considered within the MX leg.

Remarkably, the difference in E CT value between the MX chain and two-legged MX ladder systems becomes larger with increasing d. In addition, it is suggested that the difference in the rung length is not so effective, with regard to the trend of E CT values in the two-legged MX ladder system, compared with the degree of distortion of the MX leg (i.e., d value), because 3, with the longest rung length (~13.08 \u00c5), exhibits a very similar trend for E CT to the previous chloride-bridged MX ladder with the shortest rung length (~5.47 \u00c5).

On the\nother hand, in the case of the larger <italic toggle=\"yes\">d</italic> region (X\n= Cl<sup>\u2013</sup>, \u03b4 is relatively large), the large CDW\namplitude within each MX leg might provide strong <italic toggle=\"yes\">V</italic>\n<sub>rung</sub>, resulting in an extremely high <italic toggle=\"yes\">E</italic>\n<sub>CT</sub> value.

From recent theoretical studies on two-legged MX ladders, the existence of interchain Coulomb interactions through the rung would explain the relatively high E CT values, compared with those of MX chains (because V rung = 0 in the case of a single MX chain). Here, we discuss the origin of the distinct tendency of E CT in two-legged MX ladder system with \"straight\" MX legs including 2 and 3, as shown in Figure . Considering the degree of distortion of the MX leg, the valence structure of the CDW state within one leg can be formally written as  \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5   Pt   3 - \u03b4   \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5   X-Pt   3 + \u03b4   -X\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5   Pt   3 - \u03b4   \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5   X-Pt   3 + \u03b4   -X \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5 \u2063  ( 0 < \u03b4 \u2264 1 )   where \u03b4 corresponds to the d (i.e., amplitude of the CDW). Figure  shows a schematic of the CT excitation in a two-legged MX ladder with an out-of-phase CDW state based on the extended Peierls-Hubbard model, where the degree of distortion of the MX leg is taken into account. In the smaller d region (X = Br- and I-, \u03b4 is relatively small), the CDW amplitude within each MX leg can be considered to be small, and, therefore, the intersite Coulomb repulsion between adjacent chains within the ladder (V rung) is expected to become weaker upon CT excitation. On the other hand, in the case of the larger d region (X = Cl-, \u03b4 is relatively large), the large CDW amplitude within each MX leg might provide strong V rung, resulting in an extremely high E CT value. Because the CDW amplitude corresponds to the degree of localization of the charge on the Pt site (i.e., distinctiveness of PtII and PtIV sites), the relative strength of the V rung is dominated by the CDW amplitude, and as a result, a distinct trend of the E CT value in the two-legged MX-ladder system might be observed.
