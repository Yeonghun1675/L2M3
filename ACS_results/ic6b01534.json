The proton conductivity is arguably high, due to the protonation of water by the acidity of pyridinium. Low activation energy was also achieved in the MOF, due to the disordered water sites by design. This result provides us confirmation of the strategy that the fluctuated hydrogen bond in the rigid and periodic framework could enhance the proton motion and proton conductivity.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 14, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information is available free of\ncharge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications\nwebsite</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b01534\">10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b01534</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Experimental details,\nTG, IR and powder XRD patterns (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b01534/suppl_file/ic6b01534_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Crystallographic information (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b01534/suppl_file/ic6b01534_si_002.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Crystallographic\ninformation (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b01534/suppl_file/ic6b01534_si_003.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b01534.
