The Cu ion has distorted octahedral geometry with two nitrogen atoms of the 4,4'-bipyridine molecules, three coordinated water molecules, and one carboxylate oxygen atom. The CuO4N2 octahedral units linked through 4,4'-bipyridine molecules to form the one-dimensional wirelike structure (a).

Compound 2 crystallizes in the chiral space group P65 with a Flack parameter of 0.03, indicating enantioenrichment of the single crystal despite the use of achiral reagents. The asymmetric unit contains one Cu ion, one FDC anion, one 4,4'-bpy ligand, one coordinated and lattice water molecule. The Cu ion adopts distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry with two oxygen atoms from the carboxylate moiety, one from a coordinated water molecule, and two nitrogen from the 4,4'-bipyridine molecule. The Cu-O/N bond lengths are in the range of 1.951-2.386 \u00c5 (Table S4). The FDC anion links two Cu ions in monodentate fashion and the 4,4'-bipyridine molecule bonded to two Cu ions.
