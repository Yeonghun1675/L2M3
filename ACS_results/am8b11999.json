As shown in Figure S10, the 77 K N2 adsorption of FJU-88a is much less and with no pore volume, which may be caused by the removal of solvent from pores and the collapse of porous structures, as the further PXRD patterns confirm (Figure S6). In contrast, the activated FJU-89a showed two types of combined isotherms: type I, a steep rise in the low-pressure range, and type IV, obvious adsorption-desorption hysteresis in the relative pressure range of 0.5-0.9 (a). Such combined adsorption behavior has also been observed in other hierarchically porous MOFs. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and Langmuir surface area calculated from the N2 adsorption isotherms are 774 and 1202 m2/g, respectively (Figure S11). The total pore volume obtained from the maximum N2 uptake is 0.68 cm3/g (including 0.32 cm3/g of micropore volume), slightly lower than the theoretical value of 1.16 cm3/g. The difference between theoretical and experimental results is mainly due to the shrinkage of the activated host framework, which was further confirmed by the PXRD patterns (Figure S7). The pore-size distribution (PSD) of FJU-89a was calculated using the no-local density functional theory (NLDFT) model, showing the coexistence of micropores and mesopores as the major pores located in the range of 0.5-1.1 and 8-12 nm, respectively (b).\n\nGas Adsorption\n\nEstablishment of permanent porosity and optimized pore space within the framework of FJU-89a encourages us to study its adsorption and separation performances.

Similarly, the uptake value of C2H2 is 101.4 cm3/g, which is higher than the values of CO2 (61.1 cm3/g) and CH4 (14.0 cm3/g), at 296 K and 1 bar (d). Although the uptake capacity of C2H2 in FJU-89a at 296 K is lower than some famous MOFs with high density of open-metal sites, for example, FJI-H8 (224 cm3/g) and HKUST-1 (201 cm3/g), the adsorbed C2H2 is comparable to FJU-22a (114.8 cm3/g) and TIFSIX-2-Cu-i (91.8 cm3/g) and much higher than ZJU-196a (83.5 cm3/g), UTSA-300a (68.9 cm3/g), and NKMOF-1-Ni (61.0 cm3/g). The zero surface coverage isosteric heat of adsorptions (Q st) of C2H2, CO2, and CH4 for FJU-89a, derived from the 273 K and 296 K adsorption isotherms and fitted using the virial equation, are 31.0, 27.8, and 18.1 kJ/mol, respectively (Figure S12).
