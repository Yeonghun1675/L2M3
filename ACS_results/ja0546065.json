Upon dehydration, the compound retains crystallinity and exhibits a type I N2 sorption isotherm, characteristic of a microporous solid with apparent Langmuir surface area 939 m2/g and pore volume 0.31 cm3/g. Magnetic measurements for both 1 and dehydrated 1 show the spin-canted antiferromagnetic state below 5 K and a magnetic hysteresis loop at 2 K. Thus, dehydrated 1 represents the first metal-organic framework for which microporosity and a spin-canted antiferromagnetic state coexist, which demonstrates that the self-assembly of organo-polymetal clusters and metal ions can provide a potential route to magnetic porous metal-organic frameworks. \n\nJust like many other metal carboxylate frameworks, the decorated anatase framework is also porous. There are channels along the [100] and [010] axes with larger dimensions, ca. 9.5 \u00d7 4.3 \u00c5 for 1 (Figure d), compared with ca. 3.7 \u00d7 2.8 \u00c5 in anatase. The channels above connect with each other, which produces an intersecting 3D pore occupied by lattice water molecules. To determine the permanent microporosity, the gas sorption isotherm is measured (Figure S7). A plot of weight sorbed per gram of dehydrated 1 vs p/p 0 reveals a reversible type I isotherm. Assuming a monolayer coverage of N2, the apparent Langmuir surface area is found to be 939 m2/g with pore volume 0.31 cm3/g (0.49 cm3/cm3). In contrast, for zeolites, apparent surface areas up to 500 m2/g (Faujasite) and pore volumes up to 0.47 cm3/cm3 (zeolite A) have been reported. \n\nRemarkably, these magnetic properties are largely retained by the porous framework of dehydrated 1 (Figure S10). The dc magnetic data in the range 2-20 K under low field show an increase below 5 K. The ac susceptibility shows the onset of a frequency-dependent out-of-phase ac signal   below 5 K. A hysteresis is also observed at 2 K with H c of 17 Oe, M r of 96 Oe emu mol-1, and M s (2 K) of 35.4 kOe emu mol-1, corresponding to a canting angle \u03c6 of 35.2\u00b0. Thus, dehydrated 1 represents the first metal-organic framework for which microporosity and spin-canted antiferromagnetism coexist although H c is small.
