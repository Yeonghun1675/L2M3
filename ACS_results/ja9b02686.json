A thorough activation process was therefore performed, which consisted of washing several times with dry acetonitrile for 48 h and subsequent overnight heating at 150 \u00b0C under vacuum. This yields an activated form of MUV-3, as demonstrated by XRPD (Figure S2).\n\nGas Sorption in MUV-3\n\nThe porous nature of MUV-3 was assessed by N2 sorption at 77 K. Activation of MUV-3 prior to measurement was achieved by treating the washed material at 150 \u00b0C under vacuum overnight. a displays a characteristic two-step N2 adsorption isotherm, with a plateau at 260 cm3 g-1, which is reminiscent of that of the analogous ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 materials. Such a similar structural response upon sorption is attributed to the flexibility of the ligands. The obtained accessible surface area was calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model, giving a value of 960 m2 g-1, which is significantly lower than that of ZIF-8 (ca. 1400 m2 g-1) likely due to the presence of organic molecules remaining in the pores. The CO2 sorption at 298 K, shown in b, reveals a total uptake of 2.9 mmol g-1 at 18 bar, whereas an isosteric heat of adsorption, q st, is found to be 20 kJ mol-1 (Figure S16).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MUV-3", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "200", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "weight loss", "condition": "4% weight loss"}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "260", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "", "condition": "two-step N2 adsorption isotherm"}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "2.9", "unit": "mmol g-1", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "18 bar", "condition": "total uptake"}], "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "960", "unit": "m2 g-1", "condition": "calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["decomposition_temperature", "gas_adsorption", "surface_area"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['decomposition_temperature', 'gas_adsorption', 'surface_area']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[{\n\"meta\":{\"name\":\"MUV-3\", \"symbol\":\"\", \"chemical formula\":\"\"},\n\"decomposition temperature\": [\n    {\n        \"value\": \"200\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"weight loss\",\n        \"condition\": \"4% weight loss\"\n    }\n],\n\"gas adsorption\": [\n    {\n        \"adsorbate\": \"N2\",\n        \"adsorbed amount\": \"260\",\n        \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n        \"temperature\": \"77 K\",\n        \"pressure\": \"\",\n        \"condition\": \"two-step N2 adsorption isotherm\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"adsorbate\": \"CO2\",\n        \"adsorbed amount\": \"2.9\",\n        \"unit\": \"mmol g-1\",\n        \"temperature\": \"298 K\",\n        \"pressure\": \"18 bar\",\n        \"condition\": \"total uptake\"\n    }\n],\n\"surface area\": [\n    {\n        \"type\": \"BET\",\n        \"probe\": \"\",\n        \"value\": \"960\",\n        \"unit\": \"m2 g-1\",\n        \"condition\": \"calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model\"\n    }\n]\n}]\n```"}}, {"idx": 6, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Synthetic route to form MUV-3.
