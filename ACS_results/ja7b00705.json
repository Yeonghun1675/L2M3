Remarkably, compound 2 exhibits an open hysteresis loop up to 100 K under a field-sweep rate of 0.05 Oe/s (see ). Furthermore, examination of plots of magnetization versus applied field provides intrinsic coercive fields of H ci = 4520, 2270, 186, 25, and 9 Oe at 1.8, 10, 60, 90, and 100 K, respectively, with field-sweep rates of 4.5, 4.4, 0.9, 0.09, and 0.05 Oe/s. The intrinsic coercivity for 2 at 1.8 K is nearly twice that reported for 1 and is similar to that reported for 1a. Although this difference is likely best attributed to an increase in magnetic anisotropy in moving from 1 to 2, a detailed understanding of this comparison is not immediately forthcoming. Finally, at 60 K, 2 exhibits an intrinsic coercivity that is an order of magnitude larger than that reported for 1. In all three compounds, steps in the low temperature magnetic hysteresis are observed near zero-field. While the exact nature of this feature is currently unknown, it likely reflects the magnetic anisotropy of the sample due to the strong intralayer and relatively weak interlayer interactions.\n\nElectrical Conductivity\n\nBulk magnetic ordering in these compounds is accompanied by electrical conductivity, a rare occurrence in metal-organic materials. Conductivity measurements were performed on pressed pellets of 1, 1a, 2, and 3 using two-probe dc current-voltage techniques (see  and S12). For 1, an ambient temperature conductivity of \u03c3 = 1.4(7) \u00d7 10-2 S/cm was measured. Desolvation of 1 to form 1a resulted in a decrease to \u03c3 = 1.0(3) \u00d7 10-3 S/cm at ambient temperature. This small decrease is likely attributable to the slight structural distortion of the honeycomb network following desolvation, which results in a decrease in overlap between metal- and ligand-based orbitals. Indeed, a similar structural distortion and corresponding decrease in conductivity has been observed in topologically similar MOFs. \n\nChemical reduction to 2 causes a slight reduction in the conductivity to \u03c3 = 5.1(3) \u00d7 10-4 S/cm at ambient temperature. This decrease likely stems from transitioning from incomplete ligand reduction in 1, which enables ligand mixed-valency and high charge mobility by facile charge hopping, to removal of mixed valency in 2. The decrease in conductivity may seem at odds with the formal addition of a high-energy electron into the system, but has been previously observed in a three-dimensional iron-quinoid MOF. Finally, an ambient temperature conductivity of \u03c3 = 1.5(3) \u00d7 10-9 S/cm was measured for 3 (see Figure S13). This considerably lower value in comparison to the Fe congeners likely stems from the presence of fully occupied ZnII-based d orbitals in 3, which may hinder charge hopping across the 2D layers.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nThe foregoing results demonstrate the ability of metal-quinoid solids to simultaneously exhibit high magnetic ordering temperatures and electrical conductivity. The compound (Me2NH2)2[Fe2L3]\u22c52H2O\u22c56DMF, which features formally 2:1 L3-:L2-\u22c5, undergoes magnetic ordering below 80 K and exhibits an electrical conductivity up to \u03c3 = 1.4(7) \u00d7 10-2 S/cm (E a = 0.26(1) cm-1). By virtue of its porous crystalline structure, the compound can be postsynthetically reduced to give a corresponding framework with exclusively L3-\u22c5 bridging ligands. This reduced compound shows an increase in magnetic ordering to 105 K and an open hysteresis loop at 100 K, owing to the presence of stronger magnetic exchange interactions, in addition to conductivity up to \u03c3 = 5.1(3) \u00d7 10-4 S/cm (E a = 0.34(1) cm-1). Current work is geared toward incorporation of related bridging ligands, including those with different ligand substituents and more diffuse donor atoms, in an effort to isolate MOFs that feature higher values of magnetic ordering temperature and electrical conductivity.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "(Me2NH2)2[Fe2L3]\u22c52H2O\u22c56DMF"}, "etc":
