The monolayer coverages in the pores predicted by the fitting of the Langmuir equation to the N<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> isotherms were nearly identical (3.57 mmol/g for N<sub>2</sub> and 3.71 mmol/g for H<sub>2</sub>), suggesting that the same number of binding sites are accessible in each case.\n</p>", "clean_text": "Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicates that the lattice water molecules in the hexagonal channels are easily lost under 100 \u00b0C and the framework of 1 is stable around 300 \u00b0C (Figure S3 in the ). The results of variable-temperature powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements also elucidate that the framework of 1 is stable up to 300 \u00b0C (Figure S4 in the ). N2 sorption measurements for desolvated 1 measured at 77 K revealed a type I isotherm (Figure a), which is characteristic of a microporous material. The uptake amount of N2 increases abruptly at the start of the experiment and reaches a plateau of about 80 cm3 (STP)/g, corresponding to 6.8 N2 molecules in each unit cell, indicating a uniform microporous structure. Using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation, a pore volume of 0.134 cm3/g is estimated and is smaller than the pore volume of 0.218 cm3/g calculated from the crystal structure. This discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that gas molecules are unable to fill the void space efficiently. Fitting the BET and Langmuir equations to the isotherm gave estimated surface areas of 310 and 338 m2/g, respectively.\n\nConsidering the structural features of 1 with tetrazolyl-ring-modified narrow pores, H2 uptake measurements were explored. It was found that the desolvated 1 can store up to 0.75 wt % (3.71 mmol/g) of H2 at 760 Torr and 77 K (Figure b); this value is comparable to those of reported porous MOFs with larger surface areas. For instance, under similar conditions, Co2(6-mna)2) and Er2(3,5-pdc)3 display H2 uptake of 0.66 and 0.68 wt %, respectively, with surface areas of 420 and 427 m2/g, respectively (6-mna = 6-mercaptonicotinate; 3,5-pdc = pyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate). The monolayer coverages in the pores predicted by the fitting of the Langmuir equation to the N2 and H2 isotherms were nearly identical (3.57 mmol/g for N2 and 3.71 mmol/g for H2), suggesting that the same number of binding sites are accessible in each case.
