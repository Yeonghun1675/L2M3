However, the lack of high hydrolytic\nstability is an obstacle for CP-MOFs in many practical applications.\nIn this work, we report a new CP-MOF, [Cu<sub>4</sub>(tdhb)] (BUT-155),\nwhich is constructed from a judiciously designed carboxylate ligand\nwith high coordination connectivity (octatopic), abundant hydrophobic\nsubstituents (six methyl groups), and substituent constrained geometry\n(tetrahedral backbone), tdhb<sup>8\u2013</sup> [H<sub>8</sub>tdhb\n= 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetrakis\u00ad(3,5-dicarboxyphenyl)-2,2\u2032,4,4\u2032,6,6\u2032-hexamethylbiphenyl)].\nBUT-155 shows high porosity with a Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller\nsurface area of 2070 m<sup>2</sup>/g. Quite interestingly, this CP-MOF\nretains its structural integrity after being treated in water for\n10 days at room temperature or in boiling water for 24 h. To the best\nof our knowledge, BUT-155 represents the first CP-MOF that is demonstrated\nto retain its structural integrity in boiling water. The high hydrolytic\nstability of BUT-155 allowed us to carry out adsorption studies of\nwater vapor and aqueous organic pollutants on it. Water-vapor adsorption\nreveals a sigmoidal isotherm and a high uptake (46.7 wt %), which\nis highly reversible and regenerable. In addition, because of the\navailability of soft-acid-type open Cu\u00ad(II) sites, BUT-155 shows a\nhigh performance for selective adsorption of soft-base-type aniline\nover water or phenol, and a naked-eye detectable color change for\nthe MOF sample accompanies this. The adsorption selectivity and high\nadsorption capacity of aniline in BUT-155 are also well-interpreted\nby single-crystal structures of the water- and aniline-included phases\nof BUT-155.</p><p>The phase purity of BUT-155a was confirmed\nby powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurement. As shown in a, the experimental\nPXRD pattern matches well with that simulated from the single-crystal\ndata, indicating its pure phase. To evaluate its porosity, a N<sub>2</sub> adsorption experiment was performed at 77 K for the guest-free\nBUT-155, which was obtained after BUT-155a was guest-exchanged with\nmethanol and subsequently evacuated under high vacuum at 100 \u00b0C.\nA typical type I isotherm was obtained, confirming the microporous\nnature of BUT-155 (b). The Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) surface\narea is estimated to be 2070 m<sup>2</sup>/g with a total pore volume\nof 0.820 cm<sup>3</sup>/g. The experimentally observed pore volume\nis very closed to the calculated pore volume (0.821 cm<sup>3</sup>/g) from the single-crystal structure of BUT-155a, indicating that\nthe sample of BUT-155a is of high purity and the framework of BUT-155a\nis rigid and well-retained after guest removal. In addition, the CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub> adsorption isotherms of\nBUT-155 were also recorded. The H<sub>2</sub> uptake of BUT-155 at\n77 K and 1 bar is 233 cm<sup>3</sup>/g (Figure S8, <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.7b07920/suppl_file/am7b07920_si_001.pdf\">Supporting Information</ext-link>). The CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> uptakes at 298 K and 1 bar are 62.2 and 17.0 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, and\nthose at 273 K and 1 bar are 112.3 and 23.5 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, respectively\n(Figures S9 and S10, <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.7b07920/suppl_file/am7b07920_si_001.pdf\">Supporting Information</ext-link>).</p><title>Water-Vapor Adsorption</title><p>Water-vapor\nadsorption in MOFs is potentially used in many aspects, such as heat\npumps, adsorption chillers, thermal batteries, and the delivery of\ndrinking water in remote areas. Until now, a few results\nhave been reported in the study of water adsorption of MOFs; however,\nmost of the investigated MOFs are based on high-oxidation-state metals\nsuch as such as Cr<sup>3+</sup>, Fe<sup>3+</sup>, Al<sup>3+</sup>,\nand Zr<sup>4+</sup>. Limited works have been reported\nfor water adsorption in CP-MOFs because most CP-MOFs are unstable\nin high water-vapor pressures. The high stability of BUT-155 in water\nencouraged us to investigate its water adsorption property. The water\nisotherm of BUT-155 measured at 25 \u00b0C shows a sigmoidal profile\n(a), where\nthe water uptake gradually increases in the low pressure range (<italic>P</italic>/<italic>P</italic>\n<sub>0</sub> &lt; 0.24), followed by\nan abrupt uptake in the pressure range from <italic>P</italic>/<italic>P</italic>\n<sub>0</sub> = 0.24 to 0.30 and then a gradual increase\nat higher pressures to the maximum uptake (585 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, 46.7\nwt %) at <italic>P</italic>/<italic>P</italic>\n<sub>0</sub> = 0.87.\nThe relatively low water uptake in the low pressure range (<italic>P</italic>/<italic>P</italic>\n<sub>0</sub> &lt; 0.24) indicates that\nthe affinity between water molecules and the pore surface of BUT-155\nis low regardless of the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Cu\u00ad(II)\nsites, which should strongly interact with water molecules by coordination\nbonding. This may  result from its relatively large pore size and\nhydrophobicity of the organic linker. A hysteresis loop between the\nwater adsorption and desorption branches was found, which is also\nfound in most MOFs.\n</p><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, a new copper\u00ad(II)-paddlewheel\nMOF, BUT-155, showing a 3D 4,8-connected framework structure with <italic>scu</italic>-a topology, has been synthesized from a judiciously\ndesigned octatopic carboxylate ligand, which features a tetrahedral\nbackbone imposed by six methyl substituents. After guest removal,\nthe MOF is highly porous with a BET surface area of 2070 m<sup>2</sup>/g. Notably, unlike most copper\u00ad(II)-paddlewheel-based MOFs, BUT-155\nretains its structural integrity in liquid water at RT or even in\nboiling water.

However, the lack of high hydrolytic stability is an obstacle for CP-MOFs in many practical applications. In this work, we report a new CP-MOF, [Cu4(tdhb)] (BUT-155), which is constructed from a judiciously designed carboxylate ligand with high coordination connectivity (octatopic), abundant hydrophobic substituents (six methyl groups), and substituent constrained geometry (tetrahedral backbone), tdhb8- [H8tdhb = 3,3',5,5'-tetrakis(3,5-dicarboxyphenyl)-2,2',4,4',6,6'-hexamethylbiphenyl)]. BUT-155 shows high porosity with a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of 2070 m2/g. Quite interestingly, this CP-MOF retains its structural integrity after being treated in water for 10 days at room temperature or in boiling water for 24 h. To the best of our knowledge, BUT-155 represents the first CP-MOF that is demonstrated to retain its structural integrity in boiling water. The high hydrolytic stability of BUT-155 allowed us to carry out adsorption studies of water vapor and aqueous organic pollutants on it. Water-vapor adsorption reveals a sigmoidal isotherm and a high uptake (46.7 wt %), which is highly reversible and regenerable. In addition, because of the availability of soft-acid-type open Cu(II) sites, BUT-155 shows a high performance for selective adsorption of soft-base-type aniline over water or phenol, and a naked-eye detectable color change for the MOF sample accompanies this. The adsorption selectivity and high adsorption capacity of aniline in BUT-155 are also well-interpreted by single-crystal structures of the water- and aniline-included phases of BUT-155.\n\nThe phase purity of BUT-155a was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurement. As shown in a, the experimental PXRD pattern matches well with that simulated from the single-crystal data, indicating its pure phase. To evaluate its porosity, a N2 adsorption experiment was performed at 77 K for the guest-free BUT-155, which was obtained after BUT-155a was guest-exchanged with methanol and subsequently evacuated under high vacuum at 100 \u00b0C. A typical type I isotherm was obtained, confirming the microporous nature of BUT-155 (b). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area is estimated to be 2070 m2/g with a total pore volume of 0.820 cm3/g. The experimentally observed pore volume is very closed to the calculated pore volume (0.821 cm3/g) from the single-crystal structure of BUT-155a, indicating that the sample of BUT-155a is of high purity and the framework of BUT-155a is rigid and well-retained after guest removal. In addition, the CO2, CH4, and H2 adsorption isotherms of BUT-155 were also recorded. The H2 uptake of BUT-155 at 77 K and 1 bar is 233 cm3/g (Figure S8, Supporting Information). The CO2 and CH4 uptakes at 298 K and 1 bar are 62.2 and 17.0 cm3/g, and those at 273 K and 1 bar are 112.3 and 23.5 cm3/g, respectively (Figures S9 and S10, Supporting Information).\n\nWater-Vapor Adsorption\n\nWater-vapor adsorption in MOFs is potentially used in many aspects, such as heat pumps, adsorption chillers, thermal batteries, and the delivery of drinking water in remote areas. Until now, a few results have been reported in the study of water adsorption of MOFs; however, most of the investigated MOFs are based on high-oxidation-state metals such as such as Cr3+, Fe3+, Al3+, and Zr4+. Limited works have been reported for water adsorption in CP-MOFs because most CP-MOFs are unstable in high water-vapor pressures. The high stability of BUT-155 in water encouraged us to investigate its water adsorption property. The water isotherm of BUT-155 measured at 25 \u00b0C shows a sigmoidal profile (a), where the water uptake gradually increases in the low pressure range (P/P 0 < 0.24), followed by an abrupt uptake in the pressure range from P/P 0 = 0.24 to 0.30 and then a gradual increase at higher pressures to the maximum uptake (585 cm3/g, 46.7 wt %) at P/P 0 = 0.87. The relatively low water uptake in the low pressure range (P/P 0 < 0.24) indicates that the affinity between water molecules and the pore surface of BUT-155 is low regardless of the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Cu(II) sites, which should strongly interact with water molecules by coordination bonding. This may  result from its relatively large pore size and hydrophobicity of the organic linker. A hysteresis loop between the water adsorption and desorption branches was found, which is also found in most MOFs. \n\nConclusions\n\nIn summary, a new copper(II)-paddlewheel MOF, BUT-155, showing a 3D 4,8-connected framework structure with scu-a topology, has been synthesized from a judiciously designed octatopic carboxylate ligand, which features a tetrahedral backbone imposed by six methyl substituents. After guest removal, the MOF is highly porous with a BET surface area of 2070 m2/g. Notably, unlike most copper(II)-paddlewheel-based MOFs, BUT-155 retains its structural integrity in liquid water at RT or even in boiling water. Water-vapor adsorption studies reveal that BUT-155 shows a sigmoidal adsorption isotherm with a maximum uptake of 46.7 wt % (585 cm3/g). After five cycles of water adsorption and desorption, the water adsorption capacity of BUT-155 stabilized at 41 wt % (515 cm3/g) with only a 12% decrease. It is also demonstrated that BUT-155 is able to selectively detect and adsorb aniline in water with a maximum uptake of 670 mg/g due to relatively strong interactions between accessible open Cu(II) sites and amine N atoms of aniline molecules, which induces a naked-eye-detectable color change of the sample. Moreover, the aniline adsorption performance of the MOF remains unchanged after the adsorbent is regenerated for five cycles. The results presented here shed some light on the design and construction of more hydrolytically stable MOFs, which are potentially useful in boarder areas.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "Copper(II)-paddlewheel-based metal-organic frameworks", "symbol": "CP-MOFs", "chemical formula": "[Cu4(tdhb)]"}, "surface area": [{"type": "Brunauer-Emmett-Teller", "probe": "", "value": "2070", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": "Guest-free BUT-155, obtained after BUT-155a was guest-exchanged with methanol and subsequently evacuated under high vacuum at 100 \u00b0C"}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "H2", "adsorbed amount": "233", "unit": "cm3/g", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "1 bar", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "62.2", "unit": "cm3/g", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "1 bar", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "CH4", "adsorbed amount": "17.0", "unit": "cm3/g", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "1 bar", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "CO2", "adsorbed amount": "112.3", "unit": "cm3/g", "temperature": "273 K", "pressure": "1 bar", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "CH4", "adsorbed amount": "23.5", "unit": "cm3/g", "temperature": "273 K", "pressure": "1 bar", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "Water-vapor", "adsorbed amount": "46.7", "unit": "wt%", "temperature": "25 \u00b0C", "pressure": "P/P 0 = 0.87", "condition": "Sigmoidal isotherm"}, {"adsorbate": "Aniline", "adsorbed amount": "670", "unit": "mg/g", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": "Selective adsorption of aniline over water or phenol"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["surface_area", "gas_adsorption"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['surface_area', 'gas_adsorption']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"Copper(II)-paddlewheel-based metal-organic frameworks\",\n            \"symbol\": \"CP-MOFs\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"[Cu4(tdhb)]\"\n        },\n        \"surface area\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"Brunauer-Emmett-Teller\",\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"2070\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"Guest-free BUT-155, obtained after BUT-155a was guest-exchanged with methanol and subsequently evacuated under high vacuum at 100 \u00b0C\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"H2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"233\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3/g\",\n                \"temperature\": \"77 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"1 bar\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"CO2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"62.2\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3/g\",\n                \"temperature\": \"298 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"1 bar\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"CH4\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"17.0\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3/g\",\n                \"temperature\": \"298 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"1 bar\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"CO2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"112.3\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3/g\",\n                \"temperature\": \"273 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"1 bar\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"CH4\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"23.5\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3/g\",\n                \"temperature\": \"273 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"1 bar\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"Water-vapor\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"46.7\",\n                \"unit\": \"wt%\",\n                \"temperature\": \"25 \u00b0C\",\n                \"pressure\": \"P/P 0 = 0.87\",\n                \"condition\": \"Sigmoidal isotherm\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"Aniline\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"670\",\n                \"unit\": \"mg/g\",\n                \"temperature\": \"\",\n                \"pressure\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"Selective adsorption of aniline over water or phenol\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 6, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Structure of the ligand H<sub>8</sub>tdhb, (b) crystal structure\nof BUT-155a, and (c) octahedral (cage A) and (d) cuboctahedral (cage\nB) cages in BUT-155a.
