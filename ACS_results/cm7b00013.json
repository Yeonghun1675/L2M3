At temperatures above 540 K the relaxation rate then decreases monotonically, while we took care not to go beyond the decomposition temperature of the sample (see TG data in ). In this temperature range all measurements were highly reproducible during several heating and cooling scans and the magnetization transients could be well described with a monoexponential function. The behavior of T 1 -1 vs T -1 above 410 K can be well described with a so-called BPP behavior (dashed line in c). From this behavior we extracted microscopic diffusion parameters such as the hopping rate of the Li+ ions (\u03c4-1 = 5 \u00d7 108 s-1 at 500 K) and the activation barrier for single Li+ jumps (E A = 0.23(1) eV). From these values, using the Einstein-Smoluchowski equation with an average jump length estimated from the shortest Li-Li distance (~ 1.5 \u00c5), a diffusion coefficient of 2\u00d710-12 m2/s is estimated (at 500 K). This value is converted, using the Nernst-Einstein equation and a Li+ concentration n  c  of 1.87 \u00d7 1028 m-3, to a bulk Li+ ion conductivity of 1.3 \u00d7 10-3 S\u22c5cm-1 at 500 K. It is remarkable that the T 1 -1 values below 410 K show a distinct shoulder which might hint at a complex diffusion mechanism involving multiple Li sites and even faster hopping on shorter length scales.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 18, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig5\" position=\"float\">\n<label>5</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Static <sup>7</sup>Li NMR spectra of Li<sub>4</sub>PS<sub>4</sub>I for temperatures between 250 and 540 K.
