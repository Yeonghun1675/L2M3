The two adjacent sheets are further connected by oxalate to generate the 3D frameworks, as illustrated in Figure S2, . An alternate description in the cationic layer is two adjacent Sm(III) ions are first linked into a dimer through the Hpimda2- ligand, and the next two adjacent Sm(III) ions alternately are linked through the \u03bc4-oxobridged anion a little out of plane to produce a dimer, then the three adjacent dimers are arranged alternately in a Sm6 hexagonal ring as the secondary building unit (SBU). Six Sm(III) ions are almost coplanar, and the Sm\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Sm\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Sm angles are within the range from 97.33(2) to 122 0.05(9)\u00b0, while the adjacent Sm(III)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Sm(III) distances vary from 6.337(2) to 6.808(5) \u00c5. Thus, the sheets can be represented topologically by the alternating [Ln2(Hpimda)2] n  \"hexagonal circle\" SBUs, and the connections between them as an order of (3, 3) net (see Figure ). The hexagonal units propagate infinitely along the bc plane to generate a 2D grid, which are further assembled into the 3D non-interpenetration porous framework via oxalate and Hpimda2- bridged ligands acting as pillar, and the coordination fashions of the oxalate in the complex differ essentially from those of the analogous lanthanide oxalate-phosphonates in which the oxalate just acts as a linker.
