The first one is an oxo-centered trimer {Al(1)} of crystallographically equivalent Al(1) octahedra which are coordinated to bridging trimesate and \u03bc3-O ligands (see c). The second building unit consists of a 2D hexagonal network containing 18-membered rings built by sinusoidal chains of aluminum octahedra. These chains contain two non-equivalent types of aluminum, Al(2) and Al(3), which are coordinated to four and two trimesate oxygen atoms and two and three bridging \u03bc2-hydroxo moieties (d, e) respectively. The hexagonal 18-membered rings are interconnected with each other by another type of trimer. This \"unusual\" {Al(3)} trimer, seldom observed so far in the field of MOFs, is composed of three Al(3) octahedra that are corner-linked by \u03bc2-OH groups. The connection of the {Al(1)} trimer with the 2D network of Al(2) and Al(3) octahedra through the trimesate ligands results in a 3D framework with a complex arrangement of three types of cavities (see Figure S2 and Table S1 of the SI).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 13, "type": "text", "classification": ["property"], "content": "<p>The microporosity of MIL-96-(Al) consists of one spherical cage A\nwith a cavity-free diameter of about 11 \u00c5, an elongated cavity\nB with dimensions of 9.5 \u00d7 12.6 \u00d7 11.3 \u00c5, and a narrow cavity C with dimensions of 3.6 \u00d7 4.5 \u00c5.

Several solvo- and hydrothermal routes led to MIL-96-(Al) crystals with such a morphology but with different diameters (ranging from 0.8 to 40 \u03bcm) using Me3BTC or trimesic acid. Finally, nanoparticles of MIL-96-(Al) (from 160 to 55 nm) were recently reported by Knebel et al.  following a solvothermal synthesis in a mixture of H2O/DMF solvents. We report here several synthesis routes yielding pure MIL-96-(Al) with various morphologies and sizes, down to the nanoscale as required for further MMM preparation. Microwave (MW)-assisted synthesis is known to reduce the size and the polydispersity of the particles due to fast and homogeneous heating favoring the nucleation process. In contrast to the synthesis conditions of MIL-96-(Al)-HR, the initial aqueous solution of both aluminum and ligand precursors was diluted and an amount of acetic acid was added. A 2 min microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis performed at 473 K led to pure MIL-96-(Al) hexagonal platelets (i.e., MIL-96-(Al)-HP), with a diameter of a few micrometers and an average thickness of a few 100 nm as determined by SEM (see b). This process shows that MIL-96-(Al) can be isolated even at short reaction times as a pure phase without the presence of MIL-100-(Al) or MIL-110-(Al). Noteworthy, PXRD of both MIL-96-(Al)-HR and -HP (a) show changes in the relative intensity of several Bragg peaks indicating a preferential orientation of such crystals with a shape anisotropy. This phenomenon is noticeable by comparing PXRD recorded with reflection (Bragg-Brentano method) and transmission (Debye-Sherrer method) geometry for HR (Figure S10) and HP (Figure S11). Hexagonal rods present a strong (010) reflection, while the intensity of (00l) peaks is reduced and (002) almost extinct. On the other hand, (00l) and (0kl) reflections are much more intense in crystals with hexagonal platelet morphologies. Therefore, (0k0) (and thus (h00)) reflections can be assigned to the long facets of hexagonal rods while (0kl) (and by symmetry (h0l)) reflections correspond to the trigonal facets present on top of the hexagonal platelets (see b,c), in agreement with that previously reported for MIL-96-(Al) crystals of similar morphology. Since acetic acid may act as a modulator as reported for several polycarboxylate-based MOFs, it can be suggested that the presence of acetic acid impacts the nucleation and growth of MIL-96-(Al) crystals and thus its morphology. However, even without this modulator, MIL-96-(Al)-HP was also obtained along with MIL-100-(Al) as a byproduct.

Aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (191.7 mg, 0.511 mmol) and trimesic acid (70.4 mg, 0.335 mmol) were dissolved in distilled water (45 mL) under vigorous stirring. Acetic acid (14 \u03bcL, 0.25 mmol) was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred for 10 min at room temperature (RT) and then introduced into the microwave oven. After hydrothermal treatment at 200 \u00b0C (1600 W) for 2 min, the resulting mixture was cooled with an ice bath and centrifuged at 14500 rpm for 15 min. The liquid fraction was discarded, and the white product was washed twice with deionized water (30 mL) and twice with EtOH (30 mL). After a final centrifugation, the powder was dried in air at RT.\n\nSynthesis of MIL-96-(Al) Nanoparticles in Water\n\nA first solution was prepared by dissolving trimesic acid (210 mg, 1 mmol) in 70 mL of deionized water under reflux conditions. A second solution was obtained by dissolving aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (570 mg, 1.5 mmol) in 65 mL of deionized water. Both solutions were heated separately under reflux, and then the Al solution was poured into the ligand solution. Reflux was kept for about 3 h, and the white powder was cooled in an ice bath before centrifugation at 14500 rpm for 15 min. The solid was washed twice with deionized water (30 mL) and twice with EtOH (30 mL). Pure MIL-96-(Al) nanoparticles (MIL-96-(Al)-NP1s) were finally obtained and dried in air at RT.\n\nSynthesis of MIL-96-(Al) Nanoparticles in Water/DMF\n\nAluminum nitrate nonahydrate (4.5 g, 12 mmol) and trimesic acid (2.52 g, 12 mmol) were dissolved in 300 mL of a H2O/DMF (1/1 (v:v)) mixture. Acetic acid (1.68 mL, 30 mmol) was added, and the mixture was heated under reflux for 16 h. The resulting white mixture was centrifuged at 14500 rpm for 15 min and then washed once with deionized water (30 mL) and one more time with a H2O/EtOH (1/1) mixture (30 mL) and finally with EtOH (30 mL). The obtained white powder was dried at RT, and pure MIL-96-(Al) NPs (i.e., MIL-96-(Al)-NP2s) of 200 nm in diameter were obtained, with no traces of trimesic acid, nitrates, or DMF. MIL-96-(Al) NPs of 70 nm in diameter (i.e., MIL-96-(Al)-NP3s) were also prepared at the gram scale by using the same reactants but with concentrations two times lower.\n\nPreparation of MIL-96-(Al)-6FDA-DAM MMMs\n\nA high free-volume 6FDA-DAM copolymer supplied by Akron was used. 6FDA-DAM was degassed at 453 K under vacuum overnight. A polymer solution was prepared by dissolving 0.4 g of polymer in 3 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF). MIL-96-(Al) crystals (NP2 and NP3) were dispersed in 1.5 mL of THF by ultrasonication and stirring for 30 min. Then, 10% of the volume of the polymer solution was added to the MOF suspension followed by further stirring for 2 h (priming). The remaining volume of polymer solution was added to the MOF suspension and stirred overnight. This slurry solution was poured on the glass plate and cast by Doctor Blade technique tuning the thickness to about 80 \u03bcm. The solvent/(filler + polymer) weight ratio was kept constant (90/10) for all MMMs. MMMs were prepared with a MOF loading of 25 wt %. Then, membranes were covered with a top-drilled box and dried overnight under THF-saturated atmosphere.
