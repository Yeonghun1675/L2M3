The \u03c7M T value for complex 5 increases from 14.41 cm3 mol-1 K at 300 K to a maximum of 23.4 cm3 mol-1 K at 20 K. Below 20 K, it drops to 15.41 cm3 mol-1 K at 5 K. The increase in \u03c7M T from 300 to 20 K occurs because there are ferromagnetic interactions in each Mn4 unit to give an S = 9 SMM as observed before. Weak exchange interactions between the Mn4 SMMs as well as zero-field interactions are likely the origin of the decrease in \u03c7M T below 20 K. \n\nAC magnetic susceptibility data were also collected under a zero DC field with a 1 G AC field in the 1.8-50 K range. The \u03c7M\u2018T value slowly increases from 21 cm3 mol-1 K at 50 K to a broad maximum of 24 cm3 mol-1 K at 25 K. The \u03c7M\u2018T value then gradually decreases below 25 K, but it sharply increases below 7 K and reaches a maximum of 28.8 cm3 mol-1 K at 2.9 K. The appearance of the field-dependent spike feature in the \u03c7M\u2018T plot at 2.9 K is the result of the canting caused by misalignment of the easy axes of neighboring tetranuclear Mn4 units. Weak ferromagnetism arises in the case of antiferromagnetically coupled one-dimensional complexes where incomplete cancellation of spins leaves a residual magnetic moment along the chain.
