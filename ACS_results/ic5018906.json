ICP-OES analysis confirmed the atomic ratio of U/K = 1:1. Crystals of 3 were measured using a CHN analyzer to confirm C, H, and N. Anal. Calcd for the complex C20N4H58O50K4U4I2: C, 9.5; H, 2.3; N, 2.2. Found: C, 9.1; H, 2.0; N, 2.1. The pK a for EDTA are pK a1 = 0, pK a2 = 1.5, pK a3 = 2.0, pK a4 = 2.66, pK a5 = 6.16, and pK a6 = 10.24. The first four pK a values correspond to the COOH protons, and the other two are for the two NH+ protons. Compound 3 formed in a weak acid solution, and therefore EDTA is likely to be partly protonated, as assumed in the structural formula to provide charge balance.
