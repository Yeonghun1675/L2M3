X-ray quality crystals were obtained after three weeks, see Table .\n\nPreparation of [Zn-2]\n\nZinc 5-(2-aminophenyl)-10,15,20-triphenylporphyrinate (0.27 g, 0.3 mmol) was dissolved in 30 mL of anhydrous CH2Cl2, Et3N (100 uL, 0.72 mmol) was added to the above solution and stirred for 10 min in an ice bath, and then benzoyl chloride (35 uL, 0.3 mmol) was added dropwise under N2 condition. The mixture was slowly warmed to room temperature. After 6 h, the reaction was complete. The solution was rotary evaporated to dryness under the vacuum. The purple solid was purified by column chromatography (silica, pure CH2Cl2). Yield, 0.144 g, 60%. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): \u03b4 8.87 (6 H, m), 8.50 (2 H, m), 8.26 (1 H, s), 8.17 (5 H, m), 8.02 (1 H, m), 7.70 (10 H, d), 7.52 (2 H, m), 7.38 (1 H, s), 7.28 (4 H, m), 6.56 (1 H, m).
