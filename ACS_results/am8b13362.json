The spectrum of SION-8 also contains a weak signal at 1649 cm-1 originating from guest DMF molecules. TGA revealed an insight into the thermal stability of SION-8 (b). The TGA profile of SION-8 does not show an abrupt drop of mass, but instead, the mass loss is realized in several steps. We can associate the two initial segments of the TGA profile to the release of guest DMF molecules residing within the pores; since the mass loss is not smooth in this region, we raise the hypothesis (see below for the experimental and computational evidence) that this release is stepwise: the DMF molecules trapped in the hydrophobic pores are removed first (below 520 K), while those remaining in the hydrophilic pores are removed at higher temperatures, up to 590 K. The decomposition of SION-8 occurs only once the coordinated H2O molecules are removed between 590 and 670 K, suggesting their vital role in maintaining the framework integrity. The experimental mass loss values match those based on the formula derived from SCXRD, [Ca2(TBAPy)(\u03bc2-OH2)2]\u22c52DMF ().

In order to gain further insights into the interactions of CO2 and CH4 in each pore independently, we used molecular simulations to compute the heats of adsorption in each individual pore as well as in the fully activated structure as a function of loading (Figure S21). Both CO2 and CH4 are more strongly bound in the hydrophobic pore, and CO2 is overall more strongly bound than CH4. Interestingly, for both CO2 and CH4, the Q st of SION-8F was found not to be a simple average of energies of interaction between the hydrophilic pore and the hydrophobic pore (Figure S21).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 49, "type": "table", "classification": null, "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl3\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Isosteric Heats of Adsorption <italic>Q</italic>\n<sub>st</sub> at Zero Loading Calculated from CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> Adsorption Isotherms Recorded at Different Temperatures\nfor <bold>SION-8P</bold> and <bold>SION-8F</bold>\n<xref ref-type=\"table-fn\" rid=\"tbl3-fn1\"></xref>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"3\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\"></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<bold>SION-8P</bold> (only hydrophobic\npores\naccessible)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<bold>SION-8F</bold> (both\npores accessible)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>CH<sub>4</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>21.4</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>16.0</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>CO<sub>2</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>28.4</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>23.4</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n<table-wrap-foot>\n<fn id=\"tbl3-fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>Values in kJ/mol.</p>\n</fn>\n</table-wrap-foot>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 50, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The trends\nin the energy of interaction between adsorbates and\npore surfaces in <bold>SION-8F</bold> compared to <bold>SION-8P</bold> can further be understood by examining the simulated probability\ndensity of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> locations in both materials\n().
