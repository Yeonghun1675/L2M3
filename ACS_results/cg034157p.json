The 1:1 Ag-isonicotinamide polymer 2 is therefore isolated in analogy with the dicarboxylic acid-isonicotinamide 1:1 cocrystal. Moreover, 2 is the first structure with N-Ag-O covalent bonds in near linear array VIII, in contrast to six structures in the CSD with long, bent motif. Although the N-Ag-N bond linkage is well-known in [Ag(nicotinamide)2][BF4] and [Ag(isonicotinamide)3][BF4], structure 2  provides a rare example of Ag bonding with amide oxygen and pyridine nitrogen. In comparison, silver(I)-pyridylurea compounds contain a Ag-N bond (synthon VII) even though the carbonyl oxygen of urea is a stronger Lewis base than amide C\ue5fbO.
