The calculated Langmuir and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area were 1668.2 and 1475.7 m2 g-1, respectively (Figure S16). 1 shows a high Ar uptake of about 458.2 cm3 g-1, and the pore size distribution (PSD) was determined by analyzing the Ar adsorption isotherm using density functional theory (DFT) (). This revealed three types of pores with estimated diameters of 0.75, 1.1, and 1.4 nm, which were consistent with that of three different cages as observed in the crystal structure of 1.\n\nThe permanent porosity of 1 encouraged us to further investigate the H2, CH4, CO2, and N2 adsorption isotherms at low pressure (0-1 bar). At 1 bar and 77 K, the H2 uptake of 1 is 190.7 cm3 g-1 (1.7 wt %) (Figure S17a), which is compared moderately with the best capacity MOFs (2.5-3 wt %). This value is larger than that of NJU-Bai18 (1.5 wt %) and those of MOFs with the  reo  topology, such as JLU-Liu2 (1.54 wt %) and PCN-105 (1.51 wt %). On the basis of the H2 adsorption isotherms at 77 and 87 K, the zero coverage isosteric heats (Q st) of H2 for 1 calculated by the virial method is 6.3 kJ mol-1 (Figure S17b), which is comparable to that of Cu-BTTri (6.1 kJ mol-1) and PCN-121 (6.6 kJ mol-1) and higher than that of NOTT-101 (5.3 kJ mol-1).
