For compound 1, there are four obvious weight-loss steps for the removal of coordinated molecules. First, one strikingly clean weight-loss step occurred at ca. 60-67 \u00b0C (4.4% loss), corresponding to the removal of two water molecules per formula unit (4.10% calcd). Second, another obvious weight loss (9.01%) happened at ca. 114-117 \u00b0C, which indicates 1/3 coordinated DMF (8.93%) molecule in complex 1 was removed. Third, a clear weight loss (18.7%) between 255 and 363 \u00b0C suggests that the additional (2/3) DMF molecules (17.9%) vaporized. Lastly, a large weight loss (44.3%) that happened at ca. 365-522 \u00b0C shows that the DPT ligands are removed from the complex.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']"}}, {"idx": 18, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig6\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>6</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curve for <bold>1</bold>.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr9\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cg-2008-00187r_0008.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 6  Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curve for 1.
