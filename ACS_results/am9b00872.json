As proposed in the mechanism, during the colorimetric biosensing process, H2O2 was adsorbed onto the surface of PMNT-2 first, and PW12 polyanions donate electrons initially and transfer them to the metal centers through trz ligands and SWNTs. Then, adsorbed H2O2 was activated by metal centers through the breaking up of O-O bond coupling with the proton-electron transfer, producing double-active \u22c5OH stabilized by PMNT-2. Subsequently, TMB molecules were adsorbed on the surface of PMNT-2, donating lone-pair electrons of the amino groups and reacting with desorbed \u22c5OH through electron transfer to complete the catalytic oxidation of TMB and the corresponding color change from colorless to green, which is similar to other reported results.
