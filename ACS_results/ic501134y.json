Because the compound crystallizes in the chiral space group P4132/P4332, the Friedel pairs were measured in order to unambiguously establish the correct space group and absolute configurations of the octahedral metal centers. Therefore, the correct space group is P4132, the correct absolute configurations of the octahedral metal centers are \u039b, and the metal oxalate helices are P. Data reduction, including the multiscan absorption correction, was performed with the CrysAlisPRO software package. Solution, refinement, and analysis of the structure was performed using the programs integrated in the WinGX system. The structure was solved using SHELXS97  and refined with SHELXL97. The model was refined using the full-matrix least-squares refinement; all non-H atoms were refined anisotropically. The H atoms were treated as constrained entities, using the command AFIX in SHELXL97. Molecular geometry calculations were performed by PLATON, and the molecular graphics were prepared using the ORTEP-3  and CCDC-Mercury  programs.
