There are no direct intermolecular interactions between the chains. Interactions are mediated by anions arranged in layers parallel to the <italic toggle=\"yes\">bc</italic> plane. The perchlorate anions are engaged in intermolecular interactions with the pyrazine and acetonitrile moieties coming from neighboring 1D chains, which are arranged along the [1, 1, 0] direction. In this way, 2D supramolecular layers are formed. The perchlorates interact also with the coordinated acetonitrile molecules from adjoining 2D layers, extending the structure into a 3D supramolecular architecture. The number of intermolecular contacts at 127 K remains the same as that observed at 180 K, but the respective distances are altered slightly (Table S3 in the ). Lowering of the temperature from 127 to 115 K causes disordering of the pyrazine ring, and even a more severe disordering of the perchlorate anions. At 115 K, about 12% of the anions and pyrazine moieties occupy the alternative positions. At 102 K, the fraction of disordered molecules increases to about 18%. The structural processes described above are accompanied by a reorganization of the existing intermolecular contacts and the appearance of novel ones. An additional contact, C2\u2212H2B\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O2A (2 \u2212 <italic toggle=\"yes\">x</italic>, <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> + <italic toggle=\"yes\">y</italic>, <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> \u2212 <italic toggle=\"yes\">z</italic>), is formed between the 2D supramolecular layers (Table S4 in the ).

It is worth mentioning that both positions of the pyrazine rings are favored by the C<sub>pyrazine</sub>\u2212H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N<sub>acetonitrile</sub> intramolecular interaction. A further temperature decrease down to 80 K does not involve any structural changes in the polymeric backbone, and the number of contacts remains unchanged. Surprisingly, below 102 K, the disorder increases only very slowly, so that at 80 K, only about 20% of the molecules occupy the respective alternative positions.</p>", "clean_text": "X-ray measurements for 1 were performed at temperatures of 180(1), 127(1), 115(1), 102(1), and 80(1) K (see the ).

The average values of the Fe-N distances at intermediate temperatures 127 K (2.075, 2.079 and 2.042, 2.048 \u00c5) and 102 K (2.027, 2.050 and 1.983, 1.994 \u00c5), corresponding to the inflection points, are shortened with relation to the Fe-N bond lengths at 80 K (calculated as [d(Fe-N)T - d(Fe-N)LS]/[d(Fe-N)HS - d(Fe-N)LS]) by about 55 and 82%. The HS \u2192 LS transition is associated with a shortening of the distances between the bridged iron(II) ions, which are 7.109, 6.962, 6.883, and 6.828 \u00c5 at temperatures 180, 127, 102, and 80 K, respectively. Also, the shortest distance between iron(II) ions from neighboring chains Fe\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Fe (1 - x, 1 - y, -z) decreases from 8.501 (180 K), to 8.455 (127 K), to 8.430 (102 K), to 8.409 \u00c5 (80 K). There are no direct intermolecular interactions between the chains. Interactions are mediated by anions arranged in layers parallel to the bc plane. The perchlorate anions are engaged in intermolecular interactions with the pyrazine and acetonitrile moieties coming from neighboring 1D chains, which are arranged along the [1, 1, 0] direction. In this way, 2D supramolecular layers are formed. The perchlorates interact also with the coordinated acetonitrile molecules from adjoining 2D layers, extending the structure into a 3D supramolecular architecture. The number of intermolecular contacts at 127 K remains the same as that observed at 180 K, but the respective distances are altered slightly (Table S3 in the ). Lowering of the temperature from 127 to 115 K causes disordering of the pyrazine ring, and even a more severe disordering of the perchlorate anions. At 115 K, about 12% of the anions and pyrazine moieties occupy the alternative positions. At 102 K, the fraction of disordered molecules increases to about 18%. The structural processes described above are accompanied by a reorganization of the existing intermolecular contacts and the appearance of novel ones. An additional contact, C2-H2B\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O2A (2 - x, 1/2 + y, 1/2 - z), is formed between the 2D supramolecular layers (Table S4 in the ). Moreover, below 127 K, a second orientation of the pyrazine ring is additionally stabilized by a new intermolecular interaction, C6A-H6A\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O1A (1/2 + x, 1 - y, 1/2 - z). It is worth mentioning that both positions of the pyrazine rings are favored by the Cpyrazine-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Nacetonitrile intramolecular interaction. A further temperature decrease down to 80 K does not involve any structural changes in the polymeric backbone, and the number of contacts remains unchanged. Surprisingly, below 102 K, the disorder increases only very slowly, so that at 80 K, only about 20% of the molecules occupy the respective alternative positions.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 13, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>In conclusion, we report on the first example of a SCO material in which the presence of four neutral nitrile molecules besides pyrazine in the coordination sphere of iron(II) allowed one to reach a ligand field strength sufficient for the spin transition.
