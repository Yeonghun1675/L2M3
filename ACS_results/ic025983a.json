It contains 35% free volume of the crystal volume and is stable up to 300 \u00b0C.\n\nIn conclusion, we have constructed 3-fold parallel interwoven nets by the self-assembly of a Ni(II) macrocyclic complex and a big rigid tricarboxylate ligand. In the structure, three independent (6,3) nets with honeycomb-like cavities (49-53 \u00c5 size) interweave to give rise to the 2D open framework generating smaller triangular voids, which provides 35% free volume. Although free TCPEB ligand emits fluorescent light, the emission was quenched in the solid 1.
