GC/MS: m/z 168. 1H NMR: \u03b4 7.33 (d, 2H), 7.15 (t, 1H), 4.75 (s, 4H, CH 2OH); 3.87 (s, 3H, OCH 3).\n\n2-Methoxyisophthalaldehyde (22)\n\nCompound 21 (1.00 g, 5.9 mmol) was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (30 mL) and added all at once to a mixture of PCC (3.83 g, 17.8 mmol) and Celite (8 g) suspended in CH2Cl2 (30 mL). The mixture was stirred vigorously for 4 h, and then filtered over a short pad of silica gel, followed by a rinse with CH2Cl2/ethyl acetate (1:1 v/v). Solvent was removed in vacuo to yield a white solid (0.95 g, 97%). The 1H NMR spectrum of the product matches that reported for the authentic compound. \n\n2-Methoxy-m-phenylenebis(acetylacetone), 2-MeO-m-pbaH2 (6)\n\nThis compound was prepared in the same manner as compound 3. 2-Methoxyisophthalaldehyde (22; 0.40 g, 2.4 mmol) and 2,2,2-trimethoxy-4,5-dimethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphospholene (1.02 g, 4.8 mmol) were mixed together. After the reaction was complete, the crude product was purified by column chromatography (ethyl acetate-hexane, 1:4 v/v), yielding a white solid, 0.33 g (45%). 1H NMR: \u03b4 16.76 (s, 2H), 7.27-7.16 (m, 3H), 3.47 (s, 3H), 1.94 (s, 12H).

Compound 22 (0.40 g, 2.4 mmol) and 2,2,2-trimethoxy-4,5-diethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphospholene (1.15 g, 4.8 mmol) were combined together. Column chromatography of the crude product (ethyl acetate-hexane, 1:4 v/v) afforded a colorless oil (0.26 g, 30%). 1H NMR: \u03b4 16.84 (s, 2H), 7.17-7.10 (m, 3H), 3.46 (s, 3H), 2.17 (q, 8H), 1.07 (t, 12H).\n\nSyntheses of Copper Molecular Squares: [Cu4(m-pbhx)4] (10)\n\nThe procedure described here was followed for all four squares, 10-13. Aqueous CuSO4\u22c55H2O (0.401 g, 1.6 mmol, in 30 mL H2O) was converted to [Cu(NH3)4]2+ by treatment with conc NH3(aq). A solution of m-pbhxH2 (3) (0.8 g, 1.6 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (40 mL) was added, and stirring continued for 4 h; the green organic phase was dried over Na2SO4 and the solvent removed to yield a dark green powder, 0.87 g (97%).
