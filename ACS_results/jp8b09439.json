The ionic conductivity of the LiBF4-SL electrolyte increases with the increasing concentration of LiBF4 up to ~1 mol dm-3, because the charge carrier density increases as the concentration increases. A further increase in concentration leads to a decrease in ionic conductivity due to the increase in viscosity of the electrolyte solutions, which impedes the mobility of each component species. b shows the self-diffusion coefficients of Li+ (D Li), BF4 - (D BF4 ), and SL (D SL) measured using pulsed-field gradient (PFG) NMR. At around a concentration of 1 mol dm-3, the relative order of self-diffusion coefficients is as follows: D SL > D BF4  > D Li, as is the case for conventional organic electrolytes for LIBs. This is because the Li+ is solvated by SL in the electrolyte and forms [Li(SL) x ]+ complexes. According to the Stokes-Einstein equation, the diffusion coefficient of each species is proportional to 1/\u03b7 and 1/r h. The r h of the solvated Li+, [Li(SL) x ]+, is larger than those of the free SL and the BF4 - anion. It should be noted that NMR could not distinguish the free SL and the bound SL in the [Li(SL) x ]+ complex, suggesting that the Li+ exchanges ligands, i.e., SL, rapidly in the electrolyte. This is because the lifetime of monodentate-type solvents in the first solvation shell of Li+ is in the order of 10-9 s, whereas the time scale for NMR measurements is ~10-4-10-2 s. Therefore, the measured D SL is the average value of free and coordinated SL molecules. At concentrations higher than 3 mol dm-3, the viscosity increases dramatically with the LiBF4 concentration and the self-diffusion coefficient of each species was 1 order of magnitude lower than that in 1 mol dm-3 solution. Although the mobility of each species was low, a surprising phenomenon was observed. c shows the ratios of self-diffusion coefficients D SL/D Li and D BF4 /D Li as a function of concentration. Both D SL/D Li and D BF4 /D Li decrease upon increasing the LiBF4 concentration (decreasing the molar ratio of SL/LiBF4). The decrease in D BF4 /D Li indicates that the transference number of Li+ ( t Li+ ) increases with the LiBF4 concentration in the electrolyte solution. In the concentrated electrolytes with molar ratios of SL/LiBF4 \u2264 3, the D SL/D Li and D BF4 /D Li are below unity, suggesting that Li+ diffuses faster than the SL molecule and the BF4 - anion. Similar results were obtained for the SL-based highly concentrated electrolytes containing other Li salts, such as LiClO4 and LiN(SO2F)2 (Li[FSA]) (Figures S1 and S2, and Tables S2 and S3, Supporting Information). Specifically, D Li is higher than D SL in these electrolyte solutions when the molar ratio of the SL/Li salt is lower than 3. Although, unfortunately, the diffusivity of ClO4 - in the LiClO4-SL electrolyte could not be measured using the PFG-NMR apparatus employed in this study, we could also confirm that Li+ diffuses faster than the [FSA]- anion in the highly concentrated Li[FSA]-SL electrolyte. Very recently, Alvarado et al. also reported that Li+ diffuses faster than SL and the anion in the highly concentrated Li[FSA]-SL solutions, and this agrees well with our observation (Figure S2). These results suggest that the Stokes-Einstein equation is no longer valid for the [Li(SL) x ]+ complex cation in the highly concentrated Li salt-SL solutions. In general, the coordination number of Li+ in electrolyte solutions is 4-5. The fraction of free solvent (SL) in the solution is lowered with the increasing Li salt concentration. In this situation, not only SL but also BF4 - are assumed to be coordinated to Li+, in other words, aggregates (AGGs) such as [Li x (SL) y (BF4) z ] x-z  (where x = 1 or more) might be formed in the electrolytes.
