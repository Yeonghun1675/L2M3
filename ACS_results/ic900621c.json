As shown in Scheme , the coordination behaviors of these azolates, dpt24, dpt22, and dpt44, are remarkably different. Because of the rotational flexibility of 2-pyridyl groups, dpt22 exhibits three major conformations. Two of them possess two bidentate chelating sites and a monodentate one (I and II), while the third one bears a tridentate chelating site and two monodentate ones (III). We could easily predict the coordination mode and chemical composition for the Cu<sup>I</sup>-dpt22 system to synthesize a series of supramolecular isomers, since tetrahedrally coordinated Cu<sup>I</sup> is appropriate for two bidentate chelating. However, dpt44 has five potential monodentate sites (IV). It is hard to predict the local coordination environments and superstructures of its MAFs, although several supramolecular isomers had been isolated for the [Cu(dpt44)] system. The new ligand dpt24 exhibits two conformations dependent on the orientation of the 2-pyridyl group (V and VI), both possess a bidentate chelating site and three monodentate sites. When dpt24 is coordinated with a metal ion, it would first use the bidentate chelating site and then use other monodentate ones. Because of steric hindrance effects, the pyridyl nitrogen has a higher priority in coordination than the remaining azolate nitrogens. When a divalent metal ion is used, the metal ion should be chelated by two dpt24 ligands to give a neutral M(dpt24)<sub>2</sub> unit, for a divalent metal ion prefers a common octahedral coordination mode; the two remaining sites should be occupied by other ligands. Depending on the reaction mediums and conditions, these two sites can be occupied by auxiliary terminal ligands (L) to give a discrete mononuclear complex [M(dpt24)<sub>2</sub>L<sub>2</sub>], or by the nitrogen donors from two other M(dpt24)<sub>2</sub> units to give a 4-connected coordination polymer [M(dpt24)<sub>2</sub>] (each metal ion is coordinated by four dpt24 and each dpt24 is coordinated to two metal ions). If dpt24 uses the pyridyl nitrogen to link another metal ion, the separations between two adjacent metal centers are larger than 8 \u00c5, which is useful for the construction of open frameworks. Meanwhile, the two uncoordinated triazolate nitrogens would be exposed on the pore surfaces as guest-accessible sites for catalysis or adsorption. The lone pair electrons of uncoordinated nitrogens would be also useful for interacting with gas molecules such as CO<sub>2</sub>, whose carbon atom acts as an electron-acceptor.

The adsorption amount of CO2 at P = 101 kPa is about 91 cm3(STP)\u22c5g-1, which corresponds to 2.0 CO2 per Mn(dpt24)2 unit.\n\nCO2, CH4, and N2 adsorption isotherms were measured for 3b at 298 K (Figure ), which show an obviously high affinity and capacity for CO2. Detailed analysis shows that 1 L of 3b can hold up to 52.9 L (1.7 mmol\u22c5g-1) of CO2 at 298 K and 1 atm. The three adsorption isotherms are fitted well by the Toth isotherm model (Figure ). Henry's Law selectivities of CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 are calculated to be about 5.0 and 46, respectively. The CO2/N2 selectivity of 3b is significantly higher than that of many other PCPs.
