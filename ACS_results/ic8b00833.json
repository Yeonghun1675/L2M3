Hence, the rectification ratios (I on/I off) were calculated as 25.25 and 33.12, respectively, for 1 and 1' at \u00b12 V. The values of ideality factors are obtained as 2.89 and 1.92 for 1 and 1', respectively. All the measured parameters, e.g., potential height (\u2300B), ideality factor (\u03b7), and series resistance (R  S ) for 1', show better performance compared to 1 (Table S5). It is important to mention that the value of the ideality factor of 1' approached closer to 1, indicating a more ideal device. This is an indication of less interfacial charge recombination and better homogeneity of Schottky junctions. Additionally, the higher rectification ratio for 1' is attributed to the lower barrier height. The lowered value of series resistance of 1' is attributed to the large increase of charge carriers. Here, the decrease  in distance between the adjacent chains together with shrinkage of \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 stacking interactions between pyridine and naphthalene groups results in an increase in conductivty after photodimerization.
