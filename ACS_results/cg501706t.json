It should be mentioned that there are three kinds of different channels in the framework: the largest channel openings are 14-membered-ring openings with a window size of 5.70 \u00d7 8.27 \u00c52, the moderate channel openings are 10-membered-ring openings with a window size of 4.44 \u00d7 4.62 \u00c52, and the smallest channel openings are 8-membered-ring openings with a window size of 3.11 \u00d7 4.83 \u00c52 (). A better insight into this 3D framework can be provided by a topology analysis. The 3D structure of 3 can be clarified as a classical 4,8-connected net with the vertex symbol of (46)2(49\u22c5618\u22c58) by considering Ag (I) ions as the 4-connected nodes and the CA ligands as the 8-connected nodes ().", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "337-482", "unit": "K", "type": "release of free guest CH3CN molecules", "condition": "N2 atmosphere"}, {"value": "above 482", "unit": "K", "type": "framework collapse", "condition": "N2 atmosphere"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "2", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "371-473", "unit": "K", "type": "loss of lattice and coordinated water molecules", "condition": "N2 atmosphere"}, {"value": "683", "unit": "K", "type": "decomposition of the framework", "condition": "N2 atmosphere"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "[Ag2(CA)] n", "symbol": "3", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "above 546", "unit": "K", "type": "gradual decomposition of the framework", "condition": "N2 atmosphere"}], "crystal system": [{"value": "monoclinic", "condition": "space group C2/c"}], "space group": [{"value": "C2/c", "condition": ""}], "topology": [{"value": "4,8-connected net", "condition": "vertex symbol of (46)2(49\u22c5618\u22c58)"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["decomposition_temperature", "crystal_system", "space_group", "topology"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['decomposition_temperature', 'crystal_system', 'space_group', 'topology']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"\",\n            \"symbol\": \"1\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"decomposition temperature\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"337-482\",\n                \"unit\": \"K\",\n                \"type\": \"release of free guest CH3CN molecules\",\n                \"condition\": \"N2 atmosphere\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"above 482\",\n                \"unit\": \"K\",\n                \"type\": \"framework collapse\",\n                \"condition\": \"N2 atmosphere\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"\",\n            \"symbol\": \"2\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"decomposition temperature\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"371-473\",\n                \"unit\": \"K\",\n                \"type\": \"loss of lattice and coordinated water molecules\",\n                \"condition\": \"N2 atmosphere\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"683\",\n                \"unit\": \"K\",\n                \"type\": \"decomposition of the framework\",\n                \"condition\": \"N2 atmosphere\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"[Ag2(CA)] n\",\n            \"symbol\": \"3\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"decomposition temperature\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"above 546\",\n                \"unit\": \"K\",\n                \"type\": \"gradual decomposition of the framework\",\n                \"condition\": \"N2 atmosphere\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"crystal system\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"monoclinic\",\n                \"condition\": \"space group C2/c\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"space group\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"C2/c\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"topology\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"4,8-connected net\",\n                \"condition\": \"vertex symbol of (46)2(49\u22c5618\u22c58)\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 11, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Synthetic Route of\nCompounds <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>3</bold>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cg-2014-01706t_0005.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Synthetic Route of Compounds 1-3    ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 17, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) The coordination\nenvironment of Cu (II) ions in <bold>1</bold>.
