The \u03c7m T value of 5.29 cm3 K mol-1 at 300 K is larger than the spin-only value for eight Cu(II) atoms, and the monotonic decrease in \u03c7m T upon cooling indicates antiferromagnetic coupling (). The simulated and recorded powder XRD (PXRD) patterns matched well, eliminating the possibility of minor magnetic impurities. The ESR spectrum of a powdered sample of 1 at room temperature shows valuable information about the electronic configuration of copper (Figure ). The strongest resonance signal appeared at 161.5 mT and had a very large g factor of 4.16. Generally, isoelectronic ions in similar symmetry environments have similar g factors, and metal ions with a 3d7 configuration, such as Co(II) and Fe(I), show large g factors of ~4.2. Hence, the strongest ESR signal in 1 may be a clue to the presence of Cu(IV) ions with 3d7 configuration. With this assumption, 1 should show nonstoichiometry or defects. This supposition agrees with the observed abnormally large magnetic moment. The weak ESR signal at g = 2.21 could originate from Cu(II) ions.
