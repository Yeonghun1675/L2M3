From the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra, we can see that the results\nof PCN-700-DOBDC and -DOBPDC were in good agreement with the single-crystal\nX-ray diffraction data (Table S2).

The crystalline sponge, PCN-700, can absorb target molecules from their solution into the pores, because of the molecular-recognition ability of the pores, rendering the incoming molecules to adopt a preferential arrangement in the crystal. After the encapsulation of different dicarboxylate compounds, the structural stability and porosity of resultant samples was retained, as confirmed by the N2 adsorption experiments (Figure S4). These results suggest that dicarboxylate linkers with different lengths in the absence/presence of hydroxyl groups can be adsorbed into the voids formed between adjacent Zr6 clusters. On the one hand, the presence of replaceable sites on the host framework, namely the Zr sites coordinated to -OH-/H2O groups, is necessary in the present study. On the other hand, the flexibility of PCN-700 makes it successful to be employed as a crystalline sponge through coordination bond interactions. Furthermore, the 1H NMR measurement was carried out to determine the amounts of guest molecules (Figures S5-S8). From the 1H NMR spectra, we can see that the results of PCN-700-DOBDC and -DOBPDC were in good agreement with the single-crystal X-ray diffraction data (Table S2).
