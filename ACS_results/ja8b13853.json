The collective findings can be summarized as follows: in the ground electronic state, S 0, the \"open\" and \"closed\" ring isomers are separated by a high barrier of approximately 1.8 eV and are, therefore, thermally stable. The isomerization proceeds through the first excited electronic state, S 1, exhibiting a conical intersection (CI) with the ground potential energy surface (PES). The cyclization begins with the UV excitation of the \"open\"-form molecule to S 1, where it accesses the CI without a barrier. The molecule relaxes to either \"open\" or \"closed\" form on the ground PES via the CI. In the reverse reaction, the vertical excitation to S1 corresponds to the visible light, and there is a barrier to the CI of about 0.6 eV.
