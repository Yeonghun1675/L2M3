During cooling, an abrupt decrease in the \u03b5' value corresponding to approximately a -7% change was observed at 231 K in a frequency-independent manner, indicating that CO2 adsorption suddenly occurred at this temperature; in other words, the gates of the pores for gas accommodation were opened at this temperature at a CO2 pressure of 100 kPa.

The required sample was just ~5 mg, and the electric response was rapidly obtained. A sudden decrease in the \u03b5' portion of permittivity was clearly observed when the introduction of gases resulted in opening of the micropores' gates. As expected, such behavior was not observed in the nonporous gate-inactive compound [Ru2(o-OMePhCO2)4(phz)] (3). The sensitivity of the gate-opening behavior (in terms of the \u0394H Trans value) to the type of gas and two external stimuli (temperature and pressure) follows the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. It should be mentioned that the change in permittivity occurred rapidly over a narrow temperature range, suggesting that the gate-opening transition also occurred rapidly; the variation feature of \u03b5' as a function of temperature could be associated with the dynamics of gate opening. Thus, with this technique, it is possible to roughly know the dynamic behavior of gate-opening/closing phenomena for gas adsorption/desorption in a material, for example, from the temperature-dependent feature of the permittivity anomaly and its temperature range. In other words, these results suggest that it is possible to accurately control the permittivity signals using a known gas pressure. In addition, it was found that the imaginary part (\u03b5\") of permittivity is associated with the conductance; changes in the \u03b5\" value, which can be detected with high sensitivity, reflect the electronic perturbations of sample surfaces and/or framework compositions following the introduction of a gas. Of course, inert gases (He, O2, and CO2 in this work) do not cause any significant electronic perturbations, and thus any observed leakage current behavior is attributable to the intrinsic electronic properties of the sample. For compounds 1 and 3 possessing [Ru2]-phz chains, only the introduction of NO led to changers in the \u03b5\" value; the conductivity under an NO atmosphere was clearly much higher than that when the inert gases were introduced. In addition, the conductivity was dependent on the NO gas pressure and was even observed at temperatures greater than T GO, indicating that the NO gas significantly influenced the conductivity through grain boundaries in the sample, i.e., at the sample surface where host-guest electronic interactions are affected by the NO gas pressure.

The full-matrix least-squares refinement on F 2 was performed based on the observed reflections and variable parameters, and the refinement cycle was estimated from unweighted and weighted agreement factors for R1 = \u2211\u2225F 0| - |F c\u2225/\u2211|F 0| (I > 2.00\u03c3(I) and all data) and wR2 = [\u2211(w(F 0 2 - F c 2)2)/\u2211w(F 0 2)2]1/2 (all data). A Sheldrick weighting scheme was used. Neutral atom scattering factors were taken from Cromer and Waber. Anomalous dispersion effects were included in F c; the values of \u0394f' and \u0394f\" were those of Creagh and McAuley. The values for the mass attenuation coefficients are those of Creagh and Hubbell. All calculations were performed using the CrystalStructure crystallographic software package, except for refinement, which was performed using SHELXL-97. These data have been deposited as CIFs at the Cambridge Data Centre as supplementary publication no. CCDC-1003673.

Structural diagrams were prepared using VESTA software. The void volumes of the crystal structures were estimated using PLATON.
