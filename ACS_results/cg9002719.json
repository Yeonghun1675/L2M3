Each Co(II) ion in <bold>1</bold> is four-coordinate with a distorted tetrahedral geometry, composed of two carboxylic O atoms from two bptc<sup>4\u2212</sup> anions (Co\u2212O = 1.9616(15) \u00c5 and 1.9946(16) \u00c5) and two N atoms from two bimh ligands (Co\u2212N = 2.018(2) \u00c5 and 2.0467(19)\u00c5) (Figure a). All the bimh ligands adopt a <italic toggle=\"yes\">cis</italic> conformation, with the dihedral angle of the two imidazolyl rings being 59.70\u00b0. Two bimh ligands connect two Co(II) atoms to achieve a 26-membered [Co<sub>2</sub>(bimh)<sub>2</sub>] metallacyclic ring exhibiting maximum dimensions (corresponding to the Co\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Co distance and shortest intracycle C<sup>...</sup>C separation) of 12.741 \u00c5 \u00d7 7.499 \u00c5 (). Furthermore, the four carboxylic groups of each completely deprotonated bptc<sup>4\u2212</sup> anion adopt monodentate modes and coordinate to four Co atoms to generate a 2D layer (). Notably, the two types of windows are catenated, as shown in Figure b, but also connected by shared Co atoms. That is to say, all the [Co<sub>2</sub>bimh<sub>2</sub>] loops are threaded by the longer Cobptc-Co rods (node-to-node distance of 12.472 \u00c5) of the 2D net. The entanglement found here is unprecedented. One might initially describe it as a polyrotaxane due to the extensive and prominent rotaxane-like interactions, but caution should be exercised. In all self-penetrating and interpenetrating networks, by definition, rotaxane-like interactions can be defined (and also for all molecular catenanes). However, in true polyrotaxanes, by analogy to molecular rotaxanes, the ring and rod components should not be connected except by the rotaxane mechanical bond, and there should be no catenane type interactions. Both these conditions are clearly violated here, and thus the net is classified as a self-penetrating net, which can be thought of as the polymeric equivalent of a molecular knot. Furthermore, the self-catenated layer is one more example for which a special notation is needed to describe the topology: the introduction of 2-connected nodes in the point/Schlafli symbol. Such notation is the 2-membered rings (i.e., the \u201cloops\u201d), introduced by Ma and Batten. Therefore, the whole net is trinodal 2,4-connected (4\u00b78<sup>3</sup>\u00b710<sup>2</sup>)<sub>2</sub>(4)<sub>2</sub>(8<sup>5</sup>\u00b710) network.</p>", "clean_text": "Results and Discussion. Crystal Structure of [Co2(bptc)(bimh)2] (1)\n\nCrystallographic analysis revealed that compounds 1 and 2 are isostructural. Hence, only the crystal structure of compound 1 is described here in detail. Each Co(II) ion in 1 is four-coordinate with a distorted tetrahedral geometry, composed of two carboxylic O atoms from two bptc4- anions (Co-O = 1.9616(15) \u00c5 and 1.9946(16) \u00c5) and two N atoms from two bimh ligands (Co-N = 2.018(2) \u00c5 and 2.0467(19)\u00c5) (Figure a). All the bimh ligands adopt a cis conformation, with the dihedral angle of the two imidazolyl rings being 59.70\u00b0. Two bimh ligands connect two Co(II) atoms to achieve a 26-membered [Co2(bimh)2] metallacyclic ring exhibiting maximum dimensions (corresponding to the Co\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Co distance and shortest intracycle C...C separation) of 12.741 \u00c5 \u00d7 7.499 \u00c5 (). Furthermore, the four carboxylic groups of each completely deprotonated bptc4- anion adopt monodentate modes and coordinate to four Co atoms to generate a 2D layer (). Notably, the two types of windows are catenated, as shown in Figure b, but also connected by shared Co atoms. That is to say, all the [Co2bimh2] loops are threaded by the longer Cobptc-Co rods (node-to-node distance of 12.472 \u00c5) of the 2D net. The entanglement found here is unprecedented. One might initially describe it as a polyrotaxane due to the extensive and prominent rotaxane-like interactions, but caution should be exercised. In all self-penetrating and interpenetrating networks, by definition, rotaxane-like interactions can be defined (and also for all molecular catenanes). However, in true polyrotaxanes, by analogy to molecular rotaxanes, the ring and rod components should not be connected except by the rotaxane mechanical bond, and there should be no catenane type interactions. Both these conditions are clearly violated here, and thus the net is classified as a self-penetrating net, which can be thought of as the polymeric equivalent of a molecular knot. Furthermore, the self-catenated layer is one more example for which a special notation is needed to describe the topology: the introduction of 2-connected nodes in the point/Schlafli symbol. Such notation is the 2-membered rings (i.e., the \"loops\"), introduced by Ma and Batten. Therefore, the whole net is trinodal 2,4-connected (4\u22c583\u22c5102)2(4)2(85\u22c510) network.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 11, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) The immediate coordination environment around the Co(II) center in <bold>1</bold>; (b) the view of the 2D self-penetrated sheet of <bold>1</bold>.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"cg-2009-002719_0006.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  (a) The immediate coordination environment around the Co(II) center in 1; (b) the view of the 2D self-penetrated sheet of 1.
