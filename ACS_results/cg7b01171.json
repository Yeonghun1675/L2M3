We have demonstrated such strategy in this article by modeling hexatopic porphyrin linker (H6HCPP) with carboxylate coordination groups, on the basis of octatopic and tetratopic carboxy-porphyrin analogs. Synthesis of the H6HCPP linker was achieved in higher yields from the corresponding dipyrromethane and aldehyde reactants by utilizing the catalyst (TFA) concentration in excess ratio. The octahedral geometry of the hexatopic linker was well integrated with the 6-connected inorganic building units like Mn/Zn paddlewheels and Co3 trigonal prisms to form 6-connected wxyl network topology in Mn/Zn-hcMPF and nia topological network in Co-hcMPfs. Modulator synthetic approaches were utilized to obtain crystalline framework materials (hcMPFs) with p-block elements and lanthanides. This approach induces the formation of a 5-connected InNa2 cluster, which drives the formation of In-hcMPF of tcj/hc topological network. The formation of Pb-hcMPF, sustained by 6-connected Pb2 dimers in pcu alpha-Po primitive cubic topological type, is the cumulative outcome of the modulator approach and coordination geometry of the linker employed.

From crystallographic\nanalysis, the compounds contain nearly 50 to 60% void volumes, which\nare occupied by the solvent species. Hence, the initial weight losses\nin the TGA curves are related to the solvent molecules present in\nthe intralattice voids. The TGA curves of Mn-<italic>hc</italic>MPF\n(<bold>1</bold>) represent nearly 38% weight loss (calculated weight\nloss is 48%) in three intervals until 380 \u00b0C out of which initial\nweight loss can be attributed to volatile H<sub>2</sub>O molecules\nand the remaining weight loss to DMF molecules. The excess calculated\nweight percentage observed may be due to retention of some solvent\nmolecules in the lattice even at elevated temperatures. In compound <bold>2</bold>, an initial weight loss of 6.5% was observed in the region\n50\u2013130 \u00b0C, which can be attributed to two lattice water\nmolecules and four coordinated water molecules/molecular formula (calculated\nwt % of H<sub>2</sub>O molecules is 6.24%). The plot is followed by\nweight loss of 42% in two intervals until 330 \u00b0C in which DMF\nmolecules were desolvated (calculated weight loss of DMF molecules\nis 30%). The second weight loss, i.e., desolvation of DMF molecules,\nis also accompanied by decomposition of a MOF framework; as a result,\nthe observed weight loss is more than the calculated weight loss.\nFor compound <bold>3</bold>, a weight loss of 24% was recorded in\nthe region 50\u2013390 \u00b0C, whereas the calculated weight loss\nof coordinated, lattice H<sub>2</sub>O molecules and DMF molecules\naccording to the molecular formula is 33.2%. The calculated weight\nloss is more than observed weight, which can be assumed that some\nof the DMF molecules were retained in the framework and were desolvated\nduring the decomposition of the framework above 400 \u00b0C. In the\nTGA curve of compound <bold>4</bold>, a weight loss of nearly 17%\nwas observed until 380 \u00b0C. The calculated weight loss corresponding\nto H<sub>2</sub>O and DMF molecules according to the molecular formula\nis 14.5%. This plot is followed by the decomposition of the desolvated\nframework in two intervals. A gradual weight loss of 28% was observed\nin the TGA curve of compound Gd-<italic>hc</italic>MPF (7) in the\nregion 50\u2013400 \u00b0C. The calculated weight loss from molecular\nformula is nearly 36%, which includes contribution from lattice, coordinated\nwater molecules and lattice DMF molecules.

The desolvated framework of\nall the compounds does not show any characteristic PXRD patterns,\nwhich indicates that the frameworks are collapsing after removal of\nsolvent molecules.</p>", "clean_text": "TGA curves for representative samples were recorded under flowing N2 for crystalline samples in the temperature range 40-1000 \u00b0C (Section 2 in the Supporting Information). From crystallographic analysis, the compounds contain nearly 50 to 60% void volumes, which are occupied by the solvent species. Hence, the initial weight losses in the TGA curves are related to the solvent molecules present in the intralattice voids. The TGA curves of Mn-hcMPF (1) represent nearly 38% weight loss (calculated weight loss is 48%) in three intervals until 380 \u00b0C out of which initial weight loss can be attributed to volatile H2O molecules and the remaining weight loss to DMF molecules. The excess calculated weight percentage observed may be due to retention of some solvent molecules in the lattice even at elevated temperatures. In compound 2, an initial weight loss of 6.5% was observed in the region 50-130 \u00b0C, which can be attributed to two lattice water molecules and four coordinated water molecules/molecular formula (calculated wt % of H2O molecules is 6.24%). The plot is followed by weight loss of 42% in two intervals until 330 \u00b0C in which DMF molecules were desolvated (calculated weight loss of DMF molecules is 30%). The second weight loss, i.e., desolvation of DMF molecules, is also accompanied by decomposition of a MOF framework; as a result, the observed weight loss is more than the calculated weight loss. For compound 3, a weight loss of 24% was recorded in the region 50-390 \u00b0C, whereas the calculated weight loss of coordinated, lattice H2O molecules and DMF molecules according to the molecular formula is 33.2%. The calculated weight loss is more than observed weight, which can be assumed that some of the DMF molecules were retained in the framework and were desolvated during the decomposition of the framework above 400 \u00b0C. In the TGA curve of compound 4, a weight loss of nearly 17% was observed until 380 \u00b0C. The calculated weight loss corresponding to H2O and DMF molecules according to the molecular formula is 14.5%. This plot is followed by the decomposition of the desolvated framework in two intervals. A gradual weight loss of 28% was observed in the TGA curve of compound Gd-hcMPF (7) in the region 50-400 \u00b0C. The calculated weight loss from molecular formula is nearly 36%, which includes contribution from lattice, coordinated water molecules and lattice DMF molecules. It is assumed that the solvent molecules responsible for excess weight loss start desolvation along with the framework decomposition.
