Single-crystal X-ray structural analysis revealed that both Cu2 and Cu4 are porous coordination polymers composed of bridging ctpyz ligands with almost the same coordination configuration. Rhombic {Cu2I2} cores formed in Cu2, while tetranuclear cubane {Cu4I4} cores were bridged by ctpyz ligands in Cu4. As a result, the void fractions of Cu2 and Cu4 were estimated to be 19.9 and 48.0%, respectively, with EtOH or PhCN solvent molecules in the pores. Under UV irradiation, both PCPs exhibited red luminescence at room temperature in the solid states. Interestingly, the red emission of Cu2 did not change after removal of EtOH from the pores, whereas the emission maximum of Cu4 remarkably red-shifted by 36 nm, which was associated with the structural transformation from the porous crystalline to nonporous amorphous phase. The largely different behaviors of Cu2 and Cu4 could be derived from the differences in the rigidity of the porous structure; the void fraction in one unit cell of Cu2 (19.9%) is less than half of that of Cu4 (48.0%) and sufficiently rigid to retain the porous framework without solvated EtOH molecules. In contrast, adsorption and desorption of PhCN in Cu4 induced the amorphous-to-crystalline structural transition, resulting in vapochromic luminescence. The original porous framework of Cu4 was regenerated by exposure to not only PhCN but also other moderately polar solvent vapors (i.e., THF, acetone, ethyl acetate, and DMF). THF-, acetone-, and ethyl acetate-adsorbed Cu4 showed emissions very similar to that of the initially obtained PhCN-adsorbed Cu4, suggesting a weak interaction between the adsorbed vapor molecule and the Cu4 framework. One exception was observed for DMF-adsorbed Cu4, which did not show any luminescence despite reconstruction of the same porous structure. The reason for this behavior may be weak coordination of the DMF vapor molecules to Cu(I), which would suppress the generation of the emissive 3CC state. These results suggest the importance of the flexibility of the metal center of PCPs. In other words, the dinuclear rhombic {Cu2I2} core acts as a luminescent node more rigid than the tetranuclear cubane {Cu4I4} core, probably because of the more tightly packed structure around the Cu(I) ion.
