The first IR-active vibrational mode, occurring at 67 cm-1 for 2, exceeds our accessible range (110 cm-1) in 1. This originates remarkable differences in the temperature dependence of T 1 above 30 K. Local vibration modes have already been considered as sources of magnetic relaxation, but the support of optical investigations is uncommon. We have therefore reproduced the temperature dependence of the spin-lattice dynamics through the already proposed phenomenological model: 7         T   1     - 1   =   a   dir     T   x   +   a   loc     exp  ( h\u0335 \u03c9 /   k   B   T )      ( exp  ( h\u0335 \u03c9 /   k   B   T )  - 1 )   2        where \u03c9 is the frequency of the vibrational mode and a dir and a loc are coupling coefficients as in . The T 1 data of 1 are successfully simulated () with x = 0.64 and \u03c9 = 184(2) cm-1, thus suggesting that the first active mode occurs at a frequency higher than our accessible spectral range.

Spin-lattice relaxation times were measured using the standard inversion recovery sequence (\u03c0-t d-\u03c0/2-\u03c4-\u03c0-\u03c4-echo), with t \u03c0/2 = 16 ns. The uncertainty in T 1 estimated from replicate measurements was 5-10% depending upon the signal-to-noise ratio at a given temperature-field combination. Nutation measurements were performed with a nutation pulse (t p) of variable length followed by a Hahn echo sequence (t p-t d-\u03c0/2-\u03c4-\u03c0-\u03c4-echo) with t d \u226b T m (i.e., t d = 7 \u03bcs for 4 K and 2 \u03bcs for room temperature measurements). The interpulse delay \u03c4 was 200 ns, and the pulse length of the detection sequence was adjusted depending on the attenuation level of B 1. Hyperfine sublevel correlation (HYSCORE) experiments were carried out with the pulse sequence \u03c0/2-\u03c4-\u03c0/2-\u03c41-\u03c0-\u03c42-\u03c0/2-\u03c4-echo with the microwave pulse length t \u03c0/2 = 16 ns and t \u03c0 = 16 ns. The time intervals t 1 and t 2 were varied in steps of 8 ns starting from 96 to 2704 ns. Spectra with two \u03c4 values (100 and 136 ns), which are specified in the figure captions, were recorded to avoid blind spot effects. An eight-step phase cycle was used for eliminating unwanted echoes. The time traces of the HYSCORE spectra were baseline corrected with a third-order polynomial, apodized with a Hamming window, and zero filled. After two-dimensional Fourier transformation, the absolute value spectra were calculated. The HYSCORE frequencies were computed for a three-spin system (S = 1/2; I a = 1; I b = 1) using the endorfrq function, implemented in the Easyspin program.

Then the solvent was slowly evaporated under reduced pressure. 2' precipitated as a red-purple microcrystalline solid that was washed with MeOH and then Et2O and air-dried. Yield: quantitative. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis was used to estimate the effective percentage of doping of VIV by comparing the XRF intensity of the vanadium K\u03b1 emission of compound 2' to a calibration curve obtained by mixing weighted amounts of the pure compounds (2 and 3) in the 1-20% concentration range.
