Thus, we have discovered the good affinity of a P\ue5fbO group for lanthanide cations. Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions have been introduced into the 1D channels of 2 by soaking the samples in DMF solutions of their nitrate salts. The loading of Ln3+ does not influence the crystal structure integrity of 2, as demonstrated by PXRD profiles (Figure S4). When the FT-IR spectra of 2 and Eu3+@2 are compared, the characteristic absorbance of NO3 - (1350 cm-1) in Eu3+@2 indicates the introduction of Eu(NO3)3 into the channels (Figure S8). Upon excitation at 333 nm, Eu3+@2 displays narrow luminescence originating from the Eu(III) lowest emitting state 5D0 to 7F0 (578 nm), 7F1 (591 nm), 7F2 (615 nm), 7F3 (650 nm) ,and 7F4 (695 nm) levels (a). The most intense peak at 615 nm corresponds to the 5D0 \u2192 7F2 transition, yielding an intense red color emission. On excitation at 254 nm under UV light, Eu3+@2 showed a bright red light, which can be easily observed by the naked eye, as shown in the inset of a. Moreover, Eu3+@2 exhibits a long emission lifetime (1.07 ms), further demonstrating that the MOF 2 can serve as an efficient scaffold for hosting and sensitizing Eu3+ (a). For Tb3+@2, on excitation at 337 nm, the emission lines are located at about 488, 542, 582, and 616 nm, which can be assigned to 5D4 \u2192 7F J  (J = 6, 5, 4, 3) transitions of Tb3+ (b). For Eu3+@2, the emission of 2 is hardly detected, suggesting efficient energy transfer between the ligand and Eu3+.
