This is most likely due to the 2D nature of the latter compound, which confers it a more rigid structure. Although the Cu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cu interchain interactions could be considered an efficient source of cooperativity in 1, the chains are flexible enough because the Fe-N-C-Cu angles change significantly during SCO in 1, i.e., 8.8(5)\u00b0 for Fe-N(2)-C(7) and 3.3(6)\u00b0 for Cu-C(8)-N(3). Comparable changes have been observed in the Fe-N(CS) bending angles of the [Fe(tap)2(NCS)2]\u22c5nCH3CN complex upon SCO. These intrachain modifications probably absorb instead of transmitting the structural changes, associated with the [FeN6] sites, mitigating the cooperativeness of the spin transition. Similar effects have been reported previously for 1D polymers bearing tetrazole groups.
