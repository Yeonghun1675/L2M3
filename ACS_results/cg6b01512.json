The MOFs differ not only in the geometry of the linker molecules, but also in the framework topology and the connectivity of the [Ce6O4(OH)4(-CO2) x ] (x = 12, 8, 6) clusters, which further prove the versatility and flexibility of the hexanuclear Ce-clusters. Structures were confirmed from PXRD data using the Rietveld refinement method and Le Bail fitting. Ce-UiO-66-BPyDC and Ce-MOF-808 are thermally stable up to 330 and 150 \u00b0C, respectively, as proven by VT-PXRD measurements. Hence, Ce-UiO-66-BPyDC possesses the highest thermal stability of all reported Ce(IV)-based MOFs. N2 sorption experiments reveal specific surface areas of 2120 m2 g-1 for Ce-UiO-66-BPyDC and 1725 m2 g-1 for Ce-MOF-808. The lower thermal stability of Ce-DUT-67-PZDC and -TDC prevented determination of their porosities. Although these new Ce-MOFs demonstrate a lower chemical and thermal stability than their Zr analogues with respect to their crystallinity, the potential redox chemistry of the Ce(IV) makes these new frameworks very interesting for catalytic studies. To that end, studies are currently underway.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 43, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information\nis available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.cgd.6b01512\">10.1021/acs.cgd.6b01512</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>PXRD patterns,\nLe Bail plots, IR and <sup>1</sup>H NMR\nspectra, chemical and thermal analysis, sorption measurements (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.cgd.6b01512/suppl_file/cg6b01512_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.cgd.6b01512.
