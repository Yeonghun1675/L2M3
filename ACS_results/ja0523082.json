Its structure consists of linear Mg3 units linked via NDC bridges to form a three-dimensional framework, featuring one-dimensional channels filled with DEF molecules. Significantly, its framework is fully analogous to that observed within Zn3(NDC)3(CH3OH)2\u22c52DMF\u22c5H2O (2), demonstrating that Mg2+ ions can directly substitute for the heavier Zn2+ ions. Compound 1 is readily desolvated by heating at 190 \u00b0C to give the microporous solid Mg3(NDC)3, exhibiting a BET surface area of 190 m2/g. Adsorption isotherms measured at 77 and 87 K indicate high H2 adsorption enthalpies in the range 7.0-9.5 kJ/mol, depending on the degree of loading. In addition, the material displays selective adsorption of H2 or O2 over N2 or CO, suggesting possible applications in gas separation technologies. \n\nThe hydrogen storage characteristics of Mg3(NDC)3 were measured using a volumetric gas sorption apparatus. As shown in Figure , the H2 adsorption isotherm at 77 K reveals an uptake of just 2.3 mmol/g (1.7 mol/mol, 0.46 wt %) at 880 Torr. A fit of the Langmuir-Freundlich equation to the data gave a predicted saturation of 3.0 mmol/g (2.2 mol/mol, 0.60 wt %). This represents a rather low storage capacity compared to a number of other metal-organic framework solids, and suggests that the pore dimensions in Mg3(NDC)3 are somewhat constricted compared to the framework of 1. The steepness of the rise in the isotherm, however, indicates a relatively strong H2 binding interaction. Indeed, by fitting  a second H2 adsorption isotherm measured at 87 K and applying a variant of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, the isosteric heat of adsorption was calculated to lie in the range 7.0-9.5 kJ/mol (see Figure S4). These values are considerably higher than previously reported H2 adsorption enthalpies of 4.7-5.2 kJ/mol in Zn4O(BDC)3 and 5.3-7.4 kJ/mol in the dehydrated Prussian blue analogues M3[Co(CN)6]2 (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn). Consequently, Mg3(NDC)3 can be expected to attain saturation at higher temperatures and lower pressures. The higher binding affinity likely stems in part from the increased van der Waals contact area associated with a very small pore size (as discussed below). Insight into whether interactions with the Mg2+ centers also contribute will potentially be provided by planned low-temperature, high-pressure infrared spectroscopy experiments.  \n\nUnexpectedly, attempts to measure an N2 adsorption isotherm for Mg3(NDC)3 at 77 K revealed almost no N2 uptake (see Figure ). In contrast, it was found that significant quantities of O2 are adsorbed, and fitting the BET equation to the resulting isotherm gave an estimated surface area of 190 m2/g. Notably, the monolayer coverages predicted by fitting the Langmuir equation to the O2 and H2 isotherms were nearly identical (2.25 and 2.30 mmol/g, respectively), suggesting that the same number of binding sites are accessible in each case. To our knowledge, preferential adsorption of H2 over N2 by a coordination solid has been observed previously only in Mn(HCO2)2, while selective adsorption of O2 over N2 has never been demonstrated in such a material. This behavior is analogous to the molecular sieving effect observed in zeolite 4A, which shows O2 adsorption but no N2 uptake at 123 K. In view of the kinetic diameters of 3.46 \u00c5 for O2 and 3.64 \u00c5 for N2, it was concluded that zeolite 4A has pore openings of ca. 3.6 \u00c5. Similarly, assuming that the framework structure does not change upon gas adsorption, it can be inferred that the pore openings in Mg3(NDC)3 are between 3.46 and 3.64 \u00c5 in diameter. As a simple test of this hypothesis, a CO adsorption isotherm was measured (see Figure ). Only a very small amount of CO was adsorbed, consistent with prohibited access to the pores due to its larger kinetic diameter of 3.76 \u00c5.
