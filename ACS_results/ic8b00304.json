This ultramicroporous MOF has most of the features such as porosity (BET surface area = 945 m2/g), CO2 capacity (3.5 mmol/g at ambient temperature and pressure), CO2/N2 selectivity (sCO2/N2 = 250), and fast CO2 diffusion kinetics (D c = 2.25 \u00d7 10-9 m2/s), comparable to some of the other high-performing ultramicroporous MOFs, with strong binding sites. Typically, such MOFs exhibit strong CO2-framework interactions (evidenced from a heat of adsorption \u2265 38 kJ/mol). However, the MOF explained here, despite having channels lined by the amine and the open-metal sites, possesses only a moderate CO2-framework interaction (HOA = 26 kJ/mol). Using periodic DFT, we have probed this counterintuitive observation.\n\nThe HOA calculated using both virial and DFT models employing the 298, 283, 273, and 263 K CO2 isotherms was 26 kJ/mol at zero loading. At higher loadings, the HOA reaches values of 20-22 kJ/mol (A and S17). Such moderate HOA (25-35 kJ/mol) suggests facile regeneration.
