It was found that this interlayer region is partly filled with lattice water molecules and further stabilized by \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions between the triazine rings of the TPT ligand which are aligned in a parallel fashion. Furthermore, the sulfur atom of each NCS- anion participates in hydrogen bonding with a hydrogen atom of a coordinated water molecule belonging to an adjacent sheet and also interacts with the \u03c0 system of other NCS- anions that are close in proximity. Subsequently, we observe the formation of 2D sheets, that are constructed from fragments of [Co(NCS)2(H2O)0.65(MeOH)0.35] and linked by the TPT ligands. The underlying net of 3 was also determined considering each TPT ligand as a three-connected linker and each [Co(NCS)2(H2O)0.65(MeOH)0.35] fragment as a node. The resulting topology is a three-connected uninodal network with the Schla\u0308fli symbol {63}. Therefore, 3 can be identified by the hcb (Shubnikov hexagonal plane net) topology. All CoII atoms are six coordinate and adopt a slightly distorted octahedral geometry, formed by two nitrogen atoms of two distinct TPT pyridyl groups (N2, N2a), two nitrogen atoms of the NCS- anions (N3, N3a), and two oxygen atoms of the water and/or methanol molecules (O1, O1a). The latter solvent molecules exhibit partial occupancies of 65 and 35%, respectively. Moreover, the NCS- anions were found to be N-bound to CoII in a slightly bent fashion with the (Co)N-C-S and Co-N-C(S) bond angles being about 178 and 172\u00b0, respectively, while the Co-N(Py) and Co-N(thiocyanate) bond lengths have been determined to be 2.15 and 2.08 \u00c5, respectively (Table S2).
