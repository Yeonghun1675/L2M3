Herein, we report three types of pic-decorated DFH Keggin-type TAs: Na4[Ln(H2O)5]2[Fe4 (H2O)2(pic)4(B-\u03b2-SbW9O33)2]\u22c526H2O [Ln3+ = La3+ (1), Pr3+ (2), Nd3+ (3), Sm3+ (4), Eu3+ (5)], Na6H4[Fe2W4O9(H2O)2(Hpic)4(B-\u03b2-SbW9O33)2] [Ln(H2O)8]2[Fe4W2 O7(H2O)4(pic)2(Hpic)2(B-\u03b2-SbW9O33)2]\u22c538H2O [Ln3+ = Gd3+ (6), Dy3+ (7)], and Na2H2{[Ln(H2O)6]2[Fe4(H2O)2 (Hpic)2(pic)2(B-\u03b2-SbW9O33)2]}2\u22c544H2O [Ln3+ = Ho3+ (8), Er3+ (9), Hpic = 2-picolinic acid]. The common structure characteristic of 1-5 encompasses a quadripic-inserted Krebs-type [Fe4(H2O)2(pic)4(B-\u03b2-SbW9O33)2]10- moiety supported by two hydrated [Ln(H2O)5]3+ ions on both sides. Interestingly, quadripic-inserted [Fe4(H2O)2(pic)4(B-\u03b2-SbW9O33)2]10- moieties in 1-5 are further linked by the hydrated [Ln(H2O)5]3+ cations and pic ligands, generating a 3-D extended heterometallic framework. 6-7 display an isolated structure and their striking characteristic is that their molecular units comprise two kinds of quadripic-inserted non-Krebs-type [Fe2W4O9(H2O)2(Hpic)4(B-\u03b2-SbW9O33)2]6- and {[Ln(H2O)8]2 [Fe4W2O7(H2O)4(pic)2(Hpic)2(B-\u03b2-SbW9O33)2]}4- subunits. 8-9 shows the 1-D heterometallic double chain built by two crystallographically independent {[Ln(H2O)6]2[Fe4(H2O)2(Hpic)2(pic)2(B-\u03b2-SbW9O33)2]}2- units through Ln3+ linkers. The structural discrepancies of 1-5, 6-7, and 8-9 may mainly stem from the synergistic effect between different coordinate geometries of the Ln3+ cations and various coordination modes of the Hpic ligand because their synthetic conditions are the same. To our knowledge, 1-9 are the first organic-inorganic DFH TA hybrids functionalized by pic ligands. Particularly, the photoluminescence (PL) performances of 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 were studied at ambient temperature. Besides, 5 and 7 were utilized to explore the energy transfer from {B-\u03b2-SbW9} fragments and pic components to Ln3+ ions and the results indicate that {B-\u03b2-SbW9} fragments and pic components can sensitize the emission of Ln3+ ions.

Hence, only the structure discussion of 2 is exemplified. The structure segment of 2 embraces a quadripic-inserted [Pr(H2O)5]2[Fe4 (H2O)2(pic)4(B-\u03b2-SbW9O33)2]4- hybrid subunit, four Na+ ions, and 26 crystal waters (a). The Krebs-type [Pr(H2O)5]2[Fe4(H2O)2 (pic)4(B-\u03b2-SbW9O33)2]4- subunit encapsulates a tetraFeIII {Fe4(H2O)2(pic)4} group (b), in which four Fe3+ ions are situated on four vertexes of a rhomb with two neighboring edges of 5.613 and 5.566 \u00c5. In the sandwich belt, adjacent tetraFe3+ ions are combined via the Fe-O-W-O-Fe linkages and the Fe2\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Fe2A separation is 5.330 \u00c5, whereas the distance of two external Fe1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Fe1A ions is 9.827 \u00c5 (Figure S2). In addition, the sandwich belt is constituted by two kinds of nonequivalent Fe3+ ions (two internal Fe23+ ions and two external Fe13+ ions). Albeit both inequivalent Fe3+ ions exhibit octahedral configurations, both binding environments are slightly disparate. The octahedron of the Fe13+ ion (c) is constructed from two O atoms (O33, O38) of a {B-\u03b2-SbW9} [Fe-O: 1.921(7)-1.950(7) \u00c5], one O atom (O10A) of another {B-\u03b2-SbW9} [Fe-O: 1.975(7) \u00c5], one water O atom (O1W) [Fe-O: 2.097(8) \u00c5], one carboxylic O atom (O2), and one N atom (N1) root in pic [Fe-O: 2.055(7) \u00c5, Fe-N: 2.148(9) \u00c5]. Besides, O38 and O1W atoms occupy the polar positions of the octahedral Fe13+, whereas O2, O10A, O33, and N1 atoms take up the equatorial plane. Interestingly, in 2, the dihedral angle between the plane containing two W5 atoms and two Fe2 ions and the plane containing four Fe3+ ions is 132.21(20)\u00b0 (Figure S3). Analogously, the octahedral Fe23+ ion (d) is built by two O atoms (O4A, O5A) of one {B-\u03b2-SbW9} [Fe-O: 1.937(6)-1.959(7) \u00c5], two O atoms (O7, O16) of the other {B-\u03b2-SbW9} [Fe-O: 1.958(7)-1.944(6) \u00c5], one carboxylic O atom (O18), and the N atom (N2) of pic [Fe-O: 2.091(7) \u00c5, Fe-N: 2.167(9) \u00c5]. Furthermore, O5A and O18 atoms sit on the polar sites of the octahedral Fe23+ cation and O4A, O7, O16, and N2 atoms establish the equatorial plane. It is interesting that two coordinated water ligands on each Fe3+ cation are replaced by one carboxylic O atom and one N atom from a pic ligand (Figure S4). To our knowledge, this phenomenon that four pic ligands simultaneously substitute eight coordinate water ligands located at the Krebs-type polyoxoanion is observed for the first time. The disordered Pr13+ ion is distributed over two sites with the occupation ratio of 75 and 25% and links to a terminal O atom of a {B-\u03b2-SbW9}. The Pr13+ ion inhabits in a distorted bicapped triangular prism, which is established by a terminal O34 atom of a {B-\u03b2-SbW9} [Pr-O: 2.448(7) \u00c5], two carboxyl O atoms (O35B, O39A) of two pic groups [Pr-O: 2.379(8)-2.521(9) \u00c5], and five aqueous ligands (O2W, O3W, O4W, O5W, and O6W) [Pr-O: 2.423(18)-2.561(12) \u00c5] (e). The {B-\u03b2-SbW9} (f) fragment could be deemed to originate from the hypothetical parent \u03b1-Keggin [\u03b1-SbW12O40]5- polyoxoanion (g) by taking away one {W3O13} trimer group to form the {B-\u03b1-SbW9} segment (h) and accompanying 60\u00b0 clockwise rotation of one {W3O13} trimer among the remaining three {W3O13} trimers. Notably, the starting material is {B-\u03b1-SbW9}, therefore, it is clear that the {B-\u03b1-SbW9} segment in the precursor must have isomerized to the {B-\u03b2-SbW9} segment in the products, which has been previously encountered.

In the {Fe2W4O9(H2O)2(Hpic)4} group, Fe1, Fe1B, W16, and W16B atoms are aligned in a rectangle with the Fe1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5W16B distance of 5.099 \u00c5 and the Fe1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5W16 distance of 7.100 \u00c5. W10 and W10B are inside the rectangle and bridge Fe1, Fe1B, W16, and W16B together via four oxygen atoms, and W10 and W10B are joined to each other through one oxygen atom. The W10\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5W10B distance is 3.884 \u00c5. Interestingly, two Hpic ligands coordinate to W16 and W16B, whereas two Hpic ligands coordinate to Fe1 and Fe1B. In addition, the Fe1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Fe1B and W16\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5W16B distances are 8.844 and 8.639 \u00c5, respectively (Figure S7). The sandwich-type d moiety (e and S6b) is also constituted by two {B-\u03b2-SbW9} segments (f) connected by an interesting organic-inorganic hybrid quadripic-inserted octa-nuclear heterometallic {[Dy(H2O)8]2[Fe4W2O7(H2O)4(pic)2 (Hpic)2} group (g). In the {[Dy(H2O)8]2[Fe4W2O7(H2O)4(pic)2 (Hpic)2} group, Fe2, Fe3, Fe2A, and Fe3A atoms constitute a rectangle with the Fe2\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Fe3 distance of 5.201 \u00c5 and the Fe2\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Fe3A distance of 7.034 \u00c5. The Fe3 and Fe3A distance is 8.757 \u00c5, and the Fe2 and Fe2A distance is 8.739 \u00c5 (Figure S8). Each Fe3+ is coordinated by a pic ligand. W24 and W24A join Fe2, Fe3, Fe2A, and Fe3A together through four O atoms, and W24 and W24A are integrated via one oxygen atom. The W24 and W24A distance is 4.670 \u00c5. Above all, [Dy1(H2O)8]3+ and [Dy1A(H2O)8]3+ ions, respectively, graft to Fe2 and Fe2A ions through the bridging function of the pic ligand. As far as we know, such quadripic-inserted octa-nuclear heterometallic {[Dy(H2O)8]2[Fe4W2O7(H2O)4(pic)2(Hpic)2} group is encountered for the first time in POM chemistry. It should be pointed out that the most conspicuous difference between c and d units lies in their sandwich cores; the sandwich core in the c unit includes a quadripic-inserted hexa-nuclear heterometallic {Fe2W4O9(H2O)2(Hpic)4} group, whereas the sandwich core in the d unit is a quadripic-inserted octa-nuclear heterometallic {[Dy(H2O)8]2[Fe4W2O7(H2O)4(pic)2(Hpic)2} group. Overtly, there are three types of crystallographically unique Fe3+ ions in 7, namely, Fe13+ cation in the c unit and Fe23+ and Fe33+ ions in the d unit. Albeit the three Fe3+ ions exhibit the distorted octahedral configurations, their binding environments are distinguishing. The octahedron of the Fe13+ ion (h) is established by two O atoms (O11B, O39B) of one {B-\u03b2-SbW9} [Fe-O: 1.95(2)-1.984(18) \u00c5], one O atom (O4) of another {B-\u03b2-SbW9} [Fe-O: 1.908(16) \u00c5], one aqueous ligand (O1W) [Fe-O: 2.06(2) \u00c5], one carboxylic O atom (O28), and one N (N2) atom of a pic [Fe-O: 2.03(2) \u00c5, Fe-N: 2.19(2) \u00c5]. Similarly, the octahedral Fe23+ ion (i) is built by two O atoms (O36, O65) of one {B-\u03b2-SbW9} [Fe-O: 1.92(2)-1.99(2) \u00c5], one O atom (O33) of the other {B-\u03b2-SbW9} [Fe-O: 1.94(2) \u00c5], one water molecule (O2W) [Fe-O: 2.11(2) \u00c5], one carboxylic O atom (O53), and a N atom (N3) of a pic [Fe-O: 2.07(2) \u00c5, Fe-N: 2.11(2) \u00c5]. Moreover, the octahedral geometry of the Fe33+ cation (j) is identical to those of Fe13+ and Fe23+ cations and is constituted by two O atoms (O48, O64) of one {B-\u03b2-SbW9} [Fe-O: 1.84(3)-2.04(3) \u00c5], one O atom (O58) from the other {B-\u03b2-SbW9} [Fe-O: 1.91(2) \u00c5], one coordinate water molecule (O3W) [Fe-O: 1.89(3) \u00c5], one carboxylic O atom (O81), and one N atom (N4) of a pic [Fe-O: 2.02(3) \u00c5, Fe-N: 2.32(3) \u00c5]. Furthermore, the polar positions of octahedral Fe13+, Fe23+, and Fe33+ cations are occupied by O11B, O1W; O36, O2W; and O48, O3W, respectively. Their equatorial planes are constituted by O4, O28, O39B, N2; O33, O53, O65, N3; and O58, O64, O81, N4, respectively. Additionally, the Dy13+ cation directly coordinates to the carboxylate oxygen of the pic. The Dy13+ ion grafting to the sandwich belt adopts a twisted tricapped triangular prism configuration formed by an O atom (O43) of a pic [Dy-O: 2.29(2) \u00c5] and eight water ligands (O4W, O5W, O6W, O7W, O8W, O9W, O10W, and O11W) [Dy-O: 2.33(3)-2.53(3) \u00c5] (k). More importantly, the molecular units {[Fe2W4O9(H2O)2(Hpic)4(B-\u03b2-SbW9 O33)2][Dy(H2O)8]2[Fe4W2O7(H2O)4(pic)2(Hpic)2(B-\u03b2-SbW9O33)2]}10- are trimly distributed in the -AAA- fashion in the bc plane (l and S9).

Similarly,\nthe broad emission peak at 400\u2013580 nm is assigned to {B-\u03b2-SbW<sub>9</sub>} fragments and pic components, and the weak emission peak at 575 nm is attributable\nto the Dy<sup>3+</sup>\n<sup>4</sup>F<sub>9/2</sub> \u2192 <sup>6</sup>H<sub>13/2</sub> transition. By monitoring\nthe emission peak at 575 nm of <bold>7</bold>, the excitation spectrogram\nof <bold>7</bold> (d, the purple line) was obtained and exhibits an obvious excitation\npeak at 451 nm assigned to the Dy<sup>3+</sup>\n<sup>6</sup>H<sub>15/2</sub> \u2192 <sup>4</sup>I<sub>15/2</sub> transition. Notably, the emission band derived from <sup>3</sup>T<sub>1u</sub> \u2192 <sup>1</sup>A<sub>1g</sub> transition of {B-\u03b2-SbW<sub>9</sub>} fragment and the \u03c0* \u2192 \u03c0 or \u03c0* \u2192\nn transitions of pic components in the emission spectrogram of <bold>7</bold> can be superimposed on the excitation band derived from\nDy<sup>3+</sup>\n<sup>6</sup>H<sub>15/2</sub> \u2192 <sup>4</sup>I<sub>15/2</sub> transition in the excitation spectrogram of <bold>7</bold>, which proves the presence of energy transfer from {B-\u03b2-SbW<sub>9</sub>} fragment and pic ligands to Dy<sup>3+</sup> ions (d). Furthermore, the TRES measurements of <bold>7</bold> were\nalso performed on excitation with a light of 275 nm in the emission\nscope of 400\u2013600 nm (e,f). In the photoexcitation procedure of <bold>7</bold> (time is from 8.9 to 11.4 \u03bcs), apparently, the emission intensities\nof {B-\u03b2-SbW<sub>9</sub>} fragments, pic components, and Dy<sup>3+</sup> ions quickly enhance with increasing time (e). When the emission intensities\nreach the strongest, the emission intensities of {B-\u03b2-SbW<sub>9</sub>} fragments, pic components, and Dy<sup>3+</sup> ions begin\nto decline over the time increase from 11.4 to 17.0 \u03bcs (f). With time elapsing,\nthe PL decay rate of the emission bands of {B-\u03b2-SbW<sub>9</sub>} fragments and pic components is faster than that of the emission\npeaks of Dy<sup>3+</sup> ions (b), which manifests to a certain degree the existence\nof energy transfer from {B-\u03b2-SbW<sub>9</sub>} fragments and\npic components to Dy<sup>3+</sup> ions because the sensitization of\n{B-\u03b2-SbW<sub>9</sub>} fragments and pic components toward the\nemission of Dy<sup>3+</sup> ions in some degree inhibits the decrease\nof the intensity of the emission peaks of Dy<sup>3+</sup> ions. Moreover,\nthe emission color changes in CIE chromaticity diagram (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b02103/suppl_file/ic8b02103_si_002.pdf\">Figure S23</ext-link>) can also demonstrate that the existence\nof energy transfer from {B-\u03b2-SbW<sub>9</sub>} fragments and\npic components to Dy<sup>3+</sup> ions. In a word, the energy transfer\nfrom {B-\u03b2-SbW<sub>9</sub>} fragments and pic components to Ln<sup>3+</sup> ions occurs in the emission processes of <bold>5</bold> and <bold>7</bold>.</p>", "clean_text": "The pic ligand also reveals two emission peaks centered at 450 and 484 nm between 400 and 600 nm that are attributable to the \u03c0* \u2192 \u03c0 or \u03c0* \u2192 n transitions. Therefore, it can be definitely concluded that the broad emission band in the range of ca. 400-580 nm in the emitting spectrogram of 5 roots in the combined contribution of {B-\u03b2-SbW9} fragments and pic ligands. On the other hand, by monitoring the 5D0 \u2192 7F2 emission at 617 nm of Eu3+ centers in the emitting spectrogram of 5, the excitation spectrogram of 5 (a, the bule line) was recorded and reveals an excitation peak at 477 nm resulting from the typical 7F0 \u2192 5D2 transition of Eu3+ centers. It can be explicitly observed from a that the emission band derived from 3T1u \u2192 1A1g transition of {B-\u03b2-SbW9} fragment and the \u03c0* \u2192 \u03c0 or \u03c0* \u2192 n transitions of pic components in the emission spectrum of 5 can overlap with the excitation peak (7F0 \u2192 5D2) derived from Eu3+ ions in the excitation spectrum of 5. This phenomenon can testify the energy transfer emergence from {B-\u03b2-SbW9} fragments and pic components to Eu3+ centers. To consolidate the energy transfer existence from {B-\u03b2-SbW9} fragments and pic components to Eu3+ centers, the time-resolved emission spectrum (TRES) tests of 5 have been performed on excitation with a light of 275 nm in the emission scope of 400-720 nm (b,c). During the course of the excitation of 5 (time is from 9.2 to 11.6 \u03bcs), clearly, the emission intensities of {B-\u03b2-SbW9} fragments, pic components, and Eu3+ centers rapidly increase with prolonging time (b). After the emission intensities of 5 reach the strongest, the emission band intensities of {B-\u03b2-SbW9} fragments, components, and Eu3+ centers begin to decline as time increases from 11.6 to 14.6 \u03bcs (c). As time goes on, the PL decay rate of the emission band of {B-\u03b2-SbW9} fragments and pic ligands is much faster than that of the emission peaks of Eu3+ centers (a), which indicates to some extent the energy transfer from {B-\u03b2-SbW9} fragments and components to Eu3+ centers because the sensitization of {B-\u03b2-SbW9} fragments and pic components and Eu3+ centers toward the emission of Eu3+ centers in some degree alleviates the decrease of the intensity of the emission peaks of Eu3+ ions. In addition, the emission color changes in CIE chromaticity diagram (Figure S21) can also demonstrate the existence of energy transfer from {B-\u03b2-SbW9} fragments and pic ligands to Eu3+ ions. For 6-7, take 7 as an example. Similar to 5, based on the UV-visible absorption spectrograms of the solid-state samples of Na9[B-\u03b1-SbW9O33]\u22c519.5H2O and the pic ligand and 6 (Figures S17 and S22), we still use the excitation at 275 nm to collect the PL emission spectrogram of 7. The PL emission spectrogram of 7 in 400-600 nm is displayed in d in a colorful line. Similarly, the broad emission peak at 400-580 nm is assigned to {B-\u03b2-SbW9} fragments and pic components, and the weak emission peak at 575 nm is attributable to the Dy3+ 4F9/2 \u2192 6H13/2 transition. By monitoring the emission peak at 575 nm of 7, the excitation spectrogram of 7 (d, the purple line) was obtained and exhibits an obvious excitation peak at 451 nm assigned to the Dy3+ 6H15/2 \u2192 4I15/2 transition. Notably, the emission band derived from 3T1u \u2192 1A1g transition of {B-\u03b2-SbW9} fragment and the \u03c0* \u2192 \u03c0 or \u03c0* \u2192 n transitions of pic components in the emission spectrogram of 7 can be superimposed on the excitation band derived from Dy3+ 6H15/2 \u2192 4I15/2 transition in the excitation spectrogram of 7, which proves the presence of energy transfer from {B-\u03b2-SbW9} fragment and pic ligands to Dy3+ ions (d). Furthermore, the TRES measurements of 7 were also performed on excitation with a light of 275 nm in the emission scope of 400-600 nm (e,f). In the photoexcitation procedure of 7 (time is from 8.9 to 11.4 \u03bcs), apparently, the emission intensities of {B-\u03b2-SbW9} fragments, pic components, and Dy3+ ions quickly enhance with increasing time (e). When the emission intensities reach the strongest, the emission intensities of {B-\u03b2-SbW9} fragments, pic components, and Dy3+ ions begin to decline over the time increase from 11.4 to 17.0 \u03bcs (f).

Moreover, the emission color changes in CIE chromaticity diagram (Figure S23) can also demonstrate that the existence of energy transfer from {B-\u03b2-SbW9} fragments and pic components to Dy3+ ions.
