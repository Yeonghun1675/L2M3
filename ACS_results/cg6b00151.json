Recently, a study of solid-state luminescent properties of organic nitrile ligands and their Ag(I) coordination polymers revealed that the emission wavelengths of organic nitrile ligands strongly depend on their crystal packing. In this study, the luminescent properties of the crystalline solids of L, 1, 3, and 4 were investigated at room temperature by exciting at wavelength of 275 nm (). Ligand L was found to exhibit a strong emission at 451 nm. Its complexation with Ag(I) significantly affected the emission, which for 1 was found to be red-shifted to 470 nm. For 3 and 4 emission bands were observed at 465-470 nm. Compound 4 showed also a green emission with a maximum at 530 nm. The generation of this new emission band in 4 is most probably due to the interlayer \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions between aromatic units of guest molecules in the solid state (b). \n\n L \n\nC26H30N4, M r = 398.54, monoclinic, space group P21/n (No. 14), a = 7.1553(5), b = 28.203(2), c = 16.4056(13) \u00c5, \u03b2 = 98.339(3)\u00b0, V = 3275.7(4) \u00c53, T = 110 K, Z = 6, \u03bc(Mo K\u03b1) = 0.07 mm-1, \u03c1(calcd) = 1.21 g\u22c5cm-3, 23110 reflections measured to \u03b8 = 25.0\u00b0, of which 5771 were unique (Rint = 0.037) and 4476 with I > 2\u03c3(I).
