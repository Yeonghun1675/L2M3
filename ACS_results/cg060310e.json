Although some types of decameric H2O clusters, for example, with an ice Ic-like H2O arrangement, single cyclic ring, or cube-shaped core, have been observed or theoretically predicted, the present mode of the (H2O)10 cluster with a quasiplanar octameric core and two dangling water molecules in 1 is rather unusual. Moreover, the  above observations on the similarity of interchain Cu-Cu and Na-Na separations in all dimensions with the unit cell parameters of 1 indicate a highly symmetrical and regular organization of this structure and constitute an uncommon feature, also in view of the heterometallic and heteroligand character.
