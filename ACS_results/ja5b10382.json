N2 adsorption data collected at 77 K for 1a gave a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 885(105) m2/g, confirming the presence of permanent microporosity (see Figure S8). This value is the second highest reported for a porous magnet, eclipsed only by a value of 1050 m2/g reported for a lactate-bridged CoII solid. Finally, the structural distortion is fully reversible, as evidenced by powder X-ray diffraction, with 1a converting back to 1 upon soaking in DMF (see Figure S6). Similar \"breathing\" behavior has been previously observed in a number of MOFs.
