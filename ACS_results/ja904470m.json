Compound 2 showed a strong absorption at 509 nm with vibrational structure, and BODIPY (3), bearing the same ligand, showed quite similar absorption properties (\u03bbmax = 514 nm). On the other hand, a distinct difference in the fluorescence properties was revealed. Steady-state fluorescence emission of 2 was observed at 518 nm with a small Stokes shift. However, its quantum yield was 0.04, which is considerably smaller than that of 3 (\u03a6f = 0.89; \u03bbf = 525 nm).", "data": [[[{"property name": "fluorescence quantum yield", "value": "0.04", "unit": "", "condition": "before dechlorination"}, {"property name": "fluorescence quantum yield", "value": "0.42", "unit": "", "condition": "after dechlorination"}, {"property name": "absorption", "value": "509", "unit": "nm", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "fluorescence emission", "value": "518", "unit": "nm", "condition": ""}, {"property name": "quantum yield", "value": "0.04", "unit": "", "condition": ""}]]], "include_properties": ["etc"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['etc']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"property name\": \"fluorescence quantum yield\",\n        \"value\": \"0.04\",\n        \"unit\": \"\",\n        \"condition\": \"before dechlorination\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"property name\": \"fluorescence quantum yield\",\n        \"value\": \"0.42\",\n        \"unit\": \"\",\n        \"condition\": \"after dechlorination\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"property name\": \"absorption\",\n        \"value\": \"509\",\n        \"unit\": \"nm\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"property name\": \"fluorescence emission\",\n        \"value\": \"518\",\n        \"unit\": \"nm\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"property name\": \"quantum yield\",\n        \"value\": \"0.04\",\n        \"unit\": \"\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 9, "type": "table", "classification": ["Property"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Optical Properties of Tin Dipyrromethenes <bold>2</bold> and <bold>4</bold> and BODIPY (<bold>3</bold>)<xref rid=\"tbl1-fn1\"></xref>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table>\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"5\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col5\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead valign=\"middle\">\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\"></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\u03bb<sub>max</sub> (nm)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\u03f5 (M<sup>\u22121</sup> cm<sup>\u22121</sup>)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\u03bb<sub>f</sub> (nm)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\u03a6<sub>f</sub>\u2009\n                        <xref rid=\"tbl1-fn2\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row valign=\"top\">\n<oasis:entry>\n<bold>2</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>509</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>8.54 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>518</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.04</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row valign=\"top\">\n<oasis:entry>\n<bold>3</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>514</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>9.71 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>525</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.89</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row valign=\"top\">\n<oasis:entry>\n<bold>4</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>513</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>6.46 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>524</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.42</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n<table-wrap-foot>\n<fn id=\"tbl1-fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>In benzene.</p>\n</fn>\n<fn id=\"tbl1-fn2\">\n<label>b</label>\n<p>Absolute quantum yields.</p>\n</fn>\n</table-wrap-foot>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "Table 1.
