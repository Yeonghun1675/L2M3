Small amounts of impurities (e.g., KNO3) considerably decrease the shock and heat sensitivity. It is interesting to note that we were able to detect the DNM anion in a FAB- mass spectrometry experiment that was carried out with crystals of 1. To determine the explosion gases of 1, combined IR and MS pyrolysis experiments were carried out. The only gaseous products observed were N2O, NO, and HCN. Differential scanning calorimetry experiments of 1 (Table S1, Figure S1, Supporting Information) revealed that 1 undergoes an exothermic decomposition (explosion, \u0394H = -55.8 kcal/mol) with an onset of 168.56 \u00b0C (\u03b2 = 5 \u00b0C/min) in a temperature range of 168-186 \u00b0C and an estimated activation energy of ca. 48 kcal/mol. It is assumed that the presence of a delocalized \u03c0-system probably accounts for the remarkable kinetic stability of 1 (see below).
