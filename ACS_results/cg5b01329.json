However, in the case of Cu(II) complex, 1, the layers are propagated by a triangular SBU, which is a rare phenomenon. Notably, Cu(I) forms several metallic clusters with the help of anion and ligand bridging; however, it is not so common in the case of Cu(II) complexes. The Co(II) complex, 4, contains an usual rectangular grid without any metal clusters. The 1D-coordination polymer formed by the Co(II) complex, 3, is quite novel as there are very few reports that contain linking of macrocycles to form tubular networks. Interestingly, both these structures have two types of water tetramers that are being tapped in the cavities: in 3, it is a cyclic tetramer, while in 4 it is a triangular tetramer in which one H2O is at the center and connects to three water molecules via hydrogen bonds. The complex 2 exemplifies the formation of 3D-diamondoid networks containing two types of arms that differ significantly in their lengths.
