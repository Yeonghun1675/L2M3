This solid product was then examined via powder XRD to reveal that the main framework remained intact (see below). Part of this solid product was also dissolved in concentrated HNO3 for inductively coupled plasma (ICP) elemental analysis, which indicated a Zn/Hg molar ratio of 5.56:1. Chemical analysis of the product C45H57Cl1.44Hg0.72O14.5S12Zn4, corresponding to Zn4O\u22c5(L)3\u22c5(HgCl2)0.72\u22c5(EtOH)1.5, yielded the following: Calcd [C (32.33%), H (3.44%)]; Found [C (32.58%), H (3.06%)].\n\nThe HgCl2 was depleted from the host framework via the following procedure: a mixture of Zn4O\u22c5(L)3\u22c5(HgCl2)0.72\u22c5(EtOH)1.5 (5.0 mg) (the ratio of Zn/Hg was predetermined by ICP) and freshly distilled anhydrous acetonitrile (2.5 mL) in a sealed Pyrex glass tube was heated at 100 \u00b0C for 2 days and cooled to room temperature. The product was filtered and washed with freshly distilled acetonitrile and then dried in vacuo overnight (yield = 4.5 mg). The sample then was dissolved in concentrated HNO3, and the ensuing ICP elemental analysis yielded a Zn/Hg ratio of 36.4:1, which indicates that ~85% of the HgCl2 component had been removed from the solid sample. Chemical analysis of the product C44.4H51.6Cl0.22Hg0.11N1.2O13S12Zn4, corresponding to Zn4O\u22c5(L)3\u22c5(HgCl2)0.11\u22c5(CH3CN)1.2, yielded the following: Calcd [C (35.88%), H (3.50%), N (1.13%)]; Found [C (35.62%), H (3.15%), N (1.48%)].\n\nMoreover, the majority of the HgCl2 component in the HgCl2-loaded sample of 1 can be removed by a polar solvent such as acetonitrile, while maintaining the structural integrity of the host net of 1. For example, a mixture of the above Zn4O\u22c5L 3\u22c5(HgCl2)0.72\u22c5(EtOH)1.5 (5.0 mg) and freshly distilled anhydrous acetonitrile (2.5 mL) in a sealed Pyrex glass tube was heated at 100 \u00b0C for 2 days and then cooled to room temperature. The product was filtered and washed with freshly distilled acetonitrile and then dried in vacuo overnight (yield = 4.5 mg). ICP elemental analysis yields a Zn/Hg ratio of 36.4:1, indicating that ~85% of the HgCl2 component has been removed from the HgCl2-loaded sample (see the  for the details). Powder XRD studies on the HgCl2-depleted sample thus recovered revealed that the relative intensity of the peaks was largely restored to resemble that of the pristine samples of 1, consistent with the recovering of the porous features of the host net (pattern d in Figure ).", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "Dimethyl 2,5-dimercaptoterephthalate", "symbol": "S1", "chemical formula": "C10H10O4S2"},
