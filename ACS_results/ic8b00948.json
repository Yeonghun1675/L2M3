Therefore, the multiple supramolecular interactions\nbetween host and guest molecule within the chiral microenvironment\nthus provide the key driving force and may be responsible for the\nefficient recognition and separation.</p>", "clean_text": "To investigate the nature of enantioselectivity as well as the characteristics of the interactions between host framework and adsorbate molecules, the structure of host-guest complex was carefully examined. Single crystals of 1\u22c54-BrPhEtOH (4-BrPhEtOH = 1-(4-bromophenyl)ethanol) were synthesized through the same procedure as that used for 1, except that additional 4-BrPhEtOH and MeOH were added. The structure clearly revealed that the adduct 1\u22c54-BrPhEtOH is isostructural to the original host structure (a). Only (S)-4-BrPhEtOH was observed in (S)-1, which is consistent with the separation experiment. Each of the trapped alcohols is involved with different supramolecular interactions (b). The OH group of alcohol interacts with adjacent carboxylate oxygen to form a hydrogen bond (O\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O = 2.401 \u00c5) and forms C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O interactions with the coordinated DMF and the benzene ring of the ligand (C\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O = 3.173 and 2.919 \u00c5). The methyl group of alcohol interacts with the chiral OH group of the biphenol backbone through the bridge of free water guests to form C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O interaction and hydrogen bonds (C\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O = 2.200 \u00c5; O\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O = 2.321 and 2.684 \u00c5) and forms C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O interaction (C\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O = 2.988 \u00c5) with the carboxyl oxygen atom. The structure is further reinforced by face-to-face intermolecular \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction: each 4-BrPhEtOH unit is engaged in one \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking (plane-to-plane separation = 3.868 \u00c5 and dihedral angle = 26\u00b0) with one benzene ring of the ligand. In addition, the weak C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Br interaction formed between the Br atom of 4-BrPhEtOH with the coordinated DMF (C\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Br = 3.399 \u00c5) may also have some impact on the enantioselective recognition process. Therefore, the multiple supramolecular interactions between host and guest molecule within the chiral microenvironment thus provide the key driving force and may be responsible for the efficient recognition and separation.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 16, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig3\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) View of the structure of host\u2013guest\ncomplex <bold>1</bold>\u00b74-BrPhEtOH.
