Polar groups have been shown to enhance CO2 sorption, although Walton et al. studied DMOFs and found little effect from polar groups but considerable effect from methyl groups. Their findings are in good agreement with ours, especially for CO2 uptake when alkyl groups are present vs Br substituents. In the case of tp-PMBB-1-lon-e variants, the uptake values correlate with pore size and functionality rather than surface area. This is exemplified by tp-PMBB-1-lon-e-t-Bu, which exhibits a higher uptake for CO2 than all of the higher surface area variants. Isosteric heats of adsorption were calculated from the 273 and 298 K data (Figure a,b) using the virial equation (see ) and range from around 19 to 26 kJ/mol. In addition, tp-PMBB-1-lon-e-t-Bu exhibits the highest Q st at both zero coverage and higher loadings together with the highest Henry constant (K H) (see ). We attribute its better performance to the confined pore space generated by the bulky tert-butyl groups. tp-PMBB-1-lon-e-fdc exhibits the highest surface area, which we attribute to the smaller size of fdc2- with respect to bdc2-. The introduction of 5-substituents considerably reduces surface area, which might hinder accessibility to the tetrahedral and the trigonal bipyramidal cages. Other structural features, e.g., the angle subtended at the flexible tp-PMBB-1 moiety (differences in C-\u03bc3O-C angles are <1\u00b0), are invariant. Further studies to address how ligand flexibility might impact porosity and carbon dioxide sorption are currently underway in our laboratory.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 14, "type": "text", "classification": ["property"], "content": "<p>A similar trend in heat of adsorption was observed for CH<sub>4</sub> sorption at low pressure.
