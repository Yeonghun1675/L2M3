For instance, normally the CO2 pressure should remain high to make desirable portions dissolve in solution. However, with a MOF as a heterogeneous catalyst, the reaction can be conducted in the gas phase, in which CO2 and epoxide gas can diffuse to the catalytic center more easily than in the liquid phase without any solubility concern. Moreover, with the gas phase starting materials, catalyzed by solid MOFs, generating liquid products, the separation process would be significantly simplified.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 33, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we have synthesized a series of new porphyrinic\nzirconium MOFs, PCN-224(M), by adopting a linker eliminations approach.\nThe PCN-224(M) series exhibits high surface area and 3-D open channels.\nMoreover, PCN-224 shows remarkable stability in a wide range pH aqueous\nsolution.

To the best of our knowledge, the BET surface area of PCN-224(Ni) represents the highest among all reported porphyrinic MOFs. Such high surface areas should be attributed to the 3-D large open channels in the framework, which makes most of the pore surface accessible. Other PCN-224 MOFs with different metal centers in the porphyrin also show similar N2 adsorption isotherms and surface areas (Figure a,b).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "PCN-224", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "Zr6"}, "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "2600", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": "pH = 0 to pH = 11 aqueous solution"}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "790", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "", "condition": "STP"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "PCN-224(Ni)", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "2600", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "", "unit": "", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": "type-I isotherm"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["surface_area", "gas_adsorption"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['surface_area', 'gas_adsorption']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"PCN-224\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"Zr6\"\n        },\n        \"surface area\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"BET\",\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"2600\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"pH = 0 to pH = 11 aqueous solution\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"N2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"790\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"77 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"STP\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"PCN-224(Ni)\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"surface area\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"BET\",\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"2600\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"N2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"\",\n                \"unit\": \"\",\n                \"temperature\": \"\",\n                \"pressure\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"type-I isotherm\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 31, "type": "table", "classification": ["Property"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>CO<sub>2</sub>/Propylene Oxide Coupling\nReaction Catalyzed by PCN-224(Co)</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup align=\"justify\" cols=\"4\">\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">run</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">conversion\n(%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">TON<xref rid=\"t1fn1\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">TOF (h<sup>\u20131</sup>)<xref rid=\"t1fn2\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>1</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>42</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>461</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>115</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>2</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>33</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>419</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>104</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>3</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>39</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>518</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>129</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n<table-wrap-foot>\n<fn id=\"t1fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>Moles of propylene oxide consumed/moles\nof Co.</p>\n</fn>\n<fn id=\"t1fn2\">\n<label>b</label>\n<p>Moles of propylene\noxide consumed/moles\nof Co/reaction time.</p>\n</fn>\n</table-wrap-foot>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "Table 1.
