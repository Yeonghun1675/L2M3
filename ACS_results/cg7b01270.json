It is also found that one of the compounds shows reversible structural transformation on dehydration and rehydration, which was also thoroughly investigated by different techniques. In addition, results from gas and solvent vapor sorption experiments are found to be quite interesting and consistent with the structural features. From the study it is interesting to note that, despite the use of both flexible and rigid dicarboxylate linkers along with same bent coordinating ligand, 1 and 2 are found to be isostructural and the rigidity or flexibility of a ligand seems to have no effect on the overall structure, although the compounds with straight coordinating linkers have structural similarity as succinate containing pairs 3 and 5, and fumarate containing pairs 4 and 6.

It has been quite ubiquitous that the pillared layer structure is more likely to be formed by a rigid ligand and flexibility in ligand favors interpenetration, but here exactly the opposite trend is observed.

In such an adamantane cage, Zn\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Zn distances through 4-bpdb and fum are ~15.4 and ~8.8 \u00c5, respectively. These adamantoid cages are interconnected and extended to form a 3D diamondoid network with large hexagonal channels of a dimension about 18.9 \u00d7 14.4 \u00c52 (c). Topologically the framework can be presented as a 4-connected uninodal net with the Schla\u0308fli symbol {66} (f). Every diamondoid 3D network is interpenetrated with another four equivalent diamondoid networks to form a Class Ia 5-fold interpenetrated dimondoid network (e,f). Notably, the channels dimension is sufficiently decreased, and the overall 1D rectangular channels of dimension 9.6 \u00d7 7.3 \u00c52 along the b axis occur and guest water molecules reside in these channels (d). By PLATON the solvent-accessible void space of 4 was calculated and found as 27.5% of the total crystal volume.\n\nThermogravimetric Analysis (TG) and Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) Study\n\nTo study the framework stability of the compounds 1-6, thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) studies are carried out. For both the studies a crystalline powder sample is used, and TGA has been carried out in the range of 25-650 \u00b0C (Figure S9). Single crystal analysis has shown that isostructural compounds 1 and 2 have no solvent molecule, and TGA is consistent with this; there is no significant weight loss up to ~200 \u00b0C for both of them, and then a steady decrease of weight loss was observed. Eventually, compound 3 shows a gradual weight loss with a step of 7.66% (40-80 \u00b0C), which corresponds to the escape of guest water molecules and the weight loss is equivalent to ~5 (4.88) water molecules. The desolvated framework is stable up to 150 \u00b0C, and after that it steadily disintegrates to unrecognized product. The TGA curve (Figure S9) of compound 4 shows there is no significant weight loss up to 90 \u00b0C, and then it starts a gradual weight loss with a step of 8.12% up to 190 \u00b0C, corresponding to ~2 water molecules. This dehydrated framework is stable up to 270 \u00b0C. Afterward it continuously dissociates to an unidentified product. TGA of 5 depicts that guest water molecules started to escape just after 40 \u00b0C and continuous up to 137 \u00b0C. A certain change in slope at ~137 \u00b0C indicates that guest molecules are completely removed from the system with a ~7% weight loss, which is equivalent to ~3 water molecules. Afterward with almost the same rate (but not equal) it dissociates to unrecognized products. From TGA it has been revealed that compound 6 shows a sharp weight loss with a step of 2.48% (60-90 \u00b0C), corresponding to the escape of one guest water molecule from the compound. This dehydrated framework is stable up to 370 \u00b0C with no significant weight loss. This is followed by a sharp weight loss, caused by an unrecognized product probably due to the decomposition of the frameworks.\n\nHowever, the water adsorption shows enhancement of the amount of adsorption accompanied by some interesting phenomenon. The H2O adsorption profile for 3' exhibits a gate opening phenomenon; no uptake (~5 mL g-1) occurs at low pressure and then at P/P 0 ~ 0.422, a sharp rise takes place up to P/P 0 ~ 0.599, associated with an uptake of 207 mL g-1, and the final uptake amount reaches 235.6 mL g-1 (c). The final uptake amount is equivalent to a total of 12 water molecules; i.e., the converted structure can uptake more water molecules than the number present in its mother compound. For 4, a type II adsorption is observed with a final uptake of ~69.3 mL g-1. There is a certain interesting scenario with 5; it uptakes water up to P/P 0 ~ 0.17 with a continuous rate of ~61 mL g-1, equivalent to 2.1 water molecules, and then there is a change in the rate of adsorption, which ends at P/P 0 ~ 0.35, of ~85 mL g-1, equivalent to a total of three water molecules (c). Again a change of rate is observed and the final amount reaches ~150.3 mL g-1 at P/P 0 ~ 0.90, which is equivalent to ~5 (5.2) molecules of water. No significant adsorption is observed for 6; the final amount is ~38.6 mL g-1(c).\n\nLuminescence Study\n\nOptical properties of MOFs with d10 metal centers and recent successful use of them in various applications have brought them one more time under the spotlight of interest of researchers. Solid state photoluminescence study of the d10 complexes 1-6 and free respective ligands were performed at room temperature (). The ligand 3-bpdb and corresponding complexes 1 and 2 show emission maxima at 398 nm (\u03bbex = 255 nm), 405 nm (\u03bbex = 265 nm), and 408 nm (\u03bbex = 265 nm) respectively (a). Similar emission spectra is found for the 4-bpdb and its complexes 3 and 4. Complexes 3 and 4 exhibit emission maxima at 396 nm (\u03bbex = 255 nm) and 407 nm (\u03bbex = 265 nm) respectively and the ligand 4-bpdb at 394 nm (\u03bbex = 250 nm) (b). For the rest, ligand bpee shows emission spectra at 396 nm (\u03bbex = 260 nm) where its complexes 5 and 6 show emission maxima at 401 nm (\u03bbex = 260 nm) and 396 nm (\u03bbex = 250 nm)
