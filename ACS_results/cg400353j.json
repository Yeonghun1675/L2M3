Consequently, exploring heterogeneous POM-based photocatalysts is one of the key issues in this research field. POM-based inorganic-organic hybrid compounds prepared in the hydrothermal or solvothermal environments usually show a very low solubility or even insolubility in water, which reveals an ideal route to develop new photocatalysts for the degradations of organic dyes in aqueous media. Herein, all three compounds are insoluble in water, and therefore their heterogeneous photocatalytic performances were investigated via the experimental model of RhB photodegradation under UV irradiation. To further confirm the insolubility of all three compounds, B, Cu, Si, and W in the solution of RhB were analyzed on ICP spectrometer at the end of photocatalytic reaction. No signals of above elements can be detected, indicating that all compounds are insoluble or decomposed in the photocatalytic reaction. The solid-state UV-vis spectra of three compounds were also checked, showing absorption bands in the range of 200-350 nm (). These characteristic peaks are mainly attributed to the O\u2192W charge transfer transition of POM units, and such absorption bands will not overlap the UV-vis absorption peaks of RhB species during the photocatalytic experiments. Moreover, the photocatalytic properties of the [CuLo]Cl2, [Bu4N]5BW12 salt, and the blank RhB aqueous solution without any catalyst were also checked as the control experiments. The RhB solutions were monitored by UV-vis spectra, and the decolorization speeds under different conditions are displayed in Figure .", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 27, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig8\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>8</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Absorption spectra of the RhB aqueous solution during\nthe photodegradation\nunder 500 W Hg-lamp irradiation with (a) <bold>1</bold>, (b) <bold>2</bold>, (c) <bold>3</bold>, (d) [Bu<sub>4</sub>N]<sub>5</sub>BW<sub>12</sub> powder, (e) no catalyst, and (f) [CuL<italic toggle=\"yes\">o</italic>]Cl<sub>2</sub> complex.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr10\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cg-2013-00353j_0008.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 8  Absorption spectra of the RhB aqueous solution during the photodegradation under 500 W Hg-lamp irradiation with (a) 1, (b) 2, (c) 3, (d) [Bu4N]5BW12 powder, (e) no catalyst, and (f) [CuLo]Cl2 complex.
