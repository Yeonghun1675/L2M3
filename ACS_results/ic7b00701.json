The butterfly-shaped hysteresis loop of 1 at 2 K further confirms the slower relaxation process than that of 2 under an external field ( inset). The relaxation time (\u03c4) of both complexes was also extracted by fitting the ac magnetic susceptibilities with a generalized Debye model (Figure S6b,d).

However, the \u03b1 values increase to 0.38 for 1 (at 3 K) and 0.33 for 2 (at 2 K); these relatively large \u03b1 values for both complexes at low-temperature region may be attributed to the onset of QTM.
