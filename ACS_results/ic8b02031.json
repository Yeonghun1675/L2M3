Transparently, great improvement of CO2 uptake  was noticed. To further understand the interactions, we calculated the CO2 adsorption enthalpies of both, as shown in b. The zero-coverage CO2 adsorption enthalpy of HHU-5 is 25.6 kJ mol-1, which is quite comparable with that of HHU-5C (25.1 kJ mol-1) but higher than that of PCN-306 (24.1 kJ mol-1). Althrough the improvment of CO2 adsorption enthalpy in either HHU-5 or HHU-5C is not significant, it still implies to some extent that both tetrazolyl  and carboxyl groups can enhance the interactions between CO2 molecules and MOFs, and tetrazolyl with uncoordinated N atoms works better than polar carboxyl group in the whole range and especially in the higher loading range. Theoretically, all four uncoordinated N atoms are able to act as electron-rich sites to attract the electropositive carbon atoms of CO2 molecules and form Lewis acid-base pairs. However, due to the hydrogen bonding between tetrazolyl groups from every pair of ligand B, the accessibility of these N atoms is limited, and therefore the CO2 adsorption enthalpy of HHU-5 at initial uptake does not show significant improvement. As the pressure increases, more CO2 molecules enter into the pore, and the access-limited N atoms begin to work and then guarantee a high CO2 uptake in the higher pressure range. Meanwhile, although  tetrazolyl group has a similar pK a value to carboxyl groups, more uncoordinated nitrogen atoms in tetrazolyl groups can form more Lewis acid-base pairs with CO2 molecules, which leads to a continuously higher CO2 adsorption enthalpy in HHU-5 than that in HHU-5C. In general, the gentle but continuous improvement in CO2 enthalpy not only endows HHU-5 a high CO2 adsorption capacity but also indicates that it may be a potentially energy-efficient adsorbent for CO2. Very interestingly, if every N-donor site as well as unsaturated metal site in HHU-5 was regarded as a CO2 favored site and was occupied by a CO2 molecule, the CO2 uptake of HHU-5 would be ~60 molecules per unit cell, which is coincidently equal to the experimental CO2 uptake of HHU-5 at 273 K.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 13, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig3\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption isotherms of HHU-5 and HHU-5C at 273 and 298 K.\n(b) CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption enthalpy of HHU-5 and HHU-5C.
