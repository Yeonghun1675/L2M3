An analysis of the local symmetry of the equivalent CuII center reveals that the Cu1 center is bound to four bpp nitrogen atoms, a coordinated chlorine atom, and one coordinated water molecule adopting a distorted octahedral CuClN4O coordination geometry. Each Cu1 atom is weakly coordinated by a water molecule and a chlorine atom (for 1, Cu(1)-O(1W) = 2.826(3) \u00c5, Cu(1)-Cl(1) = 2.716(3) \u00c5; for 2, Cu(1)-O(1W) = 2.813(2) \u00c5, Cu(1)-Cl(1) = 2.722 (2) \u00c5) resulting from a strong Jahn-Teller effect. Except for the coordinated water molecules and chlorine atom, all nitrogen atoms form reasonably strong bonds with the copper atoms in the range between 1.979(17) and 2.035(17) \u00c5. The [PM12O40]3- anions possess the well-known Keggin-type structures, and all the bond lengths and angles are within the normal ranges and in close agreement with those described in the literature ().

The voltammetric behavior of the 2-CPE remains almost unchanged not only over 500 cycles at a scan rate of 100mVs-1 but also after it had been used for electrocatalytic reduction of nitrite and was then washed with a 1 M H2SO4 solution, suggesting that the host-guest structural feature of 2 stabilizes the Keggin-type ions in the compound. Moreover, after 2-CPE was stored at room temperature for about 1 month, the peak current decreased only 6% and could be renewed by squeezing a little carbon paste out of the tube. This is especially useful for electrocatalytic studies, since the catalytic activity is known to decrease when the electrode is fouled.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 28, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig9\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>9</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Cyclic voltammograms of the <bold>2-</bold>CPE in the 1 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution at different scan rates (from inner to outer: 50, 70, 90, 120, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500 mV s<sup>\u22121</sup>).</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr10\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2007-014513_0009.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 9  Cyclic voltammograms of the 2-CPE in the 1 M H2SO4 solution at different scan rates (from inner to outer: 50, 70, 90, 120, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500 mV s-1).
