Moreover, because the molecular size or kinetic diameter of H2O is smaller than those of organic solvent molecules, size selective porous materials can only adsorb small water molecules over large organic molecules. Nevertheless, for PCPs, hydrophobic pore surfaces can be rationally introduced to adsorb organic molecules over H2O. Li et al. have reported a hydrophobic PCP, zinc 5-tert-butyl isophthalate, which exhibits essentially zero water adsorption (~1 mg/g) up to the humidity P/P 0 = 0.65 but significant MeOH adsorption (110 mg/g at P/P 0 = 0.73). Nevertheless, due to the large pore size required for the accommodation of organic molecules, capillary condensation of H2O usually occurs for these hydrophobic porous materials at relatively high humidity and significantly reduces the organic/water selectivity. For example, Kitagawa et al. have demonstrated that a PCP with a hydrophobic pore surface does not show water uptake until P/P 0 = 0.59, which then abruptly rise to a high value (128 mg/g) at higher humidity.
