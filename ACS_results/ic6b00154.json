The structure consists of paddle-wheel Zn2(CO2)4 secondary building units (SBUs) and Zn12(CO2)24 supramolecular building blocks (SBBs). Thermal stability of 1 is found to be low. However, it undergoes transmetalation reaction with Cu(II) at room temperature without losing crystallinity affording an isostructural framework, 1  Cu . Framework 1  Cu  is thermally robust and allows generation of the solvent-free porous framework 1  Cu  ' upon activation with coordinatively unsaturated metal centers. Framework 1  Cu  ' exhibits water stability and at 77 K, adsorbs 2.56 wt % of H2 up to 1 bar that significantly increases to 4.01 wt % at 13 bar. Also, this framework gives a high adsorption of 164.70 cc/g of CH4 (11.7 wt %) at 303 K and 60 bar. The channel surfaces decorated with -NH2 group and unsaturated metal centers in 1  Cu  ' allow a promising 36.4 wt % of CO2 adsorption at 1 bar and 273 K. Moreover, it exhibits pronounced selectivity of CO2 adsorption over N2 and H2 at 273 K. Finally, the versatility of 1  Cu  ' is shown by its excellent heterogeneous catalytic activity in the Biginelli coupling reactions involving an aldehyde, urea, and ethylacetoacetate to afford dihydroprimidinones.\n\nA 3D, thermally less-stable Zn(II)-framework (1) undergoes single-crystal to single-crystal transmetalation with Cu(II) to afford isostructural 1  Cu . Unlike 1, the Cu(II) analogue is thermally stable and can be activated by heating to get 1  Cu  ', which exhibits water stability and adsorbs 2.56 wt % of H2 at 1 bar. It exhibits pronounced CO2 selectivity over N2 and H2 and catalyzes the three-component Biginelli coupling reaction.\n\nGas Adsorption Studies\n\nThe presence of porous channels in 1  Cu  along with its thermal and water stability provide a perfect platform to examine the gas sorption properties. To generate the fully desolvated framework (1  Cu  '), crystals of 1  Cu  were first immersed in EtOH for one week, followed by heating under high vacuum at 130 \u00b0C changing the color of the crystals to deep blue. At 77 K, the N2 sorption isotherm up to 1.0 bar pressure shows a type I isotherm () with slight hysteresis around 0.4 bar. The isotherm clearly indicates microporous nature of the framework, which can be further corroborated from the pore size distribution pattern (Figure S20 in the ). On the basis of the N2 adsorption studies, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and pore volume are found to be 1580 m2 g-1 and 0.97 cm3 g-1 respectively.\n\nGiven the importance of developing a protocol for on-board storage of hydrogen gas, we next explored H2 storage capacity of 1  Cu  '. At 77 K, the H2 adsorption showed a type I isotherm without any hysteresis, where storage capacity reaches to 287.02 cm3 g-1 (2.56 wt %) up to 1 bar (b). Clearly, the value of H2 uptake in the present system is greater than that of MOF-5 (2.0%), Cu-BTT (2.42%), Cu(peip) (2.51%), MOF-505 (2.47%), PCN-306 (2.50%), PMOF-3 (2.47%), NOTT-101 (2.52%), PCN-61 (2.25%), Fe-BTT (2.3%), and many other reported MOFs, or the well-known zeolite ZSM-5 (0.7 wt %; Table S3 in the ). The nature of the H2 adsorption isotherm suggests strong electrostatic interactions between H2 and fluorine as well as exposed Cu(II) sites. Since the present H2 storage curve does not reach a saturation point at 1 bar, larger uptake capacities could be anticipated at higher pressures. Indeed, the H2 uptake capacity of 1  Cu  ' reaches to 454.23 cm3 g-1 (4.05 wt %) at 13 bar of pressure (Figure S17, ).\n\nNext, CO2 capture potential of 1  Cu  ' up to 1 bar pressure was explored at 273 and 298 K. As shown in a, both the adsorption isotherms displayed type I behavior with no hysteresis, where the total CO2 uptake amounted to be 185 cm3 g-1 (36.36 wt %) and 106 cm3 g-1 (20.9 wt %) at 273 and 298
