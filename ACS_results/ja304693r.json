[Zn(H2PO4)2(TzH)2] n  (1) consists of phosphate and triazole as the ligands, both of which retain acidic protons. These ligands are linked by extended hydrogen bonds in the layers, and 1 shows a proton conductivity of >10-4 S cm-1 at 150 \u00b0C without any guest supports. The optimal interval for the mobile protons in the 2D layers is the key for intrinsic conduction. The anisotropic conductivity of the single crystal revealed that the proton transport occurs mainly in the ab plane. This result offers promising prospects for creating proton conductors by coordination-chemistry-based frameworks as well as investigating the proton-hopping mechanism in solids.
