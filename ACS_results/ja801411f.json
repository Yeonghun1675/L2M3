High pressure hydrogen adsorption isotherms of 1a were measured at 77 and 87 K (see ). At 77 K, the sorption isotherm has a type I profile, saturated at 10 bar with a hydrogen uptake of ~2.1 wt %, which is comparable to those found in other MOFs (e.g., 2.3 wt % in MOF-74). The volumetric hydrogen storage is 28.8 g/L at 77 K and 10 bar.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "Y(BTC)(H2O)\u22c54.3H2O", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "Y(BTC)(H2O)\u22c54.3H2O"}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "H2", "adsorbed amount": "2.1", "unit": "wt%", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "10 bar", "condition": "pore size of 5.8 \u00c5"}, {"adsorbate": "H2", "adsorbed amount": "1.57", "unit": "wt%", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "1 atm", "condition": "pore size of 5.8 \u00c5"}], "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "490", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "stable", "condition": "after thermal activation"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["gas_adsorption", "decomposition_temperature"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['gas_adsorption', 'decomposition_temperature']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"Y(BTC)(H2O)\u22c54.3H2O\",\n            \"symbol\": \"1\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"Y(BTC)(H2O)\u22c54.3H2O\"\n        },\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"H2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"2.1\",\n                \"unit\": \"wt%\",\n                \"temperature\": \"77 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"10 bar\",\n                \"condition\": \"pore size of 5.8 \u00c5\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"H2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"1.57\",\n                \"unit\": \"wt%\",\n                \"temperature\": \"77 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"1 atm\",\n                \"condition\": \"pore size of 5.8 \u00c5\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"decomposition temperature\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"490\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"stable\",\n                \"condition\": \"after thermal activation\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 4, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Porous structure of <bold>1</bold> with coordinated water molecules (green) inside, and (b) hydrogen clusters formed inside <bold>1a</bold>.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"ja-2008-01411f_0001.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  (a) Porous structure of 1 with coordinated water molecules (green) inside, and (b) hydrogen clusters formed inside 1a.
