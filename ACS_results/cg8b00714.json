At this point, we want to point out that the Raman process is actually also field-dependent. However, to avoid overparameterization, we treat the C coefficient as field independent. At very low temperature, we can neglect the processes involving two phonons (Raman and Orbach mechanisms) and analyze the magnetic relaxation using only QTM and direct processes. Thus, their coefficients A, B 1, and B 2 can be extracted by fitting the field-dependent \u03c4 measured at 1.8 K using the first two terms (       \u03c4   - 1   = A   H   4   T +     B   1     1 +   B   2     H   2        ). The best fit (b) gives the coefficients A = 13 s-1 K-1 kOe-2, B 1 = 239 s-1, and B 2 = 0.468 s-1 K-2. Then, by fixing these obtained coefficients of direct and QTM processes in  to avoid overparameterization, all these \u03c4 data points in b were fitted, giving C = 163.5 K-2 s-1, n = 2.6, \u03c40 = 5.9 \u00d7 10-6 s, U eff = 14.5 cm-1 (20.9 K).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 25, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>As the cobalt\u00ad(II) ions in compounds <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> have very similar coordination geometries, it is expected that they\nmight give rise to similar magnetic properties.

The magnetic interactions between the CoII centers in both 1 and 2 should be negligible, either from the superexchange coupling through the long, nonconjugated bpg ligand or from the dipolar magnetic coupling between the adjacent CoII ions. Furthermore, we have measured the field-dependent magnetizations of 1 and 2 at 2.0-5.0 K, and the results are also shown in . At the highest field of 70 kOe, the largest values of magnetization (Ms = 1.87, 1.86, and 1.80 \u03bcB for 1 and 2.30, 2.29, and 2.21 \u03bcB for 2) are well below the expected value (Ms = 3.0 \u03bcB for g = 2.0) (, inset). The lack of magnetic saturation at 70 kOe, together with the nonsuperimposable reduced magnetization plots suggest the presence of magnetic anisotropy in compounds 1 and 2 (Figure S6).", "data":
