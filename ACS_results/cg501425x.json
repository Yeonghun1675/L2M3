It is interesting to note that the 3-connected and 6-connected relationship is 2 to 1, illustrating that this 3D framework is a 2-fold interpenetrating structure with rare  sit  topology (Figure ).

General d10 transition metal are remarkable candidates in the construction of photoluminescence materials because the metal is hard to oxidize or reduce. Meanwhile, the coordination modes of organic ligands and different metals also affect the emission wavelength and luminescent theory. The luminescent properties of H3LMe and complexes 1 and 2 were tested in the solid state at room temperature (clear data as revealed in Figure ). The photoluminescence datum of free H3LMe ligand displays an emission maxima peak at 440 nm (\u03bbex = 300 nm), which is ascribed to the \u03c0* \u2192 n or \u03c0* \u2192 \u03c0 transitions. The maxima peaks of two MOFs are at 448 nm (\u03bbex = 295 nm) and 428 nm (\u03bbex = 300 nm), respectively. The maxima peak of 1 is red-shifted by 8 nm, and a blue shift of 12 nm has been presented in 2 in contrast to those of the free H3LMe ligand. The difference phenomenon shows that the electronic configuration characteristics of Mn and Cd are different; the latter one is difficult to oxidize or reduce. Furthermore, different coordination environments of central metal ions resulting in the ligand \u03c0*\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 transitions is also another factor.\n\nMagnetic Properties for Complex 1 \n\nBecause complex 1 includes three MnII ions, the measurement of magnetic properties was performed under a 1000 Oe applied field. The details of the \u03c7M T versus T plot at the temperature ranging from 1.8 to 300 K are exhibited in Figure a, of which \u03c7M is the explanation of greater susceptibility of each MnII 3 unit. Complex 1 exhibits a dominant antiferromagnetic exchange between the MnII ions. The values of \u03c7M T continually decrease as the temperature decreases and descend sharply after 75 K. The \u03c7M T value reaches the maximum at 300 K of 12.5 cm3 mol-1 K, which is slightly lower than the calculation of the theoretical value (13.125 cm3 mol-1 K) with the presence of three uncoupled MnII ions. Generally, in most of MnII complexes, assuming g = 2.0, the magnetic torque at 300 K is slightly lower than the calculative value, that is to say, the Lande factor of MnII is lower than 2.0. Furthermore, the antiferromagnetic coupling effect among manganese ions could likewise cause a lower value than those of a corresponding theoretical one. The magnetic susceptibility abides by the formula \u03c7 = C/(T - \u03b8) below 100 K, which is named the Curie-Weiss law, and it is further supported by a well-fitted \u03c7M -1 versus T plot that gives C (Curie constant) = 13.63 cm3 mol-1 K and \u03b8 (Weiss constant) = -27.91 K (Figure b). The measurement of DC magnetization was performed at 1.8 K in the 1-7 T magnetic field ranges. The magnetization increases in all the fields. The field dependence of magnetization quickly increases to 3.86 \u03bcB at the point of 2 T and finally reaches a saturation state. The magnetization value of 5.3 \u03bcB at the point of 7 T is much lower than that of MMn3 with the theoretical saturation value of 15 \u03bcB, indicating not a strong enough field to cause the spins of [Mn3] to arrange in parallel entirely along the direction of the applied field. The magnetization curve manifests that complex 1 has antiferromagnetic interaction (Figure c). In order to research the dynamics of the effect of magnetization relaxation, the ac magnetic susceptibility was measured under a 5.0 Oe ac field adding a zero applied dc field in the 1.8-20 K temperature ranges and in the 1-500 Hz frequency range. The diagram of in-phase and out-of-phase ac magnetic susceptibility versus T is displayed in . The graph was generated without magnetic frequency-dependence, and the complex 1 does not exhibit three-dimensional ac signals.\n\nGas Adsorption Analyses\n\nThe measurement of adsorption properties of complexes 1 and 2 have been performed on a Micrometritics ASAP 2020 system. Two MOFs were sequentially exchanged with methanol and dichloromethane, and the degassing process was performed at 40 \u00b0C for 5 h. The gas sorption capabilities of two complexes were investigated using several gases (N2, H2, Ar, and CO2) at varying temperatures. The pore volumes of complexes 1 and 2 were calculated by the PLATON  program. The values are 5069.1 and 19842 \u00c53, which corresponds with 23.5 and 30.8% of their respective unit.\n\nThe N2 and Ar gas uptake isotherms of 1 show the type IV adsorption isotherm under 77 K temperature (Figure a). The uptakes of N2 and Ar are only 27.6 cm3 g-1 and 20.8 cm3 g-1 at 1 bar, respectively. The BET surface area is estimated 59.4 m2 g-1 from the data of the measurement. The achieved pore volume is 0.04 cm3g-1, which is much smaller than that calculated (0.23 cm3\u22c5g-1) from the single crystal data. This phenomenon may be interpreted as the adaptability of the weak \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 stacking under the high pressure, which results in the dislocation of the organic frameworks, and it is the same as other reported soft porous MOFs. The desolvated complex 2 exhibits typical type-I gas uptake isotherms, indicating the presence of microporous structures after eliminating the solvent molecules (Figure b). The adsorption isotherms of N2 and Ar have an abrupt slope from 0.01 to 0.1 bar, which reveals that the total pore volume is packed with the gas in the 0.01-0.1 bar pressure of the range. Then the uptake capacity of N2 and Ar increases slightly and reaches a platform 351.2 cm3 g-1 and 421.9 cm3 g-1 at 1 bar, respectively. The BET surface area and pore volume are estimated to be 1353.32 m2 g-1 and 0.54 cm3 g-1 by measuring data, respectively.\n\nAlthough complex 2 displays a higher adsorption of N2 and Ar corresponding to higher surface area and pore volume, H2 and CO2 measurements of 1 and 2 show diverse results. As is shown in Figure , complex 1 takes up a defined amount of hydrogen, 52.7 cm3 g-1 (0.47 wt %) at 77 K, 24.9 cm3 g-1 of carbon dioxide at 273 K. H2 and CO2 adsorption capacities of complex 2 are not influenced by its high surface area or pore volume at low pressures. The results show that complex 2 at 77 K takes up a defined amount of hydrogen 76.4 cm3 g-1 (0.68 wt %), which is slightly higher than that of complex 1. However, the uptake value of carbon dioxide is 20.5 cm3 g-1 at 273 K, which is lower than that of complex 1. Although the uptake values of nitrogen and argon of complex 2 are almost 12 times greater than that of complex 1, the uptake capacities of H2 and CO2 are similar for 1 and 2. These results further confirm that the adsorption capacity of two complexes is highly influenced by pore size and geometry.
