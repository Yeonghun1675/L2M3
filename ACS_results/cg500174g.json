Accordingly, we have successfully synthesized a series of Co(II) coordination polymers constructed from a flexible neutral pyrazole based ligand and benzene polycarboxylic acids. One of the most fascinating outcomes of this work is construction of diverse structural networks, from a two-dimensional bilayer network to grid, nanoporous channels, an unusual supramolecular chicken-wire type network to three-dimensional diamondoid network. We have also shown that the conformational freedom of the ligand plays a crucial role in the determining both the dimensionality and topology of the final structure. One of the promising features of these MOFs is their unusual yet consistent larger dimensions, which enhances the possibility of increased porosity and well-defined cavity within the network. The thermogravimetric analyses of the MOFs show a reasonably high thermal stability.
