At 50 K, \u03c7m T starts to increase, suggesting the presence of ferromagnetic interactions between the metallic ions through the bridging oxalate ligands, as expected for the interaction between CrIII and CoII through an oxalate bridge. This increase of the magnetic moment becomes more intense at around 20 K, reaching a maximum (196.985 emu K mol-1) at 6.5 K and saturation below this temperature, indicating the presence of a magnetically ordered regime.
