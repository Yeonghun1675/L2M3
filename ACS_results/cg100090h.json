Solid-state photoluminescent spectrum of 1 is recorded at room temperature (see ), which shows a strong emission at around 455 nm (\u03bbex = 381 nm). However, the free H2 L ligand exhibits an emission maximum at 595 nm upon excitation at 435 nm. Herein, the strong emission of 1 is different from those metal-centered transitions involved s and p orbitals of s2 metal-ion complexes, which can be tentatively assigned to ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT) between the delocalized p bonds of carboxylate groups and p orbitals of PbII centers. \n\nCrystal data: C68H32F24O18Pb6, CCDC:761022, M r = 2836.08, monoclinic, C2/c, a = 34.081(2) \u00c5, b = 10.7510(8) \u00c5, c = 23.6158(2) \u00c5, \u03b1 = 90\u00b0, \u03b2 = 117.0640(10)\u00b0, \u03b3 = 90\u00b0, V = 7705.3(10) \u00c53, Z = 4, \u03c1calcd = 2.445 g/cm3, \u03bc = 13.187 mm-1 R 1 = 0.0595 and wR 2 = 0.1419, for 6779 unique reflections (R int = 0.1326), T = 293 K.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "Complex 1", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "C68H32F24O18Pb6"}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "310", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "decomposition point", "condition": "heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min-1"}], "chemical formula weight": [{"value": "2836.08", "unit": "g/mol", "condition": ""}], "crystal system": [{"value": "monoclinic", "condition": ""}], "space group": [{"value": "C2/c", "condition": ""}], "lattice parameters": [{"value": {"a": "34.081", "b": "10.7510", "c": "23.6158", "alpha": "90", "beta": "117.0640", "gamma": "90", "condition": "T = 293 K"}}], "density": [{"value": "2.445", "unit": "g/cm3", "condition": ""}]}]]], "include_properties": ["decomposition_temperature", "chemical_formula_weight", "crystal_system", "space_group", "lattice_parameters", "density"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['decomposition_temperature', 'chemical_formula_weight', 'crystal_system', 'space_group', 'lattice_parameters', 'density']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"Complex 1\",\n            \"symbol\": \"1\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"C68H32F24O18Pb6\"\n        },\n        \"decomposition temperature\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"310\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"decomposition point\",\n                \"condition\": \"heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min-1\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"chemical formula weight\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"2836.08\",\n                \"unit\": \"g/mol\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"crystal system\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"monoclinic\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"space group\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"C2/c\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"lattice parameters\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": {\n                    \"a\": \"34.081\",\n                    \"b\": \"10.7510\",\n                    \"c\": \"23.6158\",\n                    \"alpha\": \"90\",\n                    \"beta\": \"117.0640\",\n                    \"gamma\": \"90\",\n                    \"condition\": \"T = 293 K\"\n                }\n            }\n        ],\n        \"density\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"2.445\",\n                \"unit\": \"g/cm3\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 7, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Coordination environment of Pb<sup>II</sup> ions in <bold>1</bold> (symmetry code: A \u2212<italic toggle=\"yes\">x</italic> + 2, \u2212<italic toggle=\"yes\">y</italic> + 2, \u2212<italic toggle=\"yes\">z</italic> + 1; all hydrogen atoms omitted for clarity).</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"cg-2010-00090h_0001.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Coordination environment of PbII ions in 1 (symmetry code: A -x + 2, -y + 2, -z + 1; all hydrogen atoms omitted for clarity).
