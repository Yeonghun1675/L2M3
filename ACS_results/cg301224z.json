Though compound <bold>2</bold> has a structure similar to the Cu-compounds, the adsorption\nis much lower; this may be because the hexagonal channels were filled\nwith coordinated terminal oxidized Dabco molecules, which could not\nbe removed without loss of the porous framework structure.</p><p>The CO<sub>2</sub> sorption isotherms of <bold>1</bold>, <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold> measured at 273 and 295\nK are represented\nin Figure . The adsorption and desorption\nbranches of the compounds show a slight hysteresis, which could be\nattributed to the presence of intercrystalline voids.

Compound <bold>2</bold> exhibits the highest adsorption for\nCO<sub>2</sub>; it is due to its relative high internal surface areas,\nwhich could provide the opportunity for more CO<sub>2</sub> efficient\npacking in the pores. Though compound <bold>1</bold> has the largest\naccessible volumes (58.5%), the channel size (\u223c9 \u00c5) is\nalso large enough to the kinetic diameter of N<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> (3.6 and 3.3 \u00c5, respectively). It shows no N<sub>2</sub> adsorption even at 77 K, and its CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption is also\nthe least. This may be attributed to the 1D channel systems not running\nalong the crystallographic axis in the framework, while the channels\nalong the <italic toggle=\"yes\">c</italic> axis are not effective for the gas accessing.\n</p><p>Considering compound <bold>2</bold> has rapid uptake\nof N<sub>2</sub> at 77 K and CO<sub>2</sub> at 273 K, the adsorption\nfor CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> at room temperature was explored.\nAt 298 K, the\nmaximum CO<sub>2</sub> uptake is 2.5 mmol/g, compared with only 0.25\nmmol/g for N<sub>2</sub> (Figure ). The initial\nslopes of CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> adsorption isotherms were\ncalculated, and the ratio of the slopes was used to estimate the adsorption\nselectivity for CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>.

Upon further heating, the weight loss of 52.35% occurring between 340 and 500 \u00b0C (52.03%) is attributed to organic ligands decomposition, and the final product is CdO.\n\nThe TG curve of compound 4 shows the first mass loss of 10.68% below 230 \u00b0C due to the release of one guest DMF molecules (calcd 11.66%); the further weight loss 22.51% between 230 and 400 \u00b0C should be attributed to two coordinated DMF molecules (calcd 23.32%); the weight loss occurring between 400 and 700 \u00b0C (52.80%) could be attributed to the decomposition of the organic ligands (calcd 53.35%); the postresidue of 13.61% is Mn2O3, which has been tested by PXRD analysis.\n\nCompound 5 shows the first weight loss (7.41%) below 170 \u00b0C due to the release of guest and coordinated water molecules (calcd 7.44%); the further weight loss of 13.24% between 170 and 370 \u00b0C should be attributed to the guest DMF and dimethylamine molecules (calcd 12.92%). The dimethylamine molecules are from the decomposition of the DMF molecules. Then, a sharp weight loss between 380 and 700 \u00b0C with a weight loss of 55.00% corresponds to the decomposition of the organic ligand. From powder X-ray diffraction, the final products are identified as a mixture of Mn2O3 and Mn3O4.\n\nFor compound 6, the first weight loss (23.82%) below 400 \u00b0C is attributed to the release of two coordinated DMF molecules (calcd 24.10%) and then a sharp weight loss (48.09%) from 400 to 700 \u00b0C corresponding to the decomposition of the organic ligands; the final products can also be identified as a mixture of Mn2O3 and Mn3O4 from the powder X-ray diffraction.\n\nGas Adsorption Properties\n\nThe accessible volumes of the structures were estimated to be 58.5% for 1, 57.3% for 2, 41.5% for 3, 42.1% for 4 and 36.4% for 6 of the total volume without the guest molecules in the pores by calculating from the single-crystal structure with PLATON/SOLV. Before gas sorption experiments, the framework structural integrity of compounds 1-6 was evaluated using PXRD studies. Only compounds 1-3 maintained their crystallinity upon immersing the samples in common solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, acetone, acetonitrile, and ethanol for 24 h (see ), so we concentrated on the gas adsorption properties of these compounds.\n\nThe sorption measurements, using N2 and CO2 as the adsorptive gas, were carried out on the activated compounds. The activated compounds of 1-3 were obtained by drying the solvent-exchanged solid at 373 K for more than 12 h under a vacuum, respectively. The X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the evacuated compounds 1-3 are almost the same as that of the as-synthesized coordination polymers, indicating that the frameworks retains their structural integrity (). Activated frameworks 1 and 3 showed no adsorption of N2. While compound 2 revealed reversible typical type I N2 sorption isotherms (Figure ), the adsorption and desorption branches are closed without hysteresis. It takes up a significant amount of N2 at 77 K (414 cm3/g at 1 bar). The estimated Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area was estimated to be 1363 m2/g, and the corresponding pore volume was 0.58 cm3/g, in good agreement with the theoretical value of 0.61 cm3/g. Though compound 2 has a structure similar to the Cu-compounds, the adsorption is much lower; this may be because the hexagonal channels were filled with coordinated terminal oxidized Dabco molecules, which could not be removed without loss of the porous framework structure.\n\nThe CO2 sorption isotherms of 1, 2 and 3 measured at 273 and 295 K are represented in Figure . The adsorption and desorption branches of the compounds show a slight hysteresis, which could be attributed to the presence of intercrystalline voids. There is no significant CO2 uptake for compound 1; the uptake is only about 17 cm3/g (0.76 mmol/g) at 273 K. Compound 2 exhibits a very high CO2 uptake capacity of 115 cm3/g (5.1 mmol/g) at 273 K; it has a CO2 uptake of 68 cm3/g (3.0 mmol/g) at 295 K. For 3, the uptake of CO2 increases quickly at low pressure and reaches 22 cm3/g and 15 cm3/g at 273 or 295 K at 200 Torr; with further increase in the pressure, the sorption amount achieves 33 cm3/g and 26 cm3/g at 760 Torr. Compound 2 exhibits the highest adsorption for CO2; it is due to its relative high internal surface areas, which could provide the opportunity for more CO2 efficient packing in the pores. Though compound 1 has the largest accessible volumes (58.5%), the channel size (~9 \u00c5) is also large enough to the kinetic diameter of N2 and CO2 (3.6 and 3.3 \u00c5, respectively). It shows no N2 adsorption even at 77 K, and its CO2 adsorption is also the least. This may be attributed to the 1D channel systems not running along the crystallographic axis in the framework, while the channels along the c axis are not effective for the gas accessing. \n\nConsidering compound 2 has rapid uptake of N2 at 77 K and CO2 at 273 K, the adsorption for CO2 and N2 at room temperature was explored. At 298 K, the maximum CO2 uptake is 2.5 mmol/g, compared with only 0.25 mmol/g for N2 (Figure ). The initial slopes of CO2 and N2 adsorption isotherms were calculated, and the ratio of the slopes was used to estimate the adsorption selectivity for CO2 and N2. The slope ratio (CO2/N2) of compound 2 is calculated to be about 15 (), indicating the framework has a preferential adsorption of CO2 over N2 at low pressure. This is probably because CO2 molecules have significant quadrupole moments, inducing a stronger interaction with the framework.\n\nBoth of the compounds show a typical antiferromagnetic character. At room temperature, the experimental \u03c7M T value for compound 5 at room temperature is 4.36 cm3\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1, which is similar to the value expected for an isolated Mn(II) ion (4.37 cm3\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1), and decreases continuously to 1.30 cm3\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1at 2 K. The plot of \u03c7M -1 vs T above 100 K obeys the Curie-Weiss Law [\u03c7M = C/(T - \u03b8)] with C = 4.51 cm3 K mol-1 and \u03b8 = -6.67 K. Compound 6 has \u03c7M T vs T plots similar to that of 5, and negative values of \u03b8, the experimental \u03c7M T value for 6 at room temperature equals 3.94 cm3\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1, lower than the value expected for an isolated Mn(II) ion. The \u03c7MT value decreases to 0.61 cm3\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1. Fitting of the \u03c7M -1 - T data above 100 K using the Curie-Weiss law gives the Curie constant of compound 6 of 4.36 cm3 K mol-1, and Weiss constant of -3.29 K. The decreasing \u03c7M T value and the negative value of \u03b8 for these two compounds indicate weak antiferromagnetic coupling between neighboring Mn(II) ions, which is expected for Mn(II) ions bridged by carboxylate ligands.
