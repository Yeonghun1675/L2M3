Desolvated MOF 1 is robust and is selective for CO2 over N2 and CH4 (11.7:1 CO2:N2 at 1 bar), with significant kinetic trapping occurring in the case of CH4. MOF 1 is also shape-selective for C2H2 over C2H4 (1.7:1 at 1 bar), partly due to slow diffusion of the larger hydrocarbon C2H4 through the narrow channels. Despite the highly constrained zigzag pore geometry, this selectivity is still modest, and further structural optimization is clearly necessary. However, these results provide a promising lead for future studies aimed at using shape-based kinetic trapping of guests to provide new materials capable of industrially useful separations.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 33, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Experimental\nSection</title><p>All chemicals, including pyrazine and pyridine-4-carbaldehyde,\nwere of reagent-grade and were used as received, with the exception\nof acetonitrile, which was HPLC-grade. 2-Acetylpyrazine was prepared\nfrom pyrazine according to the literature procedure, and py-pzpypz was prepared according to our published procedure.\n</p>", "clean_text": "Experimental Section\n\nAll chemicals, including pyrazine and pyridine-4-carbaldehyde, were of reagent-grade and were used as received, with the exception of acetonitrile, which was HPLC-grade. 2-Acetylpyrazine was prepared from pyrazine according to the literature procedure, and py-pzpypz was prepared according to our published procedure.
