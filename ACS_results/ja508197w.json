Therefore, the MOF framework exhibited great endurance upon the uptake of Li-ions, and thus, the capacity loss may very likely have been due to the insufficient extraction of Li-ions during charge process. Large charge transfer resistance may hinder the movement of Li-ions and prevent some of them from being extracted. The inhomogeneity of crystal size and distribution in the cathodes may limit the exposure of the MOF internal surface to the electrolyte, leading to a partial redox activity of functional groups ().", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 12, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>Conclusively,\nusing a straightforward strategy, we clearly obtained\nthe first microporous MOF material with independent redox active sites\non both metal and ligands, and we introduced it as a novel cathode\nactive material for lithium batteries.
