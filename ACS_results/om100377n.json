Measurement of the crystal at higher temperature (233 K) was required, as loss of structural integrity was observed at 100 K. Similar to what was found for (Me3Si)3SiK and (Me3Si)3GeK the potassium of 2 exhibits an additional coordination to a methyl group of a neighboring molecule. This increases the coordination number of potassium from seven to eight. The Ge-Ge bond distances are not affected much by the anionic character and are close to the values found in 3 and 6. Hexakis(trimethylsilyl)disilane, hexakis(trimethylsilyl)digermane, and tris(trimethylsilyl)[tris(trimethylsilyl)silyl]germane all crystallize in the trigonal space group R3\u0305c in contrast to the all-germanium analogue 3, for which the lower R3\u0305 space group was found. The central Ge-Ge bond distance in hexakis(trimethylsilyl)digermane was reported to be 2.48 \u00c5, whereas in 3 it is only 2.46 \u00c5. This slightly shorter distance is in accordance with the differences of the torsional angles Me3X1-X2-X3-X1Me3: While 3 adopts a perfectly staggered conformation with a dihedral angle of 60\u00b0 (Figure  ), for the three other above-mentioned compounds the respective angles were determined to be 76.6-77.2\u00b0 and 42.8-43.4\u00b0, thus differing substantially from the ideal values expected for a strain-free alignment. 1,1,1,3,3,3-Hexakis(trimethylsilyl)-2,2-dimethyltrisilane and the analogous all-germanium compound 4 both crystallize in the monoclinic space group C2/c with half a molecule in the asymmetric unit. In both structures, one trimethylsilyl or trimethylgermyl group is disordered and the central Ge-Ge as well as the Si-Si bond distances are all almost minimized to normal values. The dihedral angles Me3Ge-Ge-Ge(Me)2-Ge(A)-Ge(A)Me3 in 4 show a strong deviation from the 60\u00b0 of a perfectly staggered conformation (Figure ) but have nearly the same values as were found for the corresponding Si compound. Tris(trimethylsilyl)triisopropylsilylsilane and 6 both crystallize in the same space group (trigonal R3) with nearly the same cell dimensions. The distances of the Ge-Ge bonds at 2.44 \u00c5 in 6 are in the range published for a couple of linear perphenylated germanium compounds. The bond angles are 105.1\u00b0 for Me3Ge-Ge-GeMe3 and 113.5\u00b0 for Me3Ge-Ge-Si i Pr3 and thus practically identical with the ones in tris(trimethylsilyl)triisopropylsilylsilane. The dipotassium compound 11 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1\u0305 with one and a half molecules and an additional toluene in the asymmetric unit. The central Ge-Ge bond is elongated by about 0.1 to 2.58 \u00c5, as it had been observed before for the 1,2-dipotassiumdisilane and also for tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)digermyl-1,2-dipotassium. As all the other 1,2-dianions, 11 also exhibits an anti-conformation with a torsion angle for the K-Ge-Ge-K arrangement of 158.1\u00b0. In close analogy with what was found for tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)digermyl-1,2-dipotassium the degree of pyramidalization of the anionic germanium atoms is relatively high, as can be seen from the small angles for Ge(6)-Ge(2)-Ge(5) (91.5\u00b0) and Ge(3)-Ge(1)-Ge(4) (93.0\u00b0).
