A reaction of 3-amino-5-(dihydroxyphosphoryl)benzoic acid, designed for that purpose, and copper(II) sulfate yielded a three-dimensional CP, characterized by an open, layered structure in which intersecting channels are running along the a and c axes. It should be stressed that the layering pattern observed herein is different from that prevalent for metal phosphonates, since the stacked dense sheets of metal ions and ligands are not observed. Instead, two-dimensional metal-organic sheets are bound via copper(II) nodes. Topological considerations led us to the conclusion that rare topologies such as tcs can be obtained when ligands that possess diverse binding groups are used. This result supplements an existing approach which relies on CP syntheses from mixed polytopic ligands and/or the use of metal ions of high coordination number.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 49, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Arrangement of copper\u00ad(II) ions into so-called\n\u201cdiamond chain\u201d\nenabled us to investigate the peculiarities of magnetic behavior of <bold>1</bold>.
