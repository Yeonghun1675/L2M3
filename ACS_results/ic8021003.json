The chemical environments of two crystallographically independent A2 cations are different. One is approximately parallel to the anion layer; the other intercalates its alkylamino group into the pocket of the honeycomb network. Two A2 cations in neighboring cation layers are connected through hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl groups and the amino groups, N3-H10\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O15 (2.84 \u00c5/128\u00b0), N3-H10\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O16 (2.85 \u00c5/147\u00b0), N6-H22\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O13 (2.74 \u00c5/150\u00b0), N6-H22\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O14 (2.93 \u00c5/118\u00b0), C13-H15\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O16 (3.51 \u00c5/150\u00b0), C15-H18\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O13 (3.14 \u00c5/132\u00b0), C15-H19\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O16 (2.75 \u00c5/102\u00b0), and hydrogen bonds inside A2, C9-H7\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O14 (2.72 \u00c5/101\u00b0) and C15-H19\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O16 (2.75 \u00c5/102\u00b0). Therefore, the cations related by the 21 screw axis connect head-to-tail to form two independent helical chains which interlock the honeycomb rings running along the b axis (Figure S4, ). The crystal is achiral because the chirality of the cation chains on neighboring layers is opposite. There are hydrogen bonds between the nitrogen of the cations and the oxygen in the anion layers, N1-H1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O11 (2.96 \u00c5/170\u00b0), N3-H12\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O6 (2.77 \u00c5/169\u00b0), N4-H13\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O12 (2.94 \u00c5/174\u00b0), N6-H23\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O2 (2.99 \u00c5/164\u00b0), N6-H24\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O3 (2.93 \u00c5/160\u00b0), C8-H4\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O4 (3.46 \u00c5/1157\u00b0), C8-H5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O5 (3.35 \u00c5/139\u00b0), C14-H16\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O5 (3.34 \u00c5/143\u00b0), and C14-H17\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O8 (3.31 \u00c5/138\u00b0).
