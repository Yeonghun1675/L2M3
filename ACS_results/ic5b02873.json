Although compound 1a contains sufficient window dimensions to allow the diffusion of N2 (3.64 \u00c5), it shows a very small amount of N2 uptake (25 mL at 101.325 kPa) at 77 K (a). This is probably due to a higher diffusion barrier imposed on the 1D channel after desolvation and the corresponding structural contraction. It is noteworthy that measurement of O2 at 77 K reveals the steep uptake in low-pressure regions and saturates at ~20 kPa with an uptake amount of 87 mL/g (~12.43 wt %) (a). This suggests that the framework is microporous in nature. The final uptake amount of N2 at ~20 kPa is only 1.5 wt %. Such a huge uptake difference (selectivity factor of ~10) in a low-relative pressure region makes this framework highly selective toward O2 over N2. The amounts of adsorption of N2 and O2 per Cd2+ atom calculated from the Langmuir analyses are 0.3 and 1.3, respectively. Apart from preferential O2 adsorption over N2, the CO2 (kinetic diameter of ~3.4 \u00c5) adsorption profile at 195 K shows interesting features (b). The isotherm shows a two-step uptake and also a distinct hysteresis in adsorption and desorption profile. There are two steps at relative pressures of 0.05 and 0.12 as realized from a logarithmic scale plot, and at P/P 0 ~ 0.96, the final uptake amount is 75 mL/g. In addition, at 273 K CO2 uptake profile also shows a distinct stepwise uptake with a final uptake amount of 23 mL/g (Figure S5). This stepwise adsorption again reflects the structural flexibility associated with CO2 adsorption as the CO2 molecule can interact with the pore surface decorated with carboxylate oxygen and an aromatic \u03c0-cloud from bpe and bdc linkers. This type of stepwise uptake of CO2 is not very common and also very important in terms of separation purposes.

Elemental analysis was conducted on a Flash EA 1112 series, Thermo Finnigan instrument.

X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) data were collected on a Rigaku RINT-2200HF diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation. The obtained PXRD pattern for 1a (desolvated 1) was indexed with TREOR 90.

Each heptacoordinated Cd2+ metal center is connected to three different bdc linkers through carboxylate oxygen atoms (O2-O5), one bpe (N1), and one H2O molecule (O1), residing in a distorted pentagonal bipyramidal environment (). Interestingly, the carboxylate group (O2 and O3) of one of the bdc linkers acts as a chelating bidentate ligand, and the other (O4 and O5) functions as a chelating as well as \u03bc-oxo bridging ligand. Therefore, each bdc linker acts as a bridging tridentate ligand. Such a type of ligation creates a Cd2(\u03bc-O)2 cluster, acting as a secondary building unit (SBU) in the structure. Each of these SBUs is connected to four other SBUs by four bdc linkers to generate two-dimensional rectangular sheets lying on the crystallographic ab plane (a). Such 2D sheets are connected by the bpe linkers to form a 3D microporous framework having one-dimensional channels along the c-axis (dimensions of 5.4 \u00c5 \u00d7 4.4 \u00c5) (b,c). These 1D channels are occupied by the ethanol molecules that are in the proximity of the coordinated (O1) water molecules and thus form strong H-bonds [O1(w)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O6(EtOH), 2.717(7) \u00c5] (Figure S1). The H-bonding interactions play a very essential role in the overall conformation and stability of the 3D microporous framework. The Cd2+-O and Cd2+-N bond lengths are in the range of 2.273(5)-2.672(6) and 2.283(5) \u00c5, respectively (Table S1). The degree of distortion from an ideal pentagonal bipyramidal geometry is reflected in the transoid and cisoid angles, which are 133.09(9)-169.91(9)\u00b0 and 51.90(9)-114.12(9)\u00b0, respectively. The deviation of Cd2+ from the mean plane formed by the equatorial atoms is 0.311(2) \u00c5, and the maximal deviation of the equatorial oxygen atom is 0.803(1) \u00c5. The void volume calculated after removal of the coordinated and guest solvent molecules was found to be 22.0% of the total cell volume. Topology analysis by TOPOS shows a binodal (2,6)-connected net with Schla\u0308fi symbol {812.123}{8}3 (d).\n\nThermal Stability\n\nFrom the TG analysis of compound 1, we found that the guest ethanol and coordinated water molecules can be completely removed at ~80 \u00b0C (observed, 14.3%; calculated, 14.8%), and after removal of solvents, the resultant {Cd(bpe)0.5(bdc)} n  (3) is stable up to 290 \u00b0C (Figure S3). Further heating gradually decomposes the compound. In the case of compound 2 also, the guest and coordinated solvent molecules are removed at 80 \u00b0C (observed, 11.6%; calculated, 12.8%) (Figure S3).\n\nPermanent Porosity: Selective Sorption of O2 over N2 \n\nTo check the porous property of compound 1a, N2, O2 (77 K), and CO2 (195 K) gas adsorption measurements were taken. Although compound 1a contains sufficient window dimensions to allow the diffusion of N2 (3.64 \u00c5), it shows a very small amount of N2 uptake (25 mL at 101.325 kPa) at 77 K (a). This is probably due to a higher diffusion barrier imposed on the 1D channel after desolvation and the corresponding structural contraction. It is noteworthy that measurement of O2 at 77 K reveals the steep uptake in low-pressure regions and saturates at ~20 kPa with an uptake amount of 87 mL/g (~12.43 wt %) (a). This suggests that the framework is microporous in nature. The final uptake amount of N2 at ~20 kPa is only 1.5 wt %. Such a huge uptake difference (selectivity factor of ~10) in a low-relative pressure region makes this framework highly selective toward O2 over N2. The amounts of adsorption of N2 and O2 per Cd2+ atom calculated from the Langmuir analyses are 0.3 and 1.3, respectively. Apart from preferential O2 adsorption over N2, the CO2 (kinetic diameter of ~3.4 \u00c5) adsorption profile at 195 K shows interesting features (b). The isotherm shows a two-step uptake and also a distinct hysteresis in adsorption and desorption profile. There are two steps at relative pressures of 0.05 and 0.12 as realized from a logarithmic scale plot, and at P/P 0 ~ 0.96, the final uptake amount is 75 mL/g. In addition, at 273 K CO2 uptake profile also shows a distinct stepwise uptake with a final uptake amount of 23 mL/g (Figure S5). This stepwise adsorption again reflects the structural flexibility associated with CO2 adsorption as the CO2 molecule can interact with the pore surface decorated with carboxylate oxygen and an aromatic \u03c0-cloud from bpe and bdc linkers. This type of stepwise uptake of CO2 is not very common and also very important in terms of separation purposes. \n\nSolvent Vapor Adsorption\n\nThe permanent porosity of 1a and structural transformation observed upon exposure to water, methanol, and other solvents lead us to see the vapor adsorption properties of 1a. An interesting uptake profile was observed for MeOH at 293 K (a). During the initial adsorption process, the isotherm shows a type I curve and then suddenly rises at point A (P/P 0 ~ 0.39) and attains a saturated level at point B (P/P 0 ~ 0.92). In the desorption process, MeOH molecules are gradually released until point C (P/P 0 ~ 0.08), and then the desorption drops immediately; thus, the adsorption/desorption isotherm shows a large hysteresis curve. The amounts of MeOH molecules adsorbed per Cd2+ in the framework are approximately 0.82 (point A), 2.45 (point B), and 1.69 (point C) (b). The initial type I uptake can be considered as the coordination of methanol to the Cd2+ center, and thus, a structural transformation occurs because of conversion of CdO5N to CdO5N(MeOH). After point A, additional MeOH molecules fill the pore as guest molecules. The desorption is accompanied by a structural change based on the release of loosely bound and coordinated MeOH molecules, and thus, a large hysteresis or different desorption path can be correlated to the structural change and corresponding barrier during the desorption of MeOH molecules. At 298 K, the water vapor adsorption profile of 1a shows a type I profile until P/P 0 ~ 0.45 with an uptake amount 65 mL/g (~1.07 molecules/formula), and after that, it rises sharply to reach a final uptake amount of 292 mL/g (4.84 molecules/formula) (b). The first step clearly indicates that the water molecule coordinates to the metal center, and this leads to transformation of the CdO5N \u2192 CdO6N core. In the second step, water molecules fill the pores and probably form hydrogen-bonded clusters. The desorption path clearly makes a hysteresis loop because of strong hydrogen bond association of the water molecules.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula":
