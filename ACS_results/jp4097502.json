The energy transfer from 3\u03c0\u03c0* to 5D4 (18382 cm-1) of Tb3+ contributed directly to the luminescence of Ln-MOF 1 (). Benzene may have similar excited energy level with ligands BPDC2- or BPDCA2- because of their parallel benzene and pyridine rings. The overlap between the UV-vis absorption of benzene and ligands is likely to lead to the energy transformation from benzene to ligands, which will increase in the efficiency of intersystem crossing 1\u03c0\u03c0* \u2192 3\u03c0\u03c0* and then results in the enhance of LMET. Combined with the UV absorption and luminescent spectra, it is evident that the energy transfer happened between ligands and acetone in view of the luminescent response by addition of acetone. Due to the physical intermolecular interations between ligands and acetone, such as ion-dipole, dipole-dipole, dipole-induced dipole, and hydrogen bonding, the energy absorbed by ligands BPDC2- or BPDCA2- is transferred to acetone molecules, resulting in decrease in the efficiency of intersystem crossing 1\u03c0\u03c0* \u2192 3\u03c0\u03c0* (Scheme b). Additionally, the wide UV-vis absorption of acetone itself can directly hinder the UV-vis absorption of ligands within Ln-MOF 1 and thus reduce the LMET efficiency, leading to the quenching effect on the luminescent intensity.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 35, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Simplified Schematic Diagrams Showing (a) Ligand\u2013Metal Energy\nTransformation (LMET) for Luminescent Emission (<sup>1</sup>\u03c0\u03c0*\nand <sup>3</sup>\u03c0\u03c0* are the Singlet State and Triplet\nState of Ligands) and (b) the Influence of Benzene and Acetone on\nLMET</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"jp-2013-097502_0014.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 2  Simplified Schematic Diagrams Showing (a) Ligand-Metal Energy Transformation (LMET) for Luminescent Emission (1\u03c0\u03c0* and 3\u03c0\u03c0* are the Singlet State and Triplet State of Ligands) and (b) the Influence of Benzene and Acetone on LMET   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 36, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>This mechanism of luminescent\nreduction induced by metal ions can\nbe proposed that metal ions weakly interact with potential Lewis basic\nsites of Ln-MOF <bold>1</bold> and affects the efficiency of energy\ntransformation from ligands to metal centers.
