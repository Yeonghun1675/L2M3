This\nsmall uptake might be due to the approximate match of the increased\naperture dimension of accessible pores in these solids with the kinetic\ndiameter (KD) of CO<sub>2</sub> (3.30 \u00c5) at the elevated temperature, 196 K, or the opening of the apertures\nof some parts of the pores by the highly quadrupole nature CO<sub>2</sub> gas.

In case of <bold>2</bold>, all 1D pores are of the same size with uniform functional\ngroups on the walls. Therefore, the step in CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption\nplot might be attributed to the dynamic nature of the framework. The hysteresis might have been caused by the\nstrong interaction of the adsorbate CO<sub>2</sub> gas with the polar\nframework and the interaction resulted in some structural change of\nthe framework at \u223c0.5 bar. Such \u201cbreathing behavior\u201d\nin response to adsorbed guest molecules has been observed in many\nsoft porous networks. This is again due to large quadrupole moment\n(13.4 C\u00b7m<sup>2</sup>) and polarizability (2.93) of CO<sub>2</sub>, which enable CO<sub>2</sub> to interact\nwith the highly polar imide oxygen atoms in the channels and showed\nbetter adsorption compared to other gases with isosteric heat of adsorption\nof \u223c24 KJ/mol at initial stages of adsorption and slightly\nreduced at the initial stages of adsorption and increased again, this\nalso support the dynamic nature of framework ( Figure S11). As there is little adsorption\nof N<sub>2</sub> gas, surface area of <bold>2</bold> has been estimated\nby using CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption at 196 K, which shows the BET and\nLangmuir surface areas as 1130 and 1670 m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup> respectively. Similarly, the sorption study of few other samples,\nsuch as H<sub>2</sub> at 77 K, Ar at 87 K, and CH<sub>4</sub> at 196\nK has been studied (Figure ). As expected,\nthe polar imide pores selectively adsorbing highly quadrupolar CO<sub>2</sub> from other gases at 196 K. Such selective adsorption for\nCO<sub>2</sub> over other gases is advantageous for the separation\nof gas mixtures. Very recently, an MOF with a similar 1D hexagonal\npore was found to show similar sorption properties has been reported.\n</p>", "clean_text": "The emission of CO2 is one of the major environmental issues in global warming.

This small uptake might be due to the approximate match of the increased aperture dimension of accessible pores in these solids with the kinetic diameter (KD) of CO2 (3.30 \u00c5) at the elevated temperature, 196 K, or the opening of the apertures of some parts of the pores by the highly quadrupole nature CO2 gas. Activated 2 exhibited better accessibility of the apertures of the most pores and showed significantly increased CO2 uptake, 278 cm3\u22c5g-1, at 196 K as shown in Figure , which corresponds to 5.87 molecules of CO2 per formula unit of 2. \n\nIt is noted that in the adsorption plot of CO2 gas consists of stepwise-rise CO2 uptake at 0.5 bar with hysteresis. However, the stepwise adsorption usually observed either by a compound which consist of different sized pores or with the pore with different interactions/functional groups exposed at the pores. In case of 2, all 1D pores are of the same size with uniform functional groups on the walls. Therefore, the step in CO2 adsorption plot might be attributed to the dynamic nature of the framework. The hysteresis might have been caused by the strong interaction of the adsorbate CO2 gas with the polar framework and the interaction resulted in some structural change of the framework at ~0.5 bar. Such \"breathing behavior\" in response to adsorbed guest molecules has been observed in many soft porous networks. This is again due to large quadrupole moment (13.4 C\u22c5m2) and polarizability (2.93) of CO2, which enable CO2 to interact with the highly polar imide oxygen atoms in the channels and showed better adsorption compared to other gases with isosteric heat of adsorption of ~24 KJ/mol at initial stages of adsorption and slightly reduced at the initial stages of adsorption and increased again, this also support the dynamic nature of framework ( Figure S11). As there is little adsorption of N2 gas, surface area of 2 has been estimated by using CO2 adsorption at 196 K, which shows the BET and Langmuir surface areas as 1130 and 1670 m2\u22c5g-1 respectively. Similarly, the sorption study of few other samples, such as H2 at 77 K, Ar at 87 K, and CH4 at 196 K has been studied (Figure ). As expected, the polar imide pores selectively adsorbing highly quadrupolar CO2 from other gases at 196 K. Such selective adsorption for CO2 over other gases is advantageous for the separation of gas mixtures. Very recently, an MOF with a similar 1D hexagonal pore was found to show similar sorption properties has been reported.
