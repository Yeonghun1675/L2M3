The control experiments in the absence of the catalyst (copper nitroisophthalate) compounds have also been carried out to ensure that the reaction proceeds catalytically. To make further comparison, we have also carried out the same catalytic reaction in the presence of Cu(CH3COO)2\u22c5H2O as the catalyst, which exhibited a conversion of ~5-10% to nitrile. The catalytic studies on compound I also exhibited a poor conversion ~7% only, which is comparable to that of the Cu(CH3COO)2\u22c5H2O. Compound II exhibited the maximum conversion with a near quantitative formation of the aminonitrile (~95%). Compound III exhibited a conversion of ~53%. The catalytic behavior of the three compounds may be correlated with the structure. As can be noted, in compound I, the copper centers are fully coordinated by the ligands, and the bulky aromatic units probably inhibit the approach of the imine to the metal center (Lewis site) to have any meaningful catalytic behavior. Compounds II and III, on the other hand, have a coordinated water molecule, which are labile and can be removed to provide the necessary Lewis acid center for the catalytic reaction. The higher yield in the case of compound II could be due to the presence of two coordinated water molecules. This would impart higher Lewis acidic character in II.
