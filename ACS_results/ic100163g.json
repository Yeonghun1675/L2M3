For the DFT and the ab initio multiconfigurational self-consistent field theory (MCSCF) calculations, truncated models denoted as NiH,HL2 in different spin states and conformations, as defined in the respective sections, were chosen, such as to keep the computational effort acceptable. For the DFT calculations, the BP86 and B3LYP functionals were used for the calculation of geometries/frequencies and spectroscopic properties, respectively, together with a basis set of polarized triple-\u03b6 (TZVP) quality. In order to compute the d-d transitions of Ni(II) complexes, the minimal active space should include the five 3d-based molecular orbitals involved in nonbonding or \u03c3 M-S antibonding interactions as well as the corresponding \u03c3 M-S bonding molecular orbitals. This leads to an active space with 12 electrons in 7 orbitals (CAS (12,7)). We have included all 10 roots for the triplet states (arising from the 3F and 3P terms of Ni2+) and 5 singlet roots (arising from the 1D term of Ni2+). MR-difference dedicated CI calculations, with two degrees of freedom (DDCI2) were performed on top of the state-averaged-complete active space self-consistent field (SA-CASSCF) reference wave function, in order to recover the major part of the differential dynamic correlation between the ground and excited states. As it was commented upon previously, we have used individual selection in order to decrease the computation time. The size of the first-order interacting space was reduced with a threshold T sel = 10-6 Eh.
