Prior to gas measurement, the as-synthesized ZJNU-80 was solvent-exchanged with low-boiling-point acetone followed by heating at 373 K under a dynamic vacuum, generating the activated ZJNU-80a (hereafter, a indicates the activated MOF materials). The integrity of the framework was confirmed by PXRD (Figure S3). As depicted in a, ZJNU-80a exhibited the reversible type I adsorption isotherm, revealing the microporous nature for this MOF. On the basis of the N2 isotherms, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Langmuir surface areas of ZJNU-80a were calculated to be 2279 and 2516 m2 g-1, respectively (Figure S4). The pore volume determined from the maximum adsorbed amount of N2 is 0.8942 cm3 g-1, which is somewhat higher than the value of 0.789 cm3 g-1 calculated using PLATON software. The result is not unexpected because the gas-adsorption-derived porosities frequently overestimated the crystallographically derived porosities by up to 20%. For example, even for the well investigated MOF HKUST-1, the experimentally measured pore volume is ca. 20% higher than the theoretical values. These values are lower than those of NOTT-101a (2755 and 2961 m2 g-1 and 1.0579 cm3 g-1 for the BET and Langmuir surface areas and pore volume, respectively), which is expected because of the presence of the tethering groups in ZJNU-80a, which occlude the MOF's pore space. It should be mentioned that the BET surface area and pore volume of ZJNU-80a are higher than those of the dimethyl-functionalized analogue NOTT-106a, presumably because of the grafting methyl groups on the central benzene spacer of the linkers in the latter compound projecting into the pore cage. However, the pore-size distribution (PSD) of ZJNU-80a determined by applying a nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) model to the adsorption data is very similar to that of NOTT-101a (a, inset). The experimentally observed results on the pore textural properties also indirectly reflect that the tethering groups take part in the window partition, not the cage partition.\n\nThe adsorption behaviors of ZJNU-80a toward CO2, CH4, and N2 were examined at 278, 288, and 298 K at a pressure of up to 1.1 bar. As shown in b, all isotherms exhibit fairly good reversibility without any hysteresis, indicating that all gas molecules adsorbed can be easily removed under vacuum during the desorption process. There is no loss in the adsorbed quantity after four cycles without the reactivation process between each cycle, indicating that the adsorption isotherms are repeatable (Figure S5). At 298 K and 1 atm, the CO2, CH4, and N2 uptakes are 86.4, 20.9, and 6.7 cm3 (STP) g-1, respectively. When the temperature decreased to 278 K, the adsorption amounts increased to 141.7, 31.4, and 9.6 cm3 (STP) g-1, respectively. The CO2 uptake is comparable to that of other NbO-type MOFs such as ZJNU-40  and SNU-50.

On the basis of adsorption isotherms measured at 298, 288, and 278 K (Figure S6), the isosteric heats of CO2, CH4, and N2 adsorption at low coverage were calculated to be 23.7, 17.5, and 13.0 kJ mol-1 (Figure S7).
