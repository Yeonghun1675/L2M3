Then, it was immersed in pyridine or benzene that was filled in a glass capillary (0.5 mm i.d.) for 24 h.

The X-ray structure of 5 is shown in Figure . The X-ray structure of 5 indicates a positively charged framework and I3 - counteranions included in the channels. In 5, two-thirds of nickel atoms are nickel(III). The crystallographic inversion center is located at the center of the bridging xylyl group of the bismacrocycle, and thus two nickel ions belonging to the same bismacrocyclic complex have the same oxidation state. The Ni-N and Ni-O bond distances involving nickel(III) are shorter than those involving nickel(II) ions: av Ni(III)-N and Ni(III)-O bond distances, 1.966(6) \u00c5 and 2.103(6) \u00c5; av Ni(II)-N and Ni(II)-O bond distances, 2.000(8) \u00c5 and 2.130(8) \u00c5, respectively. The bond distances are compared with those of BOF-1 (av Ni(II)-N and Ni(II)-O bond distances, 2.054(1) \u00c5 and 2.196(3) \u00c5, respectively). As for the included counteranions, the crystallographic asymmetric unit of 5 contains four independent half units of I3 - and one-half unit of I2. The I-I distances for two kinds of symmetric I3 - are 2.923(2) \u00c5 (I1-I3) and 2.912(2) \u00c5 (I2-I4) with I-I-I angles of 180.00\u00b0. Another two half units of I3 - have asymmetric I-I distances of 2.876(13) \u00c5 (I5-I6) and 2.850(10) \u00c5 (I6-I7) with an angle of 174.6(4)\u00b0 (I5-I6-I7) and 2.653(17) \u00c5 (I10-I11) and 3.245(0.023) \u00c5 (I11-I12) with an angle of 164.3(1.4)\u00b0 (I10-I11-I12).     A half unit of I2 has an I-I distance of 2.70(2) \u00c5. Intermolecular distances between iodide species are 4.642 \u00c5 for I3\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5I7 (x + 1, y - 1, z), 4.754 \u00c5 for I4\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5I9 (-x, -y + 1, -z), and 4.012 \u00c5 for I6\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5I8. Recently, a Cu(II) coordination polymer that includes L-shaped I5 - anions has been reported. In this case, the I5 - ion was formed by the I- ion linked with two I2 molecules. Even though many I3 - ions were introduced into the channels of 5, the thickness of bilayer (12.20(1) \u00c5) was very little changed compared with that of BOF-1 (11.91(1) \u00c5). The cell parameters were not significantly altered either, compared with those of BOF-1 (Table ), although the density of the redox product 5 (1.359 g/cm3) increased remarkably (ca. 28%) relative to that (1.061 g/cm3) of BOF-1.
