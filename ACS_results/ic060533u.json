The room-temperature value of the \u03c7M T product gives information on the spin states of the different metal ions. Indeed, at 300 K, this value (12.58 emu mol-1 K) is indicative of the presence of two high-spin FeIII (t2g 3eg 2, S = 5/2) and two high-spin CoII (t2g 5e g  2, S = 3/2) ions (the expected uncorrelated value is around 14 emu mol-1 K taking into account the orbital contribution to g Co). Upon cooling, it decreases slowly, as is often observed when octahedral CoII is present. Below 100 K, the decrease of \u03c7M T becomes faster and faster, reaching a value of 1.42 emu mol-1 K at 7 K, where it exhibits a minimum. At lower temperatures, the \u03c7 M T curve increases until a value equal to 2.51 emu mol-1 K at 2.5 K. The magnetic structure of compound 1 is composed of tetranuclear units isolated by diamagnetic Na+ ion pairs. Within the tetranuclear unit, two different exchange pathways are evidenced. The first one, associated with the exchange constant J 1, involves the FeIII and CoII ions that are connected by three phenoxo bridges. Because the exchange interaction is dominated by the overlap between the eg orbitals, an antiferromagnetic coupling is expected. The antiferromagnetic interaction between the CoII and FeIII ions is confirmed by the low value of the \u03c7M T product reached at low temperature. A weaker antiferromagnetic interaction, labeled J 2, is expected between the two central CoII ions through the three \u03bc 1,2-diazino bridges. A quantitative analysis of the magnetic interactions present in the tetranuclear unit cannot neglect the orbital contribution of CoII ions. An acceptable simplified treatment considers only the ground doublet of the 4T1g state split by spin-orbit coupling and low-symmetry components of the ligand field. To not overparametrize the problem, we have assumed Ising-type anisotropy of S eff = 1/2, leading to the spin Hamiltonian    where the apex indicates the symmetry-related atoms inside the tetranuclear unit. The interaction with the magnetic field has been considered to be isotropic for FeIII, while we have assumed g  x  = g  y  = 0 for the S eff = 1/2 of CoII. Such a simplified treatment is valid only in the low-temperature region where the experimental \u03c7 M T below 50 K has been successfully reproduced with   = -44.5 cm-1,   = -2.8 cm-1, and g  z (Co) = 7.6. This last value is in good agreement with that expected for octahedral CoII spins with easy-axis anisotropy. However, below 8 K an increase of \u03c7 M T is observed that is not reproduced by our model. A possible explanation for this behavior can be found in the fact that the {FeIII-CoII} pairs connected by \u03bc 1,2-diazino bridges are related by a binary axis. Therefore, the easy axes of each Co ion are, in general, pointing in different directions. In similar cases of antiferromagnetically interacting anisotropic centers with noncollinear easy axes, a sort of weak ferromagnetism in the paramagnetic phase has been observed. The M vs H curve, measured with a VSM magnetometer between 1.7 and 10 K up to \u00b1120 kOe (inset of Figure ), does not depend on the field sweeping rate and is qualitatively in agreement with such a picture. A first hint of saturation is observed at low fields, but around 60 kOe, the curve shows an inflection point, suggesting that a weak antiferromagnetic interaction is overcome by applying the field. This interaction is probably the one mediated by the diazino bridges because the Zeeman energy at this field is too weak to compete with the interaction mediated by phenoxo bridges. In fact, the features rapidly disappear on increasing temperature. Moreover, the M value even at 120 kOe is still very far from the parallel alignment of all of the spins. In this picture, the hint of saturation at low field is attributed to the noncompensated component typical of canted antiferromagnets. Efforts to obtain larger crystals to perform single-crystal magnetic measurements are in progress. The potential of the new helicand deserves to be further exploited: it can generate homo- and heterometallic helicates with unique structural features and interesting magnetic properties.
