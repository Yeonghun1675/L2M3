The expansion of the a cell dimension is of particular interest as this is the direction of the channels. The process of desolvation introduces disorder into the material on a length scale of ca. 100-500 \u00c5. The X-ray data for 50% methanol loading show a small increase in the c dimension, but the a and b dimensions are unchanged within experimental error. The activation energies for adsorption obtained from the kinetic analysis using the LDF model increase slightly in this loading region (see Figure ). However, the 240 and 113 reflections had a marked increase in peak width. As methanol loading increases, the peaks show a reduction in width, indicating an increase in order at high loadings. The volume occupied by a methanol molecule is ~70% that of an ethanol molecule. The occurrence of the isotherm step at the point where two methanol molecules are located in the channels, precisely matching the loading of hydrogen-bonding guests to that in the as-grown structure templated around ethanol, suggests that the structure itself is optimized for the uptake of two hydrogen-bonding guests. Steric considerations influence site occupation above adsorption of two methanol molecules, and the structure is forced to readjust upon sorption of further guests. However, changes in the lattice parameters with methanol loading do not provide a clear indication of the isotherm step, but subtle changes in host structure may not be detectable. The cell dimensions increase markedly above 75% loading and correspond to an increase of ~2.6% in the unit cell volume at 100% loading.
