Rigid multimodal ligands have been found to generate various combinations of 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D structures depending on the metal and counterion employed and the crystallization conditions. However, the hierarchical assembly of architectures with systematically increasing dimensionality typically has been accomplished by using moieties capable of forming weak and extensive interactions such as H-bonding synthons, \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, coordinating cations and anions, and d10-d10 interactions. In contrast, we have found through the use of a flexible multimodal ligand (Scheme 1) that we can increase dimensionality using covalent metal-ligand bonds. The difficulty of using such ligands is that they have chelating pockets, which can lead to systems with low dimensionality. We have found that by using a flexible ligand, which has a number of different conformations available (Figure ), we are able to circumvent this difficulty and build architectures of increasing dimensionality. Our ligand design incorporates both pyrazine and thioether moieties thereby providing bridging modes to expand the structure and flexibility to provide diversity of structure (Scheme 2).
