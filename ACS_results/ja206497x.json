In contrast to AB, which has been shown to produce a mixture of intractable oligomers/polymers upon H2 release, the trimerization of 1,2-BN cyclohexane is a well-defined, clean, and high-yielding process. With a molecular weight of 85, 1,2-BN cyclohexane carries 4.7 wt % H2 when considering just the trimerization process. The hydrogen storage capacity could be potentially doubled if the H2 release from BN was coupled with dehydrogenation from the carbon positions as well, which would lead to a material with a capacity of 9.4 wt % H2.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 14, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch3\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Trimerization of 1,2-BN Cyclohexane</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr5\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"ja-2011-06497x_0006.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 3  Trimerization of 1,2-BN Cyclohexane   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 15, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>In summary, we synthesized and characterized 1,2-BN cyclohexane, the parent BN isostere of cyclohexane that had thus far eluded isolation.
