The \u03c7m T value at room-temperature per Co(II)2Gd(III)-Cr(III) unit is 16.97 emu mol-1 K (11.65 \u03bcB).  This value is close to the algebraic summations of the magnetic susceptibilities of complex 2 and K3[Cr(CN)6] (15.99 emu mol-1 K). The \u03c7m T value gradually increased with decreasing temperature to the maximum value of 678.7 emu mol-1 K at 12 K and then rapidly decreased down to 166.1 emu mol-1 K at 2 K. The abrupt increase in \u03c7m T around 12 K suggests an onset of three-dimensional ferromagnetic ordering. Temperature-dependences of the ac magnetic susceptibility are shown in Figure a (inset). Both in-phase (\u03c7m\u2018) and out-of-phase (\u03c7m\u2018\u2018) signals were observed as a single sharp peak independent of the ac frequency, and the T c is determined to be 15.4 K. The T c is the highest among PB analogues incorporating a lanthanide ion. The magnetic hysteresis loop of 4 at 2 K shows the coercive field of 140 Oe and the remnant magnetization of 2.94 \u00d7 104 emu Oe mol-1 (Figure b). In the case of 3 with diamagnetic La(III) ion, a cusp in the FCM curve, an inflection point around 0.1 kOe of the magnetization curves and ac magnetic behaviors demonstrate a metamagnet-like behavior with T c of 7.4 K (Figures a,b and S4). These results suggest that the difference of the magnetic behavior between 3 and 4 is caused by the magnetic interaction in the CoLnCo pillar unit. In both cases, a ferromagnetic interaction operates between Co(II) and Cr(III) ions through cyanide bridges within the two-dimensional layers. Here, the constituent CoGdCo complex 2 shows a weak ferromagnetic interaction (\u03b8 = +0.76 K including the orbital contribution of the 4 T 1 term of Co(II) ions) between adjacent Co(II) and Gd(III) ions, whereas the CoLaCo complex 1 shows an overall antiferromagnetic behavior with a negative Weiss constant (\u03b8 = -12.3 K; Figure S3). The magnetic natures of the pillar units are essentially maintained in 3 and 4, although the magnitude of the magnetic interaction is affected by the aggregation accompanied by structural changes. The antiferromagnetic CoLaCo pillar 1 and the ferromagnetic CoGdCo pillar 2, respectively, give the metamagnetic phase of 3 and ferromagnetic phase of 4 with a weak antiferromagnetic intersheet dipolar interaction. Each magnetization value at 50 kOe (7.36 N\u03b2 for 3 and 14.42 N\u03b2 for 4) is close to a numerical summation of [Cr(CN)6]3- (3.00 N\u03b2) and the respective pillar unit (4.37 N\u03b2 for 1 and 11.08 N\u03b2 for 2), which also supports the formation of the above-mentioned magnetic phases. Comparing 3 and 4, the T  c  of 4 is moved upward by the insertion of the Gd(III) ion having a large spin number.
