Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium (Pd(PPh3)4) (0.005 mmol) and copper(I) iodide (CuI) (0.015 mmol) were then added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 12 h at 60 \u00b0C and subsequently evaporated and chromatographed (silica gel, EtOAc/hexane = 1:60) to give the product as a yellow solid (91% yield). The detailed procedure of preparation of dimethyl 5-(1-(pivaloyloxymethyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)isophthalate can be found in the reported reference (yield: 97%). To a solution of dimethyl 5-(1-(pivaloyloxymethyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl) isophthalate (1 mmol) in THF/H2O (1:1, 10 mL) was added LiOH (10 mmol), and the mixture was then stirred at room temperature for 12 h. The mixture was neutralized with a 1 M HCl solution to pH = 5. The resulting precipitate was filtered, washed with 10 mL of water, and dried under vacuum to produce the pure product 5-(1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl) isophthalic acid, which is a white solid (yield: 86%) (1H NMR, D2O, 250 MHz, \u03b4 = 8.28 (2H), 8.15(1H), 8.02 (1H)).\n\nSynthesis of 5-(1H-Pyrazol-4-yl)isophthalic Acid (H3PAIP)\n\n4-Bromo-1-trityl-1H-pyrazole and 3,5-bis(methoxycarbonyl)-phenylboronic acid were synthesized by the procedures reported in the literatures. The mixture of 4-bromo-1-trityl-1H-pyrazole (1.39 g, 3.56 mmol), 3,5-bis(methoxycarbonyl)phenylboronic acid (0.93 g, 3.91 mmol), tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium (0.42 g, 0.36 mmol), and K2CO3 (0.98 g, 7.12 mmol) in a 100 mL recovery flask was added into 1,2-dimethoxyethane (18 mL) and H2O (10 mL) under nitrogen protection. The reaction mixture was heated at 85 \u00b0C and stirred for 36 h. After 36 h, the reaction mixture was concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The residue was taken up in EtOAc (50 mL), washed with H2O (15 mL), and dried (MgSO4). After filtration, the filtrate was concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The crude product was hydrolyzed by KOH solution in THF/MeOH/H2O (v1/1/2) mixture solvents. The reaction mixture was then concentrated on a rotary evaporator and acidified by conc. HCl. The collected solid was dissolved in dichloromethane, and several drops of trifluoroacetic acid were added into the solution to deprotect trityl group. The reaction mixture was warmed to 40 \u00b0C overnight. 5-(1H-Pyrazol-4-yl)isophthalic acid (H3PAIP) was collected by filtration (yield: 50%) (1HNMR, [D6]DMSO, 250 MHz, \u03b4 = 8.35 (2H), 8.29(1H), 8.25 (2H)).\n\nSynthesis of rht-MOF-tri\n\nA mixture of 5-(1H-1,2,3-triazoyl) isophthalic acid (H3TAIP) (30 mg), CuNO3\u22c52.5H2O (90 mg), and N,N'-dimethylformamide (DMF) (1.5 mL) with 2 drops of HBF4 (47% aqueous) was added into a 4 mL vial and then heated to 65 \u00b0C for 48 h. The resulting octahedron-shaped green crystals were obtained (yield: 75% based on H3TAIP ligand).\n\nSynthesis of rht-MOF-pyr\n\nA mixture of 5-(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)isophthalic acid (H3PAIP) (10 mg), CuNO3\u22c52.5H2O (30 mg), and N,N'-dimethylformamide (DMF) (1.0 mL) with 2 drops of HBF4 (47% aqueous) was added into a 4 mL vial and then heated to 70 \u00b0C for 48 h. The resulting octahedron-shaped green crystals were obtained (yield: 70% based on H3PAIP ligand).", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "5-(1H-1,2,3-Triazol-4-yl)isophthalic Acid", "symbol": "H3TAIP",
