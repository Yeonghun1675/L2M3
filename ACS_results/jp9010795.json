The spectrophotometric titrations of the ligand and the Cu-complex give significantly different pK a values for the phenolic proton (8.8 for the ligand and 7.7 for the Cu-complex); the additional pK a values of 4.5 and 7.4, attributed to the pyridine and imidazole, are not observed in the Cu-complex, arguing against a dissociated ligand being present in the Cu-complex sample. A phenoxyl radical signal is observed in the EPR spectrum of the photoinduced ligand, while this signal is absent in the Cu-complex. Moreover, while the vibrational frequencies attributed to the C-O stretch of the cross-linked phenoxyl radical are similar in the ligand and the Cu-complex, the C-O stretches for the phenolate anion in the two compounds are significantly different. Furthermore, we expect the Cu-imidazole bond to be stable at pH 6.2 and only at significantly lower pH might the imidazole become protonated and the Cu-bond break. A Jahn-Teller effect would be most prominent in the axial (dz2) direction and not along the equatorial Cu-imidazole bond.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 55, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>In summary, our studies show that a Cu<sup>2+</sup> EPR signal is detected in the Cu-complex both before and after photolysis.
