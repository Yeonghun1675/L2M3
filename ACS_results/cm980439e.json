While the structure-directing function of the organic group is in the broadest perspective related to factors such as donor-group orientation, space-filling and steric constraints, and differential solubilities, the specific role of ligand geometry, in the sense of relative donor-group dispositions and organic tether length, is revealed in the structures of this study. Thus, the contrasting structures of CUMO-3 and CUMO-4 derive from the angular perturbation and spatial extension at the ligand tether. Similarly, the structures of CUMO-5 and CUMO-6 are unique expressions of the folding of the oxide substructure about the spatially restricted diamine ligands to generate channel structures. The different oxide frameworks of CUMO-5 and CUMO-6 reflect the requirements imposed by the donor-group dispositions in pyrazine and pyrimidine, respectively. It is noteworthy that the general strategy of employing organic components to modify inorganic substructures has witnessed a parallel development in the elaboration of the metal halides.
