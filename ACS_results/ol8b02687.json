According to fluorescence titrations in methanol, receptor 8 binds K+ and Zn2+ cations with a \"turn-on\" response and binding constants 240 \u00b1 5 and 2950 \u00b1 50 M-1, respectively (Figures S13 and 14). Thus, in the solution containing both receptor 7 and 8, the larger part of the potassium cations should be bound to 7. As can be seen in b, addition of Zn2+ to this solution until 1 equiv results in a small fluorescence enhancement, which is indicative of the redistribution of potassium cations between receptors 7 and 8 favoring the formation of the potassium complex with 8. The observed fluorescence enhancement (F/F 0) is comparable with that observed for titration of free 8 with K+. An excess of Zn2+ in solution leads to a much stronger fluorescence increase because Zn2+ replaces K+ in crown ether 8 due to the higher stability of the zinc(II) complex.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 17, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>In summary, we have demonstrated that\nsimple conformational switching\nof the cyclohexane ring can be translated to a more sophisticated\nmechanism of controlling the binding properties of the receptors with\nan external chemical stimulus.
