The pore size\nanalyses of <bold>5a</bold> and <bold>6a</bold> as performed using\nnonlocalized density functional theory indicate that the both have two different types of pores, micro-\nand mesopores (). <bold>6a</bold> had micropores with an average dimension of \u223c5.8\n\u00c5 and mesopores with an average dimension of \u223c3.7 nm,\nin an \u223c3:1 volume ratio.

The N2 adsorption isotherms of both 3a and 4a at 77 K are typical type I plots (), which confirms the microporosity of both frameworks. The specific pore volume of 3a as estimated from the uptake amount (495 cm3/g at 0.97 P/P 0) was 0.765 cm3/g, which is slightly smaller than the calculated specific pore volume of 3 from the single-crystal structure, 0.865 cm3/g. The BET surface area of 3a as calculated using a P/P 0 between 0.0004 and 0.0322 was 1953 m2/g (). The specific pore volume of 4a as estimated from the uptake amount (486 cm3/g at 0.98 P/P 0) was 0.751 cm3/g (), which is similar to that of 3a. The BET surface area calculated using the adsorption isotherm data of P/P 0 between 0.00004 and 0.0428 was 1861 m2/g (). The pore size analyses of 3a and 4a using nonlocalized density functional theory indicate that they have similar average pore dimensions but different distributions ().\n\nConversion of Non-Interpenetrated MOFs to Corresponding Interpenetrated MOFs\n\nRegardless of their net topologies and pillars, non-interpenetrated MOFs 1-4 can be transformed to the corresponding interpenetrated MOFs with hms-c topology, 5 and 6, by thermal treatment. 1 and 2 were transformed to the same new crystalline phase, [Ni(HBTC)(bipy)]-hms-c (5). Single crystals of 5 can be obtained by heating either as-synthesized 1 with hms topology or as-synthesized 2 with gra topology at 300 \u00b0C under flowing N2. Single-crystal structure analysis revealed that 5 consisted of 2-fold interpenetrated [Ni(HBTC)(bipy)] with hms-c topology (). The structure of a single network is indistinguishable from the framework structure of 1, the non-interpenetrated [Ni(HBTC)(bipy)] with hms topology. 2D layers with hcb topology are stacked in an eclipsed fashion with an interlayer distance of 11.2 \u00c5 and are pillared by bipy linkers (a,b). The 2-fold interpenetration generates two different disc-shaped pores, an A-type cage (6.5 \u00c5 in diameter, 2.2 \u00c5 in height) and a B5-type cage (7.3 \u00c5 in diameter, 2.2 \u00c5 in height), in a 2:1 ratio (). B-Type cages have no meaningful portals and are surrounded by six A-type cages in the crystallographic a-b plane, while the A-type cages are interconnected via small portals (3.0 \u00c5 \u00d7 2.2 \u00c5) in the same plane to form 2D porous channels. The void volume of the structure (585 \u00c53, 21.2% of the total unit cell volume) is significantly reduced compared to those of the corresponding non-interpenetrated analogues.\n\nGas Sorption Behavior of the Interpenetrated MOFs, 5a and 6a \n\nThe N2 sorption of activated 6a also follows a type I adsorption with some hysteric desorption (), where activated 6a was prepared by vacuuming as-synthesized 6 at 100 \u00b0C for 3 h. The BET surface area calculated using P/P 0 values between 0.00001 and 0.0585 was 392 m2/g (), and the N2 uptake amount at 77 K and 0.98 bar was 132 cm3/g. The specific pore volume as estimated from the uptake amount was 0.204 cm3/g, slightly larger than the calculated specific void volume of the single-crystal structure model, 0.160 cm3/g. Even though the single-crystal structure of 5 was similar to that of 6, the N2 sorption behavior of activated 5a, prepared by vacuuming as-synthesized 5 at 100 \u00b0C for 3 h, was significantly different from that of activated 6a. The N2 adsorption isotherm of 5a shows features of both type I and type IV isotherms simultaneously. The type I feature, a steep rise in the N2 uptake at very low P/P 0 values, indicates the presence of micropores. The subsequent slow increase in the rate of N2 uptake up to a P/P 0 of ~0.86 and the hysteresis loop between P/P 0 values of 0.86 and 0.97 are type IV features of mesoporous materials. The BET surface area of 5a as calculated using P/P 0 values between 0.00002 and 0.0802 was 259 m2/g (). The specific pore volume estimated from the uptake amount (495 cm3/g at 77 K and 0.97 bar) was 0.767 cm3/g, significantly larger than the calculated specific void volume of the single-crystal structure model, 0.139 cm3/g. The pore size analyses of 5a and 6a as performed using nonlocalized density functional theory indicate that the both have two different types of pores, micro- and mesopores (). 6a had micropores with an average dimension of ~5.8 \u00c5 and mesopores with an average dimension of ~3.7 nm, in an ~3:1 volume ratio. The formation of the mesopores was probably due to the partial removal of the neutral azpy pillars during the thermal treatment at 250 \u00b0C during the structural conversion of non-interpenetrated 3 to 2-fold interpenetrated 6. The HBTC:azpy ratio in the 1H NMR spectrum of 6a digested in D2O/DCl solvent supports the partial removal (~8%) of the neutral azpy pillars from the structure during the thermal treatment (). The EA result also supports the partial removal (~5%) of the neutral azpy pillars from the structure. 5a also had micropores with an average dimension of ~5.2 \u00c5 and mesopores with an average dimension of ~31 nm, in a volume ratio of approximately 1:6. Both the size and the cumulative volume of the micropores in 5a were slightly smaller than the corresponding values for 6a. In contrast, the dimension and the cumulative volume of the mesopores of 5a were much larger than the corresponding values for 6a. Some neutral bipy pillars were also removed from the structure during the thermal treatment at 300 \u00b0C for the structural conversion from non-interpenetrated 1 to doubly interpenetrated 5. Both the 1H NMR spectrum () and the EA of 5a support the partial removal (~8 and ~11%, respectively) of the neutral bipy pillars from the framework during the thermal treatment.", "data": [[[{"meta":
