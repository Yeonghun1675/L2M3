In this complex, the ligand 1a has a slightly different geometry as the alkyl chain adopts syn-anti-anti-anti-anti geometry (Figure a) with torsion angles of 77.89\u00b0, 154.33\u00b0, 171.26\u00b0, 155.17\u00b0, and 167.45\u00b0. However, the layer geometry, grid dimensions (12.14 \u00d7 12.14 \u00c5) and the width (5.481 \u00c5) are almost similar to those of the above complexes. The interlayer separation of 5.99 \u00c5 (6.45 \u00c5 in 3 and 7.26 in 4 \u00c5) is less than those of the above two complexes given the smaller size of the anion.
