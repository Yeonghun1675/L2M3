This transformation was quantitative, as confirmed by 1H NMR analysis (). In both the aldehyde and carboxylic acid products, the UiO-66-type framework was preserved, as confirmed by powder XRD (). Furthermore, SCXRD analysis of the crystals resulting from the aggressive oxidation confirmed that they also retained their single-crystal character. Remarkably, the position of the newly formed carboxylic acid groups could be determined through the refinement of the SCXRD data (). In this case, the S BET was found to be 301 m2/g (), which is in good agreement with those reported for this UiO-66-COOH (S BET = 350-400 m2/g).
