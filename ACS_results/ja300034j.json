Diffraction data were collected with synchrotron radiation using a 6B MX-I ADSC Quantum-210 detector with a silicon (111) double-crystal monochromator at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory. The ADSC Quantum-210 ADX program (Ver. 1.92) was used for data collection and HKL2000 (Ver. 0.98.699) was used for cell refinement, data reduction, and absorption corrections. The structure was solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares analysis using anisotropic thermal parameters for non-hydrogen atoms with the SHELXTL program. The C2 and C5 atoms were isotropically refined due to poor thermal behavior. Guest molecules in the pores were highly disordered and unable to be modeled. To account for this electron density, the program SQUEEZE was employed. All hydrogen atoms were calculated at idealized positions and refined using a riding model.

Such extreme thermal treatment was necessary because soaking in methanol at 100 \u00b0C for 20 h did not lead to exchange of the bound DEF molecules. The porosity of activated 2 was confirmed via N2 adsorption at 77 K (see ), resulting in a BET surface area of 3270 m2/g. Note that, in line with the expanded structure, this is significantly greater than the BET surface area of 1495 m2/g reported for Mg2(dobdc). \n\nThe synthesis and structure of mmen-2 is depicted schematically at the right of Figure . An activated sample of 2 was suspended in hexanes and an excess of mmen was added. As shown by powder X-ray diffraction (see ), framework crystallinity was not significantly affected by activation or subsequent amine functionalization.

At 25 \u00b0C and 0.39 mbar, near the current partial pressure of CO2 in Earth's atmosphere, the compound adsorbed 2.0 mmol/g (8.1 wt %), which is 15 times the capacity of 2. At the much higher pressure of 5 mbar, the median partial pressure of CO2 within the International Space Station, the framework adsorbed 2.6 mmol/g (10.3 wt %). For comparison, zeolite 5A, which is currently used aboard the station to adsorb CO2, adsorbs 0.85 mmol/g (3.6 wt %, crystallographic volumetric capacity 1.3 mmol/cm3) at 5 mbar. \n\nAt 25 \u00b0C, the CO2 adsorption in mmen-2 reaches 3.13 mmol/g (12.1 wt %) at 0.15 bar and 3.86 mmol/g (14.5 wt %) at 1 bar. Remarkably, its CO2 uptake at 1 bar and 25 \u00b0C exceeds the amount of N2 adsorbed at 77 K. Thus, the low surface area measured at 77 K does not appear to accurately reflect the surface area accessible to CO2, and the pore size distribution calculated from N2 adsorption at cryogenic temperatures likely does not accurately represent the true pore size distribution within mmen-2. On a per mass basis, the amine-functionalized framework adsorbed less CO2 than 2 at pressures higher than 20 mbar. The large density difference between the two frameworks is primarily responsible for the lower gravimetric capacity of mmen-2. Crystallographic densities of 0.58 and 0.86 g/cm3 were calculated for 2 and mmen-2, respectively. At 0.15 bar, 2 and mmen-2 adsorb 2.8 and 2.7 mmol/cm3, respectively.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "M2(dobpdc)", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "Zn"}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "CO2",
