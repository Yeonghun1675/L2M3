On the other hand, weight loss in temperature-dependent thermogravimetry below 400 \u00b0C is attributed to evaporation of glymes. Strong ion-(induced) dipole (M+-glyme) interactions suppress desolvation of coordinating glymes, hence make complexes thermally stable. Because the M+-glyme interaction is also influenced by the positive charge density of the metal ions, the electric-field effect (induction interaction) and ion-dipole interaction (electrostatic interaction) are mutually correlated.

As stated before, weight loss in these systems occurs because of evaporation of desolvated glyme. While the stabilization energy for the complexation of M+ with glymes increases with increasing glyme length, the interaction energy between the M+ ion and a single oxygen atom (M+-Oatom) follows the opposite order; namely, longer glymes lead to weaker M+-Oatom interactions. Because the last M+-Oatom bond-cleavage process dominates the desolvation of glyme from [M(glyme)1]+ cations, complexation of M+ ions with longer glymes results in smaller \u0394T d values than complexation with shorter glymes. On the other hand, the \u0394T d values for a series of equimolar complexes with the same ligand, e.g., G5, decrease in the following order: [Na(G5)1][TFSA] > [Li(G5)1][TFSA] ~ [K(G5)1][TFSA]. Interestingly, equimolar complexes involving Na+ ions always possess higher thermal stability than those involving Li+ ions. In general, the M+-glyme interaction strengthens with decreasing metal ion size because of the higher charge density of the metal ions. However, the \u0394T d results for [Na(G5)1][TFSA] are not completely explained by M+-glyme interactions. Because there is competition between the ligands and [TFSA]- anions for interaction with the M+ ions, the effect of the ion-ion (M+-[TFSA]-) interactions on the M+-glyme interactions should also be considered. M+-[TFSA]- interactions relax the positive charge on the M+ ion; hence, stronger M+-[TFSA]- interactions could lead to weaker M+-glyme interactions, i.e., lower stability in complexes.
