The control experiment using the physical mixture of 50% (Fe  3  O)  2  (TCPP-Co)  3  and 50% (Ni  3  O)  2  (TCPP-Co)  3  shows, as expected, a conversion rate between the value of pure (Fe  3  O)  2  (TCPP-Co)  3  and pure (Ni  3  O)  2  (TCPP-Co)  3  and significantly lower than well-mixed MTV-MOFs of the same metal component. Indeed, this clearly shows that the well-mixed spatial arrangement within the SBUs leads to better performance than the sum of the parts. The best conversion rate in this MTV-MOF series was found in (Ni  2.07  Fe  0.93  O)  2  (TCPP-Co)  3  with Ni/Fe ratio close to 2:1, which corresponds to two Ni2+ ions and one Fe3+ ion in each well-mixed metal SBU.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 14, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>In order to uncover the reason for the better catalytic performance\nobserved for mixed metal MTV-MOFs, we obtain the band structure of\nthese photocatalysts using UV\u2013vis DRS to determine the absolute\nband gap in combination with valence band-XPS to reveal the precise\nposition of the valence band (E,F and <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.6b08724/suppl_file/ja6b08724_si_017.pdf\">SI</ext-link>).
