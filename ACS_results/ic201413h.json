techniques have been successfully used in synthesizing a large number of inorganic\u2013organic hybrid materials, because the difficulties of differential solubility for organic and inorganic precursors can be overcome under hydro(solvo)thermal condition. In the present work, the mild solvothermal reaction has been conducted to prepare these six compounds. As we know, in a special hydro(solvo)thermal process, many factors can affect the formation and crystal growth of the product phases, such as reactant stoichiometry, initial reactants, pressure, pH value, temperature, reaction time, and so forth. We have studied the influence of several synthetic parameters on the obtained compounds. (1) Note that methylamine aqueous solution, acting as an organic base, offers the indispensable alkaline condition in the syntheses of <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>5</bold>. In case of <bold>1</bold>, besides 28% methylamine aqueous solution, additional ethylenediamine (0.1\u20130.2 mL) was also used to justify the alkalinity of the reaction solution; otherwise the yield of <bold>1</bold> was lowered. Compounds <bold>2a</bold> and <bold>4</bold> were obtained from the same starting materials with SnCl<sub>4</sub>\u00b75H<sub>2</sub>O/MnCl<sub>2</sub>\u00b74H<sub>2</sub>O/Se/phen\u00b7H<sub>2</sub>O in the molar ratio of 1:1:4:1, but with methylamine aqueous solution of different concentrations (28% for <bold>2a</bold> and 16% for <bold>4</bold>). Compound <bold>2b</bold> can be obtained in a very low yield with a 7% methylamine aqueous solution. Attempts to improve the yield of <bold>2b</bold> by changing the concentration of the methylamine aqueous solution were unsuccessful. Compound <bold>3</bold> can be obtained with the optimized concentration of the methylamine aqueous solution in the range 11\u201328%; otherwise, the expected crystal was not formed. Compound <bold>5</bold> can be isolated in a good yield with the concentration of the methylamine aqueous solution spanning widely from 11% to 28%; otherwise the yield of <bold>5</bold> was lowered. (2) The temperature does not play a decisive role in the formation of these six compounds, although it is directly related to the yields of the products. Compound <bold>1</bold> can also be well isolated in the optimized temperature of 150\u2013170 \u00b0C. Compounds <bold>2a</bold>, <bold>2b</bold>, <bold>4</bold>, and <bold>5</bold> still can be obtained in a lower yield in the temperature range of 170\u2013185 \u00b0C. While, compound <bold>3</bold> can also be isolated between 160 and 180 \u00b0C. (3) The Sn powder used in the synthesis of <bold>1</bold> or SnCl<sub>4</sub>\u00b75H<sub>2</sub>O used in the syntheses of <bold>2a</bold>\u2013<bold>5</bold> is perfect as the Sn source in our experiments; when the Sn source is replaced, that is, Sn powder is replaced by SnCl<sub>4</sub>\u00b75H<sub>2</sub>O in the synthesis of <bold>1</bold> and SnCl<sub>4</sub>\u00b75H<sub>2</sub>O is replaced by Sn powder in the syntheses of <bold>2a</bold>\u2013<bold>5</bold>, the yields of their corresponding products are lowered.

In the present work, the mild solvothermal reaction has been conducted to prepare these six compounds. As we know, in a special hydro(solvo)thermal process, many factors can affect the formation and crystal growth of the product phases, such as reactant stoichiometry, initial reactants, pressure, pH value, temperature, reaction time, and so forth. We have studied the influence of several synthetic parameters on the obtained compounds. (1) Note that methylamine aqueous solution, acting as an organic base, offers the indispensable alkaline condition in the syntheses of 1-5. In case of 1, besides 28% methylamine aqueous solution, additional ethylenediamine (0.1-0.2 mL) was also used to justify the alkalinity of the reaction solution; otherwise the yield of 1 was lowered. Compounds 2a and 4 were obtained from the same starting materials with SnCl4\u22c55H2O/MnCl2\u22c54H2O/Se/phen\u22c5H2O in the molar ratio of 1:1:4:1, but with methylamine aqueous solution of different concentrations (28% for 2a and 16% for 4). Compound 2b can be obtained in a very low yield with a 7% methylamine aqueous solution. Attempts to improve the yield of 2b by changing the concentration of the methylamine aqueous solution were unsuccessful. Compound 3 can be obtained with the optimized concentration of the methylamine aqueous solution in the range 11-28%; otherwise, the expected crystal was not formed. Compound 5 can be isolated in a good yield with the concentration of the methylamine aqueous solution spanning widely from 11% to 28%; otherwise the yield of 5 was lowered. (2) The temperature does not play a decisive role in the formation of these six compounds, although it is directly related to the yields of the products. Compound 1 can also be well isolated in the optimized temperature of 150-170 \u00b0C. Compounds 2a, 2b, 4, and 5 still can be obtained in a lower yield in the temperature range of 170-185 \u00b0C. While, compound 3 can also be isolated between 160 and 180 \u00b0C. (3) The Sn powder used in the synthesis of 1 or SnCl4\u22c55H2O used in the syntheses of 2a-5 is perfect as the Sn source in our experiments; when the Sn source is replaced, that is, Sn powder is replaced by SnCl4\u22c55H2O in the synthesis of 1 and SnCl4\u22c55H2O is replaced by Sn powder in the syntheses of 2a-5, the yields of their corresponding products are lowered. Detailed experiments also show that compounds 2a and 5 still can be formed in a lower yield with FeCl3 been replaced by FeCl2\u22c54H2O.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 15, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<title>Crystal Structures</title><title>Crystal Structure of <bold>1</bold>\n</title><p>Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that compound <bold>1</bold> crystallizes in triclinic space group <italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>1\u0305 and consists of one-half (Sn<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>6</sub>)<sup>4\u2013</sup> anion, two monoprotonated methylamines, and three phen molecules in the asymmetric unit (Figure ).
