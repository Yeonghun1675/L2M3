Consider first HiPTT\u22c52BiBr3\u22c5C7H8 (5). All three pairs of alkylthio groups in this structure are bonded to Bi(III) centers (whereas in the other four hybrids, only one or two pairs of alkylthio groups are bonded to bismuth atoms), and the strength of the Bi-S bonds (the shortest being 3.01 and 3.12 \u00c5) compares well with those in the other hybrids (see Table ).

In an argon atmosphere, a 50 mL three-neck round-bottom flask was charged with hexabromotriphenylene (HBT, 0.30 g, 0.43 mmol) and sodium thiomethoxide (0.76 g, 95%, 10.3 mmol), and then equipped with a condenser. DMEU (1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone, anhydrous, 40 mL) was added to the above reagents via cannula, and the reaction mixture was heated at a refluxing temperature (~240 \u00b0C) under argon for 6 h. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature, and iodoethane (99% purity, pre-purged with argon for 5 min, 2.0 mL, 25 mmol) was added to the greenish yellow suspension. After 30 min, the reaction mixture was poured into 150 mL of water and the precipitate was filtered, washed with water (100 mL \u00d7 3), and dried under vacuum. The purity of the product thus obtained (0.25 g, beige, 100% based on HBT) was checked by 1H and 13C NMR and the melting point.
