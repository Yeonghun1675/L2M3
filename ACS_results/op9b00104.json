The first GMP campaign successfully delivered 1.4 kgA of API. The low throughput to access key coupling partner 6 was largely overcome in the second campaign by vastly improving the regioselectivity in the tetrazole alkylation using a tin-mediated alkylation. Although an enantioselective introduction of the prodrug would have been ideal, the resolution of the N-1 regioisomer enantiomers via enzymatic hydrolysis provided efficient, chromatography free access to enantiopure 6. After extensive optimization to achieve a scalable process, the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling of 5 and 6 performed well. The overall yield was improved from 6% in the first campaign to 14% in the second campaign to deliver 12 kgA of API.\n\n tert-Butyl (R)-3-(N-(3-Chloropyridin-2-yl)-3-fluoro-4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzamido)piperidine-1-carboxylate (5)\n\nTo a 100 L reactor was added 2-MeTHF (20.0 L), 4 (4.00 kg), bis(pinacolato)diboron (2.86 kg, 1.2 equiv), and KOAc (2.76 kg, 3.0 equiv).
