The water and organic solvent adsorption behaviors of 2 are similar to those of typical hydrophobic MOFs: i.e., MAF-2, MAF-4, MAF-5, MAF-6, and FMOF-1. More accurately, the adsorption capabilities of organic solvents of 2 are larger than for those of MAF-2 and FMOF-1, similar to those for MAF-4/MAF-5, and smaller than that for MAF-6. Furthermore, 2 can adsorb various larger hydrocarbons such as n-alkanes, xylene, ethylbenzene, mesitylene, etc. (Figure S15).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "2", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "10.5", "unit": "mmol g-1", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "", "condition": "type I character"}, {"adsorbate": "benzene", "adsorbed amount": "3.7", "unit": "mmol g-1", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "", "condition": "type V character"}, {"adsorbate": "methanol", "adsorbed amount": "7.4", "unit": "mmol g-1", "temperature": "298 K", "pressure": "", "condition": "type V character"}, {"adsorbate": "water", "adsorbed amount": "0.045", "unit": "mmol g-1", "temperature": "", "pressure": "P/P 0 = 0.95", "condition": ""}], "pore volume": [{"probe": "N2", "value": "0.365", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "condition": "calculated from crystal structure"}, {"probe": "benzene", "value": "0.35", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "condition": ""}, {"probe": "methanol", "value": "0.30", "unit": "cm3 g-1", "condition": ""}], "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "848", "unit": "m2 g-1", "condition": ""}, {"type": "Langmuir", "probe": "", "value": "1023", "unit": "m2 g-1", "condition": ""}]}]]], "include_properties": ["gas_adsorption", "pore_volume", "surface_area"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['gas_adsorption', 'pore_volume', 'surface_area']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n  {\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"name\": \"\",\n      \"symbol\": \"2\",\n      \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"gas adsorption\": [\n      {\n        \"adsorbate\": \"N2\",\n        \"adsorbed amount\": \"10.5\",\n        \"unit\": \"mmol g-1\",\n        \"temperature\": \"77 K\",\n        \"pressure\": \"\",\n        \"condition\": \"type I character\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"adsorbate\": \"benzene\",\n        \"adsorbed amount\": \"3.7\",\n        \"unit\": \"mmol g-1\",\n        \"temperature\": \"298 K\",\n        \"pressure\": \"\",\n        \"condition\": \"type V character\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"adsorbate\": \"methanol\",\n        \"adsorbed amount\": \"7.4\",\n        \"unit\": \"mmol g-1\",\n        \"temperature\": \"298 K\",\n        \"pressure\": \"\",\n        \"condition\": \"type V character\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"adsorbate\": \"water\",\n        \"adsorbed amount\": \"0.045\",\n        \"unit\": \"mmol g-1\",\n        \"temperature\": \"\",\n        \"pressure\": \"P/P 0 = 0.95\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"pore volume\": [\n      {\n        \"probe\": \"N2\",\n        \"value\": \"0.365\",\n        \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n        \"condition\": \"calculated from crystal structure\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"probe\": \"benzene\",\n        \"value\": \"0.35\",\n        \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"probe\": \"methanol\",\n        \"value\": \"0.30\",\n        \"unit\": \"cm3 g-1\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"surface area\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"BET\",\n        \"probe\": \"\",\n        \"value\": \"848\",\n        \"unit\": \"m2 g-1\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"Langmuir\",\n        \"probe\": \"\",\n        \"value\": \"1023\",\n        \"unit\": \"m2 g-1\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 15, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Cu<sub>4</sub>(\u03bc<sub>4</sub>-Cl) cluster of <bold>1</bold>.
