This novel MOF assembled from this Di-9AC ligand was named CD-MOF-161 (controlled degradable metal-organic framework). CD-MOF-161 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1\u0305. The asymmetric unit is shown in . Interestingly, the CD-MOF-161 contains Yb dinuclear clusters as secondary building units, as shown in a. The two Yb3+ ions of the cluster are bridged by one acetate and one carboxylate group belonging to one Di-9AC ligand. A second acetate shares one oxygen atom located between the two ytterbium atoms while his second oxygen atom is only bound to one of the ytterbium atom (Yb1). Yb2 is therefore coordinated to one Di-9AC (O11, O12), one bridging Di-9AC (O10), one DMA molecule (O14), one bridging acetate (O9), one shared acetate (O8, O15), and a water molecule (O13). On its side, Yb1 is coordinated to two Di-9AC (O1 O2 and O3 O4), the bridging Di-9AC (O6), the bridging acetate (O5), the shared acetate (O15), and one DMA molecule (O7). This analysis reveals a total coordination number of 8 for both Yb1 and Yb2 with a Yb-Yb distance of 4.2584(5) \u00c5. The Yb-O distances span from 2.242(3) to 2.451(6) \u00c5 ().
