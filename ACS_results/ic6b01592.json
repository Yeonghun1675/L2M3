The fresh compound 1 was soaked in dichloromethane for 3 days and activated about 10 h under room temperature. The synthesized samples of compound 2 were exchanged with methanol for 3 days, then desolvated at 100 \u00b0C for 12 h under vacuum. The synthesized samples of compound 3 were exchanged with methanol and activated using a supercritical CO2 drying method. As shown in Figures S6-S8, the PXRD patterns of these activated samples indicated that the original skeletons were still retained after activation. As shown in , the N2 adsorption isotherms of such activated samples at 77 K were increased to 228, 188, 197 cm3 g-1 by sharp gas uptakes at the low-pressure region (P/P 0 < 0.1), respectively. The results demonstrated that these porous materials belong to microporous materials with completely reversible type-I adsorption behavior characteristics. The BET surface area and Langmuir surface area were calculated to be about 901 and 1025 m2 g-1 for compound 1, 745 and 835 m2 g-1 for compound 2, and 775 and 871 m2 g-1 for compound 3, respectively. Especially, compound 1 exhibits the highest BET surface area among all the MOF materials based on Cu x I y  SBUs, not only because Cu2(CO2)4 paddle-wheel SBUs and Cu2I2 dimer SBUs are lighter than the other Cu x I y  SBUs but also because the HKUST-like structures always have high BET surface areas in MOFs.\n\nSome other small gases (CO2, N2, and CH4) were further measured for the sorption behaviors of activated samples. In addition, the adsorption enthalpy (Q st) can be calculated according to the adsorption isotherms at 273 and 298 K using the virial method. For the desolvated compound 1, the CO2 adsorption was observed to be 115.26 cm3 g-1 (5.15 mmol g-1) and 84.01 cm3 g-1 (3.75 mmol g-1) at 273 and 298 K under 1 atm (a). The Q st of CO2 is 26.0 kJ mol-1 at zero loading (b and Figure S9). In addition, the sorption isotherms of N2 and CH4 were measured at 273 and 298 K under 1 atm (a). The maximum adsorptions for N2 are 11.60 cm3 g-1 (0.52 mmol g-1) and 9.45 cm3 g-1 (0.42 mmol g-1), and CH4 are 31.56 cm3 g-1 (1.41 mmol g-1) and 23.29 cm3 g-1 (1.04 mmol g-1), respectively. At zero loading, the Q st of N2 and CH4 are 14.77 and 15.43 kJ mol-1, respectively (b, Figures S10 and S11). For the desolvated compound 2, the CO2 adsorption was about 91.01 cm3 g-1 (4.06 mmol g-1) and 62.31 cm3 g-1 (2.78 mmol g-1) at 273 and 298 K under 1 atm (c). The Q st of CO2 is 26.56 kJ mol-1 at zero loading (d and Figure S12). The sorption isotherms of N2 and CH4 were both measured at 273 and 298 K under 1 atm (c).

The Q st of CO2 is 26.98 kJ mol-1 at zero loading (e and Figure S15). In addition, the maximum adsorption amounts for N2 are 11.08 cm3 g-1 (0.49 mmol g-1) and 7.82 cm3 g-1 (0.35 mmol g-1), and CH4 are 29.57 cm3 g-1 (1.32 mmol g-1) and 22.65 cm3 g-1 (1.01 mmol g-1), respectively.
