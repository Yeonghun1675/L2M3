A quantity given by \u0394T p/[T p\u0394(log f)] is estimated to be 0.20, which falls in the range of a superparamagnet. The Arrhenius equation of \u03c4 = \u03c40 exp(\u0394\u03c4/kT), where \u03c4 = 1/2\u03c0f, was employed to extract parameters relevant with a slow magnetic relaxation. A best fit of peak temperatures in \u03c7m'' to the equation affords \u03c40 = 3.9 \u00d7 10-10 s, which is consistent with observed values of SCMs (Figure S5 in the ), and \u0394\u03c4/k = 25.8 K. On the basis of the Glauber model, the correlation length (\u03be) diverges exponentially in a ferrimagnetic 1D anisotropic system, which can be described as the expression of \u03c7T = C eff exp(\u0394\u03be/kT), where \u0394\u03be is the energy barrier to create a domain wall in the chain. A linear fit of ln(\u03c7m'T) against 1/T gives \u0394\u03c3/k = 3.6 K, ensuring the 1D Ising chain in 3 (Figure S6 in the ). The low-temperature maximum in the curve is concerned with finite size effects, and the limitation of growing the correlation length is due to the presence of structural defects on the chains. The Cole-Cole plots (inset of Figure b), measured at temperatures of 2.2, 2.4, and 2.6 K, provide a semicircle, and fitting with a generalized Debye model leads to values of \u03b1 of less than 0.057. The \u03b1 parameters reveal a substantially narrow distribution of relaxation times, which are typical for reported SCMs. ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 13, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<p>In summary, we have prepared and characterized two bimetallic chains constructed by [W(CN)<sub>6</sub>(bpy)]<sup>\u2212</sup> and magnetic anisotropic Mn Schiff bases.
