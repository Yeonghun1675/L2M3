These results indicate that PCP-N and PCP-C are very stable and easily handled in the air.\n\nSorption Properties\n\nN2 Adsorption\n\nFirst, we measured the N2 adsorption isotherms for PCP-N and PCP-C at 77 K to confirm permanent porosity (a). The isotherm of PCP-N shows a steep uptake at a low relative pressure followed by the plateau region (ca. 200 mL (STP) g-1).\n\nIn contrast, the isotherm of PCP-C only shows a small amount of adsorption, indicative of particle surface adsorption (9.5 mL (STP) g-1 at 1 atm) (Figure S5) as is found in [Co(mdpt24)2] (mdpt24 = 3-(3-methyl-2-pyridyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazolate). The low nitrogen uptake may be due to a problem of slow diffusion at low temperature.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "PCP-N", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "PCP-N\u22c54H2O"}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "25 to 200", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "removal of four water molecules", "condition": ""}, {"value": "400", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "plateau", "condition": ""}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "200", "unit": "mL (STP) g-1", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "", "condition": "permanent porosity"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "PCP-C", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "PCP-C\u22c54H2O"}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "25 to 180", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "removal of four water molecules", "condition": ""}, {"value": "400", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "plateau", "condition": ""}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "9.5", "unit": "mL (STP) g-1", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "1 atm", "condition": "particle surface adsorption"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["decomposition_temperature", "gas_adsorption"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['decomposition_temperature', 'gas_adsorption']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"PCP-N\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"PCP-N\u22c54H2O\"\n        },\n        \"decomposition temperature\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"25 to 200\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"removal of four water molecules\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"400\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"plateau\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"N2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"200\",\n                \"unit\": \"mL (STP) g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"77 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"permanent porosity\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"PCP-C\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"PCP-C\u22c54H2O\"\n        },\n        \"decomposition temperature\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"25 to 180\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"removal of four water molecules\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"400\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"plateau\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"N2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"9.5\",\n                \"unit\": \"mL (STP) g-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"77 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"1 atm\",\n                \"condition\": \"particle surface adsorption\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 4, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Structural representation.
