One exhibits large openings with an approximate diameter of 10.9 \u00d7 11.4 \u00c52 in which the terminal water molecules are omitted, and the other exhibits small openings with an approximate diameter of 4.8 \u00d7 4.8 \u00c52, as shown in Figure e. The total solvent-accessible volume for the compound was estimated, using PLATON, to be 70.3%. Although compound 2 has the larger pores, it does not adsorb N2 at 77 K because of the low stability after evacuation.\n\nThermogravimetric Analysis\n\nThermogravimetric analysis for compound 1 shows a two-step weight loss of 14.99% between 25 and 360 \u00b0C, corresponding to the loss of guest H2O molecules and the coordinated H2O molecule (calcd 15.03%). On further heating, a loss of 65.58% between 360 and 800 \u00b0C should correspond to the release of the organic tzdc3- ligand and the collapse of the lattice structure (Figure S8, ). PXRD study indicated that the final product, upon calcinations above 800 \u00b0C, is a main phase of CdO (JCPDS: 65-2908). The TG curve for 2 exhibits an initial weight loss at 153 \u00b0C, with the observed weight loss of 10.53% corresponding to the release of guest water molecules and the terminal H2O molecule (calcd 11.28%). The second weight loss that occurs between 210 and 425 \u00b0C (53.97%) is attributed to the decomposition of the organic ligand and the collapse of the lattice structure, as seen in Figure S9 (). PXRD study indicated that the final product, upon calcinations above 425 \u00b0C, is CuO (JCPDS: 65-2309).\n\nGas Sorption\n\nTo evaluate porosity of the activated compound 1, gas adsorption measurements were carried out with N2. About 150 mg of ethanol-exchanged material (washing 10-15 times) was activated at 85 \u00b0C for 8 h. N2 sorption experiments were performed at 77 K and 0-760 Torr; the fully evacuated framework exhibits permanent microporosity, as evident by the reversible type I N2 sorption isotherms (Figure ). The maximum amount adsorbed is 82 cm3 g-1 at 77 K and 1 bar. The estimated Langmuir surface area and BET surface area of the compound are 336 and 254 m2/g, respectively. The total pore volume measured with N2 is 0.10 cm3/g.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "compound 1", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "pore diameter": [{"value": "6.2 x 6.6", "unit": "\u00c52",
