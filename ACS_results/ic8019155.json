This energy barrier seems rather high for a single chain magnetic barrier but, as will be shown below, it is consistent with the exponential temperature dependence of the susceptibility observed above 32 K. This behavior suggests either the coexistence of short and long-range order in 1 or the reminiscence of 1 for its single chain magnetic dynamics even in its ordered state, vide infra. In the 25 to 31 K temperature range over which the main maxima of \u03c7'' and \u03c7' can be observed a Cole-Cole analysis has been performed, which shows a poor fit with the generalized Debye model and large \u03b1 values between 0.645 and 0.742 indicate a broad distribution of relaxation time, see Figure  and . These poor fits indicate that the dynamics of 1 is probably not governed by a single process near 30 K. Unfortunately, no such Cole-Cole analysis could be performed over the 15 to 22 K temperature range of the secondary maximum in \u03c7'' because of the large interference from the tail of the major peak. The most likely origin of the major peak in \u03c7' and \u03c7'' is the presence of critical fluctuations close to an ordering transition at 32 K as suggested by the weak frequency dependence of the peak of \u03c7'. Above this temperature and over the limited interval 0.028 and 0.015 K-1, or 36 and 66 K, both ln(\u03c7dc T) versus 1/T and ln(\u03c7'ac T) versus 1/T clearly show an exponential variation in the correlation length that is in agreement with single chain magnetic behavior, see Figure a. It should be noted that this behavior is identical to that described by the dashed blue curve in Figure a.
