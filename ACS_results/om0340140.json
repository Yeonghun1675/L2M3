Table  summarizes the results of 119Sn NMR data measured in a noncoordinating solvent (CDCl3), in a coordinating solvent (DMSO), and in the solid state, where possible. The poor solubility of 1 precluded the measurement of a 119Sn chemical shift in CDCl3 solution, but in the case of 2, data could be obtained. This indicates likely dissociation of 2 in CDCl3 solution, a conclusion supported by the upfield shift in the 119Sn resonance in DMSO solution that is comparable to the solid-state 119Sn chemical shift, supporting the coordination of DMSO. Considering first the 2-pic series in CDCl3 and DMSO solvents, the values of the chemical shifts moved significantly upfield in the coordinating solvent for 2, 4, and 5, but no significant change in chemical shift was noted for 3. This result indicates an increase in coordination number for 2, 4, and 5 and, therefore, the incorporation of DMSO in the coordination sphere. Although there is no aggregation for both 3 and 4 in the solid state, an increased coordination in DMSO is observed for the phenyl compound (4). This result is consistent with the known steric bulk of the tert-butyl group; e.g. the crystal structure of tBu2SnCl2 is the only one of the \"common\" R2SnCl2 compounds that does not feature intermolecular Sn\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cl interactions. The chemical shifts of the n-butyl (2) and phenyl (4) compounds in the solid state is consistent with the seven- and six-coordinate coordination geometries observed crystallographically. The solid-state 119Sn NMR spectrum of Cy2Sn(2-pic)2(OH2).MeOH (5) is in harmony with an increase in coordination number, but by the inclusion of solvent rather than by carboxylate bridging. For the 2-quin series a very clear trend is evident in that no increase in coordination number in DMSO solution is possible, as judged by the similarity between the solution (DMSO) and solid-state 119Sn NMR results (Table ).
