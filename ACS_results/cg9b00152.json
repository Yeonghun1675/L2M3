The Langmuir and BET surface area are calculated to be 201.3 and 126.3 m2\u22c5g-1, respectively. Since the 2-fold interpenetrated framework of 1 is very stable, the small hysteresis loop reflects a strong affinity of the host framework containing the active interacting sites for CO2 molecules. The CO2 adsorption isotherms at 273 and 298 K also show typical type I isotherms, as shown in a, II and III. At 273 and 298 K, the CO2 uptakes of 1' at 1 atm are 14.4 (2.8 wt %) and 6.7 cm3\u22c5g-1 (1.3 wt %), respectively.\n\nIn contrast to 1', the CO2 adsorption isotherm of 3' at 195 K displays an unusual stepped double S-shaped curve with obvious hysteresis (b, I). The surface areas calculated from Langmuir and BET equation are 533.6 and 358.7 m2\u22c5g-1, respectively. The whole curve is divided into three steps, and each shows a typical type I profile. The steep increase of the CO2 uptake at very low pressures reveals the existence of intrinsic micropores in 3'. The adsorption saturation of the first step occurs at 0.07 atm (A point), where the adsorption amount is 70.5 cm3\u22c5g-1 (13.8 wt %). The second step starts at 0.08 atm and ends at 0.55 atm (B point), where the adsorption amount reaches 132.9 cm3\u22c5g-1 (26.1 wt %). The third step begins at 0.6 atm with the adsorption amount reaching 157.0 cm3\u22c5g-1 (30.8 wt %, 7.0 mmol\u22c5g-1) at 1 atm. Notably, the desorption isotherm also displays a stepwise profile at the corresponding inflection points of the adsorption isotherm but do not retrace the adsorption route to cause an evident hysteresis loop.\n\nWhile the measured temperature increased to 273 K, the CO2 adsorption isotherm still shows a stepwise adsorption stage with a large hysteresis loop (b, II). The adsorption amount of initial step is 44.8 cm3\u22c5g-1 (8.8 wt %) in the pressure region of 0-0.9 atm. In the next step, the CO2 uptake is 64.6 cm3\u22c5g-1 (11.5 wt %) under 1 atm. This stepped adsorption behavior of 3' at 273 K originates from the slight stretch of the flexible bpea ligand when CO2 pressure increases to 0.9 atm. The other possible reason for the large hysteresis loop could be that its structural feature of a small window and large chamber brings about a hindrance for CO2 to diffuse out of the pores. At 298 K, no stepped CO2 adsorption isotherm is observed (b, III). It has type I isotherm, and CO2 uptake amounted to be 22.9 cm3\u22c5g-1 (4.5 wt %) under 1 atm.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "1'", "symbol": "1'", "chemical formula": ""}, "gas adsorption":
