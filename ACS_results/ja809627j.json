Treatment of an ethanolic solution of H2 L1, H2 L5, Co(OAc)2\u22c5(H2O)4 and Et4N(OAc) with NaOEt (4.4 equiv.) (Scheme , step a) under anaerobic conditions, followed by exposure to air, gave the same series of color changes observed during the formation of [CoL1 2]- (Scheme , step a). The mixed-ligand Co(III) complex [L1CoL5]Et3NCH2Cl was isolated after chromatography (again, with cation exchange) in 84% yield. In comparison to the 1H NMR of H2 L1 (Figure b) and macrocycle H2 L5 (Figure d) a significant shift to lower field is observed for both sets of benzylic aromatic resonances (HE's and HF's, Figure c) in [L1CoL5]Et3NCH2Cl, again indicating the presence of the \u03c0-stacking interactions intended to encourage catenane formation. The selectivity of the reaction for the mixed-ligand complex [L1CoL5]-\ue5f8neither of the homotopic complexes [L1 2Co]- or [L5 2Co]- are apparent in the product mixture\ue5f8is a result of the shape and topology of the L5 macrocycle physically preventing complexes of the type [L5 2Co]- from forming. Therefore, the only way in which all the ligands in an equimolar solution of the cobalt ion, L1 2- and L5 2- can be coordinated is through sole formation of the mixed-ligand complex. The thermodynamically driven rearrangement of any initially formed [L1 2Co]2- likely occurs before the ligands are \"locked\" around kinetically inert Co(III), i.e., prior to aerobic oxidation.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 11, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Synthesis of [2]catenate [Co<bold>L7</bold>]<sup>\u2212</sup> via Single Macrocyclization of <bold>L1</bold> through <bold>L5</bold> on a Co(III) Template<xref rid=\"sch2-fn1\"></xref>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gs2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"ja-2008-09627j_0005.tif\"></graphic>\n<p>\n<fn id=\"sch2-fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>Reagents and conditions: (a) Co(OAc)<sub>2</sub>\u00b7(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>, Et<sub>4</sub>N(OAc), NaOEt, EtOH, reflux, 1 h, 84%; (b) (PCy<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>Ru=CHPh, CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, 2 d, 69%; (c) (i) Pd/C, MeOH, H<sub>2</sub>, 1 d, (ii) Zn, AcOH, MeOH, 30 min, 65%; (d) Co(OAc)<sub>2</sub>\u00b7(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>, Et<sub>4</sub>N(OAc), NaOMe, EtOH, reflux, 30 min, 75%.</p>\n</fn>\n</p>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 2  Synthesis of [2]catenate [CoL7]- via Single Macrocyclization of L1 through L5 on a Co(III) Template      a Reagents and conditions: (a) Co(OAc)2\u22c5(H2O)4, Et4N(OAc), NaOEt, EtOH, reflux, 1 h, 84%; (b) (PCy3)2Cl2Ru=CHPh, CH2Cl2, 2 d, 69%; (c) (i) Pd/C, MeOH, H2, 1 d, (ii) Zn, AcOH, MeOH, 30 min, 65%; (d) Co(OAc)2\u22c5(H2O)4, Et4N(OAc), NaOMe, EtOH, reflux, 30 min, 75%.
