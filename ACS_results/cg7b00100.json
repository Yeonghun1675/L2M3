In 1\u22c5g, this is compensated by a torsion of the ligand along its long axis. After introduction of polar ligands, the afw net in 1\u22c5g becomes polar because the polar ligands in the 31 helices arrange nearly parallel with the c-axis. Similar to its dia isomers, 1\u22c5g is also 4-fold interpenetrated. The interpenetration mode of 1\u22c5g can be classified as type IIIa (two pairs nets related by translation and inversion), which produces a mesomeric or centrosymmetric overall structure. There are two types of 1D channels in the structure both running along the crystallographic c-axis, which are occupied by disordered toluene molecules. The larger (channel A) and smaller (channel B) ones are gourd-shaped (widest and narrowest cross section diameters of 7.8 and 4.7 \u00c5) and rhombic (cross section area of 5.4 \u00d7 6.4 \u00c52), respectively (a). Compared to the conventional 3D 4-connected dia net (0.6495 \u00c5-3), afw has a lower topology density (0. 5577 \u00c5-3).
