To look into these differences in photoluminescence properties in the solid state, excitation and emission spectra were recorded at room temperature.

The excitation spectra also illustrate that complex 2 is more efficiently excited than complex 1 under a UV lamp (365 nm, Figures  and ). The emission spectra of 1 and 2 were recorded under the excitation wavelength at 350 nm and exhibited a classical pattern for Eu3+ that is caused by the transition of the first excited state, 5D0, to the ground septet, 7F J  (J = 0-4) (Figure ).
