As time went on, the anion exchange went further into the lattice of 1 and more and more NO3 - anions were exchanged by larger OII- anions, which squeezed into the 1D [Ag(bfps)] n  n+ chains. Such a replacement understandably dilated the distance between the chains, accelerated the anion exchange rate, and increased the amount of the exchanged NO3 -. Thus, in the following 30 min, another 75% of NO3 - in 1 was exchanged into the solution and no more anion exchange could proceed. Complex 3 was readily separated by centrifugation and flushed with saturated NaNO3 aqueous solution (20 mL). Only 0.14% of OII- was eluted (calculated by UV-vis spectrophotometry on the eluent), suggesting that the interactions of the cationic [Ag(bfps)] n   n+ chain with OII- anions in 3 were strong and 3 was stable to leaching. However, if the eluent was changed to a saturated solution of NaNO3 in EtOH and H2O (100 mL, 1/1 v/v), a total of 34% of OII- could be eluted (calculated by UV-vis spectrophotometry on the eluent) but further flushing could not increase the amount of the eluted OII-. Intriguingly, such an anion exchange between NO3 - and OII- was unfinished and 10% of NO3 - anions in 1 still remained. The reason was probably attributed to the fact that each OII- anion has a much larger size than each NO3 - anion. When an increasing amount of compound 4 forms around solid 1, it may block the exchange pathways to the remaining NO3 - anions. Although this process was incomplete, its driving force was probably due to the presence of strong electrostatic interactions, \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, and hydrogen bonds between the cationic [Ag(bfps)] n   n+ chain and the OII- anions.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 25, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<title>Photocurrent Responses</title><p>The electrochemical properties and\nphotocurrent responses of <bold>bfps</bold> and products <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>3</bold> were examined using the method detailed in\nour previous work.
