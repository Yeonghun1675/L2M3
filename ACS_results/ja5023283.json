Single crystal X-ray crystallographic studies indicate that these new MOFs are isostructural with the Mg-MOF template, which is otherwise unachievable through the direct reaction of the TMQPTC ligand and Fe3+/Fe2+ or Cr3+/Cr2+ metal source. The successful synthesis of PCN-426-Fe(III) and PCN-426-Cr(III) illustrate the overwhelming advantages of PSMO: (1) the stepwise strategy makes the metal metathesis much faster and more complete. The primary advantage is on account of the substantial improvement in ligand exchange rates, which is an up to 105-fold increase from Fe3+ (102 (k, s-1)) to Fe2+ (107 (k, s-1)) and an as large as 1016-fold improvement from Cr3+ (10 -6 (k, s-1)) to Cr2+ (10 10 (k, s-1)) due to the electron configuration changes from d3 to d4. PSMO also alleviates the challenges of partial exchange and kinetic inertness. (2) Fe2+ and Cr2+ are softer Lewis acids, which interact more weakly with the carboxylate ligand (a hard Lewis base) than hard Lewis acids such as Fe3+ and Cr3+, so the metal metathesis can be conducted with less destruction of crystallinity. (3) Metal ions with smaller hydrolysis equilibrium constants provide relatively milder conditions where the framework template remains intact during the exchange and facilitates the transportation of metal ions toward metal exchange completion. (4) The subsequent air oxidation is a very gentle but effective postsynthetic treatment.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 11, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Optical\nmicroscope photographs of (a) as-synthesized <bold>PCN-426-Mg</bold>, (b) <bold>PCN-426-Mg</bold> after metathesis with FeCl<sub>2</sub> for 3 h, (c) <bold>PCN-426-Fe</bold>(III) after metal node oxidation,\n(d) <bold>PCN-426-Mg</bold> after metathesis with CrCl<sub>2</sub> for 3 h, and (e) <bold>PCN-426-Cr\u00ad(III)</bold> after metal node oxidation.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ja-2014-023283_0002.tif\" xlink:type=\"simple\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 2  Optical microscope photographs of (a) as-synthesized PCN-426-Mg, (b) PCN-426-Mg after metathesis with FeCl2 for 3 h, (c) PCN-426-Fe(III) after metal node oxidation, (d) PCN-426-Mg after metathesis with CrCl2 for 3 h, and (e) PCN-426-Cr(III) after metal node oxidation.
