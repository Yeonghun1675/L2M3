Solution 1H NMR spectroscopy in CD2Cl2/CD3CN (1:1) of the as-synthesized crystalline sample indicated a 2:1:1 ratio of HPhTT (e.g., \u03b4 7.99, 12H), THF (e.g., \u03b4 3.67, 4H), and acetone (\u03b4 2.11, 6H). To test the framework stability as well as the volatility of the included solvent molecules (THF and acetone), the as-synthesized sample was heated at 180 \u00b0C for 20 min, and the resultant solid sample was studied by powder X-ray diffraction (sample pressed onto a glass slide for data collection at room temperature in air; see also Figures S2 and S3 in the Supporting Information) and solution 1H NMR spectroscopy (solid sample dissolved in 1:1 CD2Cl2/CD3CN; no peaks for THF or acetone were observed). \n\n Crystallization of HPhTT\u22c5AgTf (1b). Toluene solutions of HPhTT (6.4 mM, 0.3 mL) and AgTf (9.7 mM, 0.3 mL) were first mixed in a glass tube (10-mm o.d./6-mm i.d.), and HFB (0.2 mL) and acetone (0.1 mL) were subsequently added to provide a colorless solution. After sequentially layering toluene (0.4 mL) and hexane (1.0 mL) on top of the solution, the tube was sealed and kept in the dark. Colorless, blocklike crystals suitable for X-ray studies were obtained after 1 week. Larger bulk samples can be obtained by similar setups on a larger scale (yield 65% based on  HPhTT). X-ray powder diffraction indicated a single phase consistent with the single-crystal structure (see Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). \n\n Crystallization of HMOPhTT\u22c5AgSbF  6   (2). Single crystals suitable for X-ray data collection were first obtained as follows: Toluene solutions of HMOPhTT (2.3 mM, 0.4 mL) and AgSbF6 (3.3 mM, 0.4 mL) were mixed in a small vial to give a turbid solution. Hexafluorobenzene (0.4 mL) was then added, and more white precipitate was formed as a result. Acetone (4.0 mL) was then added to dissolve the precipitate, and the vial containing the resultant solution was loosely capped and placed into a larger vial containing heptane. The larger vial was tightly capped and placed in the dark for slow crystallization. Chunky, blocklike, light yellow single crystals formed after about 14 days (yield 56% based on HMOPhTT). The crystalline product can also be made in the following way: HMOPhTT (14.5 mg, 13.7 \u03bcmol) was dissolved in a solvent mixture of 1:2:1 toluene/HFB/acetone (total of 2.0 mL, equivalent to 7.4 mM). The light yellow solution was then evenly divided and loaded into five glass tubes (5-mm i.d.) and layered sequentially with toluene (one-half of the volume of the HMOPhTT solution) and an acetone solution of AgSbF6 (7.6 mM, same volume as the HMOPhTT solution in each tube). The glass tubes were then sealed and placed in the dark. Crystals formed after 2 weeks (17.2 mg collected from four of the tubes, 55% yield based on HMOPhTT). X-ray powder patterns of this bulk sample indicated a single phase consistent with the single-crystal structure (see Figure S5 in the Supporting Information). To further verify the chemical composition of the solid sample, the crystals were dissolved in 2:1 CD2Cl2/DMSO-d 6 for 1H NMR measurements, which indicated a 1:4 molar ratio between the included acetone guest and the HMOPhTT molecule. 1H NMR: \u03b4 2.11 (s, 6H, acetone), 3.85 (s, 72H), 6.95 (d, 48H, J = 8.0 Hz), 7.37 (d, 48H, J = 8.0 Hz), 7.80 (s, 24H). Chemical analysis of the crystals (according to the formula HMOPhTT\u22c5AgSbF6\u22c50.25acetone as indicated by solution 1H NMR spectroscopy) yields the following: calcd C 51.55%, H 3.52%; found C 51.25%, H 3.51%.
