Because of its four calixarene-like active vertices, this Ti4L6 cage shows interesting stepwise assembly function with other metal ions. The Ti4L6-Co3 cage and different Ti4L6-Ln structures from simple cages to 1D chains and 3D frameworks were successfully constructed. Moreover, the calixarene-like oxygen vertices of the Ti4L6 cage have also been used for the recognition of dye molecules through N-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O hydrogen bonding. As a result, the homogeneous Ti4L6 cage presents efficient and selective photodecomposition activities toward AB-93 and AB-4B. Therefore, our work not only provides an efficient methodology to build coordination-active cages for advanced supramolecular materials assembly but also opens a new way to produce photoactive cage materials with good activity and selectivity.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 36, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information\nis available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.7b09463\">10.1021/jacs.7b09463</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Additional experimental\ndetails and supporting figures\n(<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.7b09463/suppl_file/ja7b09463_si_002.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Crystallographic\ndata for <bold>PTC-101</bold> (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.7b09463/suppl_file/ja7b09463_si_003.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Crystallographic data for <bold>PTC-102</bold> (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.7b09463/suppl_file/ja7b09463_si_004.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Crystallographic\ndata for <bold>PTC-102\u00ad(Zr)</bold> (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.7b09463/suppl_file/ja7b09463_si_005.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Crystallographic data for <bold>PTC-102\u00ad(Hf)</bold> (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.7b09463/suppl_file/ja7b09463_si_006.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Crystallographic\ndata for <bold>PTC-103</bold> (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.7b09463/suppl_file/ja7b09463_si_007.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Crystallographic data for <bold>PTC-104</bold> (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.7b09463/suppl_file/ja7b09463_si_008.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Crystallographic\ndata for <bold>PTC-105</bold> (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.7b09463/suppl_file/ja7b09463_si_009.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Crystallographic data for <bold>PTC-106</bold> (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.7b09463/suppl_file/ja7b09463_si_010.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/jacs.7b09463.
