Its asymmetric unit comprises three Co(II) ions, two TATAB3-, two TPT, and ten water molecules. As shown in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information, Co1 and Co2 are six-coordinated by two O atoms from two TATAB3- ligands, one N atom from one TPT ligand, and three water molecules. Co3 is also six-coordinated by two N atoms from two TPT ligands and four water molecules. Each TATAB3- and TPT ligand is coordinated by two Co(II) ions, and the adjacent TATAB3- and TPT ligands are bridged by the Co(II) ions, resulting in a 2D layer. The powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD) pattern matches well with the simulated result, indicating the successful preparation of highly pure NUM-6 precursor (Figure S2a in the Supporting Information).

The operating voltage range is between 0.01 and 3.00 V versus Li/Li+ at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s-1. In the first cycle, the cathodic peaks located at 0.64 and 0.85 V are assigned to the multistep electrochemical reduction of Co3O4 to metallic Co0, the generation of an irreversible solid-electrolyte-interphase (SEI) film on the electrode surface, and the formation of amorphous Li2O. Meanwhile, the appearance of another weak cathodic peak at 1.22 V also results from the formation of an SEI film and the decomposition of electrolyte, which is similar to the literature results. In the initial anodic scan, a broad peak appearing at 2.06 V corresponds to the oxidation of Co0 to Co2+ and Co3+.
