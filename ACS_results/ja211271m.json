Upward curvature is a common observation for polymer-based amplified quenching, where it has been explained by invoking a \"sphere of action\" quenching mechanism or as a result of aggregation of polymer fluorophores. Superlinear behavior in the MOFs may arise from aggregation induced by neutralization of the negatively charged MOF surface by cationic quenchers.
