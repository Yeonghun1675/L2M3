Inspired by\nthe chemistry of these microorganisms, we report the first hydroxamate\nMOF prepared by direct synthesis. MUV-11 (MUV = materials of Universidad\nde Valencia) is a crystalline, porous material (close to 800 m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup>) that combines photoactivity with\ngood chemical stability in acid conditions. By using a high-throughput\napproach, we also demonstrate that this new chemistry is compatible\nwith the formation of single-crystalline phases for multiple titanium\nsalts, thus expanding the scope of accessible precursors. Titanium\nframeworks are regarded as promising materials for photocatalytic\napplications. Our photoelectrochemical and catalytic tests suggest\nimportant differences for MUV-11. Compared to other Ti-MOFs, changes\nin the photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic activity have been\nrationalized with computational modeling, revealing how the chemistry\nof siderophores can introduce changes to the electronic structure\nof the frontier orbitals, relevant to the photocatalytic activity\nof these solids.</p><p>These precedents encouraged us to investigate the use of siderophore-type\nlinkers by replacing carboxylate with hydroxamic units (\u2212CONHOH)\ninto already known MOF-forming polycarboxylate linkers (). Compared to carboxylates,\nhydroxamates are well known for their medical applications and ability\nto form strong metal\u2013linker joints. Still, there is no precedent for their use as connectors to form\nporous, crystalline materials by direct synthesis. This is arguably\ndue to the difficulties in controlling the formation of strong metal\u2013hydroxamate\ncoordination bonds under reversible conditions to avoid the formation\nof amorphous materials with intrinsic disorder. To date, hydroxamic\nacid linkers have been incorporated only postsynthetically into Zr\u00ad(IV)-UiO-66\nframeworks via solvent-assisted linker exchange reactions to produce\ndaughter materials with enhanced stability. This work highlights the difficulties in using hydroxamic linkers\nto produce reticular solids by direct synthesis. Herein, we report\nthe first hydroxamate-based MOF prepared by <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis. MUV-11 (MUV = materials of Universidad de Valencia) is\na crystalline, porous material that combines photoactivity with a\nsurface area close to 800 m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup>. Compared to titanium frameworks based on other binding groups,\nthe use of a siderophore binder results in outstanding chemical stability\nin acid conditions and introduces drastic changes to the frontier\ncrystalline orbitals that control charge transfer kinetics and thereby\nthe photocatalytic activity of this material.</p><p>The solid was isolated as orange crystals with hexagonal morphology\nand sizes ranging from 10 to 20 \u03bcm (b and <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.9b04915/suppl_file/ja9b04915_si_001.pdf\">S3</ext-link>). Their\nsmall size and intertwined nature prevented structural determination\nwith an in-house diffractometer. Synchrotron radiation (ALBA, BL13-XALOC)\nwas limited by very weak diffraction at high-angle resolution and\nallowed us to determine only the space group and cell parameters.\nElectron density maps were used to determine the position of Ti atoms,\norganic linkers, and the overall network connectivity. This preliminary\nstructural model was then modified with the Materials Studio (MS)\n2017 R2 and optimized with density functional theory (DFT) methods\n() to produce a starting model\nfor the refinement of the high-resolution powder X-ray diffraction\ndata (PXRD) also collected at the synchrotron (ALBA, BL04-MSPD). As\nshown in a,\nRietveld refinement converged with excellent residual values (<italic>R</italic>\n<sub>wp</sub> = 1.47%, <italic>R</italic>\n<sub>exp</sub> = 1.15%) for a trigonal <italic>P</italic>3<sub>2</sub> space group\nwith cell parameters <italic>a</italic> = 18.1230(8) \u00c5 and <italic>c</italic> = 11.2238(7) \u00c5. Comparison of the atomic coordinates\ngenerated by DFT and Rietveld refinement is summarized in . MUV-11 is based on octahedrally\ncoordinated, single-node Ti\u00ad(IV) atoms. They are coordinated to six\noxygen atoms from the hydroxamic groups of three H<sub>\n<italic>n</italic>\n</sub>bdha (<italic>n</italic> = 1, 2) units that interconnect two\nneighboring metal nodes. This results in a honeycomb-like lattice\nin which simple-node metal atoms and organic linker act as vertices\nand edges of the hexagonal tiling for a 2,3-c 2-nodal net topology\n(a and ). This is reminiscent of the in-plane structure\nof NTU-9, built from 2,5-dihydroxiterepthalate\n(H<sub>2</sub>dhtp) linkers, with 1.5 times bigger pore widows as\na result of the elongation of the linker in MUV-11 (). The hydroxamic group is capable of adapting the\ncoordination mode of dhtp connectors into a five-membered chelate,\nbut it introduces differences that result in important changes to\nthe internal structure of the layers. As summarized in , the \u2212OH groups in dhtp form\npart of the central aromatic ring, restricting the linker to adopt\na planar conformation upon metal coordination with a twist angle between\nneighboring rings of 4.4\u00b0 in NTU-9. In turn, the hydroxamate\ngroup lies off the ring and can rotate more freely to adopt the conformation\nthat is more favorable energetically. As a result, the planes of the\naromatic ring and one of the Ti-OCNO chelates deviate 16.3\u00b0 from\nplanarity to produce a highly distorted octahedron. This is likely\nthe reason for the layers in MUV-11 adopting a zigzag configuration\n(b) compared\nto their planar structure in NTU-9. The internal rotation of the hydroxamate\nunits is also influenced by the formation of NH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O\nH-bonds between neighboring layers of 2.74(14) and 2.73(11) \u00c5\n(). We presume the\ncorrugated structure of the layers and H-bond interactions are responsible\nfor the packing of the solid. Compared to NTU-9, which displays an\n\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7AA\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 eclipsed packing, MUV-11 combines\nthree types of neutral [Ti<sub>2</sub>(Hbdha)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>bdha)] layers arranged in a \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7ABC\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\nfashion for an overall slipped packing. Similar to NTU-9, a fraction of the hydroxamic NH\u2013 groups\nin the linker must be deprotonated to account for the neutrality of\nthe framework. MUV-11 might be also formulated as [Ti<sub>2</sub>(Hbdha)<sub>2.67</sub>], in which all linkers would be structurally equivalent\nand partially double-deprotonated for charge neutrality. As shown\nin c, the structure\nof MUV-11 displays helical chains built from the H-bonding of alternating\nfive-membered hydroxamate chelates (\u2212Ti\u2013O\u2013N\u2013C\ue5fbO\u2212)\nalong [001]. This helix is further bridged by the organic linker to\nthe adjacent chains. As shown in d, the helical-like packing results in the\nformation of empty 1D channels along [001] with a pseudohexagonal\nshape and internal diameter of 0.8 nm, which account for a solvent-accessible\nvolume close to 40% () and a theoretical\nsurface area near 950 m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup> as\nestimated with Zeo++. All helical chains\ndisplay the same handedness for overall chirality at a single-crystal\nlevel, consistent with the chiral space group <italic>P</italic>3<sub>2</sub>.

Analysis of the\npore size distribution (PSD) by using nonlinear density functional\ntheory (NLDFT) methods reveals a homogeneous pore diameter of 1.0\nnm, which agrees well the 0.8 nm calculated from the structure. We\nalso confirmed the porosity of the solid with CO<sub>2</sub>. MUV-11\ndisplays a reversible type-I isotherm at 195 K with less abrupt adsorption\nat low pressures ().

It is worth noting that the structure of MUV-11 is quite\nsensitive to the activation protocol employed. Soxhlet washing of\nthe solid with protic solvents led to partial collapse of the structure\nfor a substantial reduction of accessible porosity (). This is likely due to the network of H-bonds\nthat directs interlayer packing and thereby dictates the 3D structure\nof MUV-11 (b).

However, the design of porous solids with chemical stability still remains limited to carboxylate or azolate groups. There is a timely opportunity to develop new synthetic platforms that make use of unexplored metal binding groups to produce metal-linker joints with hydrolytic stability. Living organisms use siderophores (iron carriers in Greek) to effectively assimilate iron in soluble form. These compounds make use of hard oxo donors as hydroxamate or catecholate groups to coordinate metal Lewis acids such as iron, aluminum, or titanium to form metal complexes very stable in water. Inspired by the chemistry of these microorganisms, we report the first hydroxamate MOF prepared by direct synthesis.
