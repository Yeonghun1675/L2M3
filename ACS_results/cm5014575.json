Currently, organic and organic-inorganic hybrid materials are vastly explored as ferroelectric materials for their efficiency and flexibility in device fabrication. In this effort, self-assembled metal organic hybrids have gained attention owing to their ready syntheses and tunable properties. However, syntheses of self-assembled ferroelectric materials are still challenging because of the strict requirement of a helical and noncentrosymmetric polar packing arrangement of the molecular constituents. Several factors, viz., coordination geometry around the metal ion, nature of the ligand, the role of counteranions, and solvent systems, have been found to contribute toward noncentrosymmetric, chiral, or polar lattice parameters. Although it is difficult to measure the role of each of these factors, a careful choice of the metal ions and counteranions in combination with a nonrigid ligand system can contribute to polar noncentrosymmetric crystal parameters which could eventually give rise to ferroelectric self-assemblies. To test this hypothesis, we set out to synthesize both centrosymmetric and noncentrosymmetric structural motifs for the same metal-ligand combination depending upon the reaction conditions and counteranions.

Thus, the iso-structural 1D-helical assemblies of 1 and 1a exhibit large variations for ferroelectric saturation polarization (P s) and dielectric constant values as the higher values are observed for the former one. Also, the tetrameric cavitand 2 shows a significant dielectric constant despite having a centrosymmetric structure. In addition, the hydrophilic nature of the central cavity in 2 was confirmed by the encapsulation of a hydrated potassium cation. Similarly, 3 can host a water cluster in its intrinsic cavity. These results demonstrate that anion driven self-assembly is a facile approach for tuning the behavior of metal-organic ferroelectrics and pave the way for the synthesis of new practical materials.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 31, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>X-ray crystallographic data\nfor L, <bold>1</bold>, <bold>1a</bold>, <bold>2</bold>, <bold>2a</bold>, <bold>2</bold>\u2283[K\u00ad(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>8</sub>], and <bold>3</bold> in the CIF format; NMR for L and mass spectra for all of\nthe compounds; additional figures pertaining to crystal structures\nand dielectric measurements; PXRD, TGA, EPR, magnetism data, and tables\nof bond lengths and angles.
