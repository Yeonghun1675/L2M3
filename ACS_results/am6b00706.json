The N2 sorption isotherm of FJI-C4 at 77 K shows a reversible typical type-I isotherm as expected for microporous materials. Derived from N2 sorption isotherm, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and the Langmuir surface area of FJI-C4 are 690 m2 g-1 and 781 m2 g-1, respectively. A narrow distribution of micropores at appropriate 5.5 \u00c5 is calculated by the Horvath-Kawazoe method (), which is slightly smaller than the value derived from the single crystal structure. The pore volume from t-plot analysis is 0.27 cm3 g-1, which is also smaller than the theoretical value from a single crystal structure (0.44 cm3 g-1); these discrepancies can be explained by the existence of disorder Me2NH2 + counteractions occupied in the pores of FJI-C4. Since CO2 is a dominant component of greenhouse gas and a main contaminant of natural gas, it is meaningful to investigate the capacity for CO2 and selectivity of CO2/CH4. Low pressure CO2 sorption isotherms were also measured at 273 and 298 K (). The amount of CO2 uptake for FJI-C4 is 111.0 cm3 g-1 (21.8 wt %) at 273 K and 60.3 cm3 g-1 (11.2 wt %) at 298 K under 1 bar, respectively.

Although many MOFs with excellent gas sorption capacity (such as H2, CO2, and CH4) have been reported, only a few MOFs show high sorption capacity and selectivity toward light hydrocarbons. To examine the sorption and separation of light hydrocarbons of FJI-C4, single component gas sorption isotherms of FJI-C4 for various light hydrocarbons (CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, and C3H8) were performed both at 273 and 298 K. As expected, FJI-C4 can take up a high amount of C3H8 (74.7 cm3 g-1), C2H2 (82.8 cm3 g-1), C2H6 (73.4 cm3 g-1), and C2H4 (70.1 cm3 g-1) but a relatively lower amount of CH4 (32.7 cm3 g-1) at 273 K and 1 bar (a). It should be noted that the sorption capacity of FJI-C4 for C3H8 (71.5 cm3 g-1), C2H2 (72.5 cm3 g-1), C2H6 (66.3 cm3 g-1), C2H4 (61.4 cm3 g-1), and CH4 (18.4 cm3 g-1) at 298 K and 1 bar are higher than those of UTSA-35a and UTSA-36a (b).
