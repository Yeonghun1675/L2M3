The structure also presents sodium ions as charge compensating cations. These two different metallic sites, one occupied by manganese(II) cations and the other by sodium ions are in an octahedral environment, as shown in Figure . The manganese(II) ion occupies an a site over the crystallographic 3+ axis, and the same is true for the sodium ion, placed in a b site. The octahedral environment of manganese(II) is formed by six oxygen atoms, where two types of formate ligands are present (three of them bonded through O1 oxygen atoms and the other three through O2 oxygen atoms). All O-Mn-O angles are close to 90\u00b0 or 180\u00b0. Each manganese(II) center has three sodium ions as neighbors, at a distance of 3.4350(6) \u00c5. Selected bond distances and angles are listed in Table . Three manganese sites surround a sodium ion, defining an equilateral triangle. As imposed by the 3+ axis, each manganese(II) ion is the common vertex of three of these triangles, as shown in Figure ; although sharing one vertex, they are not coplanar. The lattice resulting from this arrangement has also six regular pentagons (see ) corresponding to a 33\u22c556 topology. Differing from (NH4)[M(OOCH)3], the lattice shows no channels where the charge balancing ions are free to move, since the sodium ions are well confined in the structure.
