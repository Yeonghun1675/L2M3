Efforts will focus on the characterization of reaction intermediates such as Cu(I)-OOH species. This may provide insight into the mechanism of copper-containing oxygenases but also, possibly, on the catalytic mechanism of ACC oxidase. Indeed, ACCO is an associate member of a superfamily of iron(II)-containing oxidases and oxygenases that catalyze a wide range of oxidation reactions, most of them utilizing 2-oxoglutarate as a cosubstrate (which is transformed into succinate and carbon dioxide). Although ACCO uses ascorbate and not \u03b1-ketoglutarate as a cofactor, it presents strong sequence and structural analogies with some members of this family. Moreover, very recently, Tolman et al. have described a copper(I)-\u03b1-ketoglutarate complex that can react with dioxygen to perform arene hydroxylation. This system, being a copper-containing model of \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenases, emphasizes the parallel that might be established between copper and iron systems.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 67, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>EPR experimental and simulated spectra for <bold>1b</bold>, <bold>2a</bold>, and <bold>3a</bold>.
