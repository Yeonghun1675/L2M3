The magneto-structural study, using both ac- and dc-magnetization as a function of temperature, field, and frequency, reveals very complicated magnetic behaviors not encountered previously that are discussed in terms of chains having XY anisotropic with S eff = 1/2, g ||b = 6.5, and g \u22a5b = 3.25. The moments are inferred to have a canting angle of 13.34\u00b0 from the XY (ac) plane due to competing ferromagnetic interaction within pairs and antiferromagnetic interactions between them. The moments of the neighboring chains are canted in the opposite direction to lead to compensated antiferromagnetism below 5.5 K in zero-field. The ground state is therefore a hidden-canted antiferromagnet. The existence of domains was suggested by the frequency dependence of the ac-susceptibility and the presence of hysteresis. The long distance between the antiferromagnetically coupled chains and the absence of chemical links allow a very weak metamagnetic critical field of 30 Oe to reverse the moments to give a resultant of 3 \u03bcB (a quarter of that expected for parallel alignment) along the b-axis. The results show a clear contrast to those expected for a single-chain magnet that is required to be Ising and the frequency dependence of the ac-susceptibilities extending to higher temperatures from the blocking one at low frequency. Dehydration of the compound changes the coordination geometries of the cobalt atoms, and thus their magnetic anisotropies, and consequently, this results in the absence of long-range ordering.
