Most interestingly, the high temperature single-crystal X-ray structure of 1 (433 K, 1') undoubtedly demonstrates the stability of the framework. In 1', the framework is identical to that in 1, except that there are slight changes in the bond lengths and bond angles (Table ). Furthermore, the dihedral angles between the pyridyl rings in the ligand L have changed slightly at 100 and 473 K. At 100 K, the dihedral angles between the pyridyl rings in the ligand L are 11.89\u00b0, 40.92\u00b0, and 47.59\u00b0, while the corresponding dihedral angels are 6.63\u00b0, 42.70\u00b0, and 47.01\u00b0 at 473 K. However, in 1' no free water molecules can be assigned in the electron-density maps, which is in great agreement with the TGA. More important, 1 has good water stability. To test the water stability, the sample after adsorption experiment was immersed in the water at room temperature for 7 days and at 85 \u00b0C for 18 h. As shown in Figure , PXRD unambiguously verifies that 1 retains its structure. As we know, there are few examples of the structure of porous MOFs with thermal and water stability.

However, because of no big guests to fill the large pores, two identical frameworks interpenetrate each other through four big windows to stabilize the whole structure (Figure S2 in the ). Due to the interpenetration, the pores along the crystallographic b axis are blocked. Thus only two types of 1D channels along the a (Figure a) and c axes (Figure b) remain, where the free water molecules exist as guests. Nevertheless, the total solvent accessible volume for 1 is estimated to be 35.2% calculated by the PLATON software. To evaluate the theoretical pore structure, the pore analysis tool Poreblazer was used to explore 1. The analysis results show that the pore system in 1 is percolated in one dimension with the pore limiting diameter of 5.73 \u00c5 and maximum pore diameter 6.91 of \u00c5, and the accessible surface area per mass is 611 m2\u22c5g-1. Predictably, the pore in 1 with narrow pore size can be used for gas separation.\n\nAdsorption Experiments\n\nDue to the highly stability and high accessible volume, 1 was subjected to gas adsorption studies. The as-synthesized 1 was activated by immersing in methanol (MeOH) for 3 days and then outgassed overnight under vacuum at 120 \u00b0C to generate dehydrated form 1a. The permanent porosity of 1a was established by N2 sorption experiments. The N2 adsorption isotherm at 77 K exhibits typical \"type I\" adsorption behavior with maximum nitrogen uptake of 65 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 1 bar, indicating its microporous nature (Figure a). Thus, the corresponding pore volume calculated from the maximum N2 adsorption is 0.10 cm3\u22c5g-1, and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area is 266 m2\u22c5g-1, which is smaller than the theoretical value 611 m2\u22c5g-1. The significant difference of surface area is due to the narrow pore size, and the experimental pore size distribution (PSD) curve based on NLDFT model is shown in Figure b, which shows a maximum in the micropore range (ca. 7 \u00c5). For those MOFs with ultramicropores (pore width <7 \u00c5), only the adsorption isotherms of helium at 4.2 K can give more accurate pore information including pore size and specific surface area.\n\nH2 adsorption isotherms was recorded under atmospheric pressure, which also showed type I behavior with good reversibility. At 77 K and 1 bar, it had an uptake of 80 cm3\u22c5g-1 (Figure a), which is close to those of recently reported MOFs under the same conditions. To quantitatively compare the affinities to H2 molecules, a second H2 adsorption isotherm was measured at 87 K (Figure a). The isosteric heat of H2 adsorption (Q st) is calculated by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, and the Q st at zero coverage is estimated to be 6.10 kJ\u22c5mol-1 (Figure b), higher than those of many famous porous materials, such as MOF-177 (4.4 kJ\u22c5mol-1) and MOF-5 (4.8 kJ\u22c5mol-1). It should be noted that both the N2 adsorption isotherm and the H2 adsorption isotherms show obvious hysteresis. The main reason is that the pore size in 1a is so small that there is strong binding affinity to H2 and N2.\n\nSelective CO2 Adsorption\n\nTo further explore the potential properties on gas separation of 1a under ambient conditions, the adsorption isotherms of CO2, H2, N2, and CH4 for 1a at 273 K were measured, respectively (Figure ). The CO2 uptake value at 1 bar is 70 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 273 K, which is much higher than those of H2 (0.8 cm3\u22c5g-1), N2 (4.2 cm3\u22c5g-1), and CH4 (18.2 cm3\u22c5g-1). To evaluate the CO2/CH4 selectivity of 1a under mixture gas conditions with single-component isotherms, the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) can be used to predict multicomponent adsorption behaviors. The predicted selectivities for equimolar CO2/CH4 gas mixture pairs in 1a are plotted in Figure . A remarkable point is that 1a shows very high CO2/CH4 selectivity (~65), which can compare with some reported MOF materials under similar conditions, such as a Co(II) carborane-based MOF (~47), Cu-BTC (~8), MIL-53(Cr) (~9), a mixed-ligand MOF (30), a carborane-based MOF with open metal sites (17), and a 2-D MOF with open metal sites (13). Coverage-dependent CO2 adsorption enthalpies of 1a were calculated according to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. It shows that Q st exhibits a maximum of 30.8 kJ\u22c5mol-1 at initial coverage (Figure ). The high Q st for CO2 is benefited from the small pore size of 1, because the framework-CO2 interactions can be augmented in small pores.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "1", "chemical
