After activation, 1 exhibits a stable porous framework with a specific Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 980 m2\u22c5g-1 and high CO2 adsorption capacity and high selectivity compared to those of methane (CH4) and dinitrogen (N2) at 303 K and pressure up to 21 bar. The catalytic properties of 1 were tested in the Knoevenagel condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and benzaldehyde with active methylene compounds (methyl cyanoacetate, ethyl acetoacetate, and malononitrile). The results confirmed that the compound shows high catalytic activity in condensation reactions and a high selectivity to desired products, without a significant loss of catalytic activity even after repetition cycles.\n\nStructure Determination and Refinement\n\nCompound 1 crystallizes as colorless prismlike crystals. Diffraction data were collected on a Nonius Kappa CCD diffractometer equipped with an APEX II detector (Mo K\u03b1 radiation, \u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5) at 150(2) K. Data were processed by the diffractometer software. The phase problem was solved by direct methods (SHELXS 2013) and the structure refined by full-matrix least squares on F 2 (SHELXL 2013). Diffraction maxima observed in the cavities could not be refined using a chemically plausible model and have thus been discarded using the SQUEEZE procedure in PLATON. Hydrogen atoms were refined isotropically and all other atoms anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms residing on aromatic carbon atoms were included in an ideal position with the C-H bond fixed to 0.95 \u00c5 and U iso(H) assigned to 1.2U eq of the adjacent carbon atom. The absorption correction was semiempirical on symmetry equivalents. The structure figures were drawn using DIAMOND software. Crystal data for 1: crystal size 0.52 \u00d7 0.16 \u00d7 0.13 mm, monoclinic, space group C2/c, a = 41.582(2) \u00c5, b = 20.2045(10) \u00c5, c = 28.205(3) \u00c5, \u03b2 = 131.6580(10)\u00b0, V = 17 704(2) \u00c53, Z = 8, D calcd = 1.758 g\u22c5cm-3, \u03bc = 7.660 mm-1. Of the 74859 total reflections collected (-51 \u2264 h \u2264 51, -20 \u2264 k \u2264 25, -35 \u2264 l \u2264 23), 18252 were unique (R int = 0.0418) and used to solve the crystal structure. On the basis of these data and 748 refined parameters, final R indices [I > 2\u03c3(I)], R 1 = 0.0659, wR 2 = 0.2021; R indices (all data), R 1 = 0.1018, wR 2 = 0.2158, and the goodness-of-fit on F 2 is 1.147.\n\n b depicts complex 1 exhibiting a 3D noninterpenetrated framework that contains open channels propagating along the c crystallographic axis. The channels are formed by repeated jarlike cavities, with a narrow entrance (14.98 \u00d7 7.88 \u00c52) and a wider inside pocket (14.98 \u00d7 13.17 \u00c52). Because the guest solvent molecules could not be determined by XRD data to be due to the high thermal disorder, they were proven by elemental analysis, TGA-EGA, and IR measurements at different temperatures. After removal of the guest molecules, the void space in the total crystal volume, determined by the PLATON program, is 8 913 \u00c53 (cell volume 17704 \u00c53) and corresponds to 50.3% of the crystal volume.\n\nTGA-EGA () indicates a mass loss of 19.8% in the temperature range 370-570 K, corresponding to the removal of nine H2O and five DMF molecules (calcd 20.1%) in one step (endothermic effect at 390 K on DTA). The MS spectra of the gaseous products of the first stage of thermal decomposition showed signals with 18 and 73 amu, which were assigned to H2O (18) and DMF (73) molecules. Next, heating of the sample caused thermal decomposition of the polymeric framework accompanied by an increase of the intensity of the EGA signals with 18 amu (H2O), 28 amu (CO), 44 amu (CO2), and 78 amu (benzene) with significant exothermic effects at 633, 708, 788, and 873 K on DTA. The organic part of the framework did not decompose completely upon heating to 1200 K because the decomposition of 1 was studied in an inert gas atmosphere (argon). The carbonized product was still present at 1200 K (residual mass 55.3%).\n\nAt relative pressure p/p 0 = 0.95, the N2 uptake capacity reaches 278 cm3\u22c5g-1, corresponding to an experimental pore volume of around 0.43 cm3\u22c5g-1, and is close to the total microporous volume of 0.67 cm3\u22c5g-1 calculated by DFT. The experimental pore volume (V p) was calculated by eq 1 in Supporting Information. Evaluation of the N2 isotherm using the BET equation gave a specific surface area (S BET) of 980 m2\u22c5g-1. It is of note that the observed S BET is the highest compared with other reported MOFs constructed from the methanetetrabenzoate linker such as {[Zn2(\u03bc8-MTB)(H2O)2]\u22c53DMF\u22c53H2O} n  (248 m2\u22c5g-1), {[Cu2(\u03bc8-MTB)(H2O)2]\u22c56DEF\u22c52H2O} n  (526 m2\u22c5g-1), {[Zn2(\u03bc4-MTB)(\u03ba4-CYC)2]\u22c52DMF\u22c57H2O} n  (644 m2\u22c5g-1), and {[Ni4(\u03bc6-MTB)2(\u03bc2-H2O)4(H2O)4]\u22c510DMF\u22c511H2O} n  (700 m2\u22c5g-1). For the complexes {[Co4(\u03bc6-MTB)2(\u03bc2-H2O)4(H2O)4]\u22c513DMF\u22c511H2O} n   and {[Ni2(\u03bc4-MTB)(\u03ba4-CYC)2]\u22c54DMF\u22c58H2O} n , adsorbing a limited amount of N2 [21.6 cm3\u22c5g-1 for cobalt(II) and 9.2 cm3\u22c5g-1 for nickel(II)], their surface areas, 356 and 141 m2\u22c5g-1, respectively, were estimated from the CO2 adsorption isotherms measured at 195 K using the Dubinin-Radushkevich model.\n\nThe other frequent probe to investigate the sorption properties of MOFs is CO2. The adsorption/desorption isotherm of CO2 measured at 273 K is shown in . The maximal storage capacity of CO2 at 1 bar and 273 K for 1' is 2.1 mmol\u22c5g-1 (9.3 wt %). As can be seen from , the adsorption and desorption branches of the isotherm did not close, and the irreversibility is observed even at the lowest equilibrium pressures. Such behavior can arise from a strong interaction between the adsorbate and adsorption sites. A comparison of the adsorption capacity with the literature data has shown that the CO2 adsorption capacities were reported for four compounds containing the MTB ligand, namely, {[Zn2(\u03bc8-MTB) (H2O)2]\u22c53DMF\u22c53H2O}n (1.3 mmol\u22c5g-1, 5.67 wt %, 1 bar, 273 K), {[Co4(\u03bc6-MTB)2(\u03bc2-H2O)4(H2O)4]\u22c513DMF\u22c511H2O}n (1.6 mmol\u22c5g-1, 7.02 wt %, 1 bar, 273 K), {[Zn2(\u03bc4-MTB)(\u03ba4-CYC)2]\u22c52DMF\u22c57H2O}n (2.4 mmol\u22c5g-1, 10.5 wt %, 1 bar, 273 K), and {[Ni4(\u03bc6-MTB)2(\u03bc2-H2O)4(H2O)4]\u22c510DMF\u22c511H2O} n  (3.2 mmol\u22c5g-1, 12.36 wt %, 1 bar, 273 K). As is evident, the adsorption capacity of 1' is similar to that of the {[Zn2(\u03bc4-MTB)(\u03ba4-CYC)2]\u22c52DMF\u22c57H2O} n  complex. Anyway, the adsorption uptake of 1' is rather high compared to those of other MOFs previously proposed for CO2 separation purposes, such as Nd-RPF9 (0.5 mmol\u22c5g-1, 1 bar, 303 K, S BET = 13 m2\u22c5g-1), Sc2BDC3 (0.7 mmol\u22c5g-1, 1 bar, 303 K), UiO-66-2COOH (1 mmol\u22c5g-1, 1 bar, 303 K), and Sc2BDC3-NO2 (1.1 mmol\u22c5g-1, 1 bar, 303 K).
