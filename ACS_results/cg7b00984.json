The independent net in 1 is related by a single vector of [1,0,0] (10.74 \u00c5), which can be assigned to the class Ia interpenetration. Apparently, each Zn center is connected by two AOBTC ligands and two phenDIB ligands in opposite orientation, which is considered as a 4-connected node. Each OABTC ligand acts as 4-connected node in a sheet. All phenDIB ligands as 2-connected linkers are transformed into the connective pillars between Zn centers. On the basis of this simplification, the whole interpenetrated 3D framework can be simplified as a (4,4)-connected 2-nodal bbf network with a point symbol of {64.82}{66}2 defined by TOPOS software (d).

The results (Figure S20) show that the intensity of released MB from MB@1 in the solution of NaCl with ethanol and water (1:1) remain basically consistent with the initial pure one, confirming that they have been almost completely released over other eluting solutions. Such fast release of dye molecules is owing to weak electrostatic interactions between dye molecules and the framework. Then the cycling tests for adsorption and desorption were observed using a solution of NaCl with ethanol and water (1:1) as an eluting solution. The sample of 1 after desorption was simply heated at 80 \u00b0C for 3 h, and then continuously being used for the next cycle test for adsorption and desorption. The solution of each adsorption-desorption (the removal and regeneration of MB and RhB) was evaluated through UV-vis spectroscopy. The spectroscopic investigations of the supernatants and digital images show that this material still displays high effective removal capability toward MB and RhB molecules after several cycles (). In addition, we have also demonstrated that this separation material is very stable and reusable by PXRD patterns and FTIR spectra of samples after several cycles. The results of PXRD patterns and FTIR spectra are consistent with the as-synthesized products, suggesting that the framework integrity of 1 can be well retained (Figures S21-S23). All adsorbed and removal performances of 1 toward dye molecules are very significant for practical applications.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 22, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig6\" position=\"float\">\n<label>6</label>\n<caption>\n<p>UV\u2013vis spectra of three adsorption and desorption\ncycles for <bold>1</bold> toward MB (a) and RhB (b) dye molecules.\nThe first cycle: Ad-first and De1st; the second cycle: Ad-second and\nDe2nd; the third cycle: Ad-third and De3rd, as well as the comparative\nphotographs after three cycles.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr6\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cg-2017-00984t_0003.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 6  UV-vis spectra of three adsorption and desorption cycles for 1 toward MB (a) and RhB (b) dye molecules.
