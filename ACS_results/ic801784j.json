Afterward, the reaction mixture was filtered to remove a small amount of powdery precipitate, and then divided into 5 equal portions. Freshly prepared solutions of dabco (0.034 g, 0.3 mmol) in CH3CN (1.0 mL) were carefully layered on each of the DMF solutions. Colorless, cut-tetrahedral crystals of varying size formed and were collected after 9 days. The product was washed with DMF, guest-exchanged with CHCl3, and dried under vacuum for 12 h. The yield was 0.210 g or 57% based on Zn4(2,7-ndc)4(dabco)(OH2)2(DMF)2. EA Calcd: C, 49.13; H, 4.12; N, 3.82.
