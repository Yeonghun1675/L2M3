The dimeric [Zn2(COO)3(H2O)2] cluster as the basic building block lies on a crystallographic C 3 axis and further bridges six adjacent dimers through three TPA ligands, inducing a 3D open framework with a (10,3)-connecting srs topology by inducing each [Zn2(COO)3(H2O)2] cluster and each TPA ligand as a 3-connected node, respectively (Figure a,d). All of the ligands are ranked neatly along each direction and the distance between two adjacent ligands is about 34.7 \u00c5. In such an independent net, there are two kinds of chiral 1D tubular channels, pores A and B viewed along the c axis (Figure b,c). Pore A as a rhombic 1D channel is constructed by the right-handed helix, while the hexagonal 1D channel of pore B is built from the left-handed helix. A pair such as the srs network is interwoven to generate an opening of ~33 \u00d7 14 \u00c52 (Figure S2 in the ). Such unusually large cavities induce 8-fold interpenetration of the framework. However, the structure generates a 1D channel with a window size of about 7 \u00c5 along the c axis (Figure e). Calculated by the PLATON program, the free space in the structure of FIR-28 without guest molecules and NO3 - anions is about 43.9%, which is much higher than that (20.0%) of another 8-fold srs network reported by Cui's group. The channels are occupied by dissociative guest molecules, all of which are calculated by EA and TGA.\n\nAs shown in Figure S3 in the , the TGA curve for FIR-28 shows a weight loss of 23.2% from 30 to 280 \u00b0C, corresponding to the release of solvent guests. PXRD measurement confirmed the phase purity of FIR-28 (Figure S4 in the ).\n\nIn order to investigate the gas-sorption properties, FIR-28 was exchanged by CH2Cl2 for 1 week and then evacuated at room temperature overnight in a vacuum to form the desolvated sample FIR-28-ht. At 77 K, the N2-sorption isotherm of FIR-28-ht shows a typical type I behavior with significant sorption hysteresis (Figure ), suggesting the presence of permanent micropores in FIR-28-ht. The N2 uptake capacity of FIR-28-ht reaches 259.4 cm3/g at 1 bar (Figure a). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and Langmuir surface areas are 737 and 1029 m2/g, respectively. In addition, the measured pore volume of 0.401 cm3/g (P = 0.98 bar) is slightly lower than the calculated value (0.452 cm3/g) from the crystal structure. These results further demonstrate the stability of the activated FIR-28-ht framework, showing the rigidity of the host framework. The H2 uptake capacity of 133.0 cm3/g (1.19 wt %) is equivalent to those of previously reported for FIR-7 and FIR-8 (Figure b). \n\nSecond-order NLO was performed to further confirm FIR-28 in the noncentrosymmertric space group F432. The SHG property was measured on the powder sample, using 1064 nm radiation and KDP as a reference. As shown in Figure a, FIR-28 displays a strong SHG efficiency of approximately 1.5 times that of KDP powder at the same particle size (100-200 \u03bcm). By contrast, the SHG intensity for FIR-28 is slightly higher than that of a 5-fold interpenetrating dia network reported by Liu. The phase-matching curve is shown in Figure b. Obviously, the results accord closely with the prediction that the SHG efficiencies increase with increasing sample sizes. Furthermore, FIR-28 can be stable in air, leading to its potential application as a second-order NLO material.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "FIR-28", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "C36H42N6O4"}, "surface area": [{"type": "Langmuir", "probe": "", "value": "1029", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": ""}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "N2", "adsorbed amount": "259.4", "unit": "cm3/g", "temperature": "77 K", "pressure": "1 bar", "condition": ""}, {"adsorbate": "H2", "adsorbed amount": "133.0", "unit": "cm3/g", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": ""}], "pore volume": [{"probe": "", "value": "0.401", "unit": "cm3/g", "condition": "P = 0.98 bar"}], "crystal system": [{"value": "cubic", "condition": ""}], "space group": [{"value": "F432", "condition": ""}], "lattice parameters": [{"value": {"a": "34.7360", "b": "", "c": "", "alpha": "", "beta": "", "gamma": ""}, "condition": "T = 293(2) K"}], "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "280", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "release of solvent guests", "condition": ""}], "etc": [{"property name": "second-harmonic-generation efficiency", "value": "1.5", "unit": "times that of KDP powder", "condition": "particle size 100-200 \u03bcm"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["surface_area", "gas_adsorption", "pore_volume", "crystal_system", "space_group", "lattice_parameters", "decomposition_temperature", "etc"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['surface_area', 'gas_adsorption', 'pore_volume', 'crystal_system', 'space_group', 'lattice_parameters', 'decomposition_temperature', 'etc']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"FIR-28\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"C36H42N6O4\"\n        },\n        \"surface area\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"Langmuir\",\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"1029\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"N2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"259.4\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3/g\",\n                \"temperature\": \"77 K\",\n                \"pressure\": \"1 bar\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"H2\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"133.0\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3/g\",\n                \"temperature\": \"\",\n                \"pressure\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"pore volume\": [\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"0.401\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"P = 0.98 bar\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"crystal system\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"cubic\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"space group\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"F432\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"lattice parameters\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": {\n                    \"a\": \"34.7360\",\n                    \"b\": \"\",\n                    \"c\": \"\",\n                    \"alpha\": \"\",\n                    \"beta\": \"\",\n                    \"gamma\": \"\"\n                },\n                \"condition\": \"T = 293(2) K\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"decomposition temperature\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"280\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n                \"type\": \"release of solvent guests\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"etc\": [\n            {\n                \"property name\": \"second-harmonic-generation efficiency\",\n                \"value\": \"1.5\",\n                \"unit\": \"times that of KDP powder\",\n                \"condition\": \"particle size 100-200 \u03bcm\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 4, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Structure of the H<sub>3</sub>TPA ligand showing a propeller-like\nconformation.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2015-01023m_0002.tif\" xlink:type=\"simple\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Structure of the H3TPA ligand showing a propeller-like conformation.
