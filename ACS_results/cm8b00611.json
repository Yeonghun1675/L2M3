Therefore, positive solvatochromism, e.g., the CHCl3-induced red shift of emission at room temperature, is temporarily ascribed to dipole-dipole interactions between CHCl3(I) molecules and the bpy linker chromophores in view of the nature of intermolecular charge transfer transition. Commonly, the dipole moment value serves as a criterion to evaluate solute-solvent interactions, which is however not singly capable of adequate description of these chloromethane complexes in view of the \u03bc (D) values of CH2Cl2 (1.678) > CHCl3 (1.085) > CCl4 (0) based on DFT simulation (B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ). Fortunately, the well-defined guest positions and conformations provided more information, as the dipole moment vector (\u03bc) of CHCl3 (d) points to the pyridine ring plane associated with the lowest unoccupied MO (LUMO; Figure S7), which may easily relax and solvate the nearest bpy moieties upon excitation which possess a larger excited-state dipole of intermolecular CT characteristics. As a result, the excited state is better stabilized, and a remarkable red-shifted emission appeared. This solvation process of CHCl3 will be further verified in the temperature-controlled emission studies of Ag  10  bpy\u22c5CHCl  3 . In contrast, the CH2Cl2 molecules in Ag  10  bpy\u22c5CH  2  Cl  2  (Figure S23) located at the similar positions with CHCl3 in Ag  10  bpy\u22c5CHCl  3  cannot interact with the excited bpy chromophores, which was ascribed to the fact that the dipole moment vector (\u03bc) of CH2Cl2 is nearly parallel to the pyridine ring (e), which would require a much higher magnitude of rotation to adapt and relax to the generated excited-state dipole of the chromophores. The dramatic rotation may be too difficult to be accommodated within a crystalline complex, so the dipole-dipole interaction in the emissive spectrum of Ag  10  bpy\u22c5CH  2  Cl  2  cannot be clearly observed. Unfortunately, Ag  10  bpy\u22c5CCl  4  crystals of good quality for SCXRD analysis cannot be obtained. Despite the absence of inherent dipole for CCl4, instantaneous dipoles resulting from dispersion interactions can lead to bathochromic band shifts (15 nm less than CHCl3-induced 52 nm) because molecules in their electronic excited states possess higher polarizabilities than those in their ground states. Therefore, tiny differences of dipole moment vectors of the confined chloromethane molecules (CH2Cl2, CHCl3, and CCl4) ultimately led to different interaction degrees with the excited-state host framework and thus distinctly different fluorescence responses.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 18, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<title>Temperature Modulating\nSolvation Dynamics and Emission of <bold>Ag</bold>\n<sub>\n<bold>10</bold>\n</sub>\n<bold>bpy\u00b7CHCl</bold>\n<sub>\n<bold>3</bold>\n</sub>\n</title><p>In this case, the conformation of confined\nsolvents resulted in such distinct luminescence, and their slight\nmotion with temperature may vary the interaction with the host framework\nand tune the emitting luminescence.
