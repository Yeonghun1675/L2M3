It is noted that in some cases the residue obtained after MeCN removal is amorphous. Therefore, it can be assumed that the solvent removal leads to pure amorphous or semicrystalline samples that can recrystallize on further heating, which might explain the low crystallinity of 4. Measurements using differential scanning calorimetry show an exothermic event for some samples after MeCN removal that might correspond to the recrystallization of 4 (Figure S13). Indexing of the powder pattern failed and all attempts to crystallize this compound were unsuccessful, and thus, its structure remains unknown. However, based on simple structural considerations, this compound should consist of dimers, in which each Ni cation is coordinated by one terminal and two bridging thiocyanate anions, as well as three 4-aminopyridine ligands. This is supported by IR measurements of 4, where the CN stretching vibration is observed at 2085 and 2125 cm-1, indicating that terminal and bridging anionic ligands are present (Figure S15).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 27, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>All attempts to obtain single crystals of <bold>5-HT</bold> and <bold>6</bold> at room-temperature failed, but under solvothermal\nconditions crystals of <bold>5-HT</bold> were obtained and characterized\nby single crystal X-ray diffraction, which proves that a new chain\nisomer has formed (see below).

Detailed investigations using solvent mediated conversion experiments and thermoanalytical measurements prove that the 2D compound (5-LT) is thermodynamically stable at lower temperatures up to 112 \u00b0C and that the 1D isomer (5-HT) becomes thermodynamically stable above 135 \u00b0C. On heating, an endothermic transition of 5-LT into 5-HT is observed, which proves that both forms are related by enantiotropism with the chain compound as the HT phase. Interestingly, the HT form was detected in the thermal decomposition reaction of a simple discrete precursor complex, which emphasizes the power of such solid state reactions for the synthesis of metastable phases. On further heating, the 1D compound loses half of the 4-aminopyridine ligands and transforms into a novel chain compound, whose structure was solved ab initio from XRPD data. This compound shows an unusual coordination topology that to the best of our knowledge was never observed before in thiocyanate chemistry. The magnetic properties of 5 and 6 are governed by ferromagnetic exchange interaction along the Ni(NCS) chains. A convenient formula for the susceptibility of the ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain of isotropic spins S = 1 is proposed, based on numerical DMRG calculations, and used to determine the exchange constants. This leads to different J values for the zigzag chain in 5-HT and the linear chain in 5-LT, indicating that the magnetic exchange depends strongly on the geometry of the chains. Much weaker AF interactions between chains produce an antiferromagnetic ground state, observed for 5-LT and 6. Consecutive metamagnetic transitions in 6 are explained, as a result of ordering induced by dipolar interchain interactions. Finally, it is noted that for all three compounds AC magnetic measurements were performed, which as expected show that the AC susceptibility follows the dc low-field susceptibility, with no out of phase component (Figure S40).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 53, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information\nis available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b00092\">10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b00092</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Crystal data and\nrefinement results; SEM image; IR spectra; DTA-TG and DSC curves;\nXRPD pattern (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b00092/suppl_file/ic8b00092_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b00092.
