The fluorescence quantum yield (\u03a6fl) of DPEB crystals is as high as 79%, indicating an efficient light harvest/emission process due to the AIE process. In NUS-1a, where the DPEB molecules are linked by Zn4O SBUs into a staggered 2D sheet structure that is solvent-free and highly porous, the emission maximum remains almost unchanged (486 nm), suggesting a ligand-based emission with little contribution from Zn4O SBUs. The \u03a6fl of NUS-1a is only 15%, which is less than one-quarter of that of the ligand (79%), suggesting that the fluorescence of MOFs with TPE-based ligands containing freely rotating/vibrating phenyl rings (such as DPEB reported herein) can be effectively quenched. Based on the AIE mechanism, the intramolecular motion supported by DSC should be the reason for the quenching. The as-synthesized NUS-1 shows a slightly higher quantum yield (17%) and an emission maximum at 467 nm that is blue-shifted by 19 nm compared with that of the solvent-free NUS-1a, indicating the possibility of increased interligand coupling.
