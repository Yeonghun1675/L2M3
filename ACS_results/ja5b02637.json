After another 15 min, two additional clusters emerged and attached to the crystal along the growth direction [100], leading to remarkable increases in height in those areas (marked with two solid line circles). Continued growth of the two clusters enlarged the crystalline part along the needle, finally joining them together to make a crystal displaying a \"bamboo-like\" morphology (60 min). According to  and Figure a, the needle crystals belong to the bulk phase of [Ni(qt)2]. A noteworthy variation occurred during this process at the junction of the two needle crystals (marked with dash line circles), where a cluster detached from the crystal (45 min image), and after 15 min another cluster reattached to this position (60 min image), suggesting high activity of the clusters at this stage. To track the crystal growth concretely, we inspected the height changes by scanning across the two needle crystals along a line l 1-2. The heights of the corresponding peaks, labeled as d 1 and d 2 in Figure b, show a progressive increase with time, with d 2 increasing much more than d 1 due to the attachment of the two clusters on the right crystal. Accompanied by crystal growth in all three dimensions, some of the surrounding NPs vanished, and the substrate became exposed around the crystals, consistent with the OM results. The scale of the exposed substrate broadened from ~100 nm to >1 \u03bcm as time elapsed (marked with dashed-line rectangle in Figure b). These distances are far too great to be explained by mass transport by molecular diffusion in such a solvent-free system. However, direct NP migration can explain the transport of material across the gap in NPs to the crystal. After migration and attachment of the NPs to the crystal, the length and width of the crystal increased, and finally the gaps between adjacent clusters were filled. We believe this process occurs by the conventional mechanism of dissolution and growth of monomer molecules. Thus, the crystal growth mechanism involves both oriented attachment of the activated NPs and Ostwald ripening.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 15, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig5\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>5</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Topographic\nAFM images show the evolution of the shape and\ndimensions of the crystals, indicating a crystal growth mechanism\ninvolving migration and re-oriented attachment of NPs to the crystal\nas well as Ostwald ripening.
