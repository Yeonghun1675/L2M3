These studies reveal that three major products M' x (OH) y , Na x (ZnHtOCPP) y , and M' x Na y (ZnHtOCPP) z  exist in equilibrium after addition of NaOH. Two different frameworks with {NaPr(COO)4} n  chains and heterometallic tetra-nuclear {PrNa3(H2O)6(COO)9}3- are formed in 1 and 2, respectively, by controlling the H+/OH- ratio in the reaction mixture.

Framework 3 is stabilized by the heterometallic trinuclear {In2Na(H2O)(\u03bc3-H2O) (COO)6(HCOO)} interaction synthons. Similar reactions with Mn3+ and Fe3+ ions yielded frameworks 5 and 6 tessellated by homometallic oxo-centered trinuclear clusters of the cationic species.
