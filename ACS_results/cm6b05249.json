In the high-temperature R3\u0305c phase, the MHy+ cations are dynamically disordered, i.e, similarly to [(CH3)2NH2][M(HCOO)3] multiferroics, the MHy+ ions rotate around the 3-fold axis. However, there are additional, thermally activated rotations along the 2-fold axis. Below 310-327 K, rotations along the 2-fold axis are hindered leading to the polar arrangement of MHy+ ions, which gives resultant nonzero spontaneous polarization in the c-direction. Pyroelectric current measurements confirm the ferroelectric nature of the room-temperature phase.
