To elucidate the isosteric heat (Q st) for CO2 adsorption in CoMOF-2', the Clausius-Clapeyron equation was used from their corresponding experimental isotherm at 273 and 298 K. The isosteric heat (Q st) for CO2 reaches ~35.0 kJ mol-1, indicating amide functional groups of L may be involved in strong interactions with the adsorbed CO2 molecules (Figure S8). In addition, the microscopic mechanism revealed that CO2 molecules are interacting with the carbonyl group of L, with mean characteristic O(CO2)-Ocarbonyl distances in the range of 2.8-3.5 \u00c5 (Figure S9) backing the adsorption of CO2 inside the pore (b and Figure S10).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 24, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Catalytic Performance of <bold>CoMOF-2</bold> in Cycloaddition\nof Spiro-Epoxy Oxindoles with CO<sub>2</sub>\n</title><p>The good chemical\nand thermal stability, strong CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption, functionally\ndecorated <bold>L</bold>, and the presence of high-density metal sites\nare features required for an excellent catalytic material for CO<sub>2</sub>\u2013epoxide cycloaddition.
