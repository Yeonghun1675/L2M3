For instance, denaturation of GFP resulted in a decrease of PL response by four-orders of magnitude. Therefore, activation of these modes leads to fast nonradiative decay of the excited state, which is restricted by chromophore-\u03b2-barrel interactions. To study the effect of the developed rigid scaffold on the chromophore dynamics, solid-state quadrupolar spin-echo 2H NMR and 13C CP-MAS NMR spectroscopic techniques coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed. For 2H NMR investigations, we attempted to introduce a deuterated tag, -CD3, into the prepared scaffolds through (i) the PSM of 1 by analogy with nondeuterated 2-PSM (Schemes  and ) and (ii) preparation of deuterated linker, H2BDC-HBI-d 3, following solvothermal synthesis. In both cases, methyl-2-((1-ethoxyethylidene)amino)acetate-d 3 prepared directly from deuterated acetonitrile was used as a source for the -CD3 group (). To implement the solvothermal approach, we synthesized H2BDC-HBI-d 3. However, because of proton exchange during framework solvothermal synthesis, there was no signal corresponding to the deuterated ligand.

To estimate the activation barrier (E a), we modeled the potential energy surfaces (PESs) of unbound versus restricted H2BDC-HBI.
