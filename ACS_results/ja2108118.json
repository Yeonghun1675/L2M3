Another key result is that while an observable amount (<5%) of Friedel-Crafts product 10 was detected when nitroalkene 9 was used with 5, no Friedel-Crafts products were observed when pyrrole 8 was used, suggesting that large substrates, especially pyrroles, cannot enter the porous network. To investigate further the size selectivity of NU-601, we performed a competition reaction by combining 6 and the larger conjugate acceptor 9 (1 equiv each) with 5 under the standard urea MOF conditions using 5 mol % NU-601. While both products 7 and 10 were possible, especially in a homogeneous approach, we were pleased to only observe 7, albeit in a diminished yield (see the ).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 16, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Size-Exclusion\nCatalysis Experiments (Reactions Performed with 5\nmol % <bold>NU-601</bold> for 48 h)</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ja-2011-108118_0006.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 2  Size-Exclusion Catalysis Experiments (Reactions Performed with 5 mol % NU-601 for 48 h)   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 17, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>In summary, a novel urea-containing MOF was\nsynthesized from a\ntetracarboxylate strut (<bold>1</bold>), 4,4\u2032-bipyridine, and\nZn\u00ad(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\u00b76H<sub>2</sub>O.
