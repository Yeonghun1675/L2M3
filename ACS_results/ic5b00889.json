The temperature dependence of the \u03c7T product for compounds 1-4 is shown in Figure . The room temperature values, 0.42, 8.8, 12.5, and 14.7 cm3 K mol-1 for 1-4, respectively, correspond well to those expected (i) for an S = 1/2 system [\u03c7T = 0.42 cm3 K mol-1 with g = 2.12(5)] in the case of 1 or for heterometallic units with noninteracting magnetic centers: (ii) two RuIII (S = 1/2, C = 0.42 cm3 K mol-1) and one GdIII (S = 7/2, C = 7.875 cm3 K mol-1) metal ions in 2 (\u03c7T = 8.715 cm3 K mol-1); (iii) two RuIII and one TbIII (S = 3, L = 3, g = 3/2, C = 11.8125 cm3 K mol-1) metal ions in 3 (\u03c7T = 12.65 cm3 K mol-1) and two RuIII and one DyIII (S = 5/2, L = 5, g = 4/3, C = 14.17 cm3 K mol-1) metal ions in 4 (\u03c7T = 15.01 cm3 K mol-1). For 1, the \u03c7T product remains quasi-constant down to 20 K, and then it decreases, reaching 0.37 cm3 K mol-1 at 1.8 K. This thermal behavior can be due to either a small magnetic anisotropy of the RuIII metal ion or weak antiferromagnetic interactions between the RuIII ions (a Curie-Weiss fit gives a \u03b8 value of -0.27 K and thus zJ/k B = -0.54 K) or to a combination of these two factors. The magnetization (M) versus field (H) data (Figures S1 and S2 in the ) follow the expected Brillouin function for an S = 1/2 spin with g = 2.16(5) in good agreement with the \u03c7T versus T measurements. This result, the saturation of the magnetization (1.09 \u03bcB at 1.8 K and 7 T), and the superposition of the M versus H/T data (Figure S2 in the ) suggest the absence of significant magnetic anisotropy for the ruthenium(III) precursor. For 2, the decrease of the \u03c7T product when the temperature is lowered indicates the occurrence of a weak antiferromagnetic interaction (J) between RuIII and GdIII ions across the cyanido bridge. For this system, the theoretical magnetic susceptibility in the weak-field approximation can be easily calculated (see the ) from the following Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian: H = -2J(S Ru1\u22c5S Gd + S Gd\u22c5S Ru2). This simple model is able to fit the experimental data almost perfectly down to 1.8 K with J/k B = -0.24(5) K and g = 2.02(5).
