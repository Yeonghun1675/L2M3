Eu(1) is nine-coordinate (Eu(1)O9), while Eu(2) and Eu(3) are similar eight-coordinate (Eu(2)O6N2 and Eu(3)O6N2). Eu(1) is coordinated by six O atoms from three \u03bc5-bidc ligands, one O atom from a \u03bc4-bidc ligand, and two O atoms from chelating nitrate. The Eu(2) is coordinated by five O atoms from three \u03bc5-bidc ligands, one O atom from a \u03bc4-bidc ligand, and two N atoms from chelating phen, while Eu(3) is coordinated by three O atoms from two \u03bc5-bidc ligands, three O atoms from a \u03bc4-bidc ligand, and two N atoms from phen. Eu(1)O9, Eu(2)O6N2, and Eu(3)O6N2 form a trinuclear cluster. As building blocks, the trinuclear clusters are further assembled into 1D chain structure through the COO groups along the c axis, where Eu-O-C-O-Eu double-stranded helices are found (Figure b). The distances of Eu1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Eu2 and Eu1\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Eu3 ions are 4.168(2) and 4.214(2) \u00c5, respectively. The angle of Eu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Eu\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Eu is 127.42\u00b0. The pitch of the helix is calculated to be 12.502 \u00c5. The adjacent helical chains form a 3D network by hydrogen bonds and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions (Figure S2 and Table S5, ). The structure of 2 is different from Ln-H2bidc complexes reported in literature and is the first example of a 1D chiral chain based on H2bidc ligand in conjunction with phen ligand. Also, the examples of lanthanide coordination polymers based on polynuclear clusters are limited.

The TGA\nof <bold>2</bold> shows that lattice water molecules can be removed\nat around 166 \u00b0C (the observed weight loss of 2.08%, calcd 2.29%),\nand the complex was stable up to around 410 \u00b0C.

And final product of <bold>2</bold> was Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (the observed weight loss of 68.44%,\ncalcd 69.50%). The PXRD data were collected with a scan speed of 2\u00b0\u00b7min<sup>\u20131</sup>. The PXRD pattern at 100 \u00b0C is very similar\nto the room-temperature one (25 \u00b0C), while the patterns at 200,\n300, and 400 \u00b0C are very similar (Figure ). The slight difference between PXRD patterns at 200 and 100 \u00b0C\nat small angle is due to the removal of uncoordinated water molecules.\nSome diffraction peaks for the dehydrated sample shift to larger 2\u03b8\nvalue because of lattice contraction, and small changes in intensity\noccur accordingly. However, the PXRD pattern at 500 \u00b0C is clearly\ndifferent. So, the PXRD patterns indicate that after the removal of\nfree water molecules, the 1D structure remains unchanged. The TGA\nand PXRD data show that the structural skeleton remains stable up\nto 400 \u00b0C, indicating the high stability of the dehydrated complex.\nAnd the dehydrated Eu(III)/Tb(III) complexes still show their characteristic\nluminescence (Figure S6, ). To the best of our knowledge, LnCPs with thermal stability higher\nthan 400 \u00b0C were rarely reported.

Under UV excitation at 365 nm for H2bidc and 378 nm for phen, the pure ligands present a blue emission with the bands at 430 nm for H2bidc and 438 nm for phen (Figure S3, ). The excitation and emission spectra of 1 display similar spectra to those of the ligands (Figure a); no f-f transition emission of the Gd(III) ion was observed because its lowest-lying emitting level is located at 32150 cm-1  (corresponding to the 6P7/2 \u2192 8S7/2 transition) and energy transfer from the ligand to 6P7/2 excited state of Gd(III) cation cannot occur. Under excitation at 376 nm, complex 1 presents a blue emission with the band centered at 440 nm, which comes from the \u03c0*-\u03c0 transition of the ligands (Figure a, right). The excitation spectra of 2 and 3 were recorded by monitoring at 613 nm for 2 and 544 nm for 3, and the spectra display broad bands centered at 350 nm, which can be attributed to intraligand charge change (ILCT) of the ligands and the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) for 2  (Figure b, left) and ILCT for 3 (Figure c, left). But the sharp excitation peak at 395 nm (Figure b, left) is assigned as the 7F0 \u2192 5L6 transition of Eu(III) ion. The emission spectra of complexes 2 and 3 were studied under excitation at 350 nm. Complex 2 displays narrow and characteristic luminescence due to 5D0 \u2192 7F J  (J = 0-4) transitions of Eu(III) ion (Figure b, right). The most intense emission at 613 nm is attributed to the 5D0 \u2192 7F2 (electric-dipole) transition, which is hypersensitive to the coordination environment of the Eu(III) ion and implies a red emission light. The medium-strong emission band at 590 nm corresponds to the 5D0 \u2192 7F1 (magnetic-dipole) transition, which is fairly insensitive to the environment of the Eu(III) ion. The intensity ratio of 14.7 for I(5D0\u21927F2)/I(5D0\u21927F1) indicates a low symmetry of the Eu(III) site in 2. Complex 3 shows emission bands at 488, 544, 584, and 619 nm, which correspond to the characteristic 5D4 \u2192 7F J  (J = 6-3) transitions of the Tb(III) ion (Figure c, right). The most intense emission at 544 nm corresponds to the 5D4 \u2192 7F5 transition of the Tb(III) ion. The ligand-centered emission bands at about 430 and 438 nm disappeared in the emission spectra of 2 and 3, indicating the efficient ligand-to-Ln(III) ion energy transfer in 2 and 3. The lifetime of luminescence for 1 was measured from the decay profile by fitting with biexponential decay curve with \u03c41 = 1.09 \u00b1 0.02 \u03bcs and \u03c42 = 16.01 \u00b1 0.26 \u03bcs (Figure S4a, ). The luminescent lifetimes of 2 and 3 are 0.86 and 0.32 ms, respectively (Figure S4b,c, ). The luminescent lifetime of 1 is shorter than that of 2 and 3 because 1 is the ligand-based emission. The quantum yields of luminescence for 2 and 3 are 13.20% and 2.08%, respectively. The luminescence lifetimes and quantum yields of 2 and 3 are relatively shorter and lower because the complexes 2 and 3 contain high energy C-H, N-H, and O-H oscillators, which significantly quenche the Eu(III) and Tb(III) emitting states, but are comparable to the reported ones of the LnOFs. \n\nThermogravimetry (TGA) and Temperature-Dependent Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD)\n\nTGA and PXRD techniques were used to investigate the thermal stability of the chain structure. Complexes 1-3 exhibit similar thermal behavior (Figure  and Figure S5, ); herein only 2 will be discussed in detail. The TGA of 2 shows that lattice water molecules can be removed at around 166 \u00b0C (the observed weight loss of 2.08%, calcd 2.29%), and the complex was stable up to around 410 \u00b0C. Above 410 \u00b0C, the TG curve exhibits second step of weight loss, which indicates decomposition of the organic ligands. And final product of 2 was Eu2O3 (the observed weight loss of 68.44%, calcd 69.50%). The PXRD data were collected with a scan speed of 2\u00b0\u22c5min-1. The PXRD pattern at 100 \u00b0C is very similar to the room-temperature one (25 \u00b0C), while the patterns at 200, 300, and 400 \u00b0C are very similar (Figure ). The slight difference between PXRD patterns at 200 and 100 \u00b0C at small angle is due to the removal of uncoordinated water molecules. Some diffraction peaks for the dehydrated sample shift to larger 2\u03b8 value because of lattice contraction, and small changes in intensity occur accordingly. However, the PXRD pattern at 500 \u00b0C is clearly different. So, the PXRD patterns indicate that after the removal of free water molecules, the 1D structure remains unchanged. The TGA and PXRD data show that the structural skeleton remains stable up to 400 \u00b0C, indicating the high stability of the dehydrated complex. And the dehydrated Eu(III)/Tb(III) complexes still show their characteristic luminescence (Figure S6, ). To the best of our knowledge, LnCPs with thermal stability higher than 400 \u00b0C were rarely reported. The title complexes are highly thermostable lanthanide coordination polymers.\n\nReferences\n\nCrystal data for 1: C60H37Gd3N13O21, M r = 1747.78, orthorhombic, space group P212121, a = 10.957(4) \u00c5, b = 21.610(2) \u00c5, c = 24.121(3) \u00c5, V = 5711.8(10) \u00c5-3, Z = 4, D c = 2.032 g\u22c5cm-3, \u03bc = 3.540 mm-1, F(000) = 3392, R 1 = 0.0842, wR 2 = 0.2265.
