As shown in Figure , the proton conductivity depends on the water amount inside the pore of the MOF. Proton conductivity of 1 up to the penta-hydrate state is low. Thereafter, addition of water molecules enhances its conductivity significantly suggesting that the water molecules in the channel play important role in the proton conduction probably due to the formation of hydrogen bond networks. The results suggest that small amount of protons are coordinated by water and the emerged oxonium ion acts as proton carrier. According to the literature, possibly Gro\u0308tthuss type of conduction takes place here with the participation of water molecules and the aligned imidazolium groups. However, this compound does not give high proton conductivity compared to the Zn(II) coordination polymer.
