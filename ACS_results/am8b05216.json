Accordingly, pure-component acetylene, carbon\ndioxide, and methane isotherms were measured systematically at pressures\nup to 1.05 atm (106.6 kPa, 800 mm Hg) and three distinct temperatures\n(namely, 298, 288, and 278 K). As depicted in , no hysteresis was observed for any isotherm,\nsuggesting the completely reversible adsorption\u2013desorption\nprocess. At 1.05 atm, the acetylene and carbon dioxide uptakes of <bold>ZJNU-58</bold> are 157.1 and 81.6 cm<sup>3</sup> (STP) g<sup>\u20131</sup> at 298 K, 191.7 and 103.1 cm<sup>3</sup> (STP) g<sup>\u20131</sup> at 288 K, and 228.5 and 129.5 cm<sup>3</sup> (STP) g<sup>\u20131</sup> at 278 K, whereas the acetylene and carbon dioxide uptakes of <bold>ZJNU-59</bold> are 199.5 and 109.4 cm<sup>3</sup> (STP) g<sup>\u20131</sup> at 298 K, 224.7 and 140.6 cm<sup>3</sup> (STP) g<sup>\u20131</sup> at 288 K, and 248.1 and 178.3 cm<sup>3</sup> (STP) g<sup>\u20131</sup> at 278 K, respectively. The acetylene uptake of <bold>ZJNU-59</bold> at ambient conditions exceeds those of some other porous materials and is only surpassed by those of several top-performing MOFs such\nas MFM-188 (232 cm<sup>3</sup> (STP) g<sup>\u20131</sup>), FJI-H8 (224 cm<sup>3</sup> (STP) g<sup>\u20131</sup>), NJU-Bai17 (222.4 cm<sup>3</sup> (STP)\ng<sup>\u20131</sup>), and ZJNU-47 (213\ncm<sup>3</sup> (STP) g<sup>\u20131</sup>). On the basis of the gravimetric acetylene uptake and the framework\ndensity, the acetylene storage density in the bulk material <bold>ZJNU-59</bold> is calculated to be 0.185 g cm<sup>\u20133</sup> at 298 K and 1.05 atm, which is equivalent to the one at a hypothetical\ncondition of 298 K and 17.6 MPa. The hypothetical pressure of 17.6\nMPa is 88 times larger than an upper limiting pressure (0.2 MPa) for\nstoring acetylene safely at room temperature. The carbon dioxide uptake\nof <bold>ZJNU-59</bold> at ambient conditions is comparable to and\neven exceeds the performance of some NbO-type MOFs explored for carbon\ndioxide capture, such as ZJNU-40 (108 cm<sup>3</sup> (STP) g<sup>\u20131</sup>), NJU-Bai14 (100 cm<sup>3</sup> (STP)\ng<sup>\u20131</sup>), NOTT-125 (92.59\ncm<sup>3</sup> (STP) g<sup>\u20131</sup>), and SNU-50 (80 cm<sup>3</sup> (STP) g<sup>\u20131</sup>). Notably, despite its lower pore volume and surface\narea, <bold>ZJNU-59</bold> displays larger acetylene and carbon dioxide\nuptakes than its isomer <bold>ZJNU-58</bold>. Specifically, acetylene\nand carbon dioxide uptakes of <bold>ZJNU-59</bold> at 298 K and 1.05\natm are 27 and 34% higher than those of its isomer <bold>ZJNU-58</bold>, respectively. The result indicates a crucial role that the pore\nsize effect plays in acetylene and carbon dioxide adsorption, considering\nthat these two ligand-originated MOF isomers have the same chemical\ncomposition and gravimetric density of open copper sites (3.13 mmol\ng<sup>\u20131</sup>). As determined by the N<sub>2</sub> adsorption\nisotherms (b), <bold>ZJNU-59</bold> exhibits a pore width distribution at 5.4\u20138.6\n\u00c5, which is smaller than the corresponding value of 8.6\u201310.9\n\u00c5 for <bold>ZJNU-58</bold>. As a result, the narrower pore size\nin <bold>ZJNU-59</bold> creates a higher van der Waals potential overlap\nand thus strengthens the interaction between gas molecules and the\nframework, offsetting the negative impact of the reduction of pore\nvolume and surface area on gas adsorption. The enhanced gas\u2013framework\ninteractions have also been evidenced by the isosteric heat of gas\nadsorption (<italic>Q</italic>\n<sub>st</sub>), which was extracted\nusing the Clausius\u2013Clapeyron equation from temperature-dependent\nisotherms. <bold>ZJNU-58</bold> and <bold>ZJNU-59</bold> have comparable <italic>Q</italic>\n<sub>st</sub> values at the low coverage for carbon dioxide\nand acetylene adsorption.

In terms of the BET surface area, ZJNU-58 surpasses or is comparable to some previously reported NbO-type MOFs such as UTSA-40 (1630 m2 g-1), QI-Cu (1631 m2 g-1), ZJNU-40 (2209 m2 g-1), and NOTT-101 (2316 m2 g-1).

Accordingly, pure-component acetylene, carbon dioxide, and methane isotherms were measured systematically at pressures up to 1.05 atm (106.6 kPa, 800 mm Hg) and three distinct temperatures (namely, 298, 288, and 278 K). As depicted in , no hysteresis was observed for any isotherm, suggesting the completely reversible adsorption-desorption process. At 1.05 atm, the acetylene and carbon dioxide uptakes of ZJNU-58 are 157.1 and 81.6 cm3 (STP) g-1 at 298 K, 191.7 and 103.1 cm3 (STP) g-1 at 288 K, and 228.5 and 129.5 cm3 (STP) g-1 at 278 K, whereas the acetylene and carbon dioxide uptakes of ZJNU-59 are 199.5 and 109.4 cm3 (STP) g-1 at 298 K, 224.7 and 140.6 cm3 (STP) g-1 at 288 K, and 248.1 and 178.3 cm3 (STP) g-1 at 278 K, respectively. The acetylene uptake of ZJNU-59 at ambient conditions exceeds those of some other porous materials and is only surpassed by those of several top-performing MOFs such as MFM-188 (232 cm3 (STP) g-1), FJI-H8 (224 cm3 (STP) g-1), NJU-Bai17 (222.4 cm3 (STP) g-1), and ZJNU-47 (213 cm3 (STP) g-1). On the basis of the gravimetric acetylene uptake and the framework density, the acetylene storage density in the bulk material ZJNU-59 is calculated to be 0.185 g cm-3 at 298 K and 1.05 atm, which is equivalent to the one at a hypothetical condition of 298 K and 17.6 MPa. The hypothetical pressure of 17.6 MPa is 88 times larger than an upper limiting pressure (0.2 MPa) for storing acetylene safely at room temperature. The carbon dioxide uptake of ZJNU-59 at ambient conditions is comparable to and even exceeds the performance of some NbO-type MOFs explored for carbon dioxide capture, such as ZJNU-40 (108 cm3 (STP) g-1), NJU-Bai14 (100 cm3 (STP) g-1), NOTT-125 (92.59 cm3 (STP) g-1), and SNU-50 (80 cm3 (STP) g-1). Notably, despite its lower pore volume and surface area, ZJNU-59 displays larger acetylene and carbon dioxide uptakes than its isomer ZJNU-58. Specifically, acetylene and carbon dioxide uptakes of ZJNU-59 at 298 K and 1.05 atm are 27 and 34% higher than those of its isomer ZJNU-58, respectively. The result indicates a crucial role that the pore size effect plays in acetylene and carbon dioxide adsorption, considering that these two ligand-originated MOF isomers have the same chemical composition and gravimetric density of open copper sites (3.13 mmol g-1). As determined by the N2 adsorption isotherms (b), ZJNU-59 exhibits a pore width distribution at 5.4-8.6 \u00c5, which is smaller than the corresponding value of 8.6-10.9 \u00c5 for ZJNU-58. As a result, the narrower pore size in ZJNU-59 creates a higher van der Waals potential overlap and thus strengthens the interaction between gas molecules and the framework, offsetting the negative impact of the reduction of pore volume and surface area on gas adsorption. The enhanced gas-framework interactions have also been evidenced by the isosteric heat of gas adsorption (Q st), which was extracted using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation from temperature-dependent isotherms. ZJNU-58 and ZJNU-59 have comparable Q st values at the low coverage for carbon dioxide and acetylene adsorption. However, with the increasing gas loadings, the Q st values for carbon dioxide and acetylene adsorption in ZJNU-59 significantly exceed the corresponding ones in ZJNU-58 (Figure S6).", "data":
