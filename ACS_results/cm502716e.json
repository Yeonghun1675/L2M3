Li-HPAA starts to lose water at a lower temperature than the others, attributed mainly to its 1D architecture. During the first stage, from room temperature to 100 \u00b0C, a weight loss of 14.70% is observed, which fits well with the removal of two water molecules (calculated 13.65%). From these, one originates from the weakly retained lattice water and the other one, most likely, from a rearrangement of the coordination spheres of Li+ ions. Three additional water molecules (measured overall loss 34.13%, calculated 31.72%) are lost in the second stage, up to T = 240 \u00b0C. A further temperature increase leads to decomposition of the material, which is complete above 700 \u00b0C (not shown). K-HPAA loses its four coordinating water molecules by heating from ~80 to 180 \u00b0C (measured loss 13.72%, calculated 13.43%), while decomposition starts at ~240 \u00b0C. Na-HPAA retains its water content even more tightly, starting to lose weight at ~90 \u00b0C. This behavior is associated with the stronger interaction of water in the pillared framework, as suggested by the FT-IR spectrum (see previous discussion). The removal of the four coordinating water molecules in Na-HPAA is extended up to 200 \u00b0C (measured loss 26.13%, calculated 26.48%), while further decomposition of the material starts at T > 270 \u00b0C.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']"}}, {"idx": 57, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>As revealed by\nthermodiffraction ( Figure S-6), the loss of structural water upon heating implies a progressive\namorphization of the <bold>M-HPAA</bold> (M = Li, Na, and K) solids.\nOnly <bold>Li-HPAA</bold> showed a transient new semicrystalline phase,\nformed at 100 \u00b0C.
