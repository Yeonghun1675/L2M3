FTIR data (2% KBr pellet): 3450 (br, s), 2932 (br, m), 1699 (m), 1630 (sh), 1610 (s), 1573 (m), 1482 (s), 1445 (s), 1383 (w), 1367 (m), 1302 (m), 1288 (m), 1248 (m), 1210 (m), 1183 (m), 1159 (m), 1127 (w), 1090 (m), 1067 (w), 1053 (m), 1030 (m), 993 (m), 959 (m), 910 (s), 840 (s), 768 (s), 732 (w), 654 (m), 557 (s), 507 (w), 483 (m), 422 (m).

The exchange process was complete in 1 day as judged by IR spectroscopy, and blue crystals of 1-ReO4 were harvested by filtration and washed with MeOH (5 \u00d7 10 mL) (10.3 mg, yield 91%).
