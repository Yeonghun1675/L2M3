This behavior can be attributed to the lower basicity of the s-heptazine-based ligand (rht-MOF-9) compared to the s-triazine-based ligand (rht-MOF-7) as inferred from the Q st (32 KJ mol-1 vs. 45 KJ mol-1, respectively). Interestingly, at relatively low partial pressures [0.1 bar (76 Torr) akin to postcombustion capture], the CO2 uptake for rht-MOF-9 showed higher volumetric and gravimetric uptake (18.2 cm3 STP/cm3, 1.1 mmol g-1) than rht-MOF-1 (5 cm3 STP/cm3, 0.32 mmol g-1) and rht-MOF-7 (14.7 cm3 STP/cm3, 0.83 mmol g-1). At 1 bar, the total CO2 uptake was also drastically improved, and rht-MOF-9 exhibits one of the highest gravimetric and volumetric uptakes reported for rht-MOFs. This observed enhancement in CO2 uptake, combined with a noticeable reduction in the Qst at low loading when compared to rht-MOF-7, can be translated into an enhancement in the energy/efficiency trade-off for gas separation applications. It should be noted that reduced CO2 Q st (at low loading) compared to rht-MOF-7 and the low degree of energy uniformity (see Figure S7 of the ) will not necessarily induce an improvement in the affinity and CO2 selectivity over other gases such as CH4 and N2. In this case, further studies are sought in our group to explore the CO2 separation properties of rht-MOF-9.
