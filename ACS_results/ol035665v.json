The shortest and longest non-hydrogen atomic distances across the channel are about 4.81 and 9.27 \u00c5, respectively (Figure b). These cavities and channels should be involved in the solvent diffusion phenomenon observed in the time-dependent NMR study described earlier. Applications of the 3D polymer 6 in selective trapping of organic molecules and inorganic ions and serving as a polymer assembly for catalytic organic reactions are in progress in our laboratory.
