A distinct feature of the SBU in 1 is the two coordination environments around the central Zn atoms; three Zn centers adopt tetrahedral geometries, and the other Zn atom possesses an octahedral geometry. The Zn center with octahedral geometry is additionally bound by two DMF molecules in the cis mode. To assess the framework structure, the organic linker of L2- is represented by a stick and the Zn4O cluster is represented by a joint. One framework extracted from the entire structure corresponds to a six-connected uninodal bsn net with a point symbol {48.54.63} (Figure S2, ). The nets are mutually entangled to generate the 3-fold interpenetration (full interpenetration vectors, Class Ia; Figures b,c). The side view of the nets shows that a parallelogram shaped ladder is present in the front face, while the other type of ladder is located in the back face (Figure d). These ladders are linked together via the organic linker to form the bsn topology (Figure S3, ). This 3D structure can be compared with a Zn(II) complex bridged by L2- in which the bridging ligand acts as bis(bridging bidentate) syn-anti modes to construct a 2D coordination sheet with ZnO4 SBU, clearly different from that of 1. Other frameworks using L2- and its analogue were demonstrated, and they include Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, and lanthanides as metal nodes.

Preliminary orientation matrix and cell parameters were determined from three sets of \u03c9/\u03d5 scans at different starting angles. Data frames were obtained at scan intervals of 0.5\u00b0 with an exposure time of 30 s per frame. The reflection data were corrected for Lorentz and polarization factors. Absorption corrections were carried out using SADABS. The structure of 1 was solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares analysis using anisotropic thermal parameters for non-hydrogen atoms with the SHELXTL program. Some carbon atoms (C46, C47, and C53) were disordered over two sites with occupancy of 0.5 and were isotropically refined. All hydrogen atoms except for hydrogens bound to the disordered atoms were calculated at idealized positions and refined with the riding models.

An abrupt loss is evident above 355 \u00b0C, indicating the thermal decomposition of the framework. To check the structural flexibility, the as-synthesized sample of 1 was soaked in MeOH for 3 days at room temperature. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of the MeOH-exchanged phase (1a) is different from that of the as-synthesized phase, suggesting the formation of a new phase in which the C\ue5fbO stretching vibration at 1657 cm-1, characteristic of a DMF molecule, was absent (Figure  and Figure S5, ). The original phase (1) was regenerated by immersing 1a in DMF for 3 days, which was confirmed by PXRD. The presence of DMF in the resolvated phase of 1 was identified by the advent of the C\ue5fbO peak in the Nujol infrared (IR) spectrum. Further, evacuation of 1a at 200 \u00b0C for 2 h afforded the activated sample of 1b. The TG curve of 1b corroborated the absence of DMF molecules, which was also supported by IR spectroscopy (Figures S5 and S6, ). Meanwhile, the activated phase was obtained via another route; 1 was heated under vacuum at 200 \u00b0C for 2 h to produce 1b. Phase 1b was immersed in DMF for 3 days, and the resolvated phase (1) was eventually obtained, as confirmed by PXRD and IR spectroscopy. These observations indicate that the extensive phase transformations occurring among the as-synthesized, MeOH-exchanged, and activated forms arise reversibly via two pathways: solvent exchange/resolvation and activation/resolvation. It is worth noting that the framework 1 is truly flexible and reversible upon external inputs, which could be considered as a unique intrinsic feature of the interpenetrating nets with dynamic spaces.
