AFM investigations of L1 growth as well as of silver-coordinated L1 (Ag-L1) on an HOPG surface reveal formation of ultrathin films of Ag-L1 on the HOPG surface, with abundant one-dimensional coordination polymer patterns. We propose that multivalent Ag coordination directly to ligand framework, which is an electron-rich system, will be helpful in tuning electron/hole injection bands in adenine-based CPs, as is also evident from the theoretical calculations.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 27, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information\nis available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b03090\">10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b03090</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>AFM sample preparation,\nsynthesis and crystal structure analysis of <bold>L1</bold>, synthesis\nand crystal structure analysis of silver complex of <bold>L1</bold> (Ag-<bold>L1</bold>), comparison of adlayer pattern of <bold>L1</bold> on surface with bulk packing, AFM images of Ag-<bold>L1</bold> at\n0.15 and 0.37 ML coverage, AFM images of Ag-<bold>L1</bold> with a\nmetal salt to <bold>L1</bold> volume ratio of 10/1, and configuration\nof <bold>L1</bold>, Ag-<bold>L1<italic>a</italic>\n</bold> and Ag-<bold>L1<italic>c</italic>\n</bold> used in the calculations (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b03090/suppl_file/ic6b03090_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Crystallographic\ndata (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b03090/suppl_file/ic6b03090_si_002.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b03090.
