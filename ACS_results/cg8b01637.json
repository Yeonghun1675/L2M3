Once again, the resulting a-axis lengths of PCN-606-OH-TPDC and PCN-606-OMe-TPDC naturally are very close. The greater a-axis expansion for the incorporation of the more demanding TPDC linker likely requires a higher energy input in the form of an elevated installation temperature (120 \u00b0C as opposed to 80 \u00b0C) to help overcome a thermodynamic barrier to formation. As the a-axis expands, the b-axis and c-axis can interestingly be seen slightly shrinking to compensate. Explicitly, when Me2TPDC extends the a-axis of PCN-606-OH by 4.3 \u00c5 (22.9%), the b-axis reduces by 1.3 \u00c5 (3.6%) and the c-axis reduces by 1.0 \u00c5 (6.2%). When the same ligand is inserted into PCN-606-OMe with an a-axis extension of 3.5 \u00c5 (17.7%), the b-axis shrinks by 1.1 \u00c5 (3.1%) and the c-axis shrinks by 0.9 \u00c5 (5.4%). The addition of the smaller ligand, H2EDDB, into PCN-606-OH produces a growth in the a-axis by 2.7 \u00c5 (14.4%) accompanied by b-axis and c-axis reductions by 0.7 \u00c5 (2.0%) and 0.6 \u00c5 (3.7%), respectively. Lastly, insertion of H2EDDB into PCN-606-OMe increases the a-axis by 1.8 \u00c5 (9.1%) while concurrently decreasing the b-axis and c-axis by 0.4 \u00c5 (1.2%) and 0.5 \u00c5 (3.2%), respectively. In all cases, the a-axes shows a larger percentage increase than the sum of the b- and c-axes decrease suggesting an overall increase in size, which will be mentioned later in terms of volume (these percent changes are displayed together for comparison in c). Additionally, the changes in axes lengths are more dramatic in the case of PCN-606-OH-R' than for PCN-606-OMe-R' (where R' = EDDB or TPDC). It is probable that the steric effects in the methoxy- derivative somewhat impede structural ligand distortion in the framework, leading to smaller changes in axis lengths. For comparison, it was previously reported that the a-axis of PCN-606-OH would shrink by about 22.3% and the a-axis of PCN-606-OMe would shrink by about 14.0% upon desolvation. Admittedly, the smaller magnitude of axial changes is also certainly aided by the fact that PCN-606-OMe's axes lengths were already closer to those of the linker-inserted PCN-606-OMe-R'.
