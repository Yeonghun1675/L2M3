The crystal structure and magnetic studies demonstrate that it is a single-chain magnet and the blocking temperature is ca. 6 K. \n\nMagnetic measurements were performed on a sample of very thin, needlelike crystals of random directions in the temperature range of 1.8-300 K. The magnetic susceptibility data of 2 per CuFe2 unit (Figure S1) can be fitted by a Curie-Weiss law \u03c7 M = C/(T - \u03b8) above 50 K, giving a Curie constant C = 1.27 cm3 mol-1 K and Weiss constant \u03b8 = +19.2 K. The C value corresponds to two isolated low-spin FeIII (S = 1/2) ions and one CuII (S = 1/2) ion, with g = 2.12. The positive value of \u03b8 indicates a ferromagnetic interaction between the FeIII and CuII ions. The expression6 reported by E. Coronado et al. for the isolated double chain has been used to fit the data between 10-300 K. The obtained parameters are J 1 = 32.3 cm-1 (46.6 K), J 2 = 12.3 cm-1 (17.8 K), g = 2.30, R = 7.5 \u00d7 10-5 (where J 1 is magnetic interaction within the trimer; J 2 is magnetic interaction between adjacent trimers) (Figure S1). The ferromagnetic interaction between the FeIII and CuII ions is due to the orthogonality of the magnetic orbitals of the low-spin FeIII (d5) and CuII (d9) ions. As shown in Figure , a hysteresis loop is observed at 1.8 K with a coercive field of 120 Oe and a remnant magnetization of 0.86 N\u03b2 mol-1, indicating a magnet-type behavior.
