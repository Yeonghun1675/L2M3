The distance between Hg2+ cations within the tetranuclear unit of 4.225(4) \u00c5 is close to those reported for similar neutral Hg n Cl2n  species. The organic tecton 4, in marked contrast with tectons 2 and 3, which behave as tetradentate units, acts as a hexadentate N4S2 neutral connector. The latter offers two monodentate pyridyl sites and two chelates of the NCCH2S type. Indeed, only two out of the four ArSCH2 S atoms participate in the coordination of Hg2+ with a Hg-S distance of ca 3.1 \u00c5, whereas the other two are located at ca. 4.1 \u00c5. The four N atoms of the pyridyl units occupy the apexes of a tetrahedron. The S atoms connecting the aromatic moieties are not involved in the binding of Hg2+. The interconnection between the two partners thus occurs through both N-HgII and S-HgII coordination bonds. Within the 3D network, two types of Hg2+ cations differing by both their geometry and surroundings are present.
