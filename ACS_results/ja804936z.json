Surprisingly, these two maxima evolve in a parallel way, suggesting a very similar interaction energy. No specific evidence of hydrogen interacting with P\ue5fbO is observed. Upon increasing the coverage, two extra bands on the high-frequency sides of the two main peaks grow (maxima at 4122 and 4112 cm-1), then progressively the four bands give rise to two broad bands with maxima at 4121 and 4108 cm-1. At this point a new band at 4126 cm-1 appears. Finally, the spectrum obtained at the highest hydrogen coverage (bold curve in Figure b) shows hydrogen reorganization inside the channels, leading to new maxima at 4139 and 4132 cm-1, a new component at 4119 cm-1, and a decrease in intensity of the components at low frequency (now maxima again at 4107 and 4112 cm-1). Hydrogen adsorption is completely reversible at 20 K, confirming the low interaction energy. Complex spectra evolving upon hydrogen adsorption in MOFs have previously been discussed. In the case of CPO-27-Ni, the adsorption gave rise to bands at 4035 and 4028 cm-1 for hydrogen directly interacting with open Ni(II) sites with an adsorption enthalpy of -13.5 kJ mol-1. The lower interaction energy and the higher observed frequency for H2 on Ni-STA-12 are probably because phosphonate oxygen atoms partially shield the nickel cation, which has strongly distorted tetragonal prismatic coordination. These local environments vary between the three nickel sites in the triclinic dehydrated structure (each present at 1.7 mmol g-1, Figure ). Access to the three different Ni sites is impeded differently by the ligands, and access to Ni(2) is also impeded by the P\ue5fbO oxygen atom (Figure ). Ni(3) is the most accessible of the three metal sites, and uptake on this site could account for most of the low-pressure uptake of H2 on Ni-STA-12 at 77 K.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 58, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig14\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>14</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Adsorption isotherm (dashed line) and differential heat of adsorption (solid line) for CO at 77 K on fully dehydrated Ni-STA-12.
