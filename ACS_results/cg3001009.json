FIR-2 is synthesized under solvothermal condition and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. It exhibits an organically pillared-layer architecture, being deemed to a MOF possessing topology with vertex symbol of (4\u22c562)2(42\u22c568\u22c583\u22c5102)(64\u22c582). Remarkably, gas sorption measures indicate FIR-2 has permanent porosity with a large BET surface area of 1356.2 m2/g and shows selectivity for the adsorption of CO2 over N2 or CH4 at 0 \u00b0C and 1 bar.\n\nX-ray Crystallographic Study\n\nThe diffraction data for FIR-2 was collected on an Oxford Xcalibur diffractometer equipped with a graphite-monochromatized Mo-K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5) at 293(2) K. Crystal data for FIR-2: C98H68N6O14Zn3; M = 1749.75; triclinic; a = 9.4710(11) \u00c5, b = 17.3579(17) \u00c5, c = 19.6831(19) \u00c5; \u03b1 = 76.227(3)\u00b0, \u03b2 = 83.232(3)\u00b0, \u03b3 = 88.407(3)\u00b0; V = 3120.9(6) \u00c53; T = 293(2) K, space group P1\u0305; Z = 1; 15223 reflections measured; 9703 independent reflections (R int = 0.0216). The final R 1 value was 0.0564 (I > 2\u03c3(I)). The final wR(F 2) value was 0.2069 (I > 2\u03c3(I)). The goodness of fit on F 2 was 1.063. The structures were solved by the direct method and refined by the full-matrix least-squares on F  2  using the SHELXTL-97 program. The guest molecules are highly disordered and can not be identified from X-ray diffraction. CCDC-846688 (FIR-2) contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this article. These data can be obtained free of charge via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/conts/retrieving.html.\n\nEach L ligand links to two paddle-wheel Zn2(COO)4 units in a bidentate fashion and one Zn2 atom in a monodentate fashion, forming a 2D layer with two kinds of rings (i.e., a rhombic ring with a border length of about 12.5 \u00c5 and a hexahydric ring with two different border lengths of about 12.5 \u00c5 and 24.7 \u00c5) (Figure  and a). Linear 4,4'-bipy ligands occupy the axial sites of the Zn(II) atoms and connect adjacent layers to generate a 3D open framework with 1D channels possessing a window size of 11 \u00d7 20 \u00c52. Such large cavities induce 3-fold interpenetration of the network, whose interpenetration vector runs along the c axis (Figure b). After the interpenetration, the structure of FIR-2 still shows large 1D channels along the a axis, and the solvent accessible volume is estimated bythe PLATON program to be about 47.2% of the total crystal volume. Each channel with a window size of 6.5 \u00d7 12 \u00c52 is occupied by the structural disordered solvent molecules. To our knowledge, only two MOFs (SNU-77 and FIR-1) based on this nanosized L ligand have been reported to date, and both of them are simple Zn-L frameworks without exposed metal sites. FIR-2 presents the first Zn-L framework with auxiliary ligands and potential exposed metal sites.\n\nIn order to examine the stability of the framework, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), and desolvation experiments were carried out. The TGA curve of FIR-2 shows the release of guest molecules between 25 and 250 \u00b0C, leading to a weight loss of 26.47% (Figure S4, ). Such high evacuated temperature goes against the activation of the sample for gas adsorption. To attain a more complete evacuation and protect the structural integrality, DMF was exchanged with methanol by soaking crystals of FIR-2 in methanol and heated at 60 \u00b0C for 24 h. While other organic solvents can be exchanged inside the framework, methanol was chosen for its relatively low boiling point and ease of potential removal via evacuation. As indicated by TG analysis, the methanol activated sample (FIR-2a) showed a weight loss step below 110 \u00b0C (Figure S4, ). Thus, FIR-2a becomes very easy to be desolvated, and a hollow phase FIR-2-ht can be obtained by putting FIR-2a under high vacuum (10 -8 mbar) at room temperature overnight. Further powder XRD experiments are carried out to verify the framework stability of FIR-2a (Figure S5, ). The good agreement of the peaks in all diagrams demonstrates that the framework structure of FIR-2a can retain upon a complete removal of the guest molecules.\n\nThe permanent porosity of FIR-2-ht was established by reversible gas sorption experiments using N2 and Ar at 77 and 87 K, respectively, which all show a typical type I behavior characterized by a plateau reached at low relative pressure indicating the presence of permanent micropores in FIR-2-ht (Figure ). The maximum N2 and Ar uptakes at 1 bar for FIR-2-ht are 349 cm3/g and 379 cm3/g, respectively. N2 adsorption data gives a BET surface area of 1356.2 m2/g and a Langmuir surface area of 1491.3 m2/g. In the adsorption data of FIR-2-ht, a single data point at relative pressure 0.01 gives a micropore volume of 0.45 cm3/g by the Horvath-Kawazoe equation. A pore size distribution analysis by DFT methods utilizing N2 gas at 77 K shows that there is a narrow distribution of micropores at 0.6-1.1 nm. Obviously, the 1.1 nm cages take advantage of numbers in FIR-2-ht as shown in the Figure  inset.\n\nTo further explore its potential properties on CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 gas separation under ambient conditions, the adsorption isotherms of CO2, CH4, and N2 for FIR-2-ht at 273 and 298 K were measured, respectively (Figure ). The uptake value of CO2 at 273 K was 71 cm3/g (3.2 mmol/g and 139.5 mg/g), which is comparable to the well-known MOF-5 and larger than many other reported compounds. To better understand these observation, the CO2 adsorptive capability of FIR-2-ht was measured under 298 K, giving an uptake of 35.1 cm3/g.\n\nLow-pressure H2 adsorption, isotherms collected for the sample of FIR-2-ht indicated that the framework had a strong affinity for binding H2 (Figure ). At 77 K and 1.06 bar (800 Torr), it has a fully reversible uptake of 160.8 mL/g H2, a value surpassing that of the most favorable zeolite ZSM-5 (0.7 wt %) and closing to those of recently reported ZIFs. As a further test, a second H2 adsorption isotherm was measured at 87 K, and two data sets were used to determine the isosteric heat of H2 adsorption. The enthalpy of H2 adsorption for FIR-2-ht was estimated from the sorption isotherms at 77 and 87 K using the virial equation to understand the affinity of FIR-2-ht toward H2 (Figures S8 and S9, ). The isosteric heat of H2 adsorption for FIR-2-ht reach the values of 7.2 kJ/mol. What is more, the fraction of the pore volume filled by liquid H2 (\u03c1H2 = 0.0708 g/cm3) at 1 atm and 77 K for FIR-2-ht is 45.1%, which is much larger than those of many famous porous materials, such as IRMOFs and MOF-5.
