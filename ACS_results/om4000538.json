The reaction mixture turned cloudy blue-green and was stirred at room temperature overnight. The cloudy blue-green solution was filtered through Celite to remove KBr and triturated three times with CH2Cl2. A solution of 18C6 (0.1196 g, 0.453 mmol) in CH2Cl2 was added, and the resultant green solution was stirred overnight at room temperature. The solution was filtered to remove more residual KBr, and CH2Cl2 was removed in vacuo. The crude product was recrystallized from CH2Cl2 and hexanes. The green crystalline product was isolated in 61% yield (0.2504 g).

The reaction mixture turned cloudy brown-green and was stirred at room temperature overnight. The cloudy brown-green solution was filtered through Celite to remove KBr and triturated three times with CH2Cl2. The brown solution was stirred in CH2Cl2 for 3 h and filtered to remove more residual KBr, and CH2Cl2 was removed in vacuo. The crude product was recrystallized from CH2Cl2 and hexanes at -35 \u00b0C. Recrystallization resulted in yellow blocks coated in dark oil, and they were extracted and washed with a mixture of hexanes and CH2Cl2 (80/20) and isolated in 3% yield on the basis of Cu (0.0082 g). A small amount of yellow-green crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction were grown from the recrystallization mixture at -35 \u00b0C.

The crude product was recrystallized from CH2Cl2 and hexanes at -35 \u00b0C for several days. Recrystallization resulted in large colorless blocks coated in dark oil. The crystals were extracted, washed with a mixture of hexanes and CH2Cl2 (80/20), and isolated in 13% yield based on Cu (0.0408g).

The reaction mixture turned cloudy brown-green and was stirred at room temperature overnight. The cloudy brown-green solution was filtered through Celite to remove KBr. A solution of 18C6 (0.2380 g, 0.9011 mmol) in THF was added, the resultant green-brown solution was stirred for 3 h and filtered to remove more residual KBr, and THF was removed in vacuo. The resulting green-brown oil was triturated three times with diethyl ether. The product was dissolved in diethyl ether, and the green solution was decanted. Yellow powders were then recrystallized from THF and diethyl ether. Recrystallization resulted in large yellow plates, which were isolated in 10% yield based on Cu (0.0512 g).
