The boron-hydrogen atoms, clearly identified by a difference Fourier map, are oriented to two thallium atoms, showing average Tl-H distances of 2.77(4)-3.57(5) \u00c5, Tl-H-Tl bond angles of 73.9(7)-94.2(11)\u00b0, and B-H-Tl bond angles of 112(4)-144(4)\u00b0.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 20, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>A similar coordination mode of a scorpionate ligand has been described\npreviously in the molecular structure of Tl\u00ad[PhB\u00ad(CH<sub>2</sub>SR)<sub>3</sub>] showing a \u03bc-(\u03ba<sup>2</sup>,\u03ba)-coordination\nmode.
