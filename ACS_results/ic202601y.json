The super cell consisted of one unit cell of the metal-organic framework (MOF) and/or gas molecules (H2 or CO2). Solvent molecules were not included in modeling of these systems. Valence electrons were represented using a plane wave basis set with an energy cutoff of 80 Ry. The interaction of valence electrons with the core electrons and the nuclei were represented by a norm-conserving pseudopotential of Troullier and Martins type. The gradient-corrected Becke, Lee, Yang, and Parr (BLYP) functional was employed to treat the exchange and correlation interactions. Initial calculations consisted of iterative optimization of the cell parameters and atomic positions until a minimum energy configuration was found. Further, to identify the preferred locations of H2 or CO2 molecules in the MOF, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the Car-Parrinello method (CPMD) were carried out at a temperature of 50 K. These were performed by constraining the MOF and allowing the gas molecules (H2 or CO2) to explore various regions within the framework as a function of time.

The adsorption isotherm at 195 K shows a two steps process with a small hysteresis (Figure a). The two step adsorption process is clearly evident from the plot of log(P/P 0) vs uptake  (inset Figure ). In the initial step, it uptakes 64 mL/g (12.15 wt % at STP) in the range of P/P 0 ~ 0.001-0.055. In the next step, the framework adsorbs about 36 mL (7.07 wt %) up to P/P 0 ~1. Such stepwise, hysteretic pressure dependent adsorption of CO2 uptake has been observed in several flexible and dynamic porous MOFs, which respond to specific adsorbate molecules by means of a breathing or gate opening process related to structural expansion or close-open pore system.However, stepwise adsorption in a rigid framework is extremely rare and could stem from different adsorption sites. The small hysteresis and steep uptake at the low pressure region is indicative of strong interaction of the CO2 molecules with the pore surface. The isosteric heat of adsorption (q st,\u03d5), calculated using the Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) equation, is about 35.4 kJ/mol.

DFT calculations quantitatively agree with the experimental values of heat of adsorption and are also able to uncover the nature of interactions between H2 (or CO2) with the atoms of the MOF. This has been made possible through detailed structure analyses augmented by an analysis of the electron density. The experimental and theoretical investigations unequivocally suggest that the high polarity of the pore surfaces decorated by the oxygen atoms and aromatic rings provide significant contribution for the high heat of adsorption values. Thus, by modulating the pore environment via immobilizing the hetero atoms (N, O, F) in the pore surface, the gas adsorption properties of the resulting MOF can be fine-tuned. This affords a methodology for the development of high capacity of H2/CO2 storage materials that may operate at ambient conditions which is significant in the context of global energy and environment issues.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 30, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Crystallographic data in CIF\nformat.

TGA shows the loss of one DMF molecule in the temperature range of 30-200 \u00b0C (obs. wt. loss ~17.11% and calc. wt. loss ~17.45%) and the desolvated framework [Cd(bipy)0.5(Himdc)] n  (1') is stable up to 250 \u00b0C (). Upon further heating, another weight loss was observed in the temperature range of 250-290 \u00b0C which corresponds to half of the bipy molecule (obs. wt. loss ~35.39% and calc. wt. loss ~36.45%) and later, the framework decomposes to unidentified product. The PXRD pattern of 1' exhibits sharp lines without shifting the peak positions and intensities, suggesting that framework is highly rigid and robust ().\n\nPermanent Porosity and Gas Storage Properties\n\nEncouraged by the 3D channel structure, and the high thermal stability and structural rigidity, we determined the permanent porosity of the desolvated framework (1'). The N2 (kinetic diameter = 3.6 \u00c5) adsorption isotherm shows typical type I profile, suggesting a microporous nature of the framework (Figure ). The surface area calculated from the Langmuir equation is about 648.8 m2/g, and the corresponding Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area is 498.12 m2/g. The slight discrepancy between the measured pore volume (0.22 cm3/g) from the N2 adsorption isotherm and the value calculated from the single-crystal X-ray structure (0.29 cm3/g) using PLATON is possibly due to the inability of N2 molecules to effectively enter into the small pores at 77 K. This happens owing to some energy barrier or blocking of pores by strongly adsorbed N2 molecules. The inset to Figure  shows the differential pore volume distributions as functions of pore width calculated by the Saito-Foley (S-F) method which suggests that the pore size is about 4.6 \u00c5. This agrees well with the pore size obtained from single crystal structure. We have measured H2 storage capacity of 1' at 77 and 87 K up to 1 atm (P/P 0 = 1), and the profile shows steep uptake at low pressure region which was ended without saturation (inset to Figure ). The final uptake amounts are 101 and 84 mL/g which match up about of 0.9 and 0.75 wt % storage capacity. Excess high pressure H2 adsorption capacity of 1' was measured with the BELSORP HP apparatus at  77 K, and the corresponding storage capacity was found to be 1.23 wt % (Figure ). The steep uptake at low pressure regions (up to 3 bar) suggests strong interaction of H2 with the pore surface of 1' decorated with the pendent oxygen atoms (O2 and O3) from the Himdc linker and aromatic \u03c0-cloud. The framework saturated with respect to H2 at 77 K at about 10 bar and the saturated amount indicates about two H2 molecules inclusion per formula unit of 1'. The heat of H2 adsorption (\u0394H ads) was derived from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, and the value is \u0394H ads = 13.3 kJ/mol at the low coverage regions (see details in ). This value is compatible with the highest reported value of \u0394H ads in MOF systems. However, the value calculated using the Clausius-Clapeyron approach exhibits a sudden rising behavior at low coverage. We have thus used an alternate virial method which reduces to Henry's law from which the isosteric heat of adsorption is calculated to be 9.0 kJ/mol (see ).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "1",
