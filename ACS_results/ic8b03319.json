Fluorescence lifetime and time resolution spectra clearly exhibit Tb3+ \u2192 Eu3+ energy transfer. In addition, Eu0.05Tb1.95-PDC as a self-calibrated luminescent thermometer in the temperature range of 293-333 K is evaluated, with the maximum values of 1.33% K-1 (SA) and 1.37% K-1 (SR) at 333 K. The temperature uncertainty is better than 0.16 K, and thermal cycling indicates the excellent repeatability. On the basis of the above excellent and unique optical properties of the Ln-PDC system, it could be a multifunctional luminescent material with promising applications in temperature sensing, time resolution imaging, lighting, and display.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 37, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information\nis available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\" xlink:type=\"simple\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b03319\" xlink:type=\"simple\">10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b03319</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>The summarized\ninformation on complexes <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>7</bold>.
