As shown in , each CoII ion is coordinated by two triazole N atoms from two TBC- ligands and two carboxylate O atoms from another two TBC- ligands, as well as by one methanol O atom and one Cl ion in the form of a distorted octahedron configuration. The lengths of the Co-O bonds are in the range of 2.057(3)-2.136(6) \u00c5, while the Co-N and Co-Cl bond lengths are 2.135(5) and 2.434(2) \u00c5, respectively. Two hexacoordinated Co2+ ions are bridged by one Cl ion and two \u03bc2-\u03b71:\u03b71 carboxylate groups from two TBC- ligands, to form a binuclear paddle wheel with a Co-Co distance of 3.649(5) \u00c5 (a). The binuclear coordination units are further bridged by six triangle linkers TBC- to form the 3D framework (b). The framework topology was analyzed by the freely available computer program TOPOS to obtain a simplified framework. If every binuclear unit Co2 is defined as a 6-connected node and TBC- linkers are treated as 3-connected nodes that link the Co2 binuclear units, the 3D framework then could be expressed as a 3,6-connected dag structure with a short (Schla\u0308fli) vertex symbol of {4.82}2{46.89} (d). This topology is uncommon and has not been reported in previous studies.
