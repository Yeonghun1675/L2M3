In order to explore the luminescence quenching degree, the quantified value of the quenching effect of nitrobenzene was obtained using the Stern-Volmer equation I 0/I = 1+K sv [M], in which I 0 and I are the luminescence intensities of the DMA solvent of compound 2 before and after the addition of nitrobenzene, and [M] is the concentration of nitrobenzene. As shown in Figure S11, the Stern-Volmer plots for nitrobenzene exhibited good linear correlations, and the value of K sv was estimated as 155.7 M-1. The results show that 2 are highly sensitive to nitrobenzene molecular, which indicates its potential application as sensor materials for explosives. The reason for luminescence quenching was basically attributed to the charge transfer from the electron-donating framework of 2 to the electron-withdrawing -NO2 group in NB. The stability of 2 treated with NB was proved by PXRD in Figure S12, which showed that the framework retained its structural integrity.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 24, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig4\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Emission spectra of compound <bold>2</bold> immersed into different\nsolvents.
