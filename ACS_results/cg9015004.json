One of our longer term objectives is to subject structurally characterized coordination polymers of DCNQI2- to oxidative intercalation (chemical or electrochemical) to generate materials in which, we hope, the initial coordination network remains intact and in which the DCNQI2- component has been oxidized to the radical anion state (DCNQI\u22c5-) or to a mixed (DCNQI\u22c5-) x (DCNQI2-) y  or (DCNQI\u22c5-) x (DCNQI0) y  state. With regard to electronic communication between DCNQI components in such mixed oxidation state systems, the very close proximity, reported above, of the NCN side arm of one DCNQI unit to that of a neighbor may have interesting consequences. These would be systems containing DCNQI\u22c5- radicals in entirely new sorts of geometrical arrangements and chemical environments; their properties could be fascinating.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 13, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Crystallographic data (in CIF format) for compounds [Mn(DCNQI)(bipy)]2DMF and [Mn(DCNQI)(bpe)]2DMF and thermogravimetric information are available free of charge via the Internet at <uri>http://pubs.acs.org</uri>.</p>", "clean_text": "Crystallographic data (in CIF format) for compounds [Mn(DCNQI)(bipy)]2DMF and [Mn(DCNQI)(bpe)]2DMF and thermogravimetric information are available free of charge via the Internet at http://pubs.acs.org.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 14, "type": "text", "classification": ["synthesis condition"], "content": "<title>References</title><p>Synthesis of [Mn(DCNQI)(bridge)]\u00b72DMF: A solution of Mn(OAc)\u00b74H<sub>2</sub>O (155 mg, 0.632 mmol) in MeOH (15 mL) was diffused into a solution of DNCQI H<sub>2</sub> (100 mg, 0.632 mmol) and 4,4-bipy (99.0 mg, 0.632 mmol) or bpe (115 mg, 0.632 mmol) in DMF (3 mL).
