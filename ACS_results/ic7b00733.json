Our results indicate that quantum Monte Carlo simulation is an efficient tool for the description of the magnetic behavior of objects with a large spin. The most surprising feature of the studied compound is, however, the presence of field-induced magnetic relaxations, which most probably originate from the dipole-dipole interactions between the clusters. \u03c4slow is temperature independent and vanishes above 4.25 K. In contrast, the fast relaxation process reveals an energy barrier of \u0394eff = 17.6 K and can be observed in a temperature range wider than that for the slow process. We believe that the presented relaxation results are an important step toward understanding the slow relaxation processes in compounds based on isotropic ions.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 35, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information is available free of\ncharge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications\nwebsite</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b00733\">10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b00733</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Details of crystal\ndata, molecular structure, structure parameters, and magnetic data\n(<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b00733/suppl_file/ic7b00733_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b00733.
