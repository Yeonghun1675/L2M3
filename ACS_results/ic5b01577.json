The binding constant calculations for the R  1 \u22c5K+\u22c5Cl- complex gave log K 11 value of 3.95, which is remarkably higher than the binding constant for R  1 \u22c5Cl- complex formation (log K 11 = 2.87) alone. This is clearly evident from the chemical shift changes during the titration (c). The binding constant for R  1 \u22c5K+\u22c5Br- complex is 3.25, again showing a remarkable positive cooperativity for anion binding when cation is bound to the crown ether. Similar enhancement is clearly observed with R  1 \u22c5K+\u22c5I- complex formation with log K 11 value of 2.57. When R  1 \u22c5K+\u22c5I- complex formation was studied with Job plot analysis the results gave an indication of a more complex stoichiometry being present in the solution (see ). In the Job plot analysis chemical shift changes of Ha shows 1:1 complex stoichiometry, but the chemical shift changes of Hb and Hc indicate possible 2:1 complex. This more complex stoichiometry could be modeled with HypNMR2008 with 2:1 binding model for the R  1 \u22c5K+\u22c5I- and R  1 \u22c5Rb+\u22c5I- complexes resulting in a better fit between the observed and calculated chemical shift changes. For reasons unknown the binding constant could not be calculated with this binding stoichiometry for the R  1 \u22c5Na+\u22c5I- complex although the chemical shift changes were similar to the above-mentioned complexes. The 2:1 binding model could be applied to the R  1 \u22c5Na+\u22c5Br- and R  1 \u22c5K+\u22c5Br- complexations too, although Job plot analysis gave quite clear evidence of 1:1 binding stoichiometry (). Using 2:1 binding model did result in slightly higher log K 11 values for all the complexations when compared to the log K 11 values obtained from the simple 1:1 model. The use of 2:1 binding model also gave better fit between the observed and calculated chemical shift changes (see ). The second binding event seems to be more dominant when the simple 1:1 complex formation is weaker as can be seen from the log K 21 values presented in . This observation was supported by the unsuccessful application of 2:1 model for R  1 \u22c5cation\u22c5Cl- complex where the 1:1 complexation is very strong.
