After electrochemical oxidation, the color of the electrode changes from orange to black and the absorption spectrum shows that the low-energy absorption band of 1 was broadened and red-shifted about 30 nm (). Then the photocurrent response of the oxidized electrode was measured. In comparison with the unoxidized one, the photocurrent density was increased from 5 to 9 \u03bcA cm-2 (). The band gaps estimated from the electronic spectra are 2.1 eV for py-TTF-py, 1.9 eV for 1, and 1.7 eV for oxidized 1, respectively. The HOMO energy can be estimated from the CV data, which show that the oxidation edges of py-TTF-py and 1 are comparable (0.40 V), while the oxidized 1 is 0.58 V. Figure S7 shows a schematic drawing of the band gaps of py-TTF-py, 1, and oxidized 1 along with the conductive level of the ITO electrode. The excellent photocurrent properties of oxidized 1 should be attributed to its narrow band gap and energy matching with the ITO electrode. The high photocurrent density of 1 compared with that of py-TTF-py should be attributed to the column arrangement of the TTF moieties in the dia and their short face-to-face stacking (3.33 \u00c5; Figure S5). No such short interaction was found in a crystal of py-TTF-py.
