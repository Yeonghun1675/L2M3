Selected bond lengths and angles together with the hydrogen bonding geometries are collected in Table S1.\n\n{[Zn(\u03bc-HCIP)(\u03bc-pbix)]\u22c52H2O} n  (1)\n\nThe molecular structure of 1 with the atom numbering scheme is shown in . Single crystal X-ray structural analysis reveals that 1 crystallizes in the triclinic system with the space group P1\u0305. There are one Zn(II) ion, one HCIP, two half pbix ligands, and two crystal water molecules in the asymmetric unit of 1. Each Zn(II) ion adopts a distorted [ZnO2N2] tetrahedral geometry by coordinating to two carboxylate oxygen atoms from two different HCIP ligands and two nitrogen atoms from two different pbix ligands. The HCIP ligand which acts as a bidentate bridging ligand is partly deprotonated and bridges Zn(II) ions to generate a 1D chain with a Zn\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Zn distance of 9.97 \u00c5 (Figure S2). 1D chains are linked by pbix ligands to form 1D double chains with 44-membered rings (). 1D double chains are further connected with other pbix ligands to generate a 2D undulated layer (Figure S3). There are two different windows in a 2D layer with dimensions of 13.672 \u00d7 9.97 \u00c52 and 13.237 \u00d7 9.97 \u00c52 based on the Zn\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Zn distances. The 2D layers are interpenetrated with each other to give 2D + 2D \u2192 2D interpenetrated structures (). Topologically, the complex is 2-fold interpenetrated 4-c uninodal net with sql topology. 2D layer are extended to a 3D supramolecular framework with hydrogen bonding between carboxylate oxygen atoms of the HCIP and uncoordinated water molecules [O6-H6\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O8 and O7-H7B\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O5] and between N-H groups and uncoordinated carboxylate oxygen atoms of HCIP ligands [N5-H5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O5] ().\n\nThermal behavior of complex 1 was determined by TG/DTA analysis in temperature range of 30-700 \u00b0C under a static air atmosphere (Figure S5). The first weight loss of 5.5% in the temperature range of 94.30-147.4 \u00b0C is due to removal of uncoordinated water molecules (calcd.: 5.75%). Complex 1 is stable up to 297 \u00b0C. On further heating, the framework is decomposed with exothermic picks.
