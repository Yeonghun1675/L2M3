To verify the presence of open pores in such a case, other probe molecules can be used, e.g., CO2  or MeOH. Adsorption of the latter at 25 \u00b0C was used in our study. The obtained isotherms () show that all samples possess open pores, with sample 2 adsorbing the highest amount of MeOH in accordance with its most open structure. Given that the CH3OH and N2 molecules are similar in size (3.60 and 3.64 \u00c5, respectively), the absence of any adsorption of N2 can thus be attributed to kinetic effects or to pore shrinkage at low temperature due to framework flexibility. It can be seen from  that for all samples the isotherms exhibit a large hysteresis; i.e., the desorption branch does not coincide with the adsorption one in a wide pressure range. This feature is frequently observed in PCPs, and it is generally attributed to the flexible nature of the framework (the so-called \"gate effect\"). This is also the case for MeOH adsorbed in the viologen-containing PCPs reported by Kitagawa et al. It is worth noting, however, that, in contrast to Kitagawa's compound, in our materials the hysteresis loops do not close at 25 \u00b0C (). Even after a prolonged treatment under vacuum (for 48 h), a measurable amount of MeOH is retained in the pores (2.9, 1.9, and 1.7 wt % or 0.92, 0.59, and 0.54 mmol g-1 for 1, 2, and 3' correspondingly). The residual MeOH can be completely desorbed only upon heating under vacuum at 170 \u00b0C. Such a behavior shows that some MeOH molecules interact with the pore walls much more strongly than others. The charge-transfer interaction with viologen species is very certainly the origin of this strong interaction. In fact, we can notice that the amount of MeOH retained in the pores of 1 and 3' (0.92 and 0.54 mmol g-1, respectively) corresponds approximately to the quantity of accessible bipyridinium moieties: 1.09 mmol g-1 in 1 and half of the bipyridinium units (1.24/2 = 0.62 mmol g-1) in 3' (see the structure description). In the case of compound 2, the amount of MeOH retained in the pores (0.59 mmol g-1) is quite smaller than the quantity of accessible bipyridinium moieties (0.99 mmol g-1).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 28, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig8\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>8</label>\n<caption>\n<p>MeOH adsorption isotherms of <bold>1</bold>, <bold>2</bold>, and <bold>3</bold>\u2032 measured at 25 \u00b0C (closed symbols, adsorption;\nopen symbols, desorption).</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr9\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2015-00975k_0009.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 8  MeOH adsorption isotherms of 1, 2, and 3' measured at 25 \u00b0C (closed symbols, adsorption; open symbols, desorption).

In the best case, one side of the pyridinium cycle is accessible, as in the structure of 1. When pyridinium rings are at the border of the pores, even if N+\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5guest contacts are difficult, as in the structure of 3, the presence of a local dipolar moment in the walls due to the presence of \"CO2 -\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5N+\" units has a positive impact on the detection or storage of polar guest molecules. This is highlighted in this work by the MeOH adsorption properties of 1, 2, and 3'. Upon irradiation, 1 and 3 exhibit a color change from light brown to dark green because of the presence of bipyridinium radicals, resulting from electron transfer from the electron-donor carboxylate groups to the electron-acceptor pyridinium cycles. Particularly, crystals of 3, which are very photosensitive, giving an eye-detectable color change upon exposure to the light of the microscope in air within 1-2 min, are also thermochromic.

The three Zn2+ ions are hexa- (ZnO6), penta- (ZnO4N), and tetracoordinated (ZnO4), and they form two types of clusters. The first cluster is made by two equivalent pentacoordinated zinc atoms, connected to each other by the oxygen atoms of four BDC2- molecules, forming a so-called paddle-wheel cluster, with the apical position being occupied by the nitrogen atoms of hpc1 molecules (a).

In fact, both of them are based on trinuclear clusters, containing three independent tetra- (ZnO4), penta- (ZnO5), and hexacoordinated (ZnO5N) Zn2+ ions with one OH- group binding the three cations (a). These trinuclear units are surrounded by four BDC2-, two hpc1, one HCO2 -, and one H2O molecule (2) or one EtOH molecule (3). In the structure of 2, the OH- group is interacting with the oxygen atom of a disordered EtOH molecule with a (O)H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O(EtOH) contact of 1.899(2) \u00c5 [d(O(H)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O(EtOH) = 2.690(2) \u00c5; b]. In 3, the same kind of OH\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O interaction is found, but the oxygen atom belongs to a H2O molecule. In the structure of 3, another binuclear building block of two hexacoordinated Zn2+ atoms (ZnO6 and ZnO5N), linked together by three oxygen atoms of two BDC2- groups, is found. Finally, the Zn2+ cations are surrounded by three BDC2- anions, two hpc1 molecules (bonded by the N-pyridyl and COO- sides, respectively), one HCO2 -, which bridges the two kinds of clusters, and a OH- group (c). In both structures, the CPs are extended in the three directions, resulting in porous networks whose potential void spaces have been estimated to 22% and 14% per unit volume using the SQUEEZE routine of PLATON for 2 and 3, respectively. The overall structures are displayed in .

The aperture of the largest windows has been estimated to 5 \u00d7 5 \u00c52. Upon heating, as indicated by powder X-ray thermodiffractometry measurements, a significant change of the peak positions in the pattern of 3 occurs (see the SI). This feature often reveals a breathing effect upon removal of the solvent molecules. However, in 3, in addition to the departure of solvent molecules of DMF during the second weight loss step, CO molecules resulting from decomposition of the formate anions (into OH- and CO) bridging the two kinds of clusters in 3, are also removed. This is clearly demonstrated by a single-crystal X-ray study of slowly heated crystals of 3, which, fortunately, partially retain their crystalline character through the phase transition, leading to 3'. On the one hand, formate decomposition leads to, condensation of the two kinds of clusters into a pentameric unit in the structure of 3'; on the other hand, a partial closing of one kind or pore is
