The magnetic property of complex 1 in the form of \u03c7m T vs T plots is shown in Figure a. The value of \u03c7m T at 300 K is 10.67 cm3 K mol-1, which is lower than that expected (13.14 cm3 K mol-1) for three magnetically isolated high-spin MnII ions. As the temperature decreases, the value of \u03c7m T slowly decreases down to a minimum value of 6.53 cm3 K mol-1 at 55 K and then rises rapidly to a maximum value of 12.00 cm3 K mol-1 at 16 K. Upon a further decrease of the temperature, however, lower than 16 K, the \u03c7m T drops rapidly because of the saturation effect. Fitting the data at 75-300 K with the Curie-Weiss law gives C = 13.45 cm3 K mol-1 and \u03b8 = -76.67 K for 1. The C value is consistent with the value (13.1 cm3 K mol-1) of three noninteracting MnII ions with g = 2.0. The negative value of \u03b8 and the initial decrease of \u03c7m T should be due to the overall AF coupling between the MnII ions. The shape of the \u03c7m T vs T plots, with its minimum, is typical of ferrimagnetic behavior or spin canting. However, ferrimagnetic systems usually exhibit less sharp minima. So, taking into account the large number of MnII networks with similar properties, it should be a spin-canting system. The isothermal field-dependent magnetizations M(H) at 2 K at fields up to 50 kOe (Figure b, inset right) were measured for 1. The field dependence of the magnetization does not follow a Brillouin curve. As shown in Figure , M increases quickly at very low field, reaching about 1 N\u03b2 at 2000 Oe, and then increases slowly to 4.45 N\u03b2 at 50 kOe, much less than the common value of 15 N\u03b2 for three MnII centers, which also suggests the canted AF nature of the interaction between neighboring metal ions.
