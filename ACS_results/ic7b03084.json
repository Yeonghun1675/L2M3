Experimental results are given in . After 24 h of reaction, the yields of product c catalyzed by Yb-BDC-NH2, Dy-BDC-NH2, and Sm-BDC-NH2 reach about 97.0, 82.0, and 76.0%, respectively. In comparison with previous catalysts (Table S2), the three compounds also exhibit good catalytic activity toward the deacetalization-Knoevenagel condensation reaction. Among them, Yb-BDC-NH2 demonstrates the highest catalytic activity due to the smaller ionic radius and stronger Lewis acidity (). Hence, Yb-BDC-NH2 was chosen to explore the dynamic change of the reaction over time (Figure S10) and catalyst recovery. Though the activity of catalyst Yb-BDC-NH2 decreased slightly, it is still better those for than the other two catalysts that were isolated from the reaction suspensions by centrifugation. After four runs of the reaction, the weight and color of the catalyst Yb-BDC-NH2 were unchanged. Moreover, the PXRD pattern of Yb-BDC-NH2 after four cycles was still identical with that of the as-synthesized catalyst, indicating that it maintains its structural integrity after catalytic experiments (Figure S11).
