In addition, since the experiment was done on a powder sample, chain axes are oriented randomly in space; in principle one has to consider all possible orientations. For this (quasi) one-dimensional system, as the spin-spin correlation length at low temperature is assumed to be large (noting the huge value of \u03c7T at low temperature), we cannot take a few units of the chain to model the system. On the other hand, even after assuming iron spins to be Ising-like (due to their large axial anisotropy, whose estimation will be made from our modeling), we cannot use common transfer-matrix formalism for a one-dimensional Ising model. This is because Nb ions do not have anisotropy and all of their spin components are involved in exchange interactions. Since anisotropy axes of both in-chain and off-chain Fe ions are different and furthermore nearby Nb ions are not connected to the Fe ions in similar way, we here define three angles \u03c9, \u03b1, and \u03b4 to describe the structure of the chain (Scheme ). We also considered three coordinates \u03b8, \u03d5, and \u03c8 to define the orientation of a chain, where \u03b8 and \u03d5 are the usual spherical polar coordinates to define the axis of the chain (the axis of the helix) and \u03c8 here specifies the angle of rotation of the chain along its own axis. In this paper we concentrate on low-temperature modeling, as its property depends on exchange and anisotropy parameters along with structural angles. Physical insights into the system can be obtained by studying its low temperature properties.

FeCl2\u22c54H2O (1.00 g, 5.03 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of methanol (50 mL) and water (15 mL) under nitrogen atmosphere. To this solution were added Na2S2O4 (0.438 g, 2.52 mmol), 2,6-diacetyl pyridine (0.821 g, 5.03 mmol) and triethylene tetramine (0.736 g, 5.03 mmol), and the dark blue reaction mixture was heated to 70 \u00b0C for 16 h. The reaction mixture was subsequently cooled to ambient temperature and filtered under nitrogen atmosphere to an aqueous (25 mL) solution of Na2S2O4 (0.219 g). The dark blue mother liquor containing the compound was evaporated, and the resulting deep blue compound was redissolved in methanol (20-25 mL), concentrated to around 15 mL, and kept in a refrigerator leading to a dark blue crystalline compound. Large rectangular prismatic single crystals of the compound suitable for X-ray diffraction were grown from a dilute water-methanol solution in a refrigerator. The single-crystal X-ray structure was solved to establish the structural identity of the building block. The structure is similar to that of other complexes bearing the same ligand.
