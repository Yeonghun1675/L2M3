The asymmetric unit consists of one CdII ion, half of a bptc4- ligand, half of a 4,4'-bipy, one coordinated water molecule, and two lattice water molecules. Each CdII ion is six-coordinated in a distorted triprismatic configuration with a CdO5N coordination environment (a): four carboxylate oxygen atoms from three bptc4- ligands and one oxygen atom from one coordinated water molecule with Cd-O bond lengths ranging from 2.232(6) to 2.472(6) \u00c5 and one nitrogen atom from 4,4'-bipy with a Cd-N bond length of 2.264(7) \u00c5 (Table S4). The carboxylate groups of fully deprotonated bptc4- ligands display chelating bidentate (\u03bc1-\u03b71:\u03b71) and bridging bidentate (\u03bc2-\u03b71:\u03b71) coordination modes. Two six-coordinated CdII ions are bridged by two \u03bc2-\u03b71:\u03b71 carboxylates of two bptc4- ligands to form a binuclear core with a Cd\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cd distance of 4.2596(1) \u00c5 (b). One binuclear unit is connected with the eight adjacent binuclear units by four 4-connected bptc4- and two bridging 4,4'-bipy ligands to give a 3D framework (c). The phenyl rings in bptc4- and 4,4'-bipy are noncoplanar with dihedral angles of 38.6\u00b0 and 32.5\u00b0, respectively  (Figure S4). A simplified network has been obtained by topological analysis, in which each binuclear CdII unit is regarded as a 6-connected node, all bptc4- ligands are considered as 4-connected nodes, and each bridging 4,4'-bipy ligand is viewed as a linker.

Then, suspensions of 3 mg of the CPs 1-3 in 4 mL of each of these solutions were prepared. The luminescent intensities of these CP suspensions were recorded at room temperature. As shown in  and S11, most cations possess different effects on the emission of the CPs 1-3, while only Fe3+ ions exhibits an extreme quenching effect on the luminescence, with quenching efficiencies of 99% (1), 71% (2), and 88% (3) [quenching efficiency = (I 0 - I)/I 0 \u00d7 100%, where I 0 and I are the maximum luminescent intensities before and after addition of the targeted species]. The result indicates that the CPs 1-3 can act as promising chemical sensors for Fe3+ ions. Luminescence titration experiments were carried out further to explore the detection capability of the CPs 1-3 for Fe3+ ions. a,c,e and S13 show that the luminescent intensities decrease as the concentrations of Fe3+ ions gradually increase for the CPs 1-3.

Furthermore, as shown in the insets of Figure S13, for the CPs 1-3, the luminescent intensities and the concentrations of Fe3+ ions at lower concentrations show good linear relationships. Accordingly, the detection limits are calculated to be 2.76 ppm (1.02 \u00d7 10-5 M; 1), 5.85 ppm (2.17 \u00d7 10-5 M; 2), and 5.49 ppm (2.03 \u00d7 10-5 M; 3) by 3\u03c3/k (\u03c3 = standard deviation of fluorescent tests for 10 blank solutions; k = slope of the calibration curve), which are among the best sensors in the other reported works for the Fe3+ ion (Table S6). Moreover, the luminescent quenching efficiency was quantitatively analyzed by the Stern-Volmer (S-V) equation, I 0/I = K sv[M] + 1, where I 0 and I are the maximum luminescent intensities before and after the addition of Fe3+ ions, [M] is the molar concentration of Fe3+ ions, and K SV is the quenching constant (M-1). For the CPs 1 (b) and 3 (f), the S-V plots for Fe3+ ions were nearly linear at low concentrations and then deviated from linearity to increase exponentially at higher concentrations, which may be caused by an energy-transfer process or self-absorption. Additionally, the nonlinear S-V plots indicate that the quenching behaviors for the Fe3+ ions of the CPs 1 and 3 combine static quenching with dynamic quenching, which can be fitted by an exponential quenching equation, I 0/I = a exp(k[M]) + b, where a, b, and k are constants and [M] is the molar concentration of the Fe3+ ion. For the CPs 1 and 3, these plots can be fitted to I 0/I = 2.10 exp(4.10[M]) - 2.48 and I 0/I = 7.96 exp(0.78[M]) - 8.19, respectively.

The quenching constants for the Fe3+ ions of the CPs 1-3 are comparable to those of the previously reported CP sensors (Table S6).

For the CPs 1-3, luminescence titration experiments were carried out to study the sensitivity for Cr2O7 2- and CrO4 2- ions. The titration plots revealed that the emission intensities of the CPs 1-3 decreased with increasing concentrations of the Cr2O7 2-/CrO4 2- ions. For the Cr2O7 2-/CrO4 2- ions, when their concentrations were up to 300/500 ppm (1) (a,c), 600/900 ppm (2) (Figure S18a,c), and 400/700 ppm (3) (Figure S19a,c), the quenching efficiencies could reach 99% (1), 97% (2), and 98% (3) (Figure S20).

These phenomena are similar to the CPs 1 and 3 for sensing Fe3+ ions. The exponential quenching equations mentioned above, I 0/I = a exp(k[M]) + b, where a, b, and k are constants and [M] is the molar concentration of the Cr2O7 2-/CrO4 2- ions, can be used for fitting of these S-V plots to give the relationships between I 0/I versus [M]: I 0/I = 3.89 exp(3.02[M]) - 4.77 (1), I 0/I = 2.75 exp(0.76[M]) - 2.87 (2), and I 0/I = 5.40 exp(1.73[M]) - 5.96 (3) for Cr2O7 2- ions and I 0/I = 9.24 exp(0.86[M]) - 9.40 (1), I 0/I = 1.84 exp(0.59[M]) - 1.92 (2), and I 0/I = 10.15 exp(0.53[M]) - 10.58 (3) for CrO4 2- ions.
