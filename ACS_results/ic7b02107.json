The structure was solved by direct methods and refined on F 2 by full-matrix least-squares techniques with the SHELXTL-97 program. In MOF 1, the coordinates of the hydrogen atoms on the coordinated H2O were suggested by the Calc-OH program in the WinGX suite; their O-H distances were further restrained to O-H = 0.85 \u00c5 and thermal parameters constrained to U iso(H) = 1.2U eq(O). However, for MOF 2, the hydrogen atoms on the coordinated H2O solvates were not located. In both 1 and 2, an amount of spatially delocalized electron densities in the lattice were found but acceptable refinement results could not be obtained for these electron densities. The solvent contributions were then modeled using SQUEEZE in the Platon program suite.

The formation of the duplex serves to keep the P-DNA away from the surfaces of MOFs 1 and 2, leading to the fluorescence recovery (on-state). Thus, the sensing capabilities of P-DNA@1 and P-DNA@2 systems for SUDV RNA sequences were evaluated by the fluorescence regeneration induced by the addition of complementary SUDV RNA sequences (5'-GAUGAGGACAAACUUUUUAA-3', T20). We found that the fluorescence intensity recovery is time-dependent. The fluorescence intensity increased with incubation time and remained unchanged when the incubation time was longer than 30 \u00b1 5 min for P-DNA@1 and 18 \u00b1 2 min for P-DNA@2 with a T20 concentration of 25 nM for both systems (Figure S8 in the Supporting Information). The longer recovery time of P-DNA@1 in comparison to that of P-DNA@2 is probably due to adsorption of the P-DNA by the pores of 1, which prohibits its effective recombination with target RNA sequences. However, for P-DNA@2, the flat surface of 2 lowers the steric hindrance and favors target-probe hybridization. In addition, increasing the concentration of target SUDV RNA sequences led to a gradual increase in the fluorescence intensity until saturation was observed at a concentration of 50 nM for both P-DNA@1 and P-DNA@2 ().
