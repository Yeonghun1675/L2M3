The longer, narrower shape of n-pentane results in three key differences between the structural response of Sc2BDC3 to n-pentane and 2-methylbutane uptake at high pressure. First, the Group 2 BDC rings initially do not rotate to the same extent as in Sc2BDC3(ip). There is slight variation over the pressure regime (from 20.8\u00b0 in Sc2BDC3(np-I) to 35.0\u00b0 in Sc2BDC3 (np-III)), but the rotation of 52.4\u00b0 in Sc2BDC3(ip) is far more extreme.
