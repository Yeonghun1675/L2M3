Each aqua ligand is hydrogen-bonded to an uncoordinated carboxy oxygen atom of an adjacent dimer [O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O 2.660(1) \u00c5], resulting in a hydrogen-bonded, wavy (4,4) network (Figure ), which stacks via \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions into a 3D architecture (Figure S2). When the aqua ligands are removed, the uncoordinated carboxy oxygen atom may take up the vacant site of CoII in a neighboring dimer, forming a mixed azido/carboxylato-bridged layer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of 1 displays a weight loss of 5.7% from 165 to 190 \u00b0C, corresponding to the loss of the aqua ligands (5.6%) (Figure S3). After this weight loss, a long plateau is observed until a full decomposition at ca. 270 \u00b0C occurs, where a new phase is formed upon removing the aqua ligands in the range of ca. 150-190 \u00b0C, as shown by temperature-dependent powder X-ray diffraction patterns (PXRD) (Figure S4). Fortunately, we were able to obtain, though irreversibly, the dehydrated single crystals [Co2(8-qoac)2(N3)2] n  (2) by heating the single crystals of 1 at 150 \u00b0C under vacuum.  \n\nTo further characterize the weak ferromagnetism in 2, the isothermal magnetization and the hysteresis loop were measured at 2 K. The magnetization first increases slowly in the low field for the interlayer antiferromagnetic interaction (Figure ), and then increases abruptly at 750 Oe for the intradimer ferromagnetic interactions. Upon a further increase of the field, the magnetization increases much more slowly as the ferromagnetic phase tends to saturate. Finally, the magnetization increases linearly for the higher fields, which is a feature of spin-canting antiferromagnet. The M value at 7 T is 2.57 N\u03b2, which is far below that expected for a total alignment of spins (M ~ 6 N\u03b2) for the canting antiferromagnetic interactions in 2. A hysteresis loop of 2 is observed at 2 K with a remnant magnetization 1.0 N\u03b2 and a coercive field of 1980 Oe per dimer (Figure  inset). The obvious frequency-dependent behavior was observed in the ac susceptibility data from 11 to 15 K (Figure  inset). The shift of peak temperature (T p) of \u03c7\u2018\u2018 was measured by a parameter \u03c6 = \u0394T p/[T p\u0394(logf)] = 0.01, being in the range of spin glass. This behavior confirms the presence of the long-range order in 2. The critical temperature 13 K of the phase change is attested by ZFC and FC curves (Figure S7).
