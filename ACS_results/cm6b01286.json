These channels have a virtual diameter of ca. 1.0 nm, resulting from the alternating orientation of the methyl residues from the trans-(S,S)-alamox bridging ligands within adjacent channels. The estimated empty volume without the crystallization water molecules is 2089.1 \u00c53, which is a value that represents up to ca. 58.0% of potential void per unit cell volume [V = 3604.1 \u00c53] ( in the Supporting Information). A striking structural feature of 1 is that all water molecules hosted in the pores are hydrogen-bonded, forming one-dimensional (1D) ribbons along the c-axis (see e) that involve the aqua/hydroxo bridges of the network.\n\nThermogravimetric Analysis and Powder X-ray Diffraction\n\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows a mass loss at 473 K of 31.5% ( in the Supporting Information) which corresponds to 30 H2O molecules per formula unit, a value close to the 32 lattice molecules found in the crystal structure determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) at 90 K. The vapor water adsorption isotherm of 1 at 25 \u00b0C shows that the complete rehydration process, with the recovery of 32 mmol of water per mmol of bioMOF, can be only achieved under maximum relative humidity (see  in the Supporting Information), which is in complete agreement with the proton conductivity measurements (see below).\n\nThe permanent porosity of 1 was demonstrated by means of N2 adsorption at 77 K. The isotherm shows a type I behavior with large uptake at low pressures (). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area calculated was 1015 m2/g, with a calculated pore size of 1.1 nm, which closely corresponds to that determined from the crystal structure.\n\nSingle-Crystal X-ray Diffraction\n\nCrystal data for 1: C24Cu6CaH92N6O53, hexagonal, space group P63, a = 17.6943(10) \u00c5, c = 13.2921(8) \u00c5, V = 3604.0(5) \u00c53, T = 90(2) K, Z = 2, \u03c1calc = 1.598 g cm-3, \u03bc = 1.917 mm-1, Flack parameter = 0.02(1), of the 34464 reflections collected, 5790 are unique and 4983 observed with I > 2\u03c3(I).
