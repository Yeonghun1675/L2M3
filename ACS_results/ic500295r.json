This conclusion is also supported by our lifetime investigations of the luminescence decay (vide infra).\n\nFinally, the thermal behavior of 1 (36.1 mg) was studied by simultaneous DTA/TG (Netzsch STA-409) from 25 to 900 \u00b0C with a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min-1 in a constant flow of 20 mL min-1 Ar and 20 mL min-1 N2 (see ). Three mass loss steps are detected. While the first mass loss at 120 \u00b0C of 7% accords well with the loss of one pyrazine molecule per formula unit, the subsequent steps cannot be easily identified and are likely to be a combination of pyrazine loss, decomposition, and the onset of BiCl3 sublimation above 300 \u00b0C.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "1", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "25 to 900", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "thermal investigation", "condition": "heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min-1 in a constant flow of 20 mL min-1 Ar and 20 mL min-1 N2"}, {"value": "120", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "loss of one pyrazine molecule per formula unit", "condition": ""}, {"value": "above 300", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "onset of BiCl3 sublimation", "condition": ""}], "peak spectrum": [{"value": "365, <250 to 300, 405, 520, 495", "unit": "nm", "type": "excitation and emission spectra", "condition": "room temperature and 77 K"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["decomposition_temperature", "peak_spectrum"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['decomposition_temperature', 'peak_spectrum']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n  {\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"name\": \"1\",\n      \"symbol\": \"1\",\n      \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"decomposition temperature\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"25 to 900\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"thermal investigation\",\n        \"condition\": \"heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min-1 in a constant flow of 20 mL min-1 Ar and 20 mL min-1 N2\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"value\": \"120\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"loss of one pyrazine molecule per formula unit\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"value\": \"above 300\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"onset of BiCl3 sublimation\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"peak spectrum\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"365, <250 to 300, 405, 520, 495\",\n        \"unit\": \"nm\",\n        \"type\": \"excitation and emission spectra\",\n        \"condition\": \"room temperature and 77 K\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 18, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Excerpts of the crystal structure of <sup>2</sup>\n<sub>\u221e</sub>[Bi<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>(pyz)<sub>4</sub>] (<bold>1</bold>).\nMain building unit (top left), polyhedral view along [100] (top right),\nand view along [010], with terminal pyrazine ligands omitted for clarity\n(bottom).</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2014-00295r_0007.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Excerpts of the crystal structure of 2 \u221e[Bi2Cl6(pyz)4] (1).
