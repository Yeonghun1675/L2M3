Supporting Information Table S5 gives a comparison of CO2 uptake capacity among reported Mg-MOFs. The open Mg sites from removing the coordinated water or solvent molecules likely contribute to the CO2 uptake capacities. In addition, the interactions between charged Mg-MOF frameworks (CPM-203) and CO2 are obviously enhanced, leading to the highest CO2 uptake capacity among these CPMs.\n\nCompared to the CO2 adsorption, these Mg-MOFs adsorb much less CH4 (). The CH4 uptakes for CPM-201-CPM-205 at 273 K and 1 atm are 4.0, 1.7, 3.2, 3.0, and 3.7 cm3 g-1, respectively. The CO2/CH4 uptake ratios are estimated to be ca. 31.0-10.1 (CPM-201), 25.9-24.1 (CPM-202), 19.4-16.6 (CPM-203), 8.0-7.9 (CPM-204), and 12.6-6.0 (CPM-205) between 0.015 and 1 bar, which are higher than the values of many well-known ZIFs and MOFs. The high uptake capacity for CO2 gas over CH4 in Mg-MOFs may be associated with the quadruple moment of CO2 (-1.34 \u00d7 10-39 C m2) which induces efficient interaction with the framework. Overall, other than simple lower mass effects of Mg-MOFs, the unique ionic character of Mg-O bond affords additional uptake of CO2, which also imparts high CO2/CH4 selectivity of CPM-201-CPM-205.",
