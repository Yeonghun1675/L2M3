As expected, fluorescence was quantitatively quenched upon exposure to increasing concentrations of Pd2+ and observed to be completely quenched when a 2:1 Pd2+/KFUPM-3 molar ratio was achieved. This complete quenching indicates that full complexation was realized between Pd2+ and the two allyloxy moieties on the BAT2- linker () because of the strong interaction between the \u03c0-d orbital of alkene and palladium. It is noted that Pd2+ complexation within the channels of KFUPM-3 perturbs the electronic structure of the BAT2- linker, which affects the excited state of the linkers. This perturbation then impacts sensitization of the Eu3+ emissive state by prohibiting energy transfer from the linkers to the Eu3+ SBUs, which, consequently leads to quenching of fluorescence. The quenching efficiency was then interpreted by calculating the Stern-Volmer constant. On the basis of the titration curve, shown in , the Stern-Volmer constant, K SV, was calculated to be 7.8 \u00d7 104, which is comparable to values obtained for other suspension-based Pd2+ chemosensors (see section S5). The sensitivity of KFUPM-3 toward Pd2+ was demonstrated based on the calculated detection limit. For KFUPM-3, this detection limit was 44 ppb, which is significantly lower than the 5-10 ppm threshold for palladium in pharmaceutical products (see section S5). Furthermore, this detection limit is among the lowest and most sensitive reported for MOF-based Pd2+ chemosensing materials (Table S2). To assess changes in the emission spectra in the presence of metal contaminants, KFUPM-3 was again immersed in solutions of different metal ions (see section S5).
