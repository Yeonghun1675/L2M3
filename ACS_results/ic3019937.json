The results indicate that the solvent-accessible volumes of fully desolvated MOFs (1.8 \u00c5 probe radius) are 66.0% for PCN-921 and 66.2% for PCN-922, respectively. To confirm the porosities, both samples were degassed under dynamic vacuum at 85 \u00b0C for 10 h each after solvent exchange with methanol and dichloromethane. After activation, the colorless PCN-921 became yellow, possibly a sign of crystal decomposition. Indeed, it showed no N2 adsorption as expected.
