These structures have revealed unprecedented features of osmyl coordination abilities toward MOFs. In spite of the close structural resemblance of the pro-ligands used and their similar NO2 trianionic coordination modes to the osmyl moiety; the corresponding Os/K networks formed show distinct architectures, ranging from stepladder chain (in Os  2b ) and 2D-grid (in Os  1  and Os  2a ) MOFs to 3D-porous H-bonding network (in Os  2a ). These networks are formed by the assembling of anionic osmium complexes and coordinating K+ cations, through O-carbonyl ligands and osmyl-oxo ligands that adopt different bridging modes. Their topological analysis revealed unprecedented trinodal 3,4-connected (Os  2b ) and hexanodal 3,5- (Os  2a ) or 3,4,5,6-connected (Os  1 ) underlying nets. Hence, the present work also contributes to the identification and classification of coordination polymers with new topologies.
