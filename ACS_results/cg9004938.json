The surface morphology and the distribution of the product were analyzed using field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) in which the images were acquired using the JEOL JSM-6700F model instrument. The samples were placed over carbon tape attached on the metal holder and coated with a thin layer of platinum using JEOL JFC-1600 auto fine coater to increase their conductivity.

TGA weight loss observed for water 3.6%; found 3.3%.\n\nHydrothermal Reaction\n\nFor a typical reaction, the precursor solid 1 (0.127 g, 0.143 mmol) was treated with thiourea (0.543 g, 0.713 mmol) in 25 mL of H2O (precursor: 5 sulfur source) in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave was then placed in an oven at the desired temperature and time. The obtained product was washed several times with water and ethanol and dried under vacuo. The reaction conditions were varied to explore the effect of different reaction parameters on the size and morphology of the product.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "H3Sser", "symbol": "", "chemical
