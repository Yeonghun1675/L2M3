Inside an argon-filled glovebox, sodium hydride (0.45 g, anhydrous, 60% in mineral oil, 11 mmol) and a stirring bar were loaded into a three-neck round-bottom flask. The flask was then connected to a vacuum manifold under argon protection, and 15 mL of anhydrous pentane was added via cannula. The suspension was stirred for 5 min and the pentane was taken out via cannula. This process was repeated for another two times, and then, 30 mL of freshly distilled diethyl ether (from CaH2) was added. The reaction vessel was then chilled in an ice-water bath, and stirring was started. Thiophenol (0.9 mL, 97+%, 8.5 mmol) was then injected under argon protection. When the bubbling almost stopped, the suspension was heated in an oil bath to reflux for 15 min, and the diethyl ether was evaporated afterward to yield a white solid. 1,3-Dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (DMEU, 30 mL, 99%, anhydrous) was added via cannula into the solution, and hexabromotriphenylene (HBT, 0.48 g, 0.7 mmol) was then added under argon protection. The reaction mixture was heated in oil bath at 70 \u00b0C for 2 h, during which time the reaction mixture turned into a burgundy solution. Into the solution was injected bromobenzene (0.9 mL, 99%, 8.5 mmol, purged by argon for 15 min). The mixture was heated at 70 \u00b0C for another 2 h and then poured into 100 mL of water. The mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (150 mL \u00d7 3), and the organic phase was washed with water (300 mL \u00d7 4) and brine (saturated, 300 mL) and then dried on anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated in vacuo to yield a light yellow solid (0.46 g, 77% based on HBT). The solid was washed well with hexane and then purified by flash chromatography (CH2Cl2/hexane = 2:8, 0.37 g pure product obtained, 62% based on HBT, mp 183-184 \u00b0C). 1H NMR (200 MHz, chloroform-d): 7.31 (m, 30 H), 7.99 (s, 6 H). 13C NMR (50 MHz, chloroform-d): 126.7, 127.6, 128.3, 129.4, 131.3, 134.6, 137.6.  \n\n X-ray Quality Single Crystals of 2HPhTT \u22c5 3AgTf \u22c5 3toluene (1). A toluene solution of HPhTT (6.4 mM, 0.3 mL) was mixed with a toluene solution of AgTf (9.7 mM, 0.3 mL) in a glass tube (10 mm o.d./6 mm i.d.). On top of the mixed solution was then layered sequentially toluene (0.5 mL) and hexane (0.8 mL). The tube is then sealed and kept in the dark. Blocklike, colorless crystals suitable for X-ray studies formed after one week (1.9 mg, 71% based on HPhTT).

The big vial was capped and put in the dark. Blocklike colorless crystals suitable for X-ray studies formed after about 4 days (3.6 mg, 55% based on HPhTT).
