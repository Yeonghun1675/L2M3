Moreover, it should be noted that there are some slight structural differences among Tb-2, Dy-2, Ho-2, and Gd-2: whereas a half-occupied acetate oxygen and a half-occupied water molecule are bound to the Dy1 ion in Dy-2, the analogous bonding sites of the Ln1 ions in Tb-2 and Ho-2 are occupied by one terminal water molecule (Figure ). Furthermore, the LnIII cations in Tb-2, Dy-2, and Ho-2 are eight-coordinate, with an almost undistorted dodecahedral coordination environment (Figure ). In Gd-2, the Gd1 and Gd2 cations, located in the external pocket of the \u03b1-[Si2W18O66]16- anion, are eight-coordinate, with a nearly ideal dodecahedral coordination and a distorted square-antiprismatic coordination, respectively. Gd3 is nine-coordinate, adopting a distorted nine-coordinated monocapped square antiprism, with three terminal oxygen atoms from three neighboring [Gd2(H2O)7Si2W18O66]10- polyanions and four terminal water molecules. The remaining two coordination sites are occupied by two oxygen atoms of the bidentate acetate ligand (cf. Figure  and discussion below). All polyanions are arranged as \"inversion pairs\" in analogy to K16-\u03b1-[Si2W18O66]. However, the lanthanoid cations occupy the exterior pockets of the open Wells-Dawson \u03b1-[Si2W18O66]16- anion, and they act as external linkers, thereby differing from the role of K+ in previous structures and leading to the formation of novel polymeric motifs.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 33, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig7\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>7</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Topological view of <bold>Tb-2</bold> along the <italic toggle=\"yes\">x</italic> axis (red nodes, [Tb<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>7</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>W<sub>18</sub>O<sub>66</sub>]<sup>10\u2013</sup> clusters; green nodes, Tb3 atoms).</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr7\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"ic-2011-001943_0008.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 7  Topological view of Tb-2 along the x axis (red nodes, [Tb2(H2O)7Si2W18O66]10- clusters; green nodes, Tb3 atoms).
