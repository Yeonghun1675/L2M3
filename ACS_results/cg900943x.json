The initial step is removal of lattice water to give 1D Cu-L-2-0-1D. Lattice water molecules in Cu-L-2-1-1D interact with neighboring chains through a complicated hydrogen bonding network. Therefore, once the lattice water is removed profound changes in hydrogen bonding interactions (chain\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5H2O\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5chain) ensue. Vacating the interchain space causes the chains to compact and \"slip\", with concomitant creation of a new hydrogen bonding scheme (chain\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5chain). The initial zigzag 1D chain is retained throughout the dehydration process. In 3D Cu-L-0-0-3D the vacant sites on Cu generated by removal of Cu-bound waters are now occupied by phosphonate oxygens from neighboring chains. We are currently extending this dehydration-induced chemistry to other metal-HPAA systems.

The loss of ~20.0% (calculated 19.9%) corresponds well to loss of both Cu-coordinated waters and the water of crystallization, all three in one step under the TGA experimental conditions. Beyond 150 \u00b0C the material decomposes in two steps (250-270 \u00b0C and 300-315 \u00b0C). The total observed mass loss of ~44% corresponds well to the calculated 42% (based on the formation of Cu2P2O7 which was identified by its powder diffraction pattern, PDF-79-2075). The TGA was carried out under either air or N2, without any difference in results.\n\nMagnetic and EPR Studies\n\nMagnetic susceptibility measurements and EPR spectra were carried out on powdered samples of the \"hydrated\" Cu-L-2-1-1D and \"anhydrous\" Cu-L-0-0-3D compounds. Magnetics data are shown in Figure . For the \"hydrated\" complex the room temperature value of \u03c7T is 0.486 cm3 K mol-1. The temperature dependence of \u03c7 exhibits a relatively broad maximum at ca. 35-40 K. Below 25 K an abrupt increase of \u03c7 is observed. The behavior of \u03c7 above 25 K is consistent with antiferromagnetic interactions. The structural motif of Cu-L-2-1-1D is a 1D chain. For such systems the Bonner-Fischer approximation may be used in order to model the \u03c7 vs T data. The maximum observed in the \u03c7 vs T plot is related with the magnitude of the exchange interaction J through the relationship k T max/|J| ~ 1.282 (H = -2J \u03a3 S  i  S  i+1). From this, a value of -25 cm-1 is estimated for the intra-chain exchange interactions. The increase of \u03c7 below 25 K is attributed to the presence of monomeric impurities.\n\nFor compound Cu-L-0-0-3D the room temperature \u03c7\u03a4 = 0.400 cm3 K mol-1. The \u03c7 vs T diagram exhibits a maximum at around 60 K indicative of antiferromagnetic interactions.
