As a result, only 1.4% of the entire Mn sites installed in the Mn-AIM-NU-1000 thin film are electrochemically addressable; the poor redox activity of manganese oxide may be attributed to the poor charge transport in the insulating NU-1000. However, in the Mn-AIM-NiCB@NU-1000 thin film, 16% of the Mn sites are electrochemically addressable, which indicates that the electrical conductivity of the NiCB@NU-1000 scaffold significantly improves the redox activity of the installed manganese oxide. The chronopotentiometric experiments were also conducted at various charge-discharge current densities, and the specific capacitance of the installed manganese oxide (F/gMnO2 ) can be calculated by assuming that two oxygens are present on each manganese atom (see the result shown in d and Section S9 in the Supporting Information for details). At a charge-discharge current density of 0.02 mA/cm2, the specific capacitance of manganese oxide in the Mn-AIM-NiCB@NU-1000 thin film reaches 276 F/gMnO2 , which is more than 10 times higher than that in the Mn-AIM-NU-1000 thin film (21 F/gMnO2 ). A long-term chronopotentiometric experiment suggests that a better approach for film deposition is needed to achieve a better performance retention (see Section S10 in the Supporting Information). It should be noted that although the electrical conductivity of the NiCB@NU-1000 scaffold is on the order of 10-7 S/cm, it is enough to electrochemically address ~25% of the installed Mn sites within the micrometer-thick film (at 0.02 mA/cm2), which results in an excellent specific capacitance (Table S3). The findings open the opportunity for designing electrically conductive, water-stable MOFs with accessible intra-framework functionality for a range of electrochemical applications.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 11, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig4\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) CV curves\nof the spin-coated NU-1000, NiCB@NU-1000, Mn-AIM-NU-1000,\nand Mn-AIM-NiCB@NU-1000 thin films, measured at 25 mV/s.
