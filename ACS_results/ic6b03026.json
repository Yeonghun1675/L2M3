One and half ZnII ions, one \u03bc4-O2- (O5) with an occupation of 0.25, one ad-, and one BPDC2- are in the asymmetric unit (a). The two crystallographically independent ZnII ions both display tetrahedral coordination geometry.

The N2 sorption of JXNU-4 exhibits a typical reversible type I isotherm and a very sharp uptake at P/P 0 < 0.02 with a saturated adsorption amount of 410 cm3 (STP) g-1 (a), corroborating the microporous nature of JXNU-4.

JXNU-4 takes up 78.2 and 53.3 cm3 g-1 of CO2 at 273 and 293 K (1 atm), respectively (b). The CO2 uptake of 3.49 mmol g-1 for JXNU-4 at 273 K is comparable to those of well-known anionic frameworks such as bio-MOF-1 (3.41 mmol g-1) and CPM-1 (3.15 mmol g-1).
