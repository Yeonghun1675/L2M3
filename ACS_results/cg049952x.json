In 1, the water hydrogens were found in the difference maps and refined; in 2, they were neither found nor assigned. In 3, one of the Mepyz ligands lies across a mirror plane, and thus, the disordered methyl group was refined with half occupancy; the correspondingly disordered aromatic hydrogen was not assigned.
