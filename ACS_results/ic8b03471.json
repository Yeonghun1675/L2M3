The TGA/DTA curves of all compounds 1-Ln show almost identical profiles that follow a dehydration-stability-decomposition sequence in which both dehydration and decomposition stages are made of several highly overlapping mass losses (Figure S6). Dehydration is observed as two successive mass losses that extend from room temperature to 100-115 \u00b0C and from the corresponding temperature in this range to 165-180 \u00b0C. The first loss is relatively steep, is associated with a set of at least two endothermic DTA signals centered at T min values of 40-50 and 75-85 \u00b0C, and accounts for 3.68-4.07% of the total mass, which corresponds to the release of 17 water molecules. The second loss (0.56-0.80%) is significantly more subtle, originates from a single endothermic process centered at a T min of ~140 \u00b0C, and involves the release of three additional water molecules. The resulting anhydrous phases show a noticeable range of thermal stability that becomes wider as the Ln ion varies from Ce to Lu. This fact is due to the upper limit temperature before decomposition increasing with the Ln atomic number, from ~230 \u00b0C for 1-Ln derivatives with the lighter La-Pr atoms to ~260 \u00b0C for those phases with the heaviest metal ions, Yb and Lu. Thermal decomposition takes place via three highly overlapping mass losses of an exothermic nature as indicated by the collection of DTA signals centered at T max values of ~325, ~460, and ~575 \u00b0C. These processes result from the combustion of the OAc and cyclam ligands combined with the breakdown of the Keggin-type framework. The mass loss for the decomposition stage ranges from 16.39% to 17.01%, and these values are in all cases consistent with those calculated for six cyclam and two OAc ligands (16.82-16.97%).
