As a result, the stabilities of these MOFs should be considered before they are applied. Thus, the chemical stability of 1 was investigated. Compound 1 was immersed in water, CH3OH, C2H5OH, CH3CN, THF, DMF, DMA, CH2Cl2, 1,4-dioxane, glycol, and acetylacetone, demonstrating a tolerance toward moisture and the corresponding solvents and showing excellent chemical stability, which was confirmed by PXRD (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). The TGA of 1 was also studied under an N2 atmosphere to confirm the thermal stability (Figure S8 in the Supporting Information). The TGA shows a steady plateau from room temperature to 280 \u00b0C, indicating that 1 is stable up to 280 \u00b0C, and then the whole framework begin to decompose upon further heating. This phenomenon was confirmed by the fact that 1 was heated at the temperature range of 100-280 \u00b0C for 0.5 h in air without losing their framework integrity, supported by PXRD ().\n\nLuminescence Properties\n\nIt is well-known that MOFs comprising d10 metal ions and conjugated organic ligands are regarded as promising candidates in the fields of luminescence materials. The solid luminescence spectrum of H2FDA, 1, Cu  2+  @1, Co  2+  @1, and Ni  2+  @1 have been measured at room temperature (). Upon excitation at 260 nm, the emission spectrum of H2FDA exhibits a main emission with the maximum value of 465 nm, ascribed to \u03c0* \u2192 \u03c0 and/or \u03c0* \u2192 n electronic transitions. Compared to the H2FDA ligand, a similar red shift of ca. 22 nm is observed for 1, Cu  2+  @1, Co  2+  @1, and Ni  2+  @1 upon excitation at 320 nm. Consequently, the emission peaks at 487 nm of 1, Cu  2+  @1, Co  2+  @1, and Ni  2+  @1 appear, assigned to the intraligand \u03c0* \u2192 \u03c0 or \u03c0* \u2192 n transition of the ligand that was
