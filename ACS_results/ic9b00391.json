They have different 3-connected nets (i.e., fes and srs nets) related to zeolite ABW. The chiral srs net is rare in metal phosphate chemistry and shows a moderate SHG efficiency. The present work demonstrates that amino acids may act as \"chemical scissors\" to cut different low-dimensional or interrupted structures from zeolitic frameworks. We believe that the amino acid-templated approach can be readily extended to synthesize other functional inorganic solids, such as metal phosphites and borates, under surfactant-thermal conditions.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 18, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at\nDOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b00391\">10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b00391</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Synthesis, powder\nXRD patterns, IR spectra, TGA curves, UV\u2013vis absorption spectra,\nand additional figures (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b00391/suppl_file/ic9b00391_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b00391.
