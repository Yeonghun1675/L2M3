Such connection between the Co2 clusters and the organic ligands creates 3-D intersected channels along the [100] (6.35 \u00d7 6.35 \u00c5), [001] (4.25 \u00d7 3.50 \u00c5), and [110] directions (8.60 \u00d7 3.21 \u00c5) (Figure ).

TOPOS analysis reveals that the framework of 3 is a new 4,6-connected net with point symbol of {42.62.72}{42.68.74.8} (Figure S6 in the ).\n\nThermal Stability\n\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) studies were conducted to characterize the thermal stability of 1-4, which further confirms the extraframework DMF and water molecules (Figure ). The TGA of 1 shows a continued weight loss of about 20.8% from room temperature (RT) to 350 \u00b0C, implying the removal of DMF solvent molecules (calcd 18.9%), and then the compound starts degrading. Compound 2 shows a weight loss of 6.9% starting at RT and finishing at 180 \u00b0C, indicating the removal of water molecules (calcd 6.4%). No further weight loss was observed until 360 \u00b0C, at which the compound starts to decompose quickly. For 3, the TGA curve displays a gradual weight loss of 26.7% between RT and 330 \u00b0C, corresponding to the release of 5 equiv of DMF per formula unit. After that it starts to decompose. Different from 1-3, compound 4 exhibits no weight loss until 430 \u00b0C, at which it starts degrading rapidly. Based on these results, it is demonstrated that 1 and 3 containing channels show continued weight loss during heating until the frameworks decompose, while 5-fold interpenetrating framework of 2 and dense structure of 4 can be stable to 360 and 430 \u00b0C, respectively.
