A greatly enhanced (75%) U eff is observed for the SCM complex 1 compared with the SMM complex 2, combined with an almost 300 times smaller value for \u03c40 in 1. In light of these differences, similar blocking temperatures are observed for both chain complexes, revealing fundamentally different mechanisms for magnetization relaxation. Detailed magnetic and spectroscopic characterizations of these complexes are forthcoming, promising to reveal new insight toward the transition from quantum to classical magnetic behavior.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 17, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Crystallographic information in cif format and ORTEP structures, least-squares fit of the reduced magnetization, ac susceptibility data, and magnetization hysteresis loops.
