These suggest that the primary amines lead to irreversible permanent structural changes and 1-paper acts as a one-time disposable test paper for low-carbon primary amines. The different behaviors between 1-paper and the bulk sample suggest that the analyte-receptor interactions and structural reconstruction should be affected by the paper support through some unclear mechanism. However, 1-paper and the bulk sample are very similar in their response to secondary amines: they show similar green colors and the chromic processes are reversible. The observations are understandable because secondary amines do not destroy the crystalline structure of 1 (see above), which could imply that the chromic process is not easily influenced by external factors such as the paper support. The amine-fumed green paper can bleach to the original color after standing in air at room temperature for 15 min. Five cycles of coloration-decoloration have been successfully performed with diethylamine. The results suggest that 1-paper can be used as a portable test paper for quick, naked-eye, and differentiable detection of low-carbon amines.

The green state quickly returns to yellow upon contact with moist air for just several minutes. XRD results (Figure S9) indicate that the dehydrated green phase is amorphous and that the initial crystalline phase of 1 is recovered after exposing the amorphous phase to moisture. The recovery process occurs only in the presence of water, independent of the atmosphere (air, nitrogen, oxygen, or vacuum), suggesting that the radicals are not annihilated by molecular oxygen but by back-electron transfer concomitant with water-induced structural rearrangement. The reversible color switching by dehydration-hydration can be repeated (Figure S10). The anhydrous material can find applications in humidity sensing and monitoring. It is worth mentioning that the anhydrous state does not show color and structural changes upon contact with other common solvents such as methanol, acetonitrile, and N,N'-dimethyl formamide (either vapor or liquid); therefore, the hydrochromism is highly selective toward water (Figure S9).\n\nCrystal Data for 1 \n\nC48H54Cd2ClN7O28: M r = 1437.23, space group P21/c, a = 9.7499(2), b = 18.3486(4), c = 16.6672(4), \u03b2 = 101.3530(10)\u00b0, T = 173(2) K, Z = 2, V = 2923.37(11) \u00c53, D c = 1.633 g cm-3, \u03bc = 7.068 mm-1, F(000) = 1456 and GOF = 1.007. 26884 reflections collected, 5312 unique (R int = 0.0583).
