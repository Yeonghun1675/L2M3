In comparison with the relatively small mean diameter of 2.7 nm obtained by DLS using a mixed solution of DMF and MeOH (1/5, v/v) containing 1 and Zn(acac)2, a corresponding sample solution obtained using Zn(OAc)2 gave a mean particle size of 825 nm (), as would be expected qualitatively given the larger ensemble seen in the solid state for cage-2 vs cage-1. In both cases, the size of the metal-directed assemblies differ from those observed for DMF solutions of pure 1 (Figure S13).
