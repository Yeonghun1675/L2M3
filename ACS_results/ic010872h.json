One consequence of this is that maleic acid is a much stronger acid (pK a1 = 1.75)8 because the anion is stabilized by hydrogen bonding. As a result, there will be significant amounts of the anion (HL-) and the acid (H2L) present under the acidity conditions of this study. Because of this dissociation, the ligand also may contribute significantly to the total H+ concentration and this has been taken into account during the analysis. Because it can form bidentate chelates, maleic acid is a much better complexing agent than fumaric acid and does complex with copper(II). The formation constants for the copper(II)-maleic acid system are known, and calculations indicate that insignificant amounts (\u22643 \u00d7 10-8 M) of the ligand are complexed under the moderately high acidity and low total copper concentrations of these experiments.
