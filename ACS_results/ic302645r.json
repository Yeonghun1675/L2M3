The TGA curve of 1 shows that all solvent molecules in the voids as well as coordinated water molecule can be removed by heating up to 160 \u00b0C. The TGA curve (Figure ) of 1 reveals a weight loss of 13.8% in the temperature range of 95-140 \u00b0C, corresponding to a loss of H2O and DMF molecules present in the lattice (calcd 13.6%). Another weight loss of ~1% in the temperature range 140-160 \u00b0C is attributable to the release of coordinated H2O molecules (calcd. 1%). No further weight loss is observed until 450 \u00b0C, and complete decomposition is achieved beyond this temperature.\n\nAdsorption Studies\n\nThe 3D channel structure, high thermal stability, and structural rigidity besides maintaining the overall structure upon solvent removal make 1 a potential candidate for gas storage. To evaluate the porosity of activated 1, gas adsorption measurements were carried out with N2, H2, CH4, and CO2 under different experimental conditions. The N2 sorption isotherm at 77 K shows a type-I behavior, suggesting a microporous nature of the framework (Figure ). The BET surface area on the basis of a N2 adsorption isotherm is calculated to be 1450 m2 g-1 and the total pore volume as 0.59 cm3 g-1 (at p/p 0 = 0.96).\n\nThe hydrogen gas uptake studied of evacuated 1 up to 1 bar exhibits a typical reversible type-I isotherm with a capacity of 84 cm3 g-1 (at 77 K) and 37 cm3 g-1 (at 87 K; Figure ). The uptake capacity is comparable to those of previously reported partially fluorinated or perflurinatrd MOFs. The isosteric heat of H2 adsorption (Q st) value, determined by applying the Clausius-Clayperon equation to the isotherms obtained at 77 and 87 K, is approximately 7.9 kJ/mol at low coverages (Figure ). The value is higher than that for MOF-5 (4.5 kJ mol-1), IRMOF-8 (6.1 kJ mol-1), MIL-100 (6.3 kJ mol-1), and PCN-6 (6.2 kJ mol-1) but comparable to the MOFs having high Q st values, like PCN-69 (8.14 kJ mol-1), MOF-74 (8.3 kJ mol-1), and PCN-14 (8.6 kJ mol-1). The enhancement in the binding strength is due to the presence of the exposed metal site and fluorine atoms in the pore surface of the framework. The high-pressure hydrogen sorption study was performed using a gravimetric measurement method at 77 K and a pressure up to 104 bar (Figure ). The capacity of 1 to adsorb H2 reaches the maximum 2.78 wt % at 41 bar, which is comparable to the highest capacity zeolites and some other MOFs reported in the literature (also see the , Table S1). The significant hydrogen storage capacity of 1 can probably be attributed to a combination of the high electrostatic interaction of H2 to the exposed metal sites and the polar fluorinated pore surface of the framework. Perfluorinated compounds have been shown to exhibit favorable electrostatic interactions with H2. \n\nFurther, CH4 adsorption was measured at 298 K at a pressure up to 140 bar (Figure ). The excess gravimetric methane uptake (84 mg g-1 at 87 bar) is lower compared to the best MOFs such as DUT-23 (266 mg g-1 at 100 bar), DUT-49 (291 mg g-1 at 100 bar), or MOF-210 (264 mg g-1 at 80 bar). However, the maximal volumetric methane storage capacity of 1 is comparable or higher in comparison to that of MOFs mentioned above due to the relatively high crystallographic density of 1 (1.065 g cm-1; , Table S2). For example, the volumetric methane uptake of 1 is significantly higher (102 cm3 cm-3) compared to DUT-23 (83 cm3 cm-3), DUT-49 (79 cm3 cm-3) and MOF-210 (53 cm3 cm-3) at the same pressure of 35 bar and 298 K. For PCN-14, which is the best storage material in terms of volumetric uptake, a volumetric methane storage capacity of 220 cm3 cm-3 at 35 bar has been reported, which surpasses the DOE methane storage target of 180 V/V (volume of gas stored per volume of storage cylinders) at 25 \u00b0C and 35 bar. \n\nThe fluorine atom interspersed pore surface should also be desirable for CO2 storage. The CO2 physisorption isotherm of 1 shows a CO2 uptake capacity of 315 cm3 g-1 at 195 K and 1 bar (Figure ). To determine the isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption (Q st) value, CO2 physisorption measurements were performed at different temperatures (262, 273, and 283 K) up to the relative pressure of 1 bar. The CO2 uptakes for 1 are 20 cm3 g-1 (at 262 K), 14.9 cm3 g-1 (273 K), and 11 cm3 g-1 (283 K), respectively (Figure ). The isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption calculated using the virial method is 21.8 kJ mol-1 at low coverage (Figure ). Though the value is lower than some amine functionalized MOFs, like NH2-MIL-53(Al) (50 kJ mol-1), bio-MOF-11 (45 kJ mol-1), and CAU-1 (48 kJ mol-1) but comparable to that of MAF-26 (23 kJ mol-1), MOF-253 (22 kJ mol-1), and UMCM-150 (20.6 kJ mol-1). High pressure CO2 physisorption isotherms were measured at 273 and 298 K and are presented in Figure . The CO2 adsorption isotherm of 1 shows a g-1 (at 298 K and 50 bar). In contrast to the reported MOFs with a high CO2 uptake of 575 cm3 g-1 (at 273 K and 28 bar) and 430 cm3 uptake capacity (e.g., MOF-210, 1220 cm3 g-1 at 50 bar; MOF-200, 1240 cm3 g-1 at 50 bar; NU-100, 1039 cm3 g-1 at 40 bar), 1 still has a relatively high uptake (PCN-46, 470 cm3 g-1 at 30 bar; IRMOF-6, 436 cm3 g-1 at 35 bar; IRMOF-3, 418 cm3 g-1 at 35 bar).\n\nThe run of the water vapor physisorption isotherm reflects a very hydrophobic surface of 1. The significant uptake can be reached only at a high relative humidity level (p/p 0 > 0.9; Figure ).
