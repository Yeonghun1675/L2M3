An analysis of the CSD database results in various structures with both BF4 -  and CH3CN coordinated to copper. However, in all molecular structures containing both BF4 - and CH3CN, the latter is usually coordinated to copper, while BF4 - is present in the crystal structures as a solvated counteranion and shows only weak intermolecular interactions.

Yield: 1.23 g (74.5% recalculated to 4,4'-bipyridine). Anal. Calcd for activated Cu(C10H8N2)2(BF4)2 (MeOHELM-11): C, 43.63; H, 2.90; N, 10.18. Found: C, 43.51; H, 3.30; N, 10.16.\n\nSynthesis of the Bulk Powder Sample in Acetonitrile/Water Mixture (AcetELM-11)\n\nAn experimental procedure by Blake et al. was reproduced in triple quantity. A 75 mL portion (0.04 M) of an aqueous solution of Cu(II) tetrafluoroborate was preheated at 70 \u00b0C for 2 h. After that 75 mL (0.08 M) of an acetonitrile solution of 4,4'-bipyridine was added, and the resulting solution was refluxed at 70 \u00b0C for 2 h. A small amount of precipitation was filtered out and analized by PXRD. The remaining solution was settled for 15 h in the closed desiccator containing the vessel with diethyl ether. The precipitation was filtered out, washed 3 times with acetonitrile and analyzed by PXRD. Further, the solid was subjected to activation in dynamic vacuum at 120 \u00b0C for 12 h. Yield: 0.78 g (47.2% recalculated to 4,4'-bipyridine). Elemental analysis for activated Cu(C10H8N2)2(BF4)2 (AcetELM-11). Calculated from formula: C 43.63%, H 2.90%, N 10.18%.
