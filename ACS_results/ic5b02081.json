Sr(CF3COO)2 and Ba(CF3COO)2 exhibit total weight losses of 62.2 and 51.3 wt %, respectively, upon being heated to 600 \u00b0C under dry nitrogen. Both experimental results are in excellent agreement with the theoretical weight losses expected upon decomposition of the trifluoroacetates to the corresponding SrF2 (60.0 wt %) and BaF2 (51.8 wt %) phases. Powder XRD patterns of the decomposition products confirmed both trifluoroacetates decompose to the corresponding fluorite phase (Figure S1). A single weight loss in the 295-385 and 300-390 \u00b0C ranges is observed for Sr(CF3COO)2 and Ba(CF3COO)2, respectively. Inspection of the first derivative of the thermograms (Figure S2), however, indicates that multiple processes occur within this temperature range, in agreement with previous investigations of the thermal decomposition of metal trifluoroacetates. This is further confirmed by inspecting the DTA curves, in which two peaks are observed for Sr(CF3COO)2 (305 and 379 \u00b0C) and Ba(CF3COO)2 (366 and 377 \u00b0C). The presence of exothermic peaks [379 \u00b0C for Sr(CF3COO)2 and 366 and 377 \u00b0C for Ba(CF3COO)2] confirms that crystallization of the corresponding fluoride occurs during this weight loss. It is worth noting the presence of an endothermic peak at 305 \u00b0C in the DTA curve of Sr(CF3COO)2. The process giving rise to this peak precedes the crystallization of the SrF2 phase and is not observed in the DTA curve of the barium counterpart, suggesting the decomposition of Sr(CF3COO)2 and Ba(CF3COO)2 occurs through different pathways. Although an investigation of these pathways is beyond the scope of this work, it is important to note that the temperature at which the endothermic process occurs prior to the crystallization of SrF2 is too high to be attributed to the desorption and vaporization of solvent molecules (i.e., H2O and CF3COOH) coordinated to the metal atoms or bonded to the trifluoromethyl groups via hydrogen bonding. Indeed, extensive investigation of the thermal decomposition of alkaline-earth and rare-earth metal trifluoroacetates has shown that desorption of crystallization water molecules takes place below 160 \u00b0C. Further, no simultaneous weight losses and sharp endothermic peaks that could indicate the presence of crystallization solvent molecules are observed in the low-temperature range (100-160 \u00b0C) of the TGA and DTA curves of Sr(CF3COO)2 and Ba(CF3COO)2. This is in agreement with results of single-crystal XRD studies, which demonstrate the absence of crystallization solvent molecules in the structures of both Sr(CF3COO)2 and Ba(CF3COO)2 (vide infra). We attribute the anhydrous character of these compounds to the crystallization approach employed in this work, that is, to the use of a dry nitrogen flow to induce evaporation of the solvent.

Inspection of the\nfirst derivative of the thermograms (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5b02081/suppl_file/ic5b02081_si_001.pdf\">Figure S2</ext-link>), however, indicates that multiple processes occur within this temperature\nrange, in agreement with previous investigations of the thermal decomposition\nof metal trifluoroacetates. This is further confirmed by\ninspecting the DTA curves, in which two peaks are observed for Sr\u00ad(CF<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub> (305 and 379 \u00b0C) and Ba\u00ad(CF<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub> (366 and 377 \u00b0C). The presence of exothermic\npeaks [379 \u00b0C for Sr\u00ad(CF<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub> and 366 and\n377 \u00b0C for Ba\u00ad(CF<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub>] confirms that crystallization\nof the corresponding fluoride occurs during this weight loss. It is\nworth noting the presence of an endothermic peak at 305 \u00b0C in\nthe DTA curve of Sr\u00ad(CF<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub>. The process giving\nrise to this peak precedes the crystallization of the SrF<sub>2</sub> phase and is not observed in the DTA curve of the barium counterpart,\nsuggesting the decomposition of Sr\u00ad(CF<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub> and\nBa\u00ad(CF<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub> occurs through different pathways.\nAlthough an investigation of these pathways is beyond the scope of\nthis work, it is important to note that the temperature at which the\nendothermic process occurs prior to the crystallization of SrF<sub>2</sub> is too high to be attributed to the desorption and vaporization\nof solvent molecules (i.e., H<sub>2</sub>O and CF<sub>3</sub>COOH)\ncoordinated to the metal atoms or bonded to the trifluoromethyl groups\nvia hydrogen bonding. Indeed, extensive investigation of the thermal\ndecomposition of alkaline-earth and rare-earth metal trifluoroacetates\nhas shown that desorption of crystallization water molecules takes\nplace below 160 \u00b0C. Further, no simultaneous weight\nlosses and sharp endothermic peaks that could indicate the presence\nof crystallization solvent molecules are observed in the low-temperature\nrange (100\u2013160 \u00b0C) of the TGA and DTA curves of Sr\u00ad(CF<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub> and Ba\u00ad(CF<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub>. This\nis in agreement with results of single-crystal XRD studies, which\ndemonstrate the absence of crystallization solvent molecules in the\nstructures of both Sr\u00ad(CF<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub> and Ba\u00ad(CF<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub> (vide infra). We attribute the anhydrous\ncharacter of these compounds to the crystallization approach employed\nin this work, that is, to the use of a dry nitrogen flow to induce\nevaporation of the solvent.

Sr(CF3COO)2 and Ba(CF3COO)2 exhibit total weight losses of 62.2 and 51.3 wt %, respectively, upon being heated to 600 \u00b0C under dry nitrogen. Both experimental results are in excellent agreement with the theoretical weight losses expected upon decomposition of the trifluoroacetates to the corresponding SrF2 (60.0 wt %) and BaF2 (51.8 wt %) phases. Powder XRD patterns of the decomposition products confirmed both trifluoroacetates decompose to the corresponding fluorite phase (Figure S1). A single weight loss in the 295-385 and 300-390 \u00b0C ranges is observed for Sr(CF3COO)2 and Ba(CF3COO)2, respectively. Inspection of the first derivative of the thermograms (Figure S2), however, indicates that multiple processes occur within this temperature range, in agreement with previous investigations of the thermal decomposition of metal trifluoroacetates. This is further confirmed by inspecting the DTA curves, in which two peaks are observed for Sr(CF3COO)2 (305 and 379 \u00b0C) and Ba(CF3COO)2 (366 and 377 \u00b0C). The presence of exothermic peaks [379 \u00b0C for Sr(CF3COO)2 and 366 and 377 \u00b0C for Ba(CF3COO)2] confirms that crystallization of the corresponding fluoride occurs during this weight loss. It is worth noting the presence of an endothermic peak at 305 \u00b0C in the DTA curve of Sr(CF3COO)2. The process giving rise to this peak precedes the crystallization of the SrF2 phase and is not observed in the DTA curve of the barium counterpart, suggesting the decomposition of Sr(CF3COO)2 and Ba(CF3COO)2 occurs through different pathways. Although an investigation of these pathways is beyond the scope of this work, it is important to note that the temperature at which the endothermic process occurs prior to the crystallization of SrF2 is too high to be attributed to the desorption and vaporization of solvent molecules (i.e., H2O and CF3COOH) coordinated to the metal atoms or bonded to the trifluoromethyl groups via hydrogen bonding. Indeed, extensive investigation of the thermal decomposition of alkaline-earth and rare-earth metal trifluoroacetates has shown that desorption of crystallization water molecules takes place below 160 \u00b0C. Further, no simultaneous weight losses and sharp endothermic peaks that could indicate the presence of crystallization solvent molecules are observed in the low-temperature range (100-160 \u00b0C) of the TGA and DTA curves of Sr(CF3COO)2 and Ba(CF3COO)2. This is in agreement with results of single-crystal XRD studies, which demonstrate the absence of crystallization solvent molecules in the structures of both Sr(CF3COO)2 and Ba(CF3COO)2 (vide infra). We attribute the anhydrous character of these compounds to the crystallization approach employed in this work, that is, to the use of a dry nitrogen flow to induce evaporation of the solvent.
