Four coordination sites are occupied by two bisphosphonate groups. The metal ion is chelated via O3 and O4 and via O9 and O10, forming a ring with chair conformation with each bisphosphonate group. Two other phosphonate groups coordinate via O2 and O11, acting as monodentate ligands. The remaining two coordination sites are occupied by the water molecules around O13 and O14. Adjacent Nd3+ ions are linked into rows along a by bridging phosphonate groups (Figure c). The organic linker, which coordinates in bidentate fashion to Nd3+ ions of two neighboring rows, extends these chains into a two-dimensional coordination network in the (001) plane (Figure d). The phosphonate groups that do not participate in the bridging of the metal polyhedra all stick out to one side of the layer.
