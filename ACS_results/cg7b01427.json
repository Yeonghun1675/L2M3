Each chain is linked to adjacent chains by L ligands to generate a two-dimensional (2D) (4,4) layer. Furthermore, other L ligands were employed as pillars to link the 2D layers to produce a three-dimensional (3D) framework with 1D pores (b), which was calculated by the Platon program to have an effective solvent accessible volume of 2675.2 \u00c53 for every unit cell (24.2% of the overall cell volume). The size of the pores of framework is 3.871 \u00c5 \u00d7 8.175 \u00c5 (Figure S4). However, based on the N2 adsorption-desorption measurement, we could not get expected results to calculate the pore distribution and surface area (Figure S5). This phenomenon can be ascribed to the loss of the long-range order under high vacuum for the frameworks and generally happens to some highly porous MOFs.
