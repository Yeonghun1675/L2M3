All of the reaction conditions, including starting materials, solvents, and temperature, are the same except anions, so the different ion-exchange rates herein might be caused by the different anions. For further understanding the different ion-exchange rates caused by the different metal salts, DFT calculations were carried out. The calculations were carried out using Gaussian 09 at the M06 level. A 6-31G* basis set was employed for Cl, Br, N, and O atoms. For Cu and Co atoms, the standard LanL2DZ was used. CoCl2, CuCl2, CoBr2, CuBr2, Co(NO3)2, and Cu(NO3)2 were fully optimized. Single-point calculation of CoCl2L2 was performed based on its X-ray crystal structure. Because the PXRD measurements gave the same structural information for CuCl2L2, CuBr2L2, CoBr2L2, Cu(NO3)2L2, and Co(NO3)2L2, Co-Cl bonds in CoCl2L2 were replaced by Cu-Cl, Cu-Br, Co-Br, Cu-NO3, and Co-NO3 bonds, giving the structures of CuCl2L2, CuBr2L2, CoBr2L2, Cu(NO3)L2, and Co(NO3)L2. Then electronic energies of CuCl2L2, CuBr2L2, CoBr2L2, Cu(NO3)2L2, and Co(NO3)2L2 were obtained from optimization of the Cu-Cl, Cu-Br, Co-Br, Cu-NO3, and Co-NO3 moieties with metal-L parts frozen. The electronic energies were further improved by single-point calculation, with solvent effects (SCRF = IEFPCM and solvent = MeOH) taken into account. According to the calculations, the electronic energy changes of the three reactions [CuCl2 + CoCl2L2 \u2192 CoCl2 + CuCl2L2 (1); CuBr2 + CoCl2L2 \u2192 CoCl2 + CuBr2L2 (2); Cu(NO3)2 + CoCl2L2 \u2192 CoCl2 + Cu(NO3)2L2 (3)] are -2.4(1), 16.3(2), and 19.6(3) kcal/mol, which are in good agreement with the observations of the above ion-exchange reactions.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 16, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>In summary,\nwe have successfully demonstrated, for the first time, a simultaneous\nexchange of metal nodes and counteranions on the coordination polymers\nin the solid state.
