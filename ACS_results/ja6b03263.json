Because of the symmetry of the hexagonal crystal system, the Zr6 cluster and BTB fragment were also 2-fold disordered in the resolved structure.

Before titration, PCN-134(Ni) samples with different defect density were washed thoroughly with water, DMF, and acetone, and then dried under vacuum to remove the BA and water. The samples were then titrated with an excess of CH3Li and the amount of evolved methane was quantified by gas chromatographic analysis. The proton concentrations in PCN-134 samples decreased from 7.4 to 3.9 mmol\u22c5g -1  as the TCPP ratio increased from 10% to 31%, which matched well with the theoretical calculations (Figure S19). It should be noted that titration results should be interpreted cautiously as the stability of samples will also affect the accessibility of active protons. For example, PCN-134-5%TCPP had a much lower proton concentration than expected because of its high defect density and low stability of pore architecture, which possibly collapses and hinders the accessibility of defect sites.

This work not only opens up a new synthetic route toward mixed-linker MOFs, but also provides tunable control of MOF defects and, in turn, the properties.\n\nThe pillar linker opens up the space between each Zr-BTB layer, and therefore, the porosity of PCN-133 and PCN-134 is greatly improved compared to the prototypical MOF (Zr-BTB structure). In particular, the N2 uptake of PCN-134 (TCPP ratio = 25%) reaches 717 cm3\u22c5g-1 at 77 K (b), which is almost 4 times as much as the prototypical MOF (179 cm3\u22c5g-1).
