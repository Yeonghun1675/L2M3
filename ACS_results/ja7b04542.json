Preliminary slow release performance was demonstrated by purging samples of cis-1,3-dichloropropene-loaded MOF-1201 and liquid cis-1,3-dichloropropene in an air flow of 1.0 cm3 min-1. The sample weight was monitored by a thermogravimetric instrument. As shown in d, liquid cis-1,3-dichloropropene was released quickly, with 80% of the total weight evaporated within 1000 min g-1. In contrast, the cis-1,3-dichloropropene encapsulated in MOF-1201 was released in a much slower manner, with 80% of the total (10.5 wt %) released in 100000 min g-1, corresponding to 100 times slower release compared with liquid cis-1,3-dichloropropene under the same conditions.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-1201", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "Ca14(l-lactate)20(acetate)8(C2H5OH)(H2O)"}, "porosity": [{"probe": "", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}], "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "N2", "value": "430", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": "77 K"}], "pore volume": [{"probe": "", "value": "0.18", "unit": "cm3/g", "condition": ""}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "cis-1,3-dichloropropene", "adsorbed amount": "1.4", "unit": "mmol/g", "temperature": "25\u00b0C", "pressure": "", "condition": "P/P 0 = 0.1"}]}, {"meta": {"name": "MOF-1203", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "Ca6(l-lactate)3(acetate)9(H2O)"}, "porosity": [{"probe": "", "value": "", "unit": "", "condition": ""}], "surface area": [{"type": "BET", "probe": "N2", "value": "160", "unit": "m2/g", "condition": "77 K"}], "pore volume": [{"probe": "", "value": "0.06", "unit": "cm3/g", "condition": ""}], "gas adsorption": [{"adsorbate": "", "adsorbed amount": "", "unit": "", "temperature": "", "pressure": "", "condition": ""}]}]]], "include_properties": ["porosity", "surface_area", "pore_volume", "gas_adsorption"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['porosity', 'surface_area', 'pore_volume', 'gas_adsorption']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"MOF-1201\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"Ca14(l-lactate)20(acetate)8(C2H5OH)(H2O)\"\n        },\n        \"porosity\": [\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"\",\n                \"unit\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"surface area\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"BET\",\n                \"probe\": \"N2\",\n                \"value\": \"430\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"77 K\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"pore volume\": [\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"0.18\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"cis-1,3-dichloropropene\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"1.4\",\n                \"unit\": \"mmol/g\",\n                \"temperature\": \"25\u00b0C\",\n                \"pressure\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"P/P 0 = 0.1\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"MOF-1203\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"Ca6(l-lactate)3(acetate)9(H2O)\"\n        },\n        \"porosity\": [\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"\",\n                \"unit\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"surface area\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"BET\",\n                \"probe\": \"N2\",\n                \"value\": \"160\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"77 K\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"pore volume\": [\n            {\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"0.06\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3/g\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"gas adsorption\": [\n            {\n                \"adsorbate\": \"\",\n                \"adsorbed amount\": \"\",\n                \"unit\": \"\",\n                \"temperature\": \"\",\n                \"pressure\": \"\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 7, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a, b) Ca<sup>2+</sup> centers in (a) MOF-1201 and (b) MOF-1203\nand their coordination with lactate and acetate.
