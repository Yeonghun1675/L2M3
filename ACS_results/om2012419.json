These H/D exchange reactions can be compared with other recent literature reports of H/D exchange by dividing reported turnover numbers (TONs) by reaction times to obtain turnover frequencies (TOFs). Sanford recently reported use of a series of platinum dipyridine/diimine complexes that exchange deuterium between TFA-d  or CD3CO2D and benzene at 150 \u00b0C. TOFs of up to 720 h-1 were seen using acetic acid and AgBF4 as chloride abstractor. This group also found a dicationic bipyridyl platinum complex that displayed a TOF of 360 h-1 for benzene/CD3COOD exchange at 150 \u00b0C. There is evidence for minor amounts (2-8%) of exchange into \u03b2-alkyl positions with this catalyst. Goldberg has reported a PNP-pincer rhodium phenoxide complex that catalyzes exchange of deuterium between D2O and benzene at 100 \u00b0C with a TOF of 0.1 h-1, apparently by a mechanism involving initial loss of phenoxide. Two other systems that employ alkoxide groups for H/D exchange are those reported by Gunnoe and Periana. Gunnoe found that TpRu(PMe3)2(OH) catalyzes exchange between benzene and water at 100 \u00b0C with a TOF of 0.058 h-1. Periana found that Ir(acac)2(OPh)(py) catalyzes exchange between benzene and water at 160 \u00b0C with a TOF of 9.7 h-1. Bergman reported that [Cp*IrCl2]2 catalyzes H/D exchange between aromatic (and pendant aliphatic C-H bonds) and D2O at 135 \u00b0C with a TOF of 0.55 h-1.

The ampule was then degassed and placed in a heated block at 100-125 \u00b0C. After 24 h, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. Once it was cooled, the mixture was passed through a small Celite plug and diluted with 1 mL of methylene chloride or ethyl acetate. The solution was then analyzed by GC-MS. Deuterium exchange was determined by input of data using the method published by Periana.
