Interestingly, EPR measurements on a solid sample of the dianion (2), which we would expect to be diamagnetic, also show evidence of a very weak resonance in the EPR spectrum. This resonance has a g value of 2.0033 and is extremely weak by comparison to sample 1. We believe that this resonance may arise from trace amounts of the radical anion in the lattice of 2, giving rise to a structure of nominal composition Rb2-x (2,2'-bipy2-)1-x (2,2'-bipy\u22c5-) x (en)2.

Because of the lack of strongly directional covalent interactions, the flexible character of the bridging en substituents and the different lengths of bridging en and bipyridyl moieties, the three-dimensional structure is highly distorted from an ideal diamondoid network.

The nitrogen atoms from each en molecule, N1E and N2E, also act as bridges between potassium cations, with each one of the two nitrogen atoms bonding terminally to different metal cations. As a result, N1E binds to K1 with a bond distance of 2.798(2) \u00c5 and N2E binds to a different, crystallographically related cation, with a distance of 2.882(2) \u00c5. These interactions ultimately give rise to a three-dimensional distorted diamondoid network, where each potassium metal cation is pseudotetrahedrally coordinated by four nitrogen atoms [N1E, N2E, N2 (via lone pair), and N2 (via \u03c0-manifold)] from substituents that act as bridges to four different, but crystallographically related, potassium cations (for a more detailed bonding diagram, see the ). Because of the lack of strongly directional covalent interactions, the flexible character of the bridging en substituents and the different lengths of bridging en and bipyridyl moieties, the three-dimensional structure is highly distorted from an ideal diamondoid network. This can be observed in the bond angles of the nitrogen substituents around a given potassium metal cation, which vary between 79.58(6)\u00b0 and 165.90(6)\u00b0 for N2-K1-N2E and N1E-K1-N2, respectively. The average value for all six tetrahedral angles is 108.00\u00b0. In addition to the bonds discussed, there is also some evidence for a short metal-carbon  interaction arising between K1 and the carbon atoms labeled as C6 and C7 from one 2,4'-bipyridyl radical moiety (K-C bond distances of 3.078(2) and 3.348(2) \u00c5, respectively) and between K1 and C10 from an adjacent bipyridyl moiety [3.381(2) \u00c5].

The reaction mixture was stirred for approximately 24 h in a capped sample vial in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. The solution was filtered into a crystallization ampule while in the glovebox by passing it through a Pasteur pipette containing packed glass wool at the constriction. Prior to use, an ampule containing the glass-wool-packed pipette was heated under vacuum to drive off all traces of moisture and air. After filtration, the sealed ampule was transferred to a Schlenk line, where it was layered with toluene (approximately 20 mL). During layering, the ampule was cooled in a water bath (8 \u00b0C) and then transferred to a fridge (8-10 \u00b0C) to aid the crystallization of the product. Two polymorphic crystalline products formed after 4 days: K(2,2'-bipy)(en) (1a) and K4(2,2'-bipy)4(en)4 (1b). Both crystallized as large purple/black blocklike crystals and were found to be suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Crystalline yield: 39.8%. Anal.
