At first, single crystals of both the compounds were isolated and then mounted on the glass fiber tip using commercial super glue. For the data collection, graphite monochromated Mo-K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5) from a sealed tube X-ray source has been used. The raw data were integrated using the SAINT program and by utilizing SADABS, the absorption corrections were performed. The structures were solved by SIR-92, and full-matrix least-squares refinements on F2 for all non-hydrogen atoms were performed by SHELXL-2016/4, with anisotropic displacement parameters. For complex 1, the pyridyl N atom of lattice bpe ligand is highly thermally disordered; it was split into two fragments (i.e., N2A and N2B) with 0.5 occupancy for each. The hydrogen atoms were located geometrically at their proper positions and fixed using the HFIX command for all cases except for the thermally disordered N2, C15, and C19 atoms.

These functionalized frameworks exhibit high proton conductivity as well as interesting gas and solvent sorption behaviors. All the three compounds possess 2D sheet structures containing lattice water filled 1D channel decorated by sulfonate and carboxylate groups, which help to produce such significant and attractive proton conductivity values through the extended intermolecular hydrogen bonding network composed of the electron rich moiety of the carboxylic, sulfonic acids, and N-donor ligands present in the three frameworks. Here, the compound 1 shows highest proton conductivity because of its structural dynamicity started at the temperature ~50 \u00b0C, which is confirmed by the variable-temperature PXRD analysis. In all the cases, the proton conductivity values are dependent on the temperature and relative humidity factor (% RH). The role of water molecules in these frameworks are thoroughly investigated, and it is clearly related with high-water adsorption uptake values from one side and at the other side it is solely responsible to result high proton conductivity value at higher relative humidity. Selective carbon dioxide adsorption over nitrogen have been observed in the case of compounds 1 and 3, which can make these CPs useful for selective CO2 capture from industrial flue gas. Finally, this work opens a new pathway toward multifunctional mixed ligand CPs synthesis, where the CPs can be used as alternative energy sources and the industrial flue gas adsorbent at the same time.

Therefore, the water vapor sorption isotherms for all the compounds have been studied at 298 K ( and Figure S15-S17). The water sorption phenomena for the compounds interestingly display three-step water uptake profiles and the maximum uptake at P/P o = ~0.9 reaches up to 255, 198, and 266 cc/g for 1-3, respectively. The three-step water uptake was initiated at low humidity with a small uptake, and then two-step pore-filling uptake was observed at ~9-27% RH. The pore-filling steps were observed at low RH, i.e., 9, 27 and 12% RH, respectively, for compounds 1-3, which indicates the hydrophilic nature of all the samples. It is quite certain from the large hysteresis between adsorption-desorption isotherms that a solvent-filled hydrophilic channel suitable for proton conduction is present in all three structures (). Obviously, the proton conductivity gradually increased according to increment of RH and reached to the maximum value at 95% RH (), which can be explained by the formation of intermolecular H-bonded networks at higher RH.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "Compound 1", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "127", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "weight loss",
