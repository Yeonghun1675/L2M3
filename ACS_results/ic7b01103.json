Adsorption of guests can in this case be directly (and unambiguously) observed by diffraction techniques, as the unit-cell parameters could be characteristic of the pore content. As mentioned earlier, desolvation of MIL-161 is accompanied by a broadening of Bragg peaks on the XRPD pattern. This phenomenon is reversible, as the redispersion of the dry solid in  solvents leads to the recovery of the crystalline state (see Figure S11), suggesting a flexible behavior. The dried state adsorbs a very minor adsorption of N2 at 77 K, and hence does not present any permanent porosity. As the broadening of the Bragg peaks is not associated with a significant shift, such a result probably arises from local distortions of the intrinsically flexible ligands leading to too small pore windows rather that to pore closure, as commonly found in flexible MOFs built up from rigid ligands (such as the MIL-53(Fe) and MIL-88 series). In contrast, adsorption in the liquid phase is feasible, as confirmed by the examination of the XRPD patterns of MIL-161 suspended in various solvents (). In all cases (ethanol, DMF, and water), the solids remain highly crystalline. This first confirms the robustness of MIL-161, especially in aqueous medium, as the XRPD diagram remains unaltered after weeks.
