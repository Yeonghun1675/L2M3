The absence of open metal sites in the activated material suggests a different mechanism for selectivity and high interaction energy compared to those for frameworks with open metal sites.\n\nThe permanent porosity of compound 1' was confirmed by pore characterization and gas-adsorption studies. The N2 adsorption isotherm at 77 K displays a type I sorption behavior, verifying its microporous nature. The BET surface area was calculated to be 145.15 m2/g. Experiments of H2 adsorption reveal a moderate uptake of 0.55 wt % at 77 K and 1 atm (see Figure S11 of the ). The isosteric heats of H2 sorption, calculated by fitting the adsorption data at 77 K and 87 K to the Virial equation, were found to be between 7.41 and 8.92 kJ/mol in the loading range below 0.4 wt % (see Figure ). The Q st (H2) is slightly lower than that of MOF-74(Mg) but considerable higher than those of other porous materials, such as MOF-5, ZIF-8, and PCN-6. Further, 1' was tested for CO2 adsorption at different temperatures and pressures. Compound 1' shows a reversible uptake of 5.75 and 4.37 wt % at 273 and 298 K and 1 atm pressure, respectively (Figure a). The heats of CO2 adsorption at low loadings are ~28-31 kJ/mol, significantly higher than those of N2 (~19-23 kJ/mol) in the same loading range, as shown in Figure b. The values of Q st for CO2 are lower than those of the M-MOF-74 (M = Mg, Co, Ni) series under similar experimental conditions, but they are comparable to those of HKUST-1 and MOF-5. The higher Q st for the M-MOF-74 (M = Mg, Co, Ni) series is due to the presence of open metal sites in the activated framework, while 1 possesses no open metal sites (OMSs). For postcombustion CO2 capture, OMSs are subject to water vapor and will lead to significantly reduced capture performance. The relatively high Q st of compound 1' may be attributed to its small pore size and the ionic nature of Ca-O bonding, which favors quadruple interactions with CO2 molecules.
