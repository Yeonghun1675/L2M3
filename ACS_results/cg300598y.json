Although a number of 3D coordination polymeric structures with pcu network topology have been observed with a control on the interpenetration, interweaving has not been observed to the best of our knowledge. When the slightly bulkier dicarboxylate ndc has been replaced by a longer spacer ligand bpdc, a completely different 3D network with a rare trigonal prismatic structure made from an eight-connected SBU has been obtained. It appears that this unusual interpenetrating structure could be synthesized only from the unique combination of ndc and bpeb ligands, probably dictated by the kinetic factors.
