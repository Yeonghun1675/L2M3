The results are reported in Table S8, in which R 0, R 1, and R 2 refer to the correlation coefficients of the zero-, first- and second-order models, respectively. Among these coefficients, R 1 shows the best correlation. Therefore, the studied catalytic reaction can be best described as a first-order reaction. The catalytic data were also used to estimate the kinetic parameters. According to the kinetics results, the rate constant of catalytic DBT removal (k) is 0.0106/min and the half-life of DBT in the catalytic system, at which [A] = [A]0/2, is also calculated by equation t 1/2 = 0.693/k, (t 1/2 = 0.693/k) as 65.38 min, at 60 \u00b0C.
