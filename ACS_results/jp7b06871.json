Only at 266 nm laser irradiation do we observe a reduction in luminescence intensity and full recovery. To probe why this specific irradiation energy gives this behavior we have performed a series of TD-DFT optimized excited-state geometries corresponding to different laser irradiation wavelengths. A lower-energy triplet excited state A is calculated at 334 nm where laser irradiation (318 nm) does not result in a reduction in emission intensity. TD-DFT optimized geometry calculations for excited state A are shown in  and summarized in Table S9. For excited state A only one of the copper centers undergoes a geometric change from the ground state. A bond length increase between Cu1 and N13 undergoes the greatest bond length change of 0.148 \u00c5. Calculations predict no other major bond length changes between the ground state and excited state A. The bond angle N2-Cu1-S25 at 132.3\u00b0 in the ground state is decreased by 20.3\u00b0 to become 112.0\u00b0 in excited state A. This decrease in angle results in a less planar Cu1 metal center. Photoinduced Jahn-Teller distortion for 3-coordinate Au(I) systems has been previously reported wherein a trigonal planar center in the ground state is distorted to a T-shape upon excitation. Our excited-state calculations are in agreement with this previous study. However, in our case only one of the Cu centers undergoes this distortion, leaving the other Cu center unchanged. A single metal ion transition is also observed in MO calculations of excited state A, shown in Figure S17. Calculations indicate that a significant CuSCN \u2192 Py \u03c0* transition occurs for a single Cu metal ion center upon excitation at 318 nm. This MLCT transition is observed in the highest contributing MO transition shown in . Because of the single site geometric distortion and lone metal MO transition, excitation at 318 nm most likely results in a mixed valence Cu(I)-Cu(II) complex. Similar results have been reported on excited-state computations for multinuclear Au(I) systems by Bojan et al. In this study optimization of the lowest excited triplet state of [Au2{(Ph2Sb)2O}3]2+ resulted in a Jahn-Teller distortion for a single Au center.

The structures contain independent 1-D \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5CuSCN\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5 chains, each decorated by pairs of 3-BrPy or 3-ClPy ligands coordinated at each metal center. The zigzag chain results in close interactions between the Br and S atoms of the neighboring thiocyanate group. Laser irradiation at 266 nm and 78 K results in a reduction in luminescence intensity that increases with irradiation time. This luminescence intensity can be recovered by heating the sample to 298 K and recooling to 78 K, representing a formal write-erase sequence. This photochemical reaction has been assigned to a two-step electron transfer wherein the Cu(I) center is oxidized to a Cu(II) species with capture of the halogen by the neighboring SCN ligand of the adjacent chain. This interaction can be reversed by heating the sample to room temperature. Density functional calculations for interchain dimer models in the ground and various excited electronic states have provided reasonable explanations for the structural and optical results.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 43, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting\nInformation is\navailable free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b06871\">10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b06871</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Additional crystallographic,\nspectral, and computational\ndata (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b06871/suppl_file/jp7b06871_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p><p>Additional crystallographic,\nspectral, and computational\ndata (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b06871/suppl_file/jp7b06871_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p><p>The authors declare no\ncompeting financial interest.</p><p>Crystallographic\ninformation on CCDC 1483473\nand 1483474 can be obtained free of charge by e-mailing <email>data_request@ccdc.cam.ac.uk</email> or by contacting The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, 12\nUnion Road, Cambridge, CB2 1EZ UK; Fax +44(0)\u00ad1223\u2013336033; <uri xlink:href=\"http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif\">www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif</uri>.</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b06871.
