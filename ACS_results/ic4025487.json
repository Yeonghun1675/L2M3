The quenching constant values (k q) for complexes 1-4 interacting with albumins have been calculated with the Stern-Volmer quenching equation () and the corresponding Stern-Volmer plots () and are given in Table . These values indicate good SA quenching ability, and the k q values of the complexes are higher than the corresponding values of free Htolf, with 3 exhibiting the highest quenching ability (k q = 3.67 (\u00b10.13) \u00d7 1014 M-1 s-1 for BSA and 1.02 (\u00b10.04) \u00d7 1014 M-1 s-1 for HSA). The quenching constant (k q > 1012 M-1 s-1) has higher values than other compounds that quench the fluorescence of biopolymers (2.0 \u00d7 1010 M-1 s-1), thus indicating the existence of a static quenching mechanism.
