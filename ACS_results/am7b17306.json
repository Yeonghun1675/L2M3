Nevertheless, only trace products were achieved under this reaction condition (entry 1 in ; Figure S23a). Thus, the catalytic reaction temperatures were elevated from 25 \u00b0C to 50 and 80 \u00b0C, respectively. Accordingly, the corresponding conversions were enhanced to 44 and 99%, respectively (entries 2 and 3 in ; Figure S23b,c), with increasing temperatures. It is noteworthy that only the single catalytic product 1,4-substituted 1-benzyl-4-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazole was obtained by utilizing 1 as catalyst. To further explore effect of the catalyst amount on the conversion yields, the catalyst loading was enhanced from 5 to 30 mg.
