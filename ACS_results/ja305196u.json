Similar\nchanges in the Zn\u2013O bond distance upon hydrostatic compression\nwere observed previously in a zinc phosphate phosphonoacetate hydrate,\nZnPA, and MOF-5.

The ammonium cations are\nhydrogen bonded to the anionic framework and thus follow the structural\nchanges of the framework to maintain optimal hydrogen bonding. Since\neach metal node is involved in both the four- and six-membered Zn\u2013OCHO\u2013Zn\u2013OCHO\nrings, these rings change cooperatively in response to the external\nstimulus.

DFT calculations were therefore performed in order to better understand the effect of pressure on the framework. The starting model for the computational study was the structure of [NH4][Zn(HCOO)3] at ambient pressure. The computational study gives a bulk modulus of 38.1 GPa and the percentage shrinkage of ~2.6% per GPa within the range of 0-1 GPa, which is consistent with the experimental results (Figures  and S1, ). As seen from Table S2, , there are no significant changes in the C-O bond lengths or O-C-O angles of the formate ligands from the experimental and computational data, which reflects the rigidity of the ligand due to the sp2 hybridization; ligand rigidity is also observed in MOF-5 and [Cu(CO3)2][(CH6N3)2]. Similarly, the O-Zn-O angles within the ZnO6 octahedra do not vary significantly (Table S2, ), though a rather small decrease in the Zn-O bond lengths, from 2.103(2) to 2.089(2) \u00c5 from ambient pressure to 0.94 GPa experimentally, is observed (Figures  and S2, ). Similar changes in the Zn-O bond distance upon hydrostatic compression were observed previously in a zinc phosphate phosphonoacetate hydrate, ZnPA, and MOF-5. Though the Zn-O bond distances and lattice parameters obtained from our optimized computational model are slightly longer (on average, approximately 0.03 \u00c5) than the experimental values in the range from ambient pressures to 1 GPa, the trends of all structural changes are consistent with the experimental data (Figures S2-S4, ). The computed model was subjected to hydrostatic pressures as high as 4 GPa, where the subtle trends of structural changes observed in the 0-1 GPa range are intensified and become clearer (Figure S1 and Table S4, ). Following the structural changes observed both experimentally and computationally, the NLC mechanism of framework 1 can be rationalized as follows. As seen in Figure , the Zn-O bond length decreases upon hydrostatic compression. In addition, tilting of the rigid formate ligands, occurring simultaneously with the Zn-O bond shortening, increases the angle \u03b8 facing the c axis from 88.14(1) to 89.11(1)\u00b0 with increasing pressure (Figure S5, ) and thus is directly responsible for the increase in the c axes. The ammonium cations are hydrogen bonded to the anionic framework and thus follow the structural changes of the framework to maintain optimal hydrogen bonding. Since each metal node is involved in both the four- and six-membered Zn-OCHO-Zn-OCHO rings, these rings change cooperatively in response to the external stimulus. This leads to the elongation and contraction of the orthogonal diagonals within the four-membered Zn-OCHO-Zn-OCHO rings, respectively. In line with the above, the c/a ratio changes significantly, from 1.118 to 1.137 at ambient pressure to 0.94 GPa experimentally and 1.151 to 1.169 at ambient pressure to 1 GPa computationally (). The NLC behavior of framework 1 can be ascribed to a wine-rack mechanism of the type described by Baughman et al. and shown in Figure d. It is noteworthy that framework 1 is purely assembled via the Zn-O coordination bonds; this simple framework structure therefore differs from the more anisotropic inorganic NLC wine-rack framework, KMn[Ag(CN)2]3, in which weakly bonded silver layers are interconnected via strong covalent bonds. Similarly, it is quite different from the organic NLC lattice fence system, methanol monohydrate, in which the hydrogen-bonded layers are linked via weak van der Waals interactions.
