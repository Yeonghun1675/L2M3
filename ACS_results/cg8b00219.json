This synthesis process is ligand-dependent as demonstrated by the final product only with a one-dimensional polyrotaxane chain linked by another set of noncoordinated motifs through cross-linked hydrogen bonds when starting from an isomer of precursor. A comprehensive comparison with previously reported trimeric uranyl polyrotaxane networks suggests the vital role of self-template in the formation of uranyl-organic rotaxane frameworks, especially for hexameric uranyl unit in 1.
