Thermogravimetric analysis for compound 1 shows a weight loss of 43.84% (calcd: 44.08%) between 35 and 300 \u00b0C, which corresponds to the loss of C3H7ON, H2O, C2H6SO, and (CH3)2NH2 guest in the cavity. The further weight loss of 39.50% between 300 and 500 \u00b0C should be attributed to the release of organic H4EBDC ligands (calcd: 39.23%). XRD studies indicated that the final product, upon calcinations above 500 \u00b0C, is a main phase of In2O3 (JCPDS: 65-3170).\n\nThermogravimetric analysis for compound 2 shows a weight loss of 20.55% (calcd: 20.40%) between 35 and 160 \u00b0C, which corresponds to the loss of C3H7ON and (CH3)2NH2 guest in the cavity. On further heating, a two-step weight loss of 55.57% between 160 and 500 \u00b0C should be attributed to the release of organic H4EBDC ligands (calcd: 55.84%). XRD studies indicated that the final product, upon calcinations above 500 \u00b0C, is a main phase of In2O3 (JCPDS: 65-3170).\n\nFor compound 3, thermogravimetric analysis shows a weight loss of 32.98% (calcd: 32.73%) between 35 and 380 \u00b0C, which corresponds to the loss of C3H7ON, CH3CN, H2O, and NO3 - guest in the cavity. The further weight loss of 35.42% between 380 and 500 \u00b0C should be attributed to the release of organic H4EBDC ligands (calcd: 35.64%). The different temperature XRD studies show that the framework of compound 3 was stable to 300 \u00b0C. XRD studies indicated that the final product, upon calcinations above 500 \u00b0C, is a main phase of In2O3 (JCPDS: 65-3170).\n\nThermogravimetric analysis for compound 4 shows a weight loss of 33.20% (calcd: 33.07%) between 35 and 350 \u00b0C, which corresponds to the loss of C4H9ON, CH3CN, H2O, and (CH3)2NH2 guest in the cavity. The further weight loss of 41.35% between 350 and 520 \u00b0C should be attributed to the release of organic H4EBDC ligands (calcd: 40.52%). XRD studies indicated that the final product, upon calcinations above 500 \u00b0C, is a main phase of In2O3 (JCPDS: 65-3170).\n\nGas Adsorption Properties\n\nThe total solvent-accessible volumes for 1, 2, 3, and 4 were estimated to be ~73.1, ~72.5, ~64.7, and ~67.1%, respectively, by summing voxels more than 1.2 \u00c5 away from the framework using PLATON software. Though compounds 1 and 2 have large solvent-accessible volumes in theory, neither of them has any noticeable adsorption for N2 at low temperature, which should be due to the plausible framework collapse after removing the solvents in the pores. In contrast to compounds 1 and 2, it is worth noting that both compounds 3 and 4 could maintain their crystallinity upon heating temperature up to 300 \u00b0C after full removal of solvent guest molecules (Figure S2). The argon adsorption/desorption studies of 3 and 4 revealed that both have reversible type I isotherms (), indicative of permanent microporosity. The Langmuir and BET surface areas for 3 were estimated to be 1548 and 1285 m2/g. The calculated pore volume was estimated to be 0.53 cm3/g. The Langmuir and BET surface areas, and free pore volume for 4, were estimated at 1355 and 1129 m2/g and 0.49 cm3 g-1. The surface area of 4 is higher than that of most of known anionic In-MOFs (190-1441 m2/g). \n\nBecause of the charge reversal framework features of 3 and 4 (3 adopts an overall cationic framework, whereas 4 has an anionic framework), it is interesting to evaluate the impact of the pore size, shape, and the charge on the uptake and sorption energetics of H2 and CO2 adsorbates. 3 and 4 exhibit significant uptake capacity for CO2 and H2. The CO2 uptake at 273 K and 1 atm for 3 and 4 are 91.0 and 82.5 cm3/g, respectively (). Although abundant MOF structures have been reported, MOFs with CO2 uptake > 90 cm3/g at 273 K and 1 atm are still scarce. In the case of H2, 3 and 4 revealed a storage capacity of 1.84 and 1.45 wt % at 77 K and 1 atm, respectively (). The Q st for CO2 was found to be higher in the entire studied range for 4 with a more pronounced difference at low loading, 35.2 kJ mol-1 vs 29.7 kJ mol-1 for 3 (a).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "",
