We define the coordination energy \u0394E as : 1    \u0394 E =  (     E   Ni     2 +   + E ' )  - E   where E, E Ni 2+, and E' are the energies of the complete compound [Ni(L)2/3(linker)2/3(H2O)2/3], a free metal ion, and the remaining specie [L2/3(linker)2/3(H2O)2/3]2-, respectively. According to , the higher the coordination energy \u0394E is, the stronger the bonding between the metal ion and the linkers becomes. The coordination energies were calculated via DFT calculations, and the geometries were optimized by the B3LYP functional and the 6-31+G (d, p) basis set (Table S1). Because there are two coordination modes in the MOFs, \u0394E should be the superposition of \u0394E (mode I) and \u0394E (mode II). The coordination energies are in the order of \u0394E (2) > \u0394E (3) > \u0394E (1) with values of 23.32 kJ/mol for 1, 46.06 kJ/mol for 2, and 31.06 kJ/mol for 3. This was also confirmed by the thermogravimetric analysis data of 1-3. The framework collapsed temperature are in the order of 2 (370 \u00b0C) > 3 (358 \u00b0C) >1 (286.4 \u00b0C) (Figure S8). Since Ni2+ exhibit same coordination modes, no extra energy is needed to overcome configuration changes in the SALE process. Therefore, we surmise that the coordination stability should dominate the exchange process. The formation of stronger coordination bond is the driving force for the spontaneous exchange reaction. The larger \u0394E is, the shorter the reaction time is, and the easier the reaction occurs. In addition, single crystal images of intermediate state showed that the exchanged ligand is concentrated at the edges of the crystal, resulting in a core-shell arrangement at the beginning of the exchange reaction. With the increase of reaction time, the exchange process was conducted from the edge to the center. The core and shell were analyzed respectively by single crystal X-ray diffraction, and results accord with our expectations. Referring the instances of reported SC-SC, a theoretical exchange process was inferred as follows: since the channel of original MOF is occupied by lattice waters, the linker molecules cannot entry channel freely, which lead the linkers to only contact with the edge of the MOF skeleton, and further replace the original linkers of the edge. However, the vibration of the frame and spatial change will be accompanied by the occurring of exchange reaction, which provides an opportunity for the linkers' diffusion in the exchanged MOF channel. Compared to 2, the linker length in 3 was similar to that in 1, only a slight increase from 9.006 to 9.340 \u00c5. This vibrations phenomenon was relatively weaker and the free space will not be created violently. As the daughter MOF generated preliminarily at the crystal edge, the linkers in the solution would enter the channel of daughter MOF for sequential exchange. The exchange-diffusion synergistic effect is a major cause for the formation of core-shell structures. Finally, the original linkers are replaced completely to form a new green single crystal-daughter MOF. Importantly, such a SC-SC SALE is a heterogeneous process and different from the commonly homogeneous dissolution-recrystallization. In a dissolution-recrystallization process, the crystals of a complex dissolve slightly in some certain solution.

Compared with the Hg2+ purified binding energies at 99.9 eV for Hg 4f7 and 103.9 eV for Hg 4f5, respectively, a remarkable shift of 0.9 eV can be observed in 4-Hg, which reveals the formation of strong affinities between Hg2+ and 4. These results are consistent with the FT-IR analyses. After the adsorption test, 4-Hg was isolated and washed with water to remove the residual Hg2+ on the exterior of 4-Hg. Then the sample of 4-Hg was dried and examined by Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). As shown in the Figure S17, the existence of Hg was confirmed and Hg elements are uniformly distributed in 4-Hg. In addition, according to the reported literature, metal ions have to detach large share of hydration water before they enter the smaller channels of adsorbents. Therefore, we infer that the specie of mercury is Hg2+ in adsorption experiments. The 1100 cm-1 peaks of IR spectrum for perchlorate was found (Figure S18), which shows the anion was also accompanied by Hg2+ ions into the material center. After the adsorption test, the solid samples of 4 were recovered by centrifugation, PXRD results show that the structure of 4 is complete and 4 is recyclable as an effective material for removing Hg2+ (Figure S19). This result confirmed that the introduction of amino groups effectively endowed parent MOF with the property of adsorbing heavy metal ions.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 30, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig9\" position=\"float\">\n<label>9</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a)\u00adFT-IR spectra\nof <bold>4</bold> and <bold>4-Hg</bold>.

Field-cooled (FC) and zerofield-cooled (ZFC) magnetizations were performed under an applied field of 50 Oe (Figure S12 left), and the bifurcation at 16.2 K indicates the onset of long-range magnetic ordering.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-1", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "magnetic susceptibility": [{"value": "3.73", "unit": "cm3 K mol-1", "temperature": "300 K", "condition": "1 kOe dc field"}, {"value": "3.61", "unit": "cm3 K mol-1", "temperature": "40 K", "condition": "1 kOe dc field"}, {"value": "4.14", "unit": "cm3 K mol-1", "temperature": "12.5 K", "condition": "1 kOe dc field"}, {"value": "2.99", "unit": "cm3 K mol-1", "temperature": "2 K", "condition": "1 kOe dc field"}], "etc": [{"property name": "Curie-Weiss constant", "value": "3.69", "unit": "cm3 K mol-1", "condition": "20-300 K"}, {"property name": "Curie-Weiss temperature", "value": "-0.53", "unit": "K", "condition": "20-300 K"}, {"property name": "Magnetic saturation", "value": "6.06", "unit": "N\u03b2", "condition": "2 K, 80 kOe field"}]}]]], "include_properties": ["magnetic_susceptibility", "etc"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['magnetic_susceptibility', 'etc']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"MOF-1\",\n            \"symbol\": \"1\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"magnetic susceptibility\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"3.73\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 K mol-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"300 K\",\n                \"condition\": \"1 kOe dc field\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"3.61\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 K mol-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"40 K\",\n                \"condition\": \"1 kOe dc field\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"4.14\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 K mol-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"12.5 K\",\n                \"condition\": \"1 kOe dc field\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"2.99\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 K mol-1\",\n                \"temperature\": \"2 K\",\n                \"condition\": \"1 kOe dc field\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"etc\": [\n            {\n                \"property name\": \"Curie-Weiss constant\",\n                \"value\": \"3.69\",\n                \"unit\": \"cm3 K mol-1\",\n                \"condition\": \"20-300 K\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"property name\": \"Curie-Weiss temperature\",\n                \"value\": \"-0.53\",\n                \"unit\": \"K\",\n                \"condition\": \"20-300 K\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"property name\": \"Magnetic saturation\",\n                \"value\": \"6.06\",\n                \"unit\": \"N\u03b2\",\n                \"condition\": \"2 K, 80 kOe field\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 3, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Diagram of solvent-assisted linker exchange.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"cm-2018-03621y_0001.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Diagram of solvent-assisted linker exchange.
