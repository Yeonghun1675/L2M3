This is the case for MIL-100(Cr) (-62 kJ mol-1) and MIL-101(Cr) (-45 kJ mol-1). While the enthalpies observed with methane decrease with increasing coverage, those observed with carbon dioxide show a slight increase. This behavior is in contrast with that observed with other MOF materials but resemble that of zeolites and in particular the pure silica faujasite, DAY. In the case of DAY, this increase in enthalpies is explained by a homogeneous (constant) interaction of the CO2 with the pore surface and a CO2-CO2 lateral interaction, which increases with increasing concentration in the pore. In the present case, a similar explanation can be retained and it is further of interest to note that, in the case of DAY, an initial interaction of -17 kJ mol-1 was observed which is much lower than in the present case. These results, thus, suggest that the MIL-120 surface is quite homogeneous from an energetic standpoint and that the relatively small pore size plays a distinct role with respect to enhanced confinement effects with the probe molecules studied.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 46, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we described the hydrothermal synthesis and the structure of a MOF-type aluminum pyromellitate (MIL-120), which exhibits a new type of open framework.
