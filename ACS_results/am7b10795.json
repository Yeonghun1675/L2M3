As illustrated in b, JLU-Liu46 has three types of cages with large Connolly surface area. The first kind of cage is the classical MOP-1 with cuboctahedron (cuo) geometry (M12L24), which consists of 12 copper paddlewheels and 24 L4- ligands. The second kind of cage shows truncated tetrahedron (T-Td) configuration (M12L6) with 12 copper paddlewheels, 6 L4- ligands, and 4 DABCO ligands. The third cage is the largest one with truncated octahedron geometry (T-Oh) (M24L16) which is constructed from 24 copper paddlewheels, 16 L4- and 8 DABCO. The internal diameters of the three kinds of cages are 31 (T-Oh), 12 (cuo), and 10 (T-Td) \u00c5 (regardless of the van der Waals radii), respectively (c and S5).
