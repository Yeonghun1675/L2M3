When electrical field is applied, the proton can be activated and can hop between carboxyl groups on adjacent imdc ligands and achieve conduction. Alternatively it can also hop from a carboxyl group to a guest water molecule to form a hydronium ion, and then the proton from the hydronium ion can either hop back to another carboxyl group or hop to an oxalate ligand and migrate on the surface of the layer. In  Figure S3, the hydrogen bond networks are illustrated under different hydrogen bond lengths, which can give a simple map for the proton conduction pathway (the shorter, the easier). It is necessary to point out that the proton conduction is a complicated phenomenon and that the distance between donor and acceptor atoms is only one factor.
