Two of the guest water molecules are released at higher temperature. Beyond 200 \u00b0C, the framework degrades continuously.\n\nThe TGA of 2 shows an initial loss of ~9% up to 100 \u00b0C owing to the loss of all 5 guest water molecules and one of the coordinated water molecules (Figure S6a). The subsequent ~13% loss starting at 140 \u00b0C can be attributed to the loss of the second coordinated water molecule and guest bipyridine molecules. The desolvated framework degrades almost continuously beyond this.\n\nGas and Solvent Vapor Adsorption\n\nAlthough compound 1 does not have a definite pore in any direction, the presence of a pocket lined by electron rich aromatic benzene and pyridine rings along the crystallographic b direction (d) prompted us to check the adsorption behaviour of the desolvated compound (1'). At 195 K, the adsorption isotherm of 1' shows an uptake of 35 mL g-1 CO2, with a steep uptake in the low-pressure region. This can be attributed to the interaction of the CO2 molecules with the free pendant carboxylate oxygen atoms flanking the pore surface and the \u03c0-electron density on the pore surface from the aromatic rings of the ligand (c). The water adsorption curve (Figure S7a) confirms the hydrophobic nature of the framework exhibiting poor uptake at lower pressures, which is also reiterated in the MeOH and EtOH adsorption isotherms (d). The net adsorption amount decreases from water (2.7 \u00c5) to methanol (3.6 \u00c5) to ethanol (4.5 \u00c5) as the kinetic diameter of the solvent molecules increase in that order. The lower polarity of MeOH ensures a steeper uptake at low pressures, as compared to water, but the net uptake of water is much higher owing to its smaller size. Although the hydrophobic MOF is expected to show a good adsorption of nonpolar solvents such as benzene, the small pore dimensions of 1 restrict the adsorption of benzene (kinetic diameter of benzene being 5.9 \u00c5) (Figure S7a).\n\nTo check the porous properties of compound 2, the N2 adsorption isotherm of the desolvated framework (2') was measured at 77 K. 2' does not adsorb N2, which is attributed to the high-diffusion barrier of the inert N2 gas (kinetic diameter: 3.65 \u00c5) in the narrow channel of 2' (2.93 \u00d7 5.14 \u00c52 along the b direction) (d). Moreover, the accessible void space in this framework is very small because of the twofold interpenetration. However, framework 2' manifests an appreciable amount of CO2 uptake at 195, 273, as well as at 298 K. At 195 K, 2' records the adsorption of 127 mL g-1 CO2, with a steep uptake in the low-pressure region, indicating its microporous nature (e). Steps are observed at various stages of adsorption, which manifest that the framework is flexible in nature, and there are different adsorption sites for CO2. Desorption does not follow the same path as adsorption initially, and we observe a hysteresis till P/P 0 = 0.55, below which both the curves converge. The adsorption amount of CO2 is 85 mL g-1 at 273 K and 65 mL g-1 at 298 K. 2' shows type-I adsorption at 298 K where the adsorption and desorption curves do not coincide, exhibiting a narrow hysteretic profile (e). Besides the pendant oxygen atoms on the pore surface, the presence of UMS, that is, pentacoordinated CuII centers, along the pore further contributes to the enhanced adsorption (e). Also, the kinetic diameter of CO2 is smaller (3.64 \u00c5), and its high quadruple moment interacts with the \u03c0-electron cloud of the aromatic rings on the pore surface. The polar hydrophilic nature of the pore surface of 2' is manifested by the solvent adsorption profiles (f and S5b). The adsorption isotherms of CO2 at 273 and 298 K were fitted in the virial equation, from which the isosteric heat of adsorption (Q st,f) for 2' was calculated to be ~18.9 kJ mol-1 at the zero coverage region (Figure S10b). \n\nInspired by such efficiency of 2' in separating CO2 and N2, we were further interested in exploiting the flexible structure and UMS for C2 [acetylene (C2H2) and ethylene (C2H4)] hydrocarbon storage and separation. Thus, 2' was checked for C2H2 and C2H4 adsorption, and it was found that 2' can adsorb 38 mL g-1 C2H2 at 273 K, whereas the adsorption amount for C2H4 is 27 mL g-1 at 273 K (Figure S8). 2' shows a steeper uptake of C2H2 at lower pressure, as compared to C2H4. At P/P 0 = 0.01, the adsorbed amount of C2H2 per gram of 2' is 11.5 mL when the adsorbate is C2H2, whereas that for C2H4 is merely 5 mL. The desorption curve for C2H2 takes a different route than the adsorption isotherm, thereby forming a hysteresis, indicating a strong interaction between the framework and C2H2. At 293 K, the adsorption amounts are 33 mL g-1 for C2H2 (b) and 16 mL g-1 for C2H4. The isosteric heat of adsorption calculated for C2H2 is 32 kJ mol-1 at the zero coverage region (Figure S8d,e). Thus, because of a higher Q st value, C2H2 attains more accessibility to the pore surface and interacts with the UMS, unlike C2H4. At 293 K, the predicted selectivity of C2H2 over C2H4 for a (0.01:0.99) mixture of the two gases is calculated in a similar manner as for CO2-N2, using IAST, which is 3.7 initially, and the selectivity decreases gradually with increasing pressure (Figure S9b). Thus, the easy accessibility to UMS coupled with good IAST selectivity, high room-temperature uptake, and relatively low heat of adsorption certifies that 2' is an ideal material for C2H2-C2H4
