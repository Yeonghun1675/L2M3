In the native gel, low crystallinity and scattering from retained DMSO prevented us from obtaining useful data, whereas dried samples gave inconsistent powder diffraction patterns, presumably because molecules of DMSO critical for maintaining crystallinity were lost. Nevertheless, features that appear in the structure of sodium 4,6-bis(arylamino)-1,3,5-triazine-2-carboxylate 6b account neatly for the characteristic morphology of the gels formed by all salts 6a-g. In particular, growth of crystals with the characteristic bilayer structure shown in Figure  may be relatively slow in the a and b directions, which are especially rich in sites for hydrogen bonding, coordination of Na+, and interaction with DMSO.
