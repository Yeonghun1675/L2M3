These essentially identical metallatricycles are therefore best described as a ditopic cage with binding sites separated by just over 9 \u00c5 and suited perhaps to the binding of diammonium guests. There appears to be a role for multiple hydrogen bonding in inducing a flexible ligand to adopt a conformation suited to the formation of closed structures, but this can be only part of the story in relation to the metallatricycle characterized in the present work, as two ligand units within this tricycle adopt a conformation with divergent orientation of the carboxylate donors, and interactions with the large phosphonium cations must be a factor favoring the formation of a closed species rather than a polymer. The phosphonium cations in the lattices of both complexes 1 and 2 block access to the  cavity, and it remains to be established whether a solvent in which the complex is soluble can be found and whether the tricyclic form would be retained in solution, without blockage of the two clefts by the PPh4 + or PPh3Me+ cations, so as to possibly enable other guests to enter.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 32, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information is available free of\ncharge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications\nwebsite</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b01047\">10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b01047</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Figures S1\u2013S7,\nas described in the text (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b01047/suppl_file/ic8b01047_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p><p>Figures S1\u2013S7,\nas described in the text (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b01047/suppl_file/ic8b01047_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p><p>CCDC <ext-link ext-link-type=\"ccdc\" xlink:href=\"1837482\">1837482</ext-link>\u2013<ext-link ext-link-type=\"ccdc\" xlink:href=\"1837484\">1837484</ext-link> contain the supplementary crystallographic data\nfor this paper.
