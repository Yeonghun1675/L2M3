Similar results were obtained for silver(I) carboxylates of general type [L n AgO2CR] (L = phosphane, phosphite; n = 1, 2, 3; R = single-bonded organic group). The DSC curve depicted in Figure  shows two endothermic processes at 78 and 107 \u00b0C, respectively, relating most probably to a phase transformation and melting of 3. The thermal decomposition of 3 starts with an exothermic effect at ~200 \u00b0C which may result from the oxidation of carbon monoxide or hydrogen carbons CH x  toward carbon dioxide.", "data": [[[{"value": ">200", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "thermal decomposition", "condition": "two adjacent steps"}, {"value": "78 and 107", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "phase transformation and melting", "condition": ""}, {"value": "~200", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "thermal decomposition", "condition": "exothermic effect"}]]], "include_properties": ["decomposition_temperature"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['decomposition_temperature']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[{\"value\":\">200\", \"unit\":\"\u00b0C\", \"type\":\"thermal decomposition\", \"condition\":\"two adjacent steps\"}, {\"value\":\"78 and 107\", \"unit\":\"\u00b0C\", \"type\":\"phase transformation and melting\", \"condition\":\"\"}, {\"value\":\"~200\", \"unit\":\"\u00b0C\", \"type\":\"thermal decomposition\", \"condition\":\"exothermic effect\"}]\n```"}}, {"idx": 12, "type": "table", "classification": ["Property"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Mass Spectrometry of Gaseous Products Formed by the Thermal Decomposition of <bold>3</bold>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup align=\"left\" cols=\"4\">\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">mass number</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">formula</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">intensity</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">comment</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>12</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>C<sup>+</sup>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>3 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221212</sup>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>MS fragments</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>13</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>CH<sup>+</sup>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>8 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221212</sup>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>CH<sub>4</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>14</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>CH<sub>2</sub>\n<sup>+</sup>;
