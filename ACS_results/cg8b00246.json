What is more unusual is the final topological structure of 2, which is not just layer-by-layer packing, but a 2D + 2D \u2192 3D polycatenated framework with higher complexity (d-e). There is no doubt that the additional solvent atmosphere of water plays a vital role in inducing the formation of the polycatenated framework of 2, and the slight distortion of honeycomb-like layered 2D networks might enable this intriguing assembly feasible. Interestingly, parallel networks along one direction are spatially arranged in groups of two with an interlayer spacing of 3.61 \u00c5 and intergroup spacing of 6.42 \u00c5 (a), which pass through large hexagonal loops of the other inclined subsets. This type of polycatenated framework is very similar to several previously reported structures, especially those based on terephthalate or biphenyl dicarboxylate linker. Another two important compositions in 2 are free dimethylammonium ([NH2(CH3)2]+) cations and nitrate (NO3 -) anions located at the quadrilateral channels with both side lengths of 6.42 \u00c5 (). Detailed analysis reveals that the [NH2(CH3)2]+ cations seem to link differently oriented uranyl-organic networks by widespread weak interactions (C([NH2(CH3)2]+)---O(carboxyl): 3.54 and 3.64 \u00c5, ) between [NH2(CH3)2]+ cations and adjacent uranyl centers and finally achieve the formation of polycatenated frameworks of 2.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 20, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig4\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) The asymmetric\nunit of compound <bold>2</bold>; (b) (6, 3)-connected\n2D layered network with ultralarge honeycomb-like loops in <bold>2</bold>.
