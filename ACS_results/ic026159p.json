These very weak intermolecular forces originate from the low polarizability of the fluorine atom. The notion of fluorine segregation has been addressed in other compounds, such as the 1:2 donor-acceptor salt (BFPDT-TTF)[Ni(F2pdt)2]2 (BFPDT-TTF = bis(2,2-difluoropropylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene, F2pdt = 6,6-difluoro-6,7-dihydro-5H-[1,4]dithiapine-2,3-dithiolate).
