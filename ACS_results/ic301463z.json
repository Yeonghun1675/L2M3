The N2 sorption isotherm at 77 K exhibits a type I character with a saturated adsorption capacity of about 277 cm3 (STP) g-1, corresponding to a pore volume of 0.43 cm3 g-1 (0.44 cm3 g-1 calculated from the crystal structure 1t). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and Langmuir surface areas were calculated to be 1014 and 1196 m2 g-1, respectively, which are substantially lower than those of MAF-4 and MAF-7 but still higher than the most open inorganic zeolite (Zeolite Y, 904 m2 g-1). At 195 K, the saturated adsorption uptake of CO2 is 243 cm3 (STP) g-1, corresponding to a pore volume of 0.43 cm3 g-1 identical with that from N2 measurement and calculated from the crystal structure of 1t.\n\nThe CH4 and N2 uptakes of 1a at ambient conditions are substantially lower than that for CO2. At 1 atm, the adsorption capacity for CH4 can reach 50.1 and 29.4 cm3 g-1 at 273 and 298 K, respectively, while for N2, only 1.5 and 1.0 cm3 g-1 can be adsorbed at 273 and 298 K, respectively. To calculate the adsorption enthalpy at higher CH4 uptakes, high-pressure sorption isotherms were measured. The uptakes at 20 atm are 142 cm3 (STP) g-1 at 273 K and 116 cm3 (STP) g-1 at 298 K (see Figure S10 in the ). Using the high-pressure adsorption data, the enthalpy can be calculated as monotonically increasing from 19.5 kJ mol-1 at zero coverage to 22.7 kJ mol-1 at 4.4 mmol g-1, indicating an adsorption mechanism similar to that of CO2. Compared with CO2 (quadrupole moment = 1.43 \u00d7 10-39 C m2; polarizability = 2.63 \u00d7 10-24 cm3), CH4 the adsorption enthalpy rises less (3.2 kJ mol-1), which may be due to the relatively weak interaction between low-polarity CH4 (quadrupole moment = 0 C m2; polarizability = 2.6 \u00d7 10-24 cm3) and the polar active sites.\n\nLow-pressure H2 sorption isotherms were also collected. The H2 uptake for 1a (2.05 wt % at 1 atm) at 77 K (Figure ) is relatively high for PCPs. Compared with MAF-4 (1.31 wt % of H2 at 1 atm) and MAF-7 (1.38 wt % of H2 at 1 atm), the more polar pore surfaces of 1a can enhance H2 uptakes. Coverage-dependent H2 adsorption enthalpies of 1a were also evaluated. The zero-coverage enthalpy of 7.0 kJ mol-1 is comparable to those of several PCPs with open copper sites. When the H2 coverage increases, the enthalpy remains nearly steadily above 6.6 kJ mol-1 (Figure ), which is rare in PCPs.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MAF-66", "symbol": "", "chemical formula":
