(ii) Furthermore, we also assess the influence of the ligand length on the product structures. Compounds 4 and 5 were synthesized by using L1 or L2, respectively. In 4, L1 molecules adopt a Z-type or C/Z-type conformation, which coordinate with two crystallographically unique CuI ions to form a 1D chain. Meanwhile, the PW12 anions in 4 act as the bidentate linkers connecting these 1D coordination polymers into a 2D sheet structure. In comparison with L1, the L2 molecule possesses longer rigid spacer. In 5, L2 molecules only display the C-type conformation, which coordinate with two crystallographically equivalent CuI ions to form a 1D chain. However, the PMo12 anions in 5 do not coordinate with any CuI ions. They just act as the templates to direct the {[Cu3(L2)3]3+} n  coordination chains to array around them, then forming a hydrogen-bonding-stabilized 3D framework. This may be attributed to the L2 molecule possessing a longer rigid spacer than L1, which prevents the PMo12 anions from approaching {[Cu3(L2)3]3+} n  moieties because of steric hindrance.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 33, "type": "text", "classification": "error", "content": "<title>Temperature</title><p>Compounds <bold>1</bold> and <bold>3</bold> were synthesized under identical reaction conditions, except for the change of reaction temperature.

In summary, this work provides useful information for the design and synthesis of POM-based coordination compounds. Further work is in progress to evaluate the influence of the charge number of POMs on the preparation of coordination macrocycles based on [CuL1] moieties. The electrocatalytic properties of 2 and 5 and the SPS responses of 3-5 suggest that these compounds can be used as potential electrocatalytic or photocatalytic framework materials. In addition, EFISPS curves indicate that 3-5 possess the n-type semiconductor characteristic.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 46, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>X-ray crystallographic files in CIF format; table of selected bond lengths and bond angles; FT-IR, PXRD and XPS spectra; and structure figures in PDF format.
