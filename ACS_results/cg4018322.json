Packing of the MOP molecules resulted in a continuous channel running down the a axis, which did not expose the Cu(II) metal center. In fact, the continuous channels were occupied by solvent molecules. In order to access the Cu(II) metal center for catalysis, we first dispersed MOP-TO crystals in CHCl3 by repeated washing (for 3 days), followed by heating under vacuum (100 \u00b0C, 2 h) with the hope that axially free random aggregation of the nanocage molecules would be formed in the bulk solid. MOP-TO so activated was then used in catalytic amount (3 mol % of the substrate) in TEMPO to catalyze aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol. GC/MS analyses revealed that the reaction was 99.0% complete within 12 h (Table S2 of the ). To probe the nature of the catalysis (homogeneous or heterogeneous), we allowed the reaction to proceed up to 38% conversion (in 3 h), and after filtering off the solid catalyst, we continued the reaction for another 9 h, which resulted in another 10% conversion. In the control experiment without any catalyst, the reaction did not proceed, even after 9 h, thereby indicating that some amount of Cu(II) was leached out into the solution. In fact, atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) of the reaction mixture revealed that 0.4% Cu was leached out into the solution that presumably contributed to the 10% conversion observed during the leaching experiment (). These results indicated that the reaction was mainly heterogeneously catalyzed. We tried to monitor the fate of the catalyst during reaction by FT-IR. A comparison FT-IR spectra comprised of freshly grown crystals of MOP-TO, activated MOP-TO, and MOP-TO after the reaction revealed that they were almost identical, indicating nondegradation of the molecular structure of MOP-TO; in the spectra, metal-bound antisymmetric and symmetric stretching of COO- could be seen within the range of 1609-1622 and ~1400 cm-1, respectively. The O-H stretching frequency of the occluded water molecules within the nanocage could also be observed at ~3570 cm-1 in all these spectra, thereby indicating that during washing, activation, and catalysis, the nanocage molecule could retain the integrity of its molecular structure (Figure S8 of the ). Interestingly, the FT-IR of the recovered catalyst after the second cycle (that displayed 99% completion of the reaction after 14 h instead of 12 h in the first cycle) showed significant differences, indicating disintegration of the molecular structure of MOP-TO after the second cycle. It may be mentioned here that since MOP-TO crystals were unstable outside its mother liquor due to fast evaporation of the lattice-occluded solvents, monitoring the fate of the crystalline phase of the catalyst under various conditions by PXRD was not possible.

The structure may\nbest be described as a truncated octahedron, wherein 6 vertices and\n8 faces of an octahedron were replaced by the squares arising from\nthe paddle-wheel SBUs and tripodal ligands, respectively. All Cu(II)\nmetal centers embedded within the cage were coordinated by water molecules,\nwhereas the peripheral Cu(II) were coordinated by DMA and water molecules.\nFurthermore, eight uncoordinated water molecules were found within\nthe molecular cage, sustained by participating in hydrogen-bonding\ninteractions [O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O = 2.910(6) \u2013 2.948(8) \u00c5]\nwith the adjacent coordinated water molecules. One of the peripherally\ncoordinated DMA molecules was found to be disordered (Figure ). The cage molecules were packed in 2D running\nparallel to the a\u2013c plane, sustained by the C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0\ninteractions (3.868 \u00c5) involving the benzyl CH and aromatic ring\nof the adjacent molecules. Such 2D layers were further packed in a\nparallel fashion via dispersion forces. Overall packing of the molecules\nrevealed the existence of continuous channels running down the <italic toggle=\"yes\">a</italic> axis, having an approximate size of 7 \u00d7 7 \u00c5\n(Figure ). Unaccounted electron density peaks\nwere observed within such channels during the final cycles of refinement,\nwhich could not be fit into any reasonable model. SQUEEZE calculations revealed that there were 481 electrons\nper asymmetric unit, which were attributed to \u223c48 water molecules.\nThermogravimetric data analyses revealed a weight loss of 35.5% that\noccurred within a temperature range of 40.6\u2013238.5 \u00b0C;\nthis was attributed to the weight loss of both coordinated and uncoordinated\nwater [16 H<sub>2</sub>O (located in the difference Fourier map) +\n48 H<sub>2</sub>O (according to SQUEEZE calculation)] and 4 DMA molecules\n(calculated weight loss of 34.7%). This data corroborated well with\nthe SQUEEZE calculations (Figure S1 of the ). Remarkably, the discrete molecule of the nanoball <bold>MOP-TO</bold> could be seen in HR-TEM. When a dilute solution (0.0597\n\u00d7 10<sup>\u20132</sup> M) of freshly grown crystals of <bold>MOP-TO</bold> was drop-casted on a carbon-coated gold grid and observed\nunder HR-TEM, discrete objects having a dimension of \u223c2\u20132.6\nnm could be observed (Figure ).</p><p>The metal center Co(II) was located on a mirror symmetry\nand displayed\nslightly distorted octahedral geometry; the equatorial positions were\ncoordinated by O atoms of two carboxyates and water, and the axial\nsites were occupied by water molecules. The structure may best be\ndescribed as a 1D coordination polymer, wherein the <italic toggle=\"yes\">syn</italic>-related carboxylates coordinated the adjacent metal centers, resulting\nin a 1D polymeric chain.

The coordinated\ncarboxylates also participated in hydrogen bonding with the coordinated\nwater molecule of the neighboring chain [O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O = 2.849(5)\n\u00c5] resulting in an overall 3D hydrogen-bonded network (Figure ). Thermogravimetric data analyses (Figure S2 of\nthe ) revealed a\nweight loss of 17.4% that occurred within a temperature range of 55.5\u2013156.2\n\u00b0C; this was attributed to the weight loss of the four coordinated\nwater molecules (calculated weight loss of 17.0%) corroborating well\nwith the single crystal structure of <bold>TMBTA-Co(II)</bold>.</p><p>The tripodal ligand adopted <italic toggle=\"yes\">syn\u2013syn\u2013syn</italic> conformation. All the carboxylates\nparticipated in coordination\nwith the Zn(II) metal center that displayed two different coordination\ngeometries: tetrahedral (on a 2-fold axis) and octahedral (on a center\nof inversion). The overall coordination network was 3D, wherein a\nlooped-chain type of architecture was formed due to extended coordination\nof the two carboxylates to tetrahedron Zn(II) metal center. The other\ncarboxylate bridged such looped-chain via octahedral Zn(II) coordination,\ngenerating an overall 3D coordination network. The lattice occluded\nwater molecules were found to be participating in hydrogen bonding\nvia O\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O interactions [O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O\n= 2.725(9)\u20132.930(14) \u00c5] involving the metal-coordinated\nwater and carboxylate O atoms.

This observation was in good agreement with the single crystal\nstructure of <bold>TMBTA-Zn(II)</bold>.</p>", "clean_text": "The crystal structure of MOP-TO was composed of large discrete molecules constructed from Cu(II)-paddle-wheel SBU (square SBU) connected by the tripodal ligand TMBTA displaying syn-syn-syn conformation. The structure may best be described as a truncated octahedron, wherein 6 vertices and 8 faces of an octahedron were replaced by the squares arising from the paddle-wheel SBUs and tripodal ligands, respectively. All Cu(II) metal centers embedded within the cage were coordinated by water molecules, whereas the peripheral Cu(II) were coordinated by DMA and water molecules. Furthermore, eight uncoordinated water molecules were found within the molecular cage, sustained by participating in hydrogen-bonding interactions [O\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O = 2.910(6) - 2.948(8) \u00c5] with the adjacent coordinated water molecules. One of the peripherally coordinated DMA molecules was found to be disordered (Figure ). The cage molecules were packed in 2D running parallel to the a-c plane, sustained by the C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions (3.868 \u00c5) involving the benzyl CH and aromatic ring of the adjacent molecules. Such 2D layers were further packed in a parallel fashion via dispersion forces. Overall packing of the molecules revealed the existence of continuous channels running down the a axis, having an approximate size of 7 \u00d7 7 \u00c5 (Figure ). Unaccounted electron density peaks were observed within such channels during the final cycles of refinement, which could not be fit into any reasonable model. SQUEEZE calculations revealed that there were 481 electrons per asymmetric unit, which were attributed to ~48 water molecules. Thermogravimetric data analyses revealed a weight loss of 35.5% that occurred within a temperature range of 40.6-238.5 \u00b0C; this was attributed to the weight loss of both coordinated and uncoordinated water [16 H2O (located in the difference Fourier map) + 48 H2O (according to SQUEEZE calculation)] and 4 DMA molecules (calculated weight loss of 34.7%). This data corroborated well with the SQUEEZE calculations (Figure S1 of the ). Remarkably, the discrete molecule of the nanoball MOP-TO could be seen in HR-TEM. When a dilute solution (0.0597 \u00d7 10-2 M) of freshly grown crystals of MOP-TO was drop-casted on a carbon-coated gold grid and observed under HR-TEM, discrete objects having a dimension of ~2-2.6 nm could be observed (Figure ).\n\nThe metal center Co(II) was located on a mirror symmetry and displayed slightly distorted octahedral geometry; the equatorial positions were coordinated by O atoms of two carboxyates and water, and the axial sites were occupied by water molecules. The structure may best be described as a 1D coordination polymer, wherein the syn-related carboxylates coordinated the adjacent metal centers, resulting in a 1D polymeric chain. The free carboxylate participated in hydrogen bonding with the coordinated water molecule of the neighboring chain (O\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O = 2.747(3)-3.013(3) \u00c5]. The coordinated carboxylates also participated in hydrogen bonding with the coordinated water molecule of the neighboring chain [O\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O = 2.849(5) \u00c5] resulting in an overall 3D hydrogen-bonded network (Figure ). Thermogravimetric data analyses (Figure S2 of the ) revealed a weight loss of 17.4% that occurred within a temperature range of 55.5-156.2 \u00b0C; this was attributed to the weight loss of the four coordinated water molecules (calculated weight loss of 17.0%) corroborating well with the single crystal structure of TMBTA-Co(II).\n\nThe tripodal ligand adopted syn-syn-syn conformation. All the carboxylates participated in coordination with the Zn(II) metal center that displayed two different coordination geometries: tetrahedral (on a 2-fold axis) and octahedral (on a center of inversion). The overall coordination network was 3D, wherein a looped-chain type of architecture was formed due to extended coordination of the two carboxylates to tetrahedron Zn(II) metal center. The other carboxylate bridged such looped-chain via octahedral Zn(II) coordination, generating an overall 3D coordination network. The lattice occluded water molecules were found to be participating in hydrogen bonding via O-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O interactions [O\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5O = 2.725(9)-2.930(14) \u00c5] involving the metal-coordinated water and carboxylate O atoms. Weak interactions such as C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 (3.364 \u00c5) involving the methyl C-H and \u03c0 cloud of the adjacent aromatic rings and cation-\u03c0 (2.996 \u00c5), involving K+ and the aromatic ring were also observed (Figure ). Thermogravimetric data analyses (Figure S3 of the ) revealed a weight loss of 15.9% that occurred within a temperature range of 28.1-105.2 \u00b0C; this was attributed to the weight loss of two coordinated and two lattice-occluded water molecules (calculated weight loss of 15.4%).
