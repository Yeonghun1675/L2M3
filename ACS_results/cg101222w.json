The choice of solvent exerts a profound influence on the way of the organic linker meeting coordination environments of discrete metal cluster SBUs in each framework, resulting in supramolecular isomers. Although all three isomers (1-3) have the same dia topology, their structural features are quite different: 1 is noncentrosymmetric due to the cross-linked 3-fold interpenetration of dia nets; 2 is centrosymmetric and comprising two interpenetrated dia nets cross-linked by an inversion center; 3 is noncentrosymmetric and consists of two interpenetrated dia nets related by a d-glide plane. Noncentrosymmetric 1 and 3 may have interesting ferroelectric and second-order nonlinear optical properties, a feature we are currently investigating.

The BET surface sorption experiments were performed on desolventized <bold>1</bold> using nitrogen at 77 K and CO<sub>2</sub> at 273 K in order to determine its potential use for gas separation and storage purposes. As shown in Figure A, the activated <bold>1</bold> displays a reversible type-I adsorption isotherm of CO<sub>2</sub>, which is typical of microporous materials. Derived from the adsorption data, <bold>1</bold> has the Brunauer\u2212Emmett\u2212Teller (BET) surface and Langmuir surface areas of 231 m<sup>2</sup>/g and 249 m<sup>2</sup>/g, respectively. To our surprise, no nitrogen diffusion is observed at 77 K (BET surface area &lt;1 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>\u22121</sup>) even though the framework is stable and has seemingly adequate pore size, implying the N<sub>2</sub> molecules are only absorbed on the surface of the material and could not enter the pores (Figure B). BET surface area measurements on <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold> show negligible uptake of either N<sub>2</sub> or CO<sub>2</sub> and imply the frameworks become nonporous after guest removal, consistent with their PXRD measurements.</p><p>The activated <bold>1</bold> solid was also investigated for adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> at low and high pressures at room temperature using a volumetric gas analyzer (HPVA-100). At 1 bar (Figure A), the solid sorbs 6.0 wt % of CO<sub>2</sub> (30 mL/g at STP), six times of the uptake of CH<sub>4</sub> (1.0 wt %, 14 mL/g at STP). From the CO<sub>2</sub> sorption isotherm, it suggests that there is no saturation at 1 bar; therefore, high pressure adsorption measurements are performed and show complex <bold>1</bold> sorbs 14 wt % of CO<sub>2</sub> at 30 bar (70 mL/g at STP, Figure B), where the CH<sub>4</sub> uptake is 2.8 wt % (39 mL/g at STP). The selective adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub> over CH<sub>4</sub> in <bold>1</bold> could be ascribed to the higher quadrupole moment and polarizability of CO<sub>2</sub> compared to CH<sub>4</sub>. These gas adsorption results imply complex <bold>1</bold> holds great potential for CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> separation applications.</p>", "clean_text": "Results and Discussion\n\nStructural Description of 1 \n\nSingle crystal X-ray analysis revealed that compound 1 is constructed from infinite Cd-O-C rod as its SBUs. 1 crystallizes in the chiral triclinic space group P1.

The whole framework of 3 is a 2-fold interpenetration of the single dia nets generated by a d-glide plane (parallel to the bc plane). Large rhombic channels of ca. 7.1 \u00d7 4.5 \u00c52 in diameters exist in the framework along the b axis and are occupied by coordinated water molecules and guest DMA and water molecules (Figure D). PLATON/VOID calculations show that the guest accessible volume comprises 57.1% of the unit cell volume of 3. \n\nThermal Stability\n\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) studies were conducted to characterize the thermal stability of frameworks in compounds 1-3. TGA of compound 1 shows a two-step weight loss of about 18.2% starting at room temperature (RT) and finishing at 210 \u00b0C, implying the removal of water molecules first and then the trapped DMF solvent molecules. No further weight loss was observed until 350 \u00b0C at which the compound starts degrading quickly. Compound 2 shows a rapid weight loss of about 31% between RT and 150 \u00b0C, corresponding to the loss of DMF and water molecules in 2. No further weight loss was observed until 360 \u00b0C. Compound 3 shows the loss of coordinated water molecules and guest DMA molecules from RT up to 250 \u00b0C. The compound starts to decompose at 360 \u00b0C. The PXRD patterns of 1 before and after activation at 200 \u00b0C confirm the stability of the host framework upon solvent removal. However, for 2 and 3, both structures collapse after heating the sample at 150 \u00b0C (see ).\n\nGas Adsorption Measurements\n\nThe thermal stability of the framework of 1 upon desolvation has encouraged us to examine its gas adsorption properties. The BET surface sorption experiments were performed on desolventized 1 using nitrogen at 77 K and CO2 at 273 K in order to determine its potential use for gas separation and storage purposes. As shown in Figure A, the activated 1 displays a reversible type-I adsorption isotherm of CO2, which is typical of microporous materials. Derived from the adsorption data, 1 has the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface and Langmuir surface areas of 231 m2/g and 249 m2/g, respectively. To our surprise, no nitrogen diffusion is observed at 77 K (BET surface area <1 m2 g-1) even though the framework is stable and has seemingly adequate pore size, implying the N2 molecules are only absorbed on the surface of the material and could not enter the pores (Figure B). BET surface area measurements on 2 and 3 show negligible uptake of either N2 or CO2 and imply the frameworks become nonporous after guest removal, consistent with their PXRD measurements.\n\nThe activated 1 solid was also investigated for adsorption of CO2 and CH4 at low and high pressures at room temperature using a volumetric gas analyzer (HPVA-100). At 1 bar (Figure A), the solid sorbs 6.0 wt % of CO2 (30 mL/g at STP), six times of the uptake of CH4 (1.0 wt %, 14 mL/g at STP). From the CO2 sorption isotherm, it suggests that there is no saturation at 1 bar; therefore, high pressure adsorption measurements are performed and show complex 1 sorbs 14 wt % of CO2 at 30 bar (70 mL/g at STP, Figure B), where the CH4 uptake is 2.8 wt % (39 mL/g at STP). The selective adsorption of CO2 over CH4 in 1 could be ascribed to the higher quadrupole moment and polarizability of CO2 compared to CH4. These gas adsorption results imply complex 1 holds great potential for CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 separation applications.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "crystal
