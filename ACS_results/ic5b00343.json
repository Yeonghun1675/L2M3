Metal complexes which display these exciting physical properties belong to a class of new magnetic materials, termed single-molecule magnets (SMMs), that can potentially be employed in various high-tech devices such as memory storage and quantum computers. The magnetic orbitals in lanthanide ions are located in the core 4f orbitals; thus, superexchange pathways generally play a minimal role in the magnetic interactions. Recent research, however, determined that the large anisotropy and non-negligible magnetic moments of lanthanide ions compensate for the weak exchange coupling and have yielded SMMs with the highest spin reversal barriers to date. Some of our recent studies involving a series of lanthanide complexes containing {Dy2} cores have resulted in high energy barriers for the reversal of the magnetization when coordinated to the Schiff-base H2valdien ligand. It was also discovered that the nature and strength of the magnetic interaction between metal ions can be strongly influenced by changes in the coordination environment of the metal center.

Therefore, the following analysis of the magnetic behaviors of 1 and 2 is of two very distinct systems. The dc magnetic susceptibility measurements for both 1 and 2 were performed between 1.8 and 300 K under an applied dc field of 1000 Oe. The \u03c7T versus T plots of 1 and 2 are presented in Figure , where the \u03c7T product at room temperature is 27.74 cm3 K mol-1 for 1 and 27.62 cm3 K mol-1 for 2, which is within reasonable agreement of the expected value of 28.34 cm3 K mol-1 for two uncoupled DyIII ions (6H15/2, S = 5/2, L = 5, g = 4/3). For 1, the \u03c7T values remain relatively constant before reaching a minimum value of 25.3 cm3 K mol-1 at 11 K and then increasing sharply to a maximum value of 28.76 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K. In compound 2, the \u03c7T product continuously increases reaching a maximum of 55.4 cm3 K mol-1 at 1.8 K.

This weak interaction is negligible at high temperature and is often masked at high temperatures by the thermal population of the excited states of DyIII ions, as is commonly observed in lanthanide compounds. In order to probe the strength of the magnetic interaction between lanthanide ions, the synthesis of GdIII analogues is common practice due to its isotropic nature. While we successfully synthesized the GdIII analogue of 1, identified as compound 3, we were unsuccessful in obtaining an identical analogue of 2. At room temperature, the \u03c7T product of 3 was determined to be 14.60 cm3 K mol-1, which is in good agreement with the expected value of 15.76 cm3 K mol-1 for two uncoupled GdIII ions (8 S 7/2, S = 7/2; L = 0, g = 2). Furthermore, it can be seen from Figure  that the magnetic interaction between metal ions changes from ferromagnetic for DyIII, to antiferromagnetic in GdIII, revealed by the decrease of the \u03c7T value when lowering the temperature. A few examples of this behavior have been previously reported and are explained by the variation of the effective magnetic dipole moment at low temperatures due to f-f interactions. The application of the van Vleck equation to Kambe's vector coupling scheme by using the isotropic spin Hamiltonian H = -2JS a\u22c5S b with S a = S b = 7/2 allows us to reproduce the variation of \u03c7T versus T. The best-fit parameters obtained are J = -0.051(3) cm-1 and g = 1.93(9). The exchange interaction for a pure lanthanide dinuclear system through a single hydroxo-bridge is therefore quite weak, due to the shielded f orbitals which prevent adequate overlap with bridging ligand orbitals.
