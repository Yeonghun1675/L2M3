Due to the large diversity of nets that zeolites exemplify, attention has been paid to 4-coordinated MOFs assembled with similar connectivities. Obtaining materials with zeolite-like topologies is challenging because of the proclivity of tetrahedral SBUs to assemble with the diamond (dia) topology.
