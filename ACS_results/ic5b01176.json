Coordinated water often enhances proton conductivity due to the Lewis acidity of the coordinating metal ions, but this contribution is not evident in the LaM compounds since the proton conduction is independent of the metal ion pair in each network. This result clearly shows that the difference in the proton-conducting pathways between them is directly related to the difference in the proton conductivity. The pink plot shows the conductivity of LaCo(ox)2.5\u22c54H2O (details are described below), having no channel structure, which is made from LaCo.

The electronic spectrum of LaCo(ox)2.5\u22c54H2O has two visible bands at 8000 and 19000 cm-1 (), which are typical of the {CoIIO6} chromophore. From the result of thermogravimetric analysis (), the included four water molecules (calcd as 14.7% weight loss) of LaCo(ox)2.5\u22c54H2O were desorbed below 250 \u00b0C (14.6% weight loss), and the framework was decomposed at ~380 \u00b0C as similar to LaCo. The \u03c7m T value at 300 K is 3.09 emu mol-1 K (or 4.97 \u03bcB), which decreases at lower temperatures to 1.10 emu mol-1 K (2.97 \u03bcB) at 2.0 K (). The \u03c7m T versus T curve can be interpreted as the 4T1 ground term of octahedral high-spin Co(II). The curve displays a gradual downward departure from the theoretical curve at lower temperatures (1.77 emu mol-1 K (3.76 \u03bcB) is expected at 2 K), probably because of secondary effects such as zero-field splitting of 4T1 or an intermolecular antiferromagnetic interaction. The spectral and magnetic results are consistent with [CoII(ox)3]4- existing in LaCo(ox)2.5\u22c54H2O.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "LaCr", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "LaCr(ox)3"},
