Catalytic activities of 1-3 were initially evaluated in toluene at reflux for 4 h, with aromatic nitriles (4a and 4b) and ethanediamine as substrates. As shown in Table , 1 and 2 were effective catalysts for the cascade cyclization of aromatic nitriles (4a and 4b) with 1,2-ethanediamine, leading to 7a and 7b, respectively, with moderate to high yields (45-89%). In comparison, Co(OAc)2 as a homogeneous catalyst gave cycloaddition products 7a and 7b with yields of 59 and 35%, respectively. Importantly, the catalytic activity of 2 was higher than that of 1, giving yields of 89 and 60% for 7a and 7b, respectively. By contrast, 3 provided poor yields for 7a and 7b, indicating its catalytic capacity is lower than those of 1 and 2. Similarly, with respect to the synthesis of 2-substituted 1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidines by the cascade cycloaddition reactions of aromatic nitriles (4a and 4b) with 1,3-propanediamine, 1 gave a moderate yield, 2 was highly effective and could generate the desired products 8a and 8b in yields of 89 and 81%, respectively, while 3 gave poor conversions (Table ).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 31, "type": "table", "classification": null, "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl3\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Catalyzed\nSynthesis of 2-Imidazolines\nfrom <bold>4</bold> with 1,2-Ethanediamine</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic content-type=\"header\" id=\"fx1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2014-02369y_0009.tif\"></graphic>\n<graphic id=\"fx2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2014-02369y_0010.tif\"></graphic>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 32, "type": "table", "classification": null, "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl4\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>4</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Catalyzed\nSynthesis of 1,4,5,6-Tetrahydropyrimidines\nfrom <bold>4</bold> with 1,3-Propanediamine</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic content-type=\"header\" id=\"fx3\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2014-02369y_0011.tif\"></graphic>\n<graphic id=\"fx4\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ic-2014-02369y_0012.tif\"></graphic>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 33, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>To prove the effect\nof the substrate size in this reaction, we\nconducted the processes catalyzed by <bold>1\u20133</bold> with\nthe more bulky substrates <bold>4c</bold> and <bold>4d</bold> as substrates\n(entries 9\u201316 in Tables  and ).
