The boron spectra (Figure ) exhibit very clearly two signals presenting very substantial differences of second-order quadrupolar interactions. To get reliable values of quadrupolar parameters (quadrupolar coupling constants C Q and asymmetry parameters), experiments were performed at two magnetic field and under proton decoupling. Proton decoupling allows significant improvement of the measurements of quadrupolar parameters, particularly for the signal presenting a large C Q value. Data recorded at two magnetic fields (7 and 14 T) were fitted using the same set of parameters (isotropic chemical shift and quadrupolar parameters). Results are presented in Table . Considering the local environment of boron atoms in the structure, we can attribute the signal with the largest quadrupolar interaction to the Boron 2 crystallographic position (atoms in triangular environment) and the smallest one to the Boron 1 atoms in tetrahedral environment.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 40, "type": "table", "classification": null, "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<title>\n<sup>11</sup>B NMR Parameters Extracted\nfrom Simultaneous Fit (Dmfit<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref69\"></xref>) of <sup>11</sup>B MAS Spectra of {[Y\u00ad(cpbOH)\u00ad(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]\u00ad(cpb)}<sub>\u221e</sub> under Proton Decoupling</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"4\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\"></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">isotropic\nchemical shift<xref rid=\"tbl2-fn1\"></xref> (ppm)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">quadrupolar\ncoupling constant C<sub>Q</sub> (MHz)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">asymmetry\nparameter</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>Boron 2</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>9.2</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>3.016</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.44</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>Boron 1</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\u201314.92</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.480</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.42</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n<table-wrap-foot>\n<fn id=\"tbl2-fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>Recorded at magnetic field strength\nof 7 and 14 T (spectra referenced to aqueous boric acid).</p>\n</fn>\n</table-wrap-foot>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 41, "type": "text", "classification": ["property"], "content": "<title>Thermal Stability</title><p>The thermal behavior\nof {[Tb\u00ad(cpbOH)\u00ad(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]\u00ad(cpb)}<sub>\u221e</sub> was also investigated\nby temperature-dependent powder X-ray diffraction (TDXD) and thermal\nanalyses (TGA-TDA).
