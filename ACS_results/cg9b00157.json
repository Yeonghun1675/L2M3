This hexatungstate core (see a) of 2 can be described as a pair of [W3O11] trimers constructed from edge-sharing {WO6}-octahedra (W1, W5, and W3 and W2, W4, and W6) in such a way that the central octahedron of each trimer (W5 and W4, respectively) is connected via edge-sharing to the two remaining {WO6}-octahedra, while these last two octahedra share a corner between them. Both trimers assemble each other involving only edge-sharing (see b) such that one octahedron (W3) is linked to the three octahedra of the other trimer (W2, W4, W6), the W5 octahedron connects to the W2 and W4 octahedra, while the W1 octahedron is joined only to the W2 octahedron. In this geometry (see Table S4), the crystallographically independent hexamer entity shows 13 terminal oxygen ligands [range: W-O t , 1.723(10)-1.869(9) \u00c5], four \u03bc2-Obridging [range: W-O b , 1.814(9)-2.053(10) \u00c5], two \u03bc3-Otriple-bridging [range: W-O tb , 2.020(9)-2.244(10) \u00c5], and two \u03bc4-Ocorner [range: W-O c , 1.977(8)-2.483(9) \u00c5]. Although, it should be emphasized that one of the terminal O atoms [W1-O18 i -W6 i : W1-O18 i , 1.920(9) \u00c5; W6-O18, 1.869(9) \u00c5; (i) = 1 + x,y,z] is co-responsible for the extension of the polymer structure. This hexatungstate sits on a local site involving a very close C 2 symmetry, in which the 2-fold axis goes across the middle point of the line between W4\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5W5 and that of the W2\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5W3 line (see b). However, the presence of the decorating \"[Cu(OH2)(bpy)]\" fragment (vide infra) breaks down the C 2 symmetry to the final C 1 symmetry obtained in the crystal structure. The geometry for the hexatungstate [W6O21]6- entity observed in 2 represents the first example containing the previously described W-O bonding pattern in a very close C 2 symmetry.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 18, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Graphical representation of the (a) building\nblock of the (b) 1D\npolymer observed in the crystal structure of <bold>2</bold>.
