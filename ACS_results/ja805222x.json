Its 3D porous framework has an aperture of 3.5 \u00c5 and a pore size of 11.2 \u00c5. The pores are decorated by the aldehyde functionality of ICA which has allowed its transformation to the alcohol functionality by reduction with NaBH4 and its conversion to imine functionality by reaction with ethanolamine to give ZIF-91 and ZIF-92, respectively. The N2 adsorption isotherm of ZIF-90 shows a highly porous material with calculated Langmuir and BET surface areas of 1320 and 1270 m2 g-1. Both functionalized ZIFs retained high crystallinity and in addition ZIF-91 maintained permanent porosity (surface areas: 1070 and 1010 m2 g-1).\n\nTo perform the postsynthesis functionalization on crystals of ZIF-90, we first examined its porosity and structural integrity. Solvent guests in the as-synthesized form of ZIF-90 were removed by first immersing the crystals in methanol then evacuating (0.01 Torr) at 25 \u00b0C for 24 h. The N2 adsorption isotherm for the resulting sample measured at 77 K (Figure ) showed a steep rise in the low-pressure region indicating the permanent porosity of the ZIF-90 framework. The small step at higher pressure with a hysteresis loop is attributed to a slight constriction of the pores due to the presence of the aldehyde functionality on the ICA links. Nevertheless, this does not prevent access to the pores by N2 molecules, and thus the calculated Langmuir and BET surface areas from the adsorption data for ZIF-90 were 1320 and 1270 m2 g-1, respectively.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "ZIF-90", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "pore diameter": [{"value": "3.5", "unit": "\u00c5", "condition": ""}, {"value": "11.2", "unit": "\u00c5", "condition": ""}], "surface area": [{"type": "Langmuir", "probe": "", "value": "1320", "unit": "m2 g-1", "condition": ""}, {"type": "BET", "probe": "", "value": "1270", "unit": "m2 g-1", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "ZIF-91", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "surface area": [{"type": "", "probe": "", "value": "1070", "unit": "m2 g-1", "condition": ""}, {"type": "", "probe": "", "value": "1010", "unit": "m2 g-1", "condition": ""}]}]]], "include_properties": ["pore_diameter", "surface_area"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['pore_diameter', 'surface_area']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"ZIF-90\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"pore diameter\": [\n            {\n                \"value\": \"3.5\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00c5\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": \"11.2\",\n                \"unit\": \"\u00c5\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"surface area\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"Langmuir\",\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"1320\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2 g-1\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"type\": \"BET\",\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"1270\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2 g-1\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"name\": \"ZIF-91\",\n            \"symbol\": \"\",\n            \"chemical formula\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"surface area\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"\",\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"1070\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2 g-1\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"type\": \"\",\n                \"probe\": \"\",\n                \"value\": \"1010\",\n                \"unit\": \"m2 g-1\",\n                \"condition\": \"\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"}}, {"idx": 3, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Transformation of ZIF-90 (A) by Reduction with NaBH<sub>4</sub>, and Reaction with Ethanolamine To Give ZIF-91 (B) and ZIF-92 (C)</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gs1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"ja-2008-05222x_0001.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Transformation of ZIF-90 (A) by Reduction with NaBH4, and Reaction with Ethanolamine To Give ZIF-91 (B) and ZIF-92 (C)   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {}}, {"idx": 5, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Crystal structure of ZIF-90 presented as (A) a net (blue line and black dot drawing), (B) a tiling to show the subdivision of space (turquoise polyhedra) in the sodalite topology, and (C) a cut away view of one of the ZIF cages with ZnN<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra in pink polyhedra and the ICA links in ball-and-stick representation (C, black; N, green; O, red).
