The remaining alkyl group on Mg bonds to a Li center of a neighboring unit through its methylene anion, giving rise to a 1D chain structure which allows each Li atom to attain further coordinative stabilization. Surprisingly, in contrast with other alkali-metal magnesiates which also contain THF as part of their constitution, in 2 this Lewis base chooses to coordinate exclusively to magnesium; furthermore, this preferred Mg-O(THF) interaction is not only present in the solid-state structure of 2 but also appears to be retained in deuterated benzene solutions, as indicated by 1H-7Li HOESY NMR experiments (vide infra), reflecting the strong Lewis acidity of Mg in comparison with Li. In the extended structure of 2 (Figure ), the THF molecules and the SiMe3 groups (from the alkyl groups which connect the monomeric units) adopt an alternating disposition across the Li\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Mg\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5C vector. Unfortunately a large amount of motion between the metal sites and the THF molecules in 2 (and/or unresolved disorder) adversely affects the precision of this structure and therefore prevents discussion of any geometrical parameters, although its connectivity is definite.

PMDETA (0.21 mL, 1 mmol) was then added, giving a slightly cloudy solution. Gentle heating gave a clear solution, and the Schlenk tube was transferred to the freezer (-30 \u00b0C). After 4 days colorless crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction were deposited. Due to the fast formation of an oil at room temperature, an accurate yield has not been obtained; however, the NMR of the oil showed that no other species were present, indicating that the formation of 6 is quantitative. 1H NMR (400.13 MHz, 298 K, C6D6): \u03b4 -1.31 (6H, s, SiCH 2), 0.42 (27H, s, Si(CH 3)3), 1.73-1.94 (23H, br overlapping m, PMDETA). 13C{1H} NMR (100.62 MHz, 298 K, C6D6): \u03b4 -3.28 (SiCH2), 5.39 (Si(CH3)3), 44.91 (CH3, PMDETA), 45.83 ((CH3)2, PMDETA), 53.14 (CH2, PMDETA), 57.04 (CH2, PMDETA). 7Li NMR (155.50 MHz, 298 K, C6D6): \u03b4 0.76.\n\nSynthesis of [{(PMDETA)2Li2Mg(CH2SiMe3)3}+{Mg3(CH2SiMe3)6(OCH2SiMe3)}-] (7)\n\nTo a solution of LiCH2SiMe3 (1 mL of a 1 M solution in hexane, 1 mmol) in hexane (15 mL) was added Mg(CH2SiMe3)2 (0.40 g, 2 mmol), and the resulting suspension was stirred for 1 h, affording a clear solution. PMDETA (0.21 mL, 1 mmol) was then added, giving a slightly cloudy solution. A drying tube was fitted to the Schlenk tube for 30 min. Gentle heating gave a clear solution with a yellow oil deposited at the bottom of the Schlenk tube. A drying tube containing CaCl2 was fitted to the Schlenk tube to allow oxygen but not water to enter the system. After 30 min at room temperature, the drying tube was removed and the Schlenk tube was transferred to the freezer (-30 \u00b0C) overnight. Colorless crystals formed (0.23 g, yield 34%). 1H NMR (400.13 MHz, 298 K, 0.045 M in C6D6): \u03b4 -1.11 (18H, overlapping m, br, SiCH 2), 0.45 (91H, overlapping m, Si(CH 3)3), 1.80 (43H, overlapping m, NCH 2, N(CH 3)2, and N(CH 3) PMDETA), 3.93 (2H, s, OCH 2). 7Li NMR (155.50 MHz, 298 K, C6D6): \u03b4 0.20. The relatively low solubility of 7 in C6D6 solution precluded the collection of a meaningful 13C{1H} NMR spectrum.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "[LiMg(CH2SiMe3)3]", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula":
