The result of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicates that 1 readily lost DMF and H2O molecules in the temperature range of 30-240 \u00b0C, and the desolvated 1 is stable up to 380 \u00b0C (Figure S4 in ). Furthermore, the DMF and H2O molecules in 1 can be removed under high vacuum at 200 \u00b0C to obtain a desolvated 1 (Figure S4 in ), and the result of PXRD measurement demonstrates that desolvated 1 retains its structural integrity (Figure S3 in ). The porosity of 1 was examined by the gas sorption measurements, which indicates that it can adsorb N2, H2, and CO2 at low temperatures. As shown in Figure , N2 adsorption measurement for 1 at 77 K and 1 atm revealed type-I isotherm with saturated N2 uptake of 79.8 cm3 g-1 (STP), which is characteristic of a microporous material, corresponding to a BET surface area of 232.5 m2 g-1. CO2 adsorption isotherm demonstrated that 1 can store up to 74.9 cm3 g-1 (STP) CO2 at 195 K/1 atm. Furthermore, the H2 adsorption isotherm of 1 measured at 77 K demonstrated an uptake of 66.9 cm3 g-1 (STP) at 1 bar (Figure S5 in ).\n\nFurther, the CO2 sorption was performed at near room temperature to study the interactions between CO2 and the host framework of 1. As shown in Figure a, the CO2 uptakes at 1 bar are 37.7 cm3 g-1 at 273 K and 26.5 cm3 g-1 at 298 K. Interestingly, the CO2 sorption isotherms have hysteresis characteristics at both temperatures, which indicate that the framework of 1 maybe has relatively strong interactions with CO2. In order to understand the interactions between CO2 and the framework of 1, we calculated the isosteric heat Q st of CO2 by fitting the 273 and 298 K isotherms to the virial equation (Figure S6 in ).
