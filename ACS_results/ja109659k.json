To date there is no other MOF formed directly from Cu4(\u03bc4-Cl) and BTC, so we first chose HKUST-1 [Cu3(BTC)2], which is formed by Cu and BTC too. It was found that HKUST-1 adsorbs 8.2 DMMP molecules per formula unit at 298 K (Figure ). In comparison with MOF-5, HKUST-1 reaches a higher DMMP adsorption despite its lower BET surface area (1507 m2 g-1) and pore volume (0.75 cm3 g-1). This occurs mainly because solvent molecules in HKUST-1 can be removed to give coordinatively unsaturated metal centers (UMCs), which are similar to EMCs and could increase the absorption capability. In addition, we measured the dynamic DMMP adsorption of NENU-3 {(C4H12N)2[Cu12(BTC)8\u22c512H2O][HPW12O40]\u22c525H2O}, which was constructed from HKUST-1 and a polyoxoanion [PW12O40]3-. As shown in Figure , NENU-3 adsorbs 11.5 DMMP molecules per formula unit at 298 K, with the lowest BET surface area (405 m2 g-1) and pore volume (0.31 cm3 g-1). This value is higher than that of either MOF-5 or the parent MOF HKUST-1 but lower than that of NENU-11 (Table ). Because of the higher molecular weights of POMs, the adsorption amount of DMMP on a mass basis for NENU-11 is lower. MOF-5 with its larger pore volume adsorbs 0.90 g of DMMP/g of sorbent, HKUST-1 0.83 g g-1, and NENU-11 0.24 g g-1, respectively. () However, POM guests cannot be ignored for their contribution to the DMMP adsorption. The adsorption amount on a volume basis for NENU-11 is competitive with that of the single MOFs.
