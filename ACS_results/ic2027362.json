Presence of magnetic property and porosity is\nnot a common phenomena in MOFs as magnetic interactions are good within\nshort-range while porosity requires long linkers. But use of [Mn<sub>6</sub>] core based node allows the short-range interactions, and\nconnecting these nodes by some other linkers can also generate porosity.\nMOFs are attractive because of their modular nature of porosity and\nare also very useful for selective gas adsorption. This can be attained\nby using short bridging ligands and increasing the bulkiness of the\nligands which constrict the apertures of porous MOFs. In complex <bold>1</bold> the metal coordinated bulky ligand, phenylacetate, and the\nshort bridging ligand pyz satisfy these criteria. To examine the influence\nof size and polarity of the different adsorbates, we have studied\nthe adsorption properties of the framework of compound <bold>1</bold> with different gases (N<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>). The sorption\nisotherm of N<sub>2</sub> shows no uptake for N<sub>2</sub> (kinetic\ndiameter, 3.64 \u00c5) at 77 K.

Thus, each pyz bridge connects two Mn4 atoms of neighboring clusters along the c axis or two Mn3 atoms (also of neighboring clusters) along the a axis, creating a 3D distorted porous diamond-like framework that can be described as a (6,4) net (Figure ). The complex has potential guest accessible void volume of 81.7 \u00c53 (1.0%) per unit cell volume.\n\nSelective CO2 Adsorption\n\nSince the invention of synthetic-zeolites in the 1940s, with the appearance of various adsorbents and the progress of adsorption-based separation techniques, adsorption has become a key gas separation device in industry. Presence of magnetic property and porosity is not a common phenomena in MOFs as magnetic interactions are good within short-range while porosity requires long linkers. But use of [Mn6] core based node allows the short-range interactions, and connecting these nodes by some other linkers can also generate porosity. MOFs are attractive because of their modular nature of porosity and are also very useful for selective gas adsorption. This can be attained by using short bridging ligands and increasing the bulkiness of the ligands which constrict the apertures of porous MOFs. In complex 1 the metal coordinated bulky ligand, phenylacetate, and the short bridging ligand pyz satisfy these criteria. To examine the influence of size and polarity of the different adsorbates, we have studied the adsorption properties of the framework of compound 1 with different gases (N2 and CO2). The sorption isotherm of N2 shows no uptake for N2 (kinetic diameter, 3.64 \u00c5) at 77 K. This is expected as the as-synthesized compound does not contain any accessible channel. But to our surprise at 195 K it adsorbs CO2 (kinetic diameter, 3.3 \u00c5) gas and at ~1 atm pressure it adsorbs up to 7 wt % of CO2 (Figure ).\n\nMagnetic Properties\n\nThe thermal variation of the product of the molar magnetic susceptibility per [Mn6] cluster, times the temperature (\u03c7m T) of compound 1 shows a room temperature value of about 19.2 emu K mol-1, which is lower than the expected value (23.5 emu K mol-1) for four Mn(II) (S = 5/2) and two Mn(III) (S = 2) isolated ions (Figure ). When the temperature is lowered, the \u03c7m T product shows a progressive decrease down to about 50 K and a more abrupt decrease at lower temperatures to reach a value of about 0.5 emu K mol-1 at 2 K. This behavior suggests the presence of predominant antiferromagnetic exchange interactions inside the [Mn6] cluster which are already operative at high temperatures, as indicated by the low \u03c7m T value observed at room temperature. A confirmation of this behavior is provided by the plot of the thermal variation of \u03c7m that shows a maximum at about 20 K (inset in Figure ).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF", "symbol": "1",
