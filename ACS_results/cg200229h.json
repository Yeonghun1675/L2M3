The asymmetric unit of <bold>1</bold> consists of one Zn atom, half of a ligand L, and one acetonitrile guest molecule. As shown in Figure , the Zn atom is in a distorted tetrahedral geometry, coordinated by four O atoms from four different L ligands with the Zn\u2013O distances ranging from 1.907(3) to 1.969(3) \u00c5. The bond angles around the Zn atom are in the range of 98.64(13)\u2013123.49(13)\u00b0. The L ligand is fully deprotonated and connects to eight Zn atoms in bis-monodenate coordination fashion. It is in a nearly planar geometry with the center sitting on a 2-fold symmetry axis. The dihedral angles are 23.0(2) and 10.3(2)\u00b0 between the two middle biphenyl and two side-middle phenyl rings, respectively. The ligands are parallel aligned and interconnected with neighboring ones via common Zn atoms to form a 2D sheet with elliptical rings of 7.7 \u00d7 21.1 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> in diameters (Figure ). The 2D sheets stack in an eclipsed manner along the <italic toggle=\"yes\">c</italic>-axis and interlink with each other via sharing common O vertices on the ZnO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra between two adjacent layers. This gives rise to a 3D framework with one-dimensional elliptical ring channels along the <italic toggle=\"yes\">c</italic>-axis. Inside the channels reside the disordered acetonitrile molecules as guests, which form weak van der Waals interactions with the host framework. PLATON calculations show that the guest accessible volume (521.9 \u00c5<sup>3</sup> per unit cell) comprises 17.8% of the unit cell volume.</p><p>From a topological viewpoint, the framework of <bold>1</bold> can be viewed as constructed from rod-shaped secondary building units (SBUs). As shown in Figure , the Zn\u2013O\u2013C rods are composed of 4-coordinated Zn centers that are bound by four carboxyl groups from four ligands. The rods run along the <italic toggle=\"yes\">c</italic> crystallographic direction and are linked together by the 4-connecting ligands to four other rods to give rod packing of <bold>pcu</bold> type and elliptical channels of 7.7 \u00d7 8.4 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> in the <italic toggle=\"yes\">c</italic> direction.</p><p>Compound <bold>2</bold> possesses a 3D framework built from 4-connecting Zn<sub>2</sub>(OOC)<sub>4</sub> units and ligands L (Figure ). The binuclear units are tetrahedrally linked by four carboxyl groups from four L ligands, while ligands L are connecting four Zn<sub>2</sub>(OOC)<sub>4</sub> units. Considering the Zn<sub>2</sub>(OOC)<sub>4</sub> unit and the L ligand as a respective 4-connecting node, the framework of <bold>2</bold> can thus be reduced to a known 4,4-connected <bold>sra</bold> net. The net is 2-fold interpenetrated, which eliminates parts of its large voids. Small rectangular pore channels measuring 8.5 \u00d7 9.5 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> run along the <italic toggle=\"yes\">a</italic> axis, in which water molecules reside as guests. The guest water molecules form extensive hydrogen bonds with the framework atoms () to stabilize the structure. PLATON calculations show that the guest accessible volume (1084.4 \u00c5<sup>3</sup> per unit cell) comprises 29.9% of the unit cell volume.</p><title>Thermal Analysis</title><p>To estimate the stability of complexes <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>4</bold>, the TG analyses were carried out, as shown in Figure . For complex <bold>1</bold>, the weight loss of 2.5% from RT to 450 \u00b0C corresponds to partial departure of acetonitrile guests (calcd 5.7%). The structure subsequently collapsed with an abrupt weight loss of 32.3% as a result of ligand decomposition (calcd 29.9% for OCH<sub>2</sub>PhPhCH<sub>2</sub>O). Complex <bold>2</bold> lost surface water from RT to ca. 100 \u00b0C (ca. 3.8%) and three guest water molecules (observed 3.3%, calcd 3.6%) from ca. 100 to ca. 160 \u00b0C. The coordinate water molecules and two guest water molecules were lost from ca. 160 to ca. 205 \u00b0C (observed 7.9%, calcd 7.2%).

For complex <bold>3</bold>, the weight loss of 2.6% below ca. 50 \u00b0C is likely due to the loss of surface water. The loss of guest and coordinate water molecules occurred from ca. 65 to ca. 300 \u00b0C (observed 9.2%, calcd 10.0%).

For complex <bold>4</bold>, the weight loss of 12.7% from RT to ca. 130 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of guest water and DMA molecules (calcd 13.0%). The loss of coordinate water and DMA molecules started from ca. 150 to ca. 250 \u00b0C (observed 13.2%, calcd 13.0%).

[Zn2(L)]\u22c5CH3CN (1)\n\nCompound 1 crystallizes in a monoclinic space group C2/c. The asymmetric unit of 1 consists of one Zn atom, half of a ligand L, and one acetonitrile guest molecule. As shown in Figure , the Zn atom is in a distorted tetrahedral geometry, coordinated by four O atoms from four different L ligands with the Zn-O distances ranging from 1.907(3) to 1.969(3) \u00c5. The bond angles around the Zn atom are in the range of 98.64(13)-123.49(13)\u00b0. The L ligand is fully deprotonated and connects to eight Zn atoms in bis-monodenate coordination fashion. It is in a nearly planar geometry with the center sitting on a 2-fold symmetry axis. The dihedral angles are 23.0(2) and 10.3(2)\u00b0 between the two middle biphenyl and two side-middle phenyl rings, respectively. The ligands are parallel aligned and interconnected with neighboring ones via common Zn atoms to form a 2D sheet with elliptical rings of 7.7 \u00d7 21.1 \u00c52 in diameters (Figure ). The 2D sheets stack in an eclipsed manner along the c-axis and interlink with each other via sharing common O vertices on the ZnO4 tetrahedra between two adjacent layers. This gives rise to a 3D framework with one-dimensional elliptical ring channels along the c-axis. Inside the channels reside the disordered acetonitrile molecules as guests, which form weak van der Waals interactions with the host framework. PLATON calculations show that the guest accessible volume (521.9 \u00c53 per unit cell) comprises 17.8% of the unit cell volume.\n\nFrom a topological viewpoint, the framework of 1 can be viewed as constructed from rod-shaped secondary building units (SBUs). As shown in Figure , the Zn-O-C rods are composed of 4-coordinated Zn centers that are bound by four carboxyl groups from four ligands. The rods run along the c crystallographic direction and are linked together by the 4-connecting ligands to four other rods to give rod packing of pcu type and elliptical channels of 7.7 \u00d7 8.4 \u00c52 in the c direction.\n\nCompound 2 possesses a 3D framework built from 4-connecting Zn2(OOC)4 units and ligands L (Figure ). The binuclear units are tetrahedrally linked by four carboxyl groups from four L ligands, while ligands L are connecting four Zn2(OOC)4 units. Considering the Zn2(OOC)4 unit and the L ligand as a respective 4-connecting node, the framework of 2 can thus be reduced to a known 4,4-connected sra net. The net is 2-fold interpenetrated, which eliminates parts of its large voids. Small rectangular pore channels measuring 8.5 \u00d7 9.5 \u00c52 run along the a axis, in which water molecules reside as guests. The guest water molecules form extensive hydrogen bonds with the framework atoms () to stabilize the structure. PLATON calculations show that the guest accessible volume (1084.4 \u00c53 per unit cell) comprises 29.9% of the unit cell volume.\n\nThermal Analysis\n\nTo estimate the stability of complexes 1-4, the TG analyses were carried out, as shown in Figure . For complex 1, the weight loss of 2.5% from RT to 450 \u00b0C corresponds to partial departure of acetonitrile guests (calcd 5.7%). The structure subsequently collapsed with an abrupt weight loss of 32.3% as a result of ligand decomposition (calcd 29.9% for OCH2PhPhCH2O). Complex 2 lost surface water from RT to ca. 100 \u00b0C (ca. 3.8%) and three guest water molecules (observed 3.3%, calcd 3.6%) from ca. 100 to ca. 160 \u00b0C. The coordinate water molecules and two guest water molecules were lost from ca. 160 to ca. 205 \u00b0C (observed 7.9%, calcd 7.2%). The framework began to decompose at ca. 400 \u00b0C (observed 24.3%, calcd 24.3% for CH2PhPhCH2). For complex 3, the weight loss of 2.6% below ca. 50 \u00b0C is likely due to the loss of surface water. The loss of guest and coordinate water molecules occurred from ca. 65 to ca. 300 \u00b0C (observed 9.2%, calcd 10.0%). The framework collapsed from ca. 410 \u00b0C with losses of parts of ligands (observed 26.0%, calcd 25.3% for CH2PhPhCH2). For complex 4, the weight loss of 12.7% from RT to ca. 130 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of guest water and DMA molecules (calcd 13.0%). The loss of coordinate water and DMA molecules started from ca. 150 to ca. 250 \u00b0C (observed 13.2%, calcd 13.0%). The further weight loss is due to the decomposition of the ligands (observed 21.9%, calcd 22.6% for CH2PhPhCH2).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "crystal
