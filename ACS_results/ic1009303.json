The sharp continual weight loss started at 370 \u00b0C, corresponding to decomposition of the organic ligands. Its Fourier transform IR spectrum exhibits a strong O-H stretching band centered at 3465 cm-1 due to the existence of a H2O molecule and a hydroxyl group in the structure. Two sharp peaks that appear at 1618 and 1434 cm-1 are the expected absorptions for the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the carboxylate groups, respectively. The sharp absorption at 631 cm-1 can be assigned to the C-S stretching vibration of the SIP ligand.\n\nReferences\n\nCrystal data: C21H20N2O9SZn2, M r = 607.19, monoclinic, space group Cc, a = 20.907(8) \u00c5, b = 7.810(3) \u00c5, c = 15.367(6) \u00c5, \u03b2 = 117.4100(10)o, V = 2227.3(15) \u00c53, Z = 4, \u03c1calc = 1.811 mg/m3, \u03bc = 2.305 mm-1, R1 = 0.0366, wR2 = 0.0690 [I > 2\u03c3(I)], Flack parameter 0.033(14).", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "1", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "C21H20N2O9SZn2"}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "170 and 210", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "release of the coordinated H2O molecule", "condition": ""}, {"value": "370", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "decomposition of the organic ligands", "condition": ""}], "chemical formula weight": [{"value": "607.19", "unit": "g/mol", "condition": ""}], "crystal system": [{"value": "monoclinic", "condition": ""}], "space group": [{"value": "Cc", "condition": ""}], "lattice parameters": [{"value": {"a": "20.907", "b": "7.810", "c": "15.367", "alpha": "", "beta": "117.4100", "gamma": "", "condition": ""}}], "density": [{"value": "1.811", "unit": "mg/m3", "condition": ""}]}]]], "include_properties": ["decomposition_temperature", "chemical_formula_weight", "crystal_system", "space_group", "lattice_parameters", "density"], "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['property']", "text-property-type": "['decomposition_temperature', 'chemical_formula_weight', 'crystal_system', 'space_group', 'lattice_parameters', 'density']", "text-property-extract": "```JSON\n[{\n\"meta\":{\"name\":\"1\", \"symbol\":\"1\", \"chemical formula\":\"C21H20N2O9SZn2\"},\n\"decomposition temperature\": [\n    {\n        \"value\": \"170 and 210\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"release of the coordinated H2O molecule\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"value\": \"370\",\n        \"unit\": \"\u00b0C\",\n        \"type\": \"decomposition of the organic ligands\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n    }\n],\n\"chemical formula weight\": [\n    {\n        \"value\": \"607.19\",\n        \"unit\": \"g/mol\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n    }\n],\n\"crystal system\": [\n    {\n        \"value\": \"monoclinic\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n    }\n],\n\"space group\": [\n    {\n        \"value\": \"Cc\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n    }\n],\n\"lattice parameters\": [\n    {\n        \"value\": {\n            \"a\": \"20.907\",\n            \"b\": \"7.810\",\n            \"c\": \"15.367\",\n            \"alpha\": \"\",\n            \"beta\": \"117.4100\",\n            \"gamma\": \"\",\n            \"condition\": \"\"\n        }\n    }\n],\n\"density\": [\n    {\n        \"value\": \"1.811\",\n        \"unit\": \"mg/m3\",\n        \"condition\": \"\"\n    }\n]\n}]\n```"}}, {"idx": 6, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>ORTEP drawing of the molecular structure of <bold>1</bold> with 30% probability thermal ellipsoids.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"ic-2010-009303_0004.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  ORTEP drawing of the molecular structure of 1 with 30% probability thermal ellipsoids.
