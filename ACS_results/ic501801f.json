Herein, the photoluminescent properties of 1, 2, and H3 L 1 were investigated intensively at room temperature. As shown in  Figure S4, free ligand H3 L 1 displays a purple-blue fluorescence at 396 nm (\u03bbex = 300 nm), which originates from the \u03c0*\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 transition of the p electrons of aromatic rings.

Meanwhile, complex 2 shows photoluminescence with emission maxima at 400 nm (\u03bbex = 300 nm). It is obvious that the emission bands for complexes 1 and 2 resemble those of triarylboron-containing ligands, so the emissions of 1 and 2 are possible attributed to the ligands \u03c0*\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 transitions modified by metal coordination.\n\nGas Sorption of Complexes 1 and 2 \n\nTo investigate the permanent porosities of 1 and 2, the gas isotherms were measured for N2 at 77 K. The as-synthesized 1 and 2 were guest-exchanged with dry methanol and dichloromethane, respectively, followed by activation at 60 \u00b0C under high vacuum for 3 h to get the activated 1 and 2. Figure  shows the N2 sorption isotherms at 77 K for complexes 1 and 2. The Langmuir surface area of 1 is 9.6895 m2 g-1. The uptake of N2 is only 6.0 cm3 g-1 at 1 bar. The measured pore volume from N2 sorption is 0.00706 cm3 g-1, which is much lower than that estimated from the single crystal structure (cald: 0.296 cm3 g-1), indicating that the host framework is easy to collapse after removing solvents from the crystalline samples. Meanwhile, the N2 adsorption isotherm shows a type-II sorption behavior, which further demonstrates a collapse structure of desolvated 1. Moreover, desolvated 2 displays typical type-I adsorption isotherms for N2, which suggests the retention of the microporous structure after removal of guest molecules. It is possible that the SBU with four coordinated DMA molecules in 1 is more unstable than the SBU with two coordinated H2O molecules in 2. As shown in Figure , the isotherm for 2 has an abrupt slope from 0.01 to 0.1 bar, which indicates that the pores are filled in sequence as the increasing of pressure from 0.01 to 0.1 bar. Subsequently, the N2 uptake capacity of 2 increases slightly and reaches a platform (185 cm3 g-1) at 1 bar. The BET and Langmuir surface areas are calculated to be 680.2 m2 g-1 and 771.3 m2 g-1, respectively. The measured pore volume is 0.2859 cm3 g-1. The parameters of 2 are much larger than those of 1. The mean pore size distribution is about 12.7 \u00c5 for complex 2 ( Figure S5). Remarkably, the uptake of N2 for 2 is higher than that reported for the ZnIIB-MOF compound (~140 cm3 g-1), and the pore volume of 0.2859 cm3 g-1 is larger than that for the ZnIIB-MOF compound (0.21 cm3 g-1), which may derive from the observation that shorter linker and hindrance groups avoid interpenetration and lead to a larger pore volume to compare with L 1 ligand (tris(2',3',5',6'-tetramethylbiphenyl-4-carboxylic acid)borane).\n\nIn addition, low-pressure Ar, H2, CO2, and CH4 sorption experiments for complex 2 were measured at a variety of temperatures. Their sorption isotherms are exhibited in Figure . The uptake of Ar for 2 is 220 cm3 g-1, which is also higher than that of the ZnIIB-MOF compound (~160 cm3 g-1). Under the conditions of 1 bar and 77 K, desolvated 2 exhibits the H2 uptake capacity of 115 cm3 g-1 (1.02 wt %). The value surpasses that of the favorable zeolite ZSM-5 (0.7 wt %) and is close to those of some reported MOFs at the same condition. The gas isosteric heat of adsorption (Q st) can be calculated by fitting the gas adsorption isotherms at different temperature to a virial-type expression. By this method, the Q st for H2 was obtained by fitting the H2 adsorption isotherms at 77 and 87 K and had the estimated value of 7.0 kJ mol-1 ( Figure S6a). The sorption isotherms for CO2 reveal that 2 stores CO2 up to 49.3 cm3 g-1 (9.6 wt %) at 273 K and 1 atm, and 33.4 cm3 g-1 (6.5 wt %) at 295 K and 1 atm. The CO2 sorption capacity of 2 is higher than those for the favorable zeolites ZIF-79, ZIF-70, and ZIF-100, and is close to those for some reported MOFs, such as MOF-253, YO-MOF, and CPL-2, etc. Complex 2 adsorbs 12.2 cm3 g-1 of CH4 at 273 K and 1 atm, and 8.87 cm3 g-1 of CH4 at 295 K and 1 atm. The Q st for CO2 and CH4 at low coverage can be calculated by fitting the gas adsorption isotherms at 273 and 295 K. The values for CO2 and CH4 are 17.7 and 9.6 kJ mol-1, respectively ( Figure S6b,c).\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have successfully synthesized two 3D noninterpenetrating MOFs (1 and 2) built from trinuclear SBUs and organoboron carboxylate ligands.
