The activation stage for this material is, unfortunately, not as easy as those for other MOFs, and even after extensive solvent extraction and thermal activation, only ~5 mmol NO/g of material is adsorbed. The recent paper by Dietzel et al. explains why the Zn analogue is not easy to activate fully: this material exhibits several phase transitions, and the framework undergoes considerable strain upon dehydration. However, the amount of NO adsorbed is still significantly greater than that for any other porous material, so this material remains a very interesting candidate for further biological applications.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 19, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>One particularly important aspect of NO donors is their biocompatibility.
