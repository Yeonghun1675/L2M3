A large amount of colorless crystals (122.1 mg, 60.91% based on HB(2,4-dimethylimidazolyl)4) were obtained. The crystals were washed using acetonitrile five times and ethanol twice and dried at 85 \u00b0C in air for other measurements.\n\nSynthesis of Li[B(bim)4][(\u00b1)-2-AB] (BIF-12)\n\nHB(benzimidazolyl)4 (198 mg), butyllithium solution (0.5 mL, 2.5 M in hexanes), (\u00b1)-2-amino-1-butanol (2.602 g), and benzene (1.590 g) are mixed in a Teflon-lined autoclave and stirred for 1 h. The autoclave was then sealed and heated at 120 \u00b0C for 5 days, followed by cooling to room temperature. A large amount of colorless rhombus crystals (145.3 mg, 61.3% based on HB(benzimidazolyl)4) were obtained.
