Significantly, the two adjacent chromophore linkers (BTD unit) are held in a cofacial geometry (in opposite direction, antimode) with the transannular distance of 3.47 \u00c5. This transannular distance is shorter than the distance of antidimer predicted by theoretical calculation (4.00 \u00c5), but it is longer than that in anti-[2.2](4,7)benzothiadiazolophane (average distance 2.94 \u00c5). Herein, we preliminarily inferred that there was BTD antidimmer in the complex 1. As shown in , the peak positions of the experimental PXRD spectrum match well with that of simulated one, indicating the excellent phase purity of complex 1. In addition, application of the SQUEEZE routine in PLATON indicates a void volume of 29% in the total cell volume. These channels are probably occupied by solvents, which are further confirmed by TGA. From the TGA experiment (), there are two successive weight losses of 8.83% (calcd 8.81%) before 190 \u00b0C. It is ascribed to the absence of solvents in the cavity and free S atom in the S@Cd6 cage, which was further supported by the result from 1H NMR spectrum for complex 1 immersed in CD3CN for one week (the DMF signal was resulted from the DMF molecules adhered in the surface of crystal, ). Over 190 \u00b0C, the framework of sample 1 was decomposed gradually, which was also proved by the PXRD patterns for complex 1 heated under 130 and 180 \u00b0C, respectively (). Thus, gas sorption measurement for the as-synthesized sample 1 after SC-CO2 activation was conducted up to a relative pressure (p/p 0) of 1.0 on the activated frameworks at STP. N2 adsorption isotherm demonstrates that MOF 1 exhibited the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 404.34 m2/g (). Interestingly, MOF 1 showed the good chemical stability () in intermediate acidic (pH = 3) or basic condition (pH = 11).\n\nConclusion\n\nHerein, two new BTD-derived MOFs 1 and 2 were successfully obtained, which were structurally similar. It is interesting that one free sulfur atom was fixed in a Cd(II) cluster cage to form the SBU S@Cd6, which further extended into a 3D porous framework. MOF 1 showed a larger BET surface area (404.34 m2/g) than that of 2 (102.23 m2/g). More interestingly, uncommon BTD antidimmer was evidenced by the corresponding structural and photophysical experiment. Furthermore, because of the structural character, either 1 or 2 showed the special dual emission, the mechanism of which was realized by the structural analyses and photophysical study. Researching the solvatochromic behavior of 1 and 2 revealed that the dual emission was clearly red-shifted by increasing the solvent polarity or the acidity of ambiance, respectively. These results indicate that chromophore-derived MOF can be a powerful platform to deeply understand the relationship between photophysical properties and the structures, which is extremely beneficial to design and construct the excellent optical-functional materials.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "porosity": [{"probe": "PLATON", "value": "0.87",
