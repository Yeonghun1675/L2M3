Meanwhile, the void volume of <bold>1</bold> is the largest in the four frameworks; both <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold> adsorbed twice the amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> as\ndid <bold>1</bold>.

The stretching of the sulfonyl\ngroups in the sdb ligands shifted slightly lower from 1330 cm<sup>\u20131</sup> during an increase in the CO<sub>2</sub> pressure.\nThe shifts of IR spectra are not large, although the O atoms on the\nsulfonyl groups are isolated in the crystal structures. Therefore,\nthe shifts to lower wavenumber suggested that the rhombic grids in\nthe 1D double chain shrank or swelled and that the space between the\n2D sheets expanded less dramatically in the low-pressure region. Accompanying\nan increase of pressure from <italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic> = 65 to 100 kPa, large\nchanges of the synchrotron-radiation PXRD patterns were observed at\n2\u03b8 = 3\u20134\u00b0.

In the desorption\nprocess, <bold>3</bold> shows a hysteresis loop, which also suggested\nthat <bold>3</bold> stays in a different phase when CO<sub>2</sub> molecules fully occupy the pore. The difference in the linker ligands\ncontributes to the stepwise adsorption.

For 4, the diameter of the 1D channel along the c axis is largest, 3.3 \u00c5. Adsorption measurements of CO2 were carried out up to P/P 0 = 1.0 at 195 K, shown in Figure . All of them start to take up CO2 from the low-pressure region, and the amounts of CO2 reached 66 mL\u22c5g-1 in 1 (2.5 CO2 per Zn2), 137 mL\u22c5g-1 in 2 (5.9 CO2 per Zn2), 141 mL\u22c5g-1 in 3 (6.1 CO2 per Zn2), and 29 mL\u22c5g-1 in 4 (1.2 CO2 per Zn2). Meanwhile, the void volume of 1 is the largest in the four frameworks; both 2 and 3 adsorbed twice the amounts of CO2 as did 1. This is because the gas-adsorption performance of 1 depends on the desolvation process. The tendency to adsorb lower amounts than expected from the single-crystal structure has often been observed in other adsorption measurements in this work. The framework of 4 adsorbed the least amount of CO2, which is consistent with the smallest void volume of 4 in the four frameworks. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of these frameworks are shown in Table S1 in the . The surface area of 4 is the smallest. While the adsorption isotherms of 1 and 4 are categorized as type I isotherms, both 2 and 3 showed stepwise adsorption behaviors. The PXRD patterns of 2 and 3 in the desolvated phase are similar, and 2 and 3 showed similar adsorption isotherms up to P = 25 kPa with structural changes supported by the diffraction patterns of 3 under a controlled pressure of CO2 obtained using synchrotron irradiation, as shown in Figure S4 in the . The different behaviors were observed above P = 25 kPa. The adsorption isotherm of 2 is more moderate in the step region from P = 25 to 55 kPa than that of 3 above P = 80 kPa, which suggests that the structural changes of 2 and 3 are gradual and abrupt in each step region, respectively. Further investigation to reveal the details of 2 and 3 used IR measurements for 2 and 3 under a controlled pressure of CO2 at 195 K. The stretching of the sulfonyl groups in the sdb ligands shifted slightly lower from 1330 cm-1 during an increase in the CO2 pressure. The shifts of IR spectra are not large, although the O atoms on the sulfonyl groups are isolated in the crystal structures. Therefore, the shifts to lower wavenumber suggested that the rhombic grids in the 1D double chain shrank or swelled and that the space between the 2D sheets expanded less dramatically in the low-pressure region. Accompanying an increase of pressure from P = 65 to 100 kPa, large changes of the synchrotron-radiation PXRD patterns were observed at 2\u03b8 = 3-4\u00b0. These changes correspond to the expansion of 3 before and after the abrupt uptake. In the desorption process, 3 shows a hysteresis loop, which also suggested that 3 stays in a different phase when CO2 molecules fully occupy the pore. The difference in the linker ligands contributes to the stepwise adsorption. That is, the linker ligand of bpt in 3 coordinates to Zn2+ more weakly than does bpb in 2. This is also suggested by the density functional theory calculation shown in Figures S5 and S6 and Table S2 in the . This weaker coordination bond contributes to the larger flexibility and allows larger structural change. As a consequence, both 2 and 3 accommodate similar amounts of CO2 based on similar void volumes through different structural changes.

On the other hand, many studies have been reported relating to gate-opening phenomena based on the flexibility of  PCP frameworks that have potential applicability to materials for separating various gas molecules. The reason why the flexible frameworks from 1-3 do not show the gate-opening phenomenon is that they can adsorb gas molecules from the rhombic grids, which are permanent large pores, as shown in Figure a. From this point of view, we focused on bpy, which has a suitable length to construct an interpenetrated structure with a rhombic grid pore occupied by bpy in a neighboring framework. We investigated the adsorption properties of 4, which has much less void volume and a smaller window than the three other frameworks. We show adsorption isotherms at 195 K up to P = 101 kPa of CH4, C2H6, C2H4, and CO2 for comparison in Figure a. The adsorption amounts of CH4, C2H6, and C2H4 are negligible amount, 7 mL\u22c5g-1 (0.3 C2H4 per Zn2) and 13 mL\u22c5g-1 (0.5 C2H6 per Zn2).

The pore diameter of 4 is 3.3 \u00c5, as mentioned above. This size is appropriate for CO2 molecules to diffuse and for CH4 to be excluded, and their isotherms indicated reasonable size selectivity depending on their size. In contrast, C2H6 and C2H4 showed inconsistent adsorption behaviors with a size-selective adsorption because they are larger than CO2, CH4, and the pore diameter of 4. We obtained structural information on 4 during gas adsorption from diffraction patterns by synchrotron irradiation shown in Figure S10 in the . Slight differences in the diffraction pattern were observed compared with the degassed phase and P = 90 kPa of CO2 at 195 K, and little difference was observed in the degassed phase at 195, 298, and 423 K. In contrast, the dependence of the diffraction patterns on the temperature was clearly observed when CO2 molecules were adsorbed under P = 90 kPa from 195 to 298 K. We concluded that 4 has a small amount of structural flexibility independent of the CO2 amounts at the same temperature, while the structure of 4 with CO2 clearly depends on the temperature. When the framework of 4 is synthesized in a different way using an aqueous solution, water molecules are accommodated. The simulated PXRD patterns of 4 at 223 K and 4\u2283H2O at 293 K are different, as shown in Figure S11 in the , which is consistent with the case of CO2. The kinetic diameter of H2O is 2.6 \u00c5, which is smaller than that of CO2, and H2O accommodation induces a small amount of structural change more easily than does CO2. In the cases of C2H4 and C2H6, they have quadrupole moments that are the same as that of CO2 and tend to interact closely with the smaller pore of 4. In this manner, we can surmise that a structural change is also induced slightly when C2H4 and C2H6 interact with the framework at 195 K and gate-opening adsorption occurred, although C2H4 and C2H6 are clearly larger than H2O or CO2.

While <bold>1</bold> in the as-synthesized phase showed a PXRD pattern similar\nto the simulated pattern produced from the single-crystal X-ray structure,\nthe desolvated phase showed patterns different from those of the as-synthesized\nphase, as shown in Figure a. This difference\nindicates that <bold>1</bold> has structural flexibility. Desolvated <bold>1</bold> showed a broadening of the pattern and weaker intensity,\nwhich suggested partial collapse of the framework. The larger porosity\nof <bold>1</bold> causes the lower stability, and it collapsed completely\nabove 380 \u00b0C. In the cases of <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold>, each framework starts releasing DMF at around 100 \u00b0C, as shown\nin parts b and c of Figure S1 in the , respectively. The decrease of 17% in weight corresponds to the\ninclusion of ca. 2.5 DMF molecules per Zn<sub>2</sub> (Zn<sub>2</sub> means one paddle-wheel unit) in each framework. No weight loss of <bold>2</bold> was observed from 150 to 380 \u00b0C, and <bold>2</bold> collapses above 380 \u00b0C. In contrast, <bold>3</bold> showed\ntwo stepwise weight losses at around 290 and 400 \u00b0C. The former\ndecrease indicates collapse of the framework because of the weaker\ncoordination bond between Zn<sup>2+</sup> and bpt compared with bpb.\nOn the basis of the TGA measurements, we could remove guest DMF molecules\nat 150 and 100 \u00b0C from <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold>, respectively,\nwithout collapse. The PXRD patterns of <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold> in the desolvated phase were different from those in the as-synthesized\nphase, as shown in Figures b,c, which means\nthat they also have structural flexibility. Although the PXRD patterns\nof <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold> are different in the as-synthesized\nphase, both <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold> showed similar diffraction\npatterns in the desolvated phase. Therefore, we can assume that the\ndesolvated structures of <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold> are similar.\nWe determined the crystal structure of <bold>2</bold> in the degassed\nphase by single-crystal X-ray analysis, and the PXRD pattern in the\ndesolvated phase of <bold>2</bold> is not different largely from the\nsimulated one in the degassed phase, as shown in Figure S2 in the . Consequently, <bold>3</bold> in the desolvated\nphase is similar to <bold>2</bold>. In the case of <bold>4</bold>,\nthe framework showed a distinct TGA curve that was different from\nthe others, as shown in Figure S1d in the . The TGA curve showed little weight decrease below 400 \u00b0C,\nwhich indicated that there was no guest molecule in <bold>4</bold> as a result of less void space than in the others, and the collapse\nhappens above 400 \u00b0C. After evacuation of <bold>4</bold> at 150\n\u00b0C for 3 h for confirmation of desolvation, a different behavior\nwas not observed in the TGA curve. Both PXRD patterns in the as-synthesized\nand evacuated phases are quite similar, as shown in Figure d. Overall, <bold>4</bold> has no guest molecules\nand less flexibility compared with other frameworks. We were also\nattracted to the local dynamics of organic ligands in frameworks because\nsome studies have implied that those dynamics relate to gas-adsorption\nprocesses. The local dynamics of bpy\nwere investigated using solid-state <sup>2</sup>H NMR measurements\nof deuterated <bold>4</bold> (<bold>4</bold>-<italic toggle=\"yes\">d</italic>).\nThe typical Pake pattern of the <sup>2</sup>H NMR spectrum obtained\nat 298 K is shown in Figure S3 in the . This narrow spectrum indicates that bpy is in a motional state\ndespite the lower structural flexibility. The reason is that the motional\nstate of bpy is spatially isolated from the restrictions of the surrounding\norganic ligands by the rhombic sdb ligands; therefore, bpy can move\ndynamically. This motion would disturb the rigidity of <bold>4</bold>, which showed a structural change when gas molecules were included\nat 298 K, as discussed later.</p><title>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> Adsorption Properties</title><p>We also measured\nthe adsorption isotherms of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, which is similar\nto C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> in that they are both anisotropic. The\nkinetic diameter of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> is 4.2 \u00c5, which is larger than that of CH<sub>4</sub> and\nsmaller than that of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>. C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> has a double bond, which provides a planar shape. C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> has an intermediate size, planar shape, and a double\nbond; therefore, it is suitable for comparison with the three other\ntypes of gas molecules. Furthermore, investigation of the adsorption\nbehavior of these gases is important industrially, and their selective\nadsorption has been studied. Isotherms\nof <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>3</bold> up to <italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic> =\n101 kPa at 195 K are shown in Figure c. Their\naccommodated volumes are 35 mL\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup> in <bold>1</bold> (1.3 C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> per Zn<sub>2</sub>), 64\nmL\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup> in <bold>2</bold> (2.8 C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> per Zn<sub>2</sub>), and 70 mL\u00b7g<sup>\u20131</sup> in <bold>3</bold> (3.0 C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> per Zn<sub>2</sub>). The accommodated volume of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> in <bold>1</bold> was similar to those of CH<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> because of their adequate void space. The C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> adsorption isotherm of <bold>2</bold> has an abrupt\nincrease at <italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic> = 31 kPa, which contrasts with the\ncases of CH<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> adsorption.\nAlmost three C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> molecules are adsorbed per\none zinc paddle-wheel unit in both <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold>, although the protons of bpb in <bold>2</bold> decrease the void\nspace for C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>. In other words, these protons\ndo not greatly affect the total capacities for C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, including the abrupt increase in the measurement region.\nThis increase is caused by a structural change, as in the case of\nCO<sub>2</sub>. Because both CO<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> have larger quadrupole moments than C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, they would induce a structural change. The electron-withdrawing\ntetrazine rings in <bold>3</bold> have a tendency to interact more\nwith C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> than <bold>2</bold>, therefore, a structural change is induced during the adsorption\nof C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> even in the lower pressure region around <italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic> = 0.3 kPa, as shown in Figure S8 in the . As mentioned above, the flexible coordination bond between\nZn<sup>2+</sup> and bpt plays a significant role in the structural\nchange. Totally, \u03c0 electrons of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> respond\nto the electron-withdrawing tetrazine rings of the linker ligands\nin <bold>3</bold>. The different structural flexibility between <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold> is induced by the tetrazine rings. These factors effectively work on the adsorption properties.</p><title>Adsorption\nProperties of <bold>4</bold>\n</title><p>The adsorption processes of <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>3</bold> are not size-selective; however, the\nframeworks showed various adsorption behaviors depending on the functional\ngroups in the organic linkers and the structural flexibility. On the\nother hand, many studies have been reported relating to gate-opening\nphenomena based on the flexibility of  PCP frameworks that have potential\napplicability to materials for separating various gas molecules. The\nreason why the flexible frameworks from <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>3</bold> do not show the gate-opening phenomenon is that they can\nadsorb gas molecules from the rhombic grids, which are permanent large\npores, as shown in Figure a. From this point\nof view, we focused on bpy, which has a suitable length to construct\nan interpenetrated structure with a rhombic grid pore occupied by\nbpy in a neighboring framework. We investigated the adsorption properties\nof <bold>4</bold>, which has much less void volume and a smaller window\nthan the three other frameworks. We show adsorption isotherms at 195\nK up to <italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic> = 101 kPa of CH<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub> for\ncomparison in Figure a.

The isotherm of CO<sub>2</sub> has a type I profile; in contrast,\nCH<sub>4</sub> is not adsorbed in <bold>4</bold>. Isotherms of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> exhibited the\ngate-opening phenomenon at <italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic> = 1 and 8 kPa, respectively,\nas shown in Figure S9a in the  in a logarithmic\nscale. The pore diameter of <bold>4</bold> is 3.3 \u00c5, as mentioned\nabove. This size is appropriate for CO<sub>2</sub> molecules to diffuse\nand for CH<sub>4</sub> to be excluded, and their isotherms indicated\nreasonable size selectivity depending on their size. In contrast,\nC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> showed inconsistent\nadsorption behaviors with a size-selective adsorption because they\nare larger than CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and the pore diameter\nof <bold>4</bold>. We obtained structural information on <bold>4</bold> during gas adsorption from diffraction patterns by synchrotron irradiation\nshown in Figure S10 in the . Slight differences\nin the diffraction pattern were observed compared with the degassed\nphase and <italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic> = 90 kPa of CO<sub>2</sub> at 195 K,\nand little difference was observed in the degassed phase at 195, 298,\nand 423 K. In contrast, the dependence of the diffraction patterns\non the temperature was clearly observed when CO<sub>2</sub> molecules\nwere adsorbed under <italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic> = 90 kPa from 195 to 298 K.\nWe concluded that <bold>4</bold> has a small amount of structural\nflexibility independent of the CO<sub>2</sub> amounts at the same\ntemperature, while the structure of <bold>4</bold> with CO<sub>2</sub> clearly depends on the temperature. When the framework of <bold>4</bold> is synthesized in a different way using an aqueous solution,\nwater molecules are accommodated. The\nsimulated PXRD patterns of <bold>4</bold> at 223 K and <bold>4</bold>\u2283H<sub>2</sub>O at 293 K are different, as shown in Figure\nS11 in the , which is consistent with\nthe case of CO<sub>2</sub>. The kinetic diameter of H<sub>2</sub>O\nis 2.6 \u00c5, which is smaller than that of CO<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O accommodation induces a small\namount of structural change more easily than does CO<sub>2</sub>.\nIn the cases of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, they have quadrupole moments that are the same as that of\nCO<sub>2</sub> and tend to interact closely with the smaller pore\nof <bold>4</bold>. In this manner, we can surmise that a structural\nchange is also induced slightly when C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> and\nC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> interact with the framework at 195 K and\ngate-opening adsorption occurred, although C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> are clearly larger than H<sub>2</sub>O or CO<sub>2</sub>. The lower gate-opening pressure of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> is derived from its chemical or physical properties,\nsuch as the double bond, molecular size, and larger quadrupole moment.</p>", "clean_text": "The TGA curves of 1-3 clearly indicated accommodation of solvent molecules in the as-synthesized phase. A weight loss of 24% was observed in the TGA curve of 1, and guest molecules were released above 130 to 150 \u00b0C, as shown in Figure S1a in the . Therefore, we removed guest molecules by evacuation at 150 \u00b0C for 6 h. While 1 in the as-synthesized phase showed a PXRD pattern similar to the simulated pattern produced from the single-crystal X-ray structure, the desolvated phase showed patterns different from those of the as-synthesized phase, as shown in Figure a. This difference indicates that 1 has structural flexibility. Desolvated 1 showed a broadening of the pattern and weaker intensity, which suggested partial collapse of the framework. The larger porosity of 1 causes the lower stability, and it collapsed completely above 380 \u00b0C. In the cases of 2 and 3, each framework starts releasing DMF at around 100 \u00b0C, as shown in parts b and c of Figure S1 in the , respectively. The decrease of 17% in weight corresponds to the inclusion of ca. 2.5 DMF molecules per Zn2 (Zn2 means one paddle-wheel unit) in each framework. No weight loss of 2 was observed from 150 to 380 \u00b0C, and 2 collapses above 380 \u00b0C. In contrast, 3 showed two stepwise weight losses at around 290 and 400 \u00b0C. The former decrease indicates collapse of the framework because of the weaker coordination bond between Zn2+ and bpt compared with bpb. On the basis of the TGA measurements, we could remove guest DMF molecules at 150 and 100 \u00b0C from 2 and 3, respectively, without collapse. The PXRD patterns of 2 and 3 in the desolvated phase were different from those in the as-synthesized phase, as shown in Figures b,c, which means that they also have structural flexibility. Although the PXRD patterns of 2 and 3 are different in the as-synthesized phase, both 2 and 3 showed similar diffraction patterns in the desolvated phase. Therefore, we can assume that the desolvated structures of 2 and 3 are similar. We determined the crystal structure of 2 in the degassed phase by single-crystal X-ray analysis, and the PXRD pattern in the desolvated phase of 2 is not different largely from the simulated one in the degassed phase, as shown in Figure S2 in the . Consequently, 3 in the desolvated phase is similar to 2. In the case of 4, the framework showed a distinct TGA curve that was different from the others, as shown in Figure S1d in the . The TGA curve showed little weight decrease below 400 \u00b0C, which indicated that there was no guest molecule in 4 as a result of less void space than in the others, and the collapse happens above 400 \u00b0C. After evacuation of 4 at 150 \u00b0C for 3 h for confirmation of desolvation, a different behavior was not observed in the TGA curve. Both PXRD patterns in the as-synthesized and evacuated phases are quite similar, as shown in Figure d. Overall, 4 has no guest molecules and less flexibility compared with other frameworks. We were also attracted to the local dynamics of organic ligands in frameworks because some studies have implied that those dynamics relate to gas-adsorption processes. The local dynamics of bpy were investigated using solid-state 2H NMR measurements of deuterated 4 (4-d). The typical Pake pattern of the 2H NMR spectrum obtained at 298 K is shown in Figure S3 in the . This narrow spectrum indicates that bpy is in a motional state despite the lower structural flexibility. The reason is that the motional state of bpy is spatially isolated from the restrictions of the surrounding organic ligands by the rhombic sdb ligands; therefore, bpy can move dynamically. This motion would disturb the rigidity of 4, which showed a structural change when gas molecules were included at 298 K, as discussed later.\n\nC2H4 Adsorption Properties\n\nWe also measured the adsorption isotherms of C2H4, which is similar to C2H6 in that they are both anisotropic. The kinetic diameter of C2H4 is 4.2 \u00c5, which is larger than that of CH4 and smaller than that of C2H6. C2H4 has a double bond, which provides a planar shape. C2H4 has an intermediate size, planar shape, and a double bond; therefore, it is suitable for comparison with the three other types of gas molecules. Furthermore, investigation of the adsorption behavior of these gases is important industrially, and their selective adsorption has been studied. Isotherms of 1-3 up to P = 101 kPa at 195 K are shown in Figure c. Their accommodated volumes are 35 mL\u22c5g-1 in 1 (1.3 C2H4 per Zn2), 64 mL\u22c5g-1 in 2 (2.8 C2H4 per Zn2), and 70 mL\u22c5g-1 in 3 (3.0 C2H4 per Zn2). The accommodated volume of C2H4 in 1 was similar to those of CH4 and C2H6 because of their adequate void space. The C2H4 adsorption isotherm of 2 has an abrupt increase at P = 31 kPa, which contrasts with the cases of CH4 and C2H6 adsorption. Almost three C2H4 molecules are adsorbed per one zinc paddle-wheel unit in both 2 and 3, although the protons of bpb in 2 decrease the void space for C2H6. In other words, these protons do not greatly affect the total capacities for C2H4, including the abrupt increase in the measurement region. This increase is caused by a structural change, as in the case of CO2. Because both CO2 and C2H4 have larger quadrupole moments than C2H6, they would induce a structural change. The electron-withdrawing tetrazine rings in 3 have a tendency to interact more with C2H4 than 2, therefore, a structural change is induced during the adsorption of C2H4 even in the lower pressure region around P = 0.3 kPa, as shown in Figure S8 in the . As mentioned above, the flexible coordination bond between Zn2+ and bpt plays a significant role in the structural change. Totally, \u03c0 electrons of C2H4 respond to the electron-withdrawing tetrazine rings of the linker ligands in 3. The different structural flexibility between 2 and 3 is induced by the tetrazine rings. These factors effectively work on the adsorption properties.\n\nAdsorption Properties of 4 \n\nThe adsorption processes of 1-3 are not size-selective; however, the frameworks showed various adsorption behaviors depending on the functional groups in the organic linkers and the structural flexibility. On the other hand, many studies have been reported relating to gate-opening phenomena based on the flexibility of  PCP frameworks that have potential applicability to materials for separating various gas molecules. The reason why the flexible frameworks from 1-3 do not show the gate-opening phenomenon is that they can adsorb gas molecules from the rhombic grids, which are permanent large pores, as shown in Figure a. From this point of view, we focused on bpy, which has a suitable length to construct an interpenetrated structure with a rhombic grid pore occupied by bpy in a neighboring framework. We investigated the adsorption properties of 4, which has much less void volume and a smaller window than the three other frameworks. We show adsorption isotherms at 195 K up to P = 101 kPa of CH4, C2H6, C2H4, and CO2 for comparison in Figure a. The adsorption amounts of CH4, C2H6, and C2H4 are negligible amount, 7 mL\u22c5g-1 (0.3 C2H4 per Zn2) and 13 mL\u22c5g-1 (0.5 C2H6 per Zn2). The isotherm of CO2 has a type I profile; in contrast, CH4 is not adsorbed in 4. Isotherms of C2H6 and C2H4 exhibited the gate-opening phenomenon at P = 1 and 8 kPa, respectively, as shown in Figure S9a in the  in a logarithmic scale. The pore diameter of 4 is 3.3 \u00c5, as mentioned above. This size is appropriate for CO2 molecules to diffuse and for CH4 to be excluded, and their isotherms indicated reasonable size selectivity depending on their size. In contrast, C2H6 and C2H4 showed inconsistent adsorption behaviors with a size-selective adsorption because they are larger than CO2, CH4, and the pore diameter of 4. We obtained structural information on 4 during gas adsorption from diffraction patterns by synchrotron irradiation shown in Figure S10 in the . Slight differences in the diffraction pattern were observed compared with the degassed phase and P = 90 kPa of CO2 at 195 K, and little difference was observed in the degassed phase at 195, 298, and 423 K. In contrast, the dependence of the diffraction patterns on the temperature was clearly observed when CO2 molecules were adsorbed under P = 90 kPa from 195 to 298 K. We concluded that 4 has a small amount of structural flexibility independent of the CO2 amounts at the same temperature, while the structure of 4 with CO2 clearly depends on the temperature. When the framework of 4 is synthesized in a different way using an aqueous solution, water molecules are accommodated. The simulated PXRD patterns of 4 at 223 K and 4\u2283H2O at 293 K are different, as shown in Figure S11 in the , which is consistent with the case of CO2. The kinetic diameter of H2O is 2.6 \u00c5, which is smaller than that of CO2, and H2O accommodation induces a small amount of structural change more easily than does CO2. In the cases of C2H4 and C2H6, they have quadrupole moments that are the same as that of CO2 and tend to interact closely with the smaller pore of 4. In this manner, we can surmise that a structural change is also induced slightly when C2H4 and C2H6 interact with the framework at 195 K and gate-opening adsorption occurred, although C2H4 and C2H6 are clearly larger than H2O or CO2. The lower gate-opening pressure of C2H4 is derived from its chemical or physical properties, such as the double bond, molecular size, and larger quadrupole moment.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "1",
