Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm () was recorded at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K). A type IV adsorption-desorption isotherm is observed with a very large H2-type hysteresis loop in the relative pressure (p/p 0) range from 0.45 to 0.99. At the low relative pressure, typically at p/p 0 < 0.1, the micropores are starting to fill through monolayer adsorption reflecting a steep uptake of N2 in the onset of adsorption isotherm. With increasing relative pressure (p/p 0 > 0.1) N2 filling may continue on the multilayer phase to a critical film thickness corresponding to relative pressure at p/p 0 = 0.7. Further increase in p/p 0 upsurge in N2 adsorption is observed, which may be due to capillary condensation, indicating the generation of mesoporosity. When the p/p 0 is ~1.0, saturation point is reached; the internal pore structure of the material fills with condensed (liquid) nitrogen. In the desorption isotherm, pore evaporation starts at relative pressure 0.5 and continues to 0.45; further decrease in p/p 0 does not show significant desorption. This feature may be H2-type hysteresis, demonstrating disordered pores or pore blocking. The observed hysteresis might be due to multiple reasons: changes in the volume of adsorbent, irreversible uptake of molecules in the pores, or swelling of nonrigid pores. The typical pattern of the isotherm has suggested the existence of a cagelike formation of large uniform mesopores connected by windows of the small aperture. Furthermore, the initial adsorption pattern clearly indicates the presence of microporosity in the compound.

Using just obtained ideality factor (\u03b7) value, we calculated the value of barrier height (\u03c6B). The measured barrier height, ideality factor, and series resistance under the dark condition for the metal (Al)-semiconductor (synthesized compounds) junctions are listed in . From the data, it can be seen that the series resistance (R S) values from two different methods using Cheung's functions are in concurrence with each other. Series resistance (R S) in both cases decreases after soaking light. These results indicate a certain reduction in carrier density in the depletion region of the rectifier through the introduction of traps and recombination centers associated with illumination effect. These good agreements of the determined values give the evidence for the validity of these methods for the determination of the series resistance of the Schottky diode.

The solvent-free activated state of the coordination polymer, [Cd2I2(BDC)2(INH)2] n , 1', adsorbs N2, and the adsorption-desorption analysis displayed the increase in porosity to mesoporous range (~14.7 nm) with very high specific Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area, which may be due to the rise in interparticle void space.

The lowering of band gap after I2 sorption is presumably due to the interaction of I2 with Cd-I (Cd-I\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5I-I) in hcb core, which was evidenced from Raman spectra analysis.\n\nThe 3D aggregate via packing mode 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 clearly shows the porosity of the coordination polymer along the ab plane (17.2 \u00d7 8.31 \u00c52), where DMF and water are encapsulated a.

Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Langmuir surface areas of the sample were 611 and 846 m2 g-1, respectively, with an average pore diameter of 14.7 nm and pore volume of 0.26 cm3 g-1, which is typical of microporous pore volume. Thus, gas adsorption studies clearly indicate the microporous and mesoporous features of 1'. The nature of mesoporosity having a pore diameter of 14.7 nm presumably originates from the interparticle voids, since the unit cell parameters are typically within the range of 2 nm, interpenetration in the framework structure presumably being the reason for the narrow aperture of the window. The high specific surface area with microporous and mesoporous features thus have prompted us to perform iodine (diameter being 4.94 \u00c5) uptake study with 1' in cyclohexane medium.", "data":
