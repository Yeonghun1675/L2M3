In summary, CD-MOF-1 and CD-MOF-2 show particular promise for technological development as simple, inexpensive, and green porous materials. Moreover, we have demonstrated, in a general and fundamental manner, that the cyclodextrins do indeed act as ligands for Group IA and IIA metal cations in much the same way as do crown ethers, but with a much greater propensity to form extended structures in the solid state. One is left reflecting on the fact that the cubic CD-MOF topology is the one that almost got away!\n\n Crystal Data for CD-MOF-1.
