Caution! Alkali metals are extremely reactive with water and potentially reactive with nitrogen. All manipulations with alkali metals were carried out in an argon-atmosphere glovebox. Alkali metals are stored in mineral oil in a glovebox. All reduced materials were prepared in the same manner; a general procedure follows. Immediately prior to use, small pieces of the metal are briefly immersed in THF to remove excess mineral oil. The pieces are dried, and any dark oxide on the surface is removed to reveal the shiny metallic surface. Upon addition of the cleaned metal pieces to the naphthalene solution, a green color appears in solution. After several hours, the metal chunks are completely dissolved, and the solution is uniformly dark green. A precise quantity of 0.1 M M(NAP) is then transferred to a known amount of an MOF sample with a volumetric syringe and stirred for several minutes. The solution immediately turns clear and colorless and is accompanied by a color change in the solid. The solid MOF is then isolated on a coarse glass frit and washed with 1 mL aliquots of THF to remove any weakly adsorbed naphthalene. Versions of structure 1 reduced with M(NAP) are designated 1\u22c5M where M = Li, Na, or K. These reduced MOFs are air-sensitive, and oxidation can be observed as the solid changes back to the original color upon exposure to air. Therefore, all manipulations with the reduced material are carried out under an inert atmosphere. The metal content is determined by ICP analysis and EA. The structure of 1 is maintained through reduction and oxidation in air as verified by PXRD and TGA (). Zn2(NDC)2(diPyTz)\u22c5Li0.10 (1\u22c5Li): Anal.

The compound, which features a triply catenating, pillared-paddlewheel structure, was designed to be easily chemically reduced (diPyTz sites) by appropriate channel permeants. Reduction was achieved by using the naphthalenide anion, with the accompanying metal cation (Li<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup>) serving to dope the compound in extraframework fashion. H<sub>2</sub> uptake at 1 atm and 77 K increases from 1.12 wt % for the neutral material to 1.45, 1.60, and 1.51 wt % for the Li<sup>+</sup>-, Na<sup>+</sup>-, and K<sup>+</sup>-doped materials, respectively. The isosteric heats of adsorption are similar for all four versions of the material despite the large uptake enhancements for the reduced versions. Nitrogen isotherms were also measured in order to provide insight into the mechanisms of uptake enhancement.
