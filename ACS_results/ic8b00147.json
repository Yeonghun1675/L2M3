In the case of 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylates, the favored diequatorial disposition of the carboxylate substituents in the trans isomer (t-chdc2-) might be expected to have different consequences to the favored axial-equatorial disposition for the cis (c-chdc2-). The trans isomer is usually referred to as the racemic form, since it can be separated into configurationally stable R,R and S,S enantiomers, while the cis is commonly termed the meso form due to the rapid conformational interconversion, in solution, of its R  ax ,S  eq  and R  eq ,S  ax  enantiomers.
