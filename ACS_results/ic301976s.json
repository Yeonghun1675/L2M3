Under neutral to slightly basic conditions (pH = 7-8) 5-fold coordinated copper ions are observed which form dinuclear Cu2O10 clusters. The molar ratio of Cu2+/Na+ of 1:1 leads to a mixed metal phosphonatosulfonate. Sodium shows a higher affinity toward the sulfonate group and copper a higher affinity toward the phosphonate groups. Thus, a three-dimensional structure of alternating Na-O-S and Cu-O-P layers interconnected by -C2H4- groups was obtained. Although there is no structural data available on mixed metal phosphonatosulfonates, a few crystal structures of mixed Na/Cu phosphonates have been reported before. Using the 7-methyl-3,11-bis(methylphosphonic) derivate of 3,7,11,17-tetraazabicyclo[11.3.1]heptadeca-1(17),13,15-triene leads to selective coordination of copper to nitrogen donor atoms and sodium to phosphonate ligands. The methylenediphosphonate H2O3P-CH2-PO3H2 in combination with Na+, Cu2+, and V3+ leads to the coordination of all three metal species by the phosphonate group. The polyfunctionalized linker HO2C-CH2-NH-CH2-PO3H2 coordinates Cu2+ as well as Na+ ions via the phosphonates group.
