Decomposition occurred in two stages, first between 150-220 \u00b0C with an endothermic maximum at 205 \u00b0C, followed by a broad event between 220-350 \u00b0C with an endothermic maximum at 250 \u00b0C. Mass loss from these two events (67%) agrees closely with the calculated mass loss to yield PbS (68%).
