The observed water uptake capacities by these MOFs are found to be significantly better than those of many reported porous CPs or MOFs (Table S2).\n\nGas Sorption Studies\n\nThe presence of porous channels and water stability of the MOFs of complexes 1-3 prompted us to examine the permanent porosity of the frameworks by CO2, N2, and CH4 gas sorption measurements. To generate the fully desolvated framework, all the complexes were first immersed in methanol for 7 days, followed by heating under high vacuum at 150 \u00b0C. At 77 K, activated MOFs 1-3 exhibit a type-III adsorption profile with N2 gas and the uptakes amounts were found to be 55, 45, and 55 cc/g, respectively, even at high pressure (P/P 0 = 0.9).\n\nIn contrast, the CO2 sorption at 273 K by MOFs displays a steep rise at the relatively low pressure region, which can be categorized as a type-I adsorption profile. The CO2 uptake capacities of complexes 1-3 are 69 (13.5 wt %), 68 (13.4 wt %), and 68 cc/g (13.1 wt %), respectively, at 273 K (a). The surface areas are found to be 256.35, 252.96, and 245.85 m2/g. The pore size distributions are calculated by the Horvath-Kawazoe model are in the range from 4.6 to 7.5 \u00c5. The MOF 2 was found to exhibit a larger desorption hysteresis for CO2 that implies stronger interactions of CO2 with the framework compared to the other two frameworks. The desorption hysteresis mainly correlates with the narrow channel system that actually resists the departure of adsorbed gas molecules. The maximum CO2 uptakes by MOFs 1-3 are found to be 40, 18, and 62 cc/g at 298 K (c). The heat of adsorption (Q st) of CO2 sorption isotherms was calculated at 273 and 298 K by using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. At zero coverage, the Q st values (-\u0394H) for MOFs 1-3 are found to be 27, 32, and 32 kJ/mol. At high coverage, they exhibit 14, 35, and 15 kJ/mol (e). The MOF 2 was found to show larger desorption hysteresis for CO2 that correlated with the large Q st value. To further explore the potentiality of these MOFs under ambient conditions, the CH4 adsorption isotherms of MOFs 1-3 are measured at 298 K. The amounts of CH4 taken up are found to be 10, 3, and 14 cc/g, which are less compared to those of CO2 sorption (d). These gas sorption experiments reveal that the MOFs have CO2/N2 or CO2/CH4 selectivity and high loading affinity toward CO2. The selectivity of CO2 gas over N2 could be due to the better interactions of CO2 given its large quadrupole moment with the hydrophilic channels of MOFs than N2. Further, CO2 sorption capacities of the MOFs observed here are on par or better than those of many recently reported MOFs (Table S1).\n\nLuminescence Studies\n\nThe MOFs with luminescent properties are of great interest due to their applicability in light emitting diodes (LEDs), photochemistry, and sensors. Generally, the Cd(II) or Zn(II) complexes are expected to exhibit interesting luminescence properties. Therefore, the solid state luminescence of the MOFs 1, 2 and L were recorded under the identical conditions at room temperature. The complexes of 1, 2 and L exhibit an emission maximum at about 440, 425, and 472 nm, respectively, upon excitation at 335 nm (). These could be attributed to the intraligand \u03c0-\u03c0* transitions of the ligand. In all of these MOFs, the ligands act as double pillar and form \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between azabenzimidazole moieties with a separation of 3.6-3.7 \u00c5. The emission peaks for complexes 1 and 2 are blue-shifted compared to that of L. The blue shift in the emission maximum may be attributed to the M-L coordination bonds and also to the encapsulated lattice solvent molecules.", "data": [[[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-A", "symbol": "1",
