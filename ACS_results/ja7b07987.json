Ultimately, large differences in particle size and morphology were observed between the low and high conducting members of the series with larger particle sizes observed for the two highest conducting members and smaller particles correlated with all the lower conducting members of the isomorphous series. The effect of the lanthanide contraction was 2-fold in that (1) the intrinsic molecular pathway was very finely altered and (2) it resulted in dramatic differences in particle size, morphology and extrinsic conduction routes. The differences in conductivity are likely correlated to the difference in grain boundary but the conduction is not arising from degradation of the interparticle region as this would have made the smaller particle MOFs the better conductors.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 36, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information is available\nfree of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications\nwebsite</ext-link> at DOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.7b07987\">10.1021/jacs.7b07987</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>Detailed experimental\nprocedures, LeBail fits, proton\nconduction data and full characterization of materials (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.7b07987/suppl_file/ja7b07987_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Data for Ce-PCMOF-5\n(<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.7b07987/suppl_file/ja7b07987_si_002.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>Data\nfor Pr-PCMOF-5 (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.7b07987/suppl_file/ja7b07987_si_003.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/jacs.7b07987.
