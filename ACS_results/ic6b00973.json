Hmta plays crucial structure-directing roles in the formation of high-symmetry Ag-I units as well as 3D frameworks. Unlike guest templates, the structural information transformation of Hmta was realized through the direct coordination bond. Therefore, syntheses demonstrate the feasibility to access novel Ag-I-based framework materials by the incorporation of SDAs into the host framework and provide a new idea for the design and syntheses of other open-framework materials. The temperature-dependent photoluminescent measurement indicated that 1 and 2 show luminescent thermochromism. They represent the first 3D hybrid framework Ag-I compounds displaying luminescent thermochromism. In addition, the results indicate 1 as a promising luminescent thermometer applicable in two different temperature ranges: a wavelength-dependent luminescent thermometer in the temperature range of 120-180 K and an intensity-dependent luminescent thermometer between 200 and 300 K.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else]"}}, {"idx": 34, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org\">ACS Publications website</ext-link> at\nDOI: <ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00973\">10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00973</ext-link>.<list id=\"silist\" list-type=\"label\">\n<list-item>\n<p>PXRD patterns,\nUV\u2013vis absorption spectra, TGA curve, luminescent decay curves,\ntemperature-dependent luminescent emission spectra, and corresponding\n\u03bb<sub>max</sub> and <italic>I</italic>\n<sub>max</sub> curves\n(<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00973/suppl_file/ic6b00973_si_001.pdf\">PDF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>X-ray\ncrystallographic data in CIF format (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00973/suppl_file/ic6b00973_si_002.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>X-ray crystallographic data in CIF\nformat (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00973/suppl_file/ic6b00973_si_003.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>X-ray crystallographic data in CIF format (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00973/suppl_file/ic6b00973_si_004.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>X-ray crystallographic data in CIF\nformat (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00973/suppl_file/ic6b00973_si_005.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n<list-item>\n<p>X-ray crystallographic data in CIF format (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00973/suppl_file/ic6b00973_si_006.cif\">CIF</ext-link>)</p>\n</list-item>\n</list>\n</p>", "clean_text": "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00973.
