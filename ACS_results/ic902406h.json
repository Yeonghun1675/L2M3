Although ionic liquids are often touted as supersolvents and although they do possess remarkable solvent properties such as the ability to solubilize the high-molecular-weight bitumous matter in oil shale (kerogen), ionic liquids with weakly coordinating anions (for instance, BF4 -, PF6 -, TfO-, and Tf2N-) are poor solvents for metal salts and metal oxides.

It is sparingly soluble in most acids to form uranium(IV) salts. However, UO2 can be dissolved by nitric acid upon oxidation to UO2(NO3)2. UO3 is an amphoteric oxide: it dissolves in acids HX to form uranyl salts [UO2]X2 and in basic solutions to form uranates [UO4]2- or diuranates [U2O7]2-.
