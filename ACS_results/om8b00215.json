Orange single-crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction could be grown from CH2Cl2/pentane solvent mixtures, and the resulting solid-state structures determined are shown in . The effect of the anions on the solid-state structure is signaled by the three complexes crystallizing in different space groups: [1-NBD][BAr  Cl   4  ] P1\u0305 (Z' = 1), [1-NBD][BAr  F   4  ] Fdd2 (Z' = 0.5), and [1-NBD][BAr  H   4  ] Pbca (Z' = 1). The cations show unremarkable structural metrics, being very similar to that of the parent complex [1-NBD][BAr  CF3   4  ]. However, consideration of the packing of the anions in the lattice shows a dramatic difference between all three. For [1-NBD][BAr  Cl   4  ], the cation sits on the shared face of two parallelepipeds, but there is no crystallographically imposed symmetry. In [1-NBD][BAr  F   4  ] the cation is surrounded by eight anions which adopt a gyrobifastigium arrangement (two face-sharing trigonal prisms rotated 90\u00b0 to one another) and sits on a special position generating C 2 symmetry.

H2 was added to crystalline material (2 bar, 298 K) and a selected single-crystal rapidly transferred to the cryostream (150 K) of an X-ray diffractometer. This procedure was repeated a number of times to optimize the hydrogenation time (30 min) to obtain the highest-quality structure. Under these temporal conditions (cf. ), the best solution still had ~7% [1-NBD][BAr  Cl   4  ] in the lattice that could be adequately accounted for at this partial occupancy.

This single-crystal to single-crystal transformation proceeds without a change in space group (P1\u0305) or the overall structural motif of the anion-packing.
