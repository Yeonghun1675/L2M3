The solvent-accessible volumes of 1 and 2, as estimated by the PLATON program, are about 48.6% and 25.9% of the total crystal volume, respectively. As shown in , the N2 sorption of 1 exhibits a type I isotherm typical of a material of permanent porosity. The Langmuir and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of 1 are 729.21 and 475.21 m2 g-1, respectively, and the median pore size is at 6.43 \u00c5 (Figure S6; using nonlocal density functional theory, NLDFT). Furthermore, 1 exhibits a significant uptake capacity for CO2 and H2. The CO2 uptake at 273 K and 760 mmHg and the H2 uptake at 77 K and 760 mmHg reach 50.86 and 75.29 cm3 g-1, respectively. The CO2 uptake capacity is comparable with that of the highly porous framework ZIF-82 (52.7 cm3 g-1; BET surface area = 1300 m2 g-1) under the same conditions, which is likely due to an important effect of the uncoordinated 4-pyridyl groups residing in the 1D channels. 2 exhibits a type II isotherm, as confirmed by N2 absorption (Figure S7). The Langmuir and BET surface areas are 91.46 and 140.95 m2 g-1, respectively, which are much smaller than those of 1. The uptake capacities of N2 and H2 under 760 mmHg at 77 K reach 40.31 and 41.70 cm3 g-1, respectively. Further, CO2 sorption shows that 2 can absorb CO2 with a low uptake capacity of 13.98 cm3 g-1 under 760 mmHg at 273.15 K.\n\nThe variable-temperature magnetic susceptibilities of 1 and 2 were measured in the temperature range of 2-300 K with an applied magnetic field of 1 kOe (). The experimental \u03c7m T value of 1 and 2 at 300 K are 36.04 and 36.70 cm3 K mol-1, being much smaller than the theoretical value (47.00 cm3 K mol-1) expected for eight uncoupled high-spin MnII (S = 2.5) and four MnIII (S = 2.0) ions with g = 2.0. Upon cooling, the \u03c7m T values of 1 and 2 decrease smoothly to 21.81 cm3 K mol-1 at 42 K and 18 cm3 K mol-1 at 20 K. Upon cooling below 42 K, the \u03c7m T value of 1 exhibits a sharp rise, reaching a maximum of 23.18 cm3 K mol-1 at 34 K, and finally the \u03c7mT value again decreases to a minimum of 8.74 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K. For 2, the \u03c7m T value shows a quick decrease to a minimum of 9.03 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K upon cooling below 20 K. The above behaviors suggest the presence of dominant antiferromagnetic interactions within the clusters in both cases.
