The interchain Ising-like resonant interaction model, which tacitly incorporates the chain anisotropy, explains the observed magnetization effects. Taking two chains for the effective modeling of the supramolecular coupling, we have for each state i of the individual chain a 2|zJ|(   )2 gap between four collective states grouped in two degenerate pairs, one set originating from the {(+   , +   ), (-   , -   )} chain couples and another set from the {(+   , -   ), (-   , +   )} ones. The field-tuned crossing of the ground-state levels (with the above degeneracy pattern) determines the recorded phase transition (Scheme S4 in the Supporting Information).
