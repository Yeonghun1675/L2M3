Complex 1 possesses a novel 3,6-connected layer network with kgd topology. The perpendicular interpenetrations among the 2D layers result in the formation of a 3D porous framework with 1D channels. Structurally, complex 1 presents the first example that possesses a 2D kgd topology and 2D \u2192 3D multiple interpenetrations among all reported Zr MOFs. Although complex 1 exhibits low gas uptake and thermal stability compared to other 3D Zr MOFs, our results presented here may provide a strategy for the construction of porous Zr MOFs through framework interpenetration. Further study will focus on the design and synthesis of porous Zr MOFs with high gas uptake and thermal stability, as well as catalytic property.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 15, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China\n(Grants 21271117 and 21371179), NCET-11-0309, the Shandong Natural\nScience Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (Grant JQ201003), the\nNational Science Foundation of Shandong Province (Grant BS2011CL041),\nand the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grants\n13CX05010A and 13CX02006A).</p>", "clean_text": "This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (Grants 21271117 and 21371179), NCET-11-0309, the Shandong Natural Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (Grant JQ201003), the National Science Foundation of Shandong Province (Grant BS2011CL041), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grants 13CX05010A and 13CX02006A).", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 16, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>Crystallographic data in CIF format, detailed synthesis\nprocedure, crystal data, XRD, TGA, IR spectrum, bond distances and\nangles, and additional graphics.
