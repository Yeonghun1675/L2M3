"type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<title>Thermogravimetric Analyses</title><p>TGA shows that <bold>1</bold> is stable up to 300 \u00b0C. The weight loss of 31.6% from RT to 260 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of two guest DMF and two uncoordinated water molecules per Cu(L1) unit (calcd: 32.3%). There is no weight loss from 260 to 300 \u00b0C. Complex <bold>2</bold> has a higher weight loss of 38.5% upon heating from RT to 200 \u00b0C, which is attributed to the loss of three guest DMF and nine solvated/coordinated water molecules per Cu<sub>2</sub>(L2)<sub>2</sub> (calcd: 39.1%). The frameworks of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> may be anticipated to collapse above 300 and 290 \u00b0C, respectively (Figure ).</p><title>Gas Sorption</title><p>To study the porosity of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>, nitrogen physisorption measurements was preformed at 77 K. For this purpose, the synthesized materials were dried to remove the guest molecules by evacuation under a dynamic vacuum at 90 \u00b0C for 10 h. TGA shows that the solvent was removed completely for <bold>1</bold> (Figure c). The XRPD pattern of guest-free <bold>1</bold> confirms the stability of the framework in the absence of guest molecules, characteristic of peak broadening and peak shifts at higher 2\u03b8 angles probably related to the conformational change of the ligand (Figure c). The XRPD peaks could reversibly sharpen and shift back as the sample gets resolvated in the mother liquor (Figure d). The nitrogen physisorption measurement reveals that <bold>1</bold> exhibits a type-I isotherm, indicative of microporous materials (Figure a). The nitrogen adsorption shows good reversibility. <bold>1</bold> has a total pore volume of 0.28 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u22121</sup>. The Langmuir and Brunauer\u2212Emmett\u2212Teller (BET) surface areas are 719 and 431 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>\u22121</sup>, respectively, derived from the adsorption data. In contrast, the guest removal of <bold>2</bold> under similar conditions causes a loss in crystallinity and leads to the gas sorption behavior of nonporous materials.</p><p>Adsorption of carbon dioxide and hydrogen by guest-free <bold>1</bold> was also studied. Carbon dioxide sorption at 195 K gave a reversible type-I isotherm (Figure b). The uptake at 1 atm (1 atm = 101\u2009325 Pa) reached 118 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u22121</sup> (5.27 mmol g<sup>\u22121</sup>), which amounts to 17.3 CO<sub>2</sub> molecules per formula unit. The hydrogen adsorption isotherm indicates an uptake of 117 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>\u22121</sup> (\u223c1.05 wt %) at 77 K and 1 atm (Figure c). In contrast to the nitrogen and carbon dioxide sorption isotherms, the hydrogen sorption isotherm displays remarkable hysteresis between adsorption and desorption curves at 77 K. The hysteretic desorption indicates strong interaction between H<sub>2</sub> and host frameworks and allows H<sub>2</sub> to be adsorbed at high pressures but stored at lower pressures, which has been reported recently in a few examples. Considering the absence of vacant metal coordination sites and kinetic traps within the framework of <bold>1</bold>, the present hydrogen sorption hysteresis is possibly related to the presence of narrow pores (\u223c6.2 \u00c5) and tubular channels. An optimal pore size of just slightly over twice the kinetic diameter of the hydrogen molecules (about 6 \u00c5) strengthens the interactions between H<sub>2</sub> molecules and pore walls.

The weight loss of 31.6% from RT to 260 \u00b0C corresponds to the loss of two guest DMF and two uncoordinated water molecules per Cu(L1) unit (calcd: 32.3%). There is no weight loss from 260 to 300 \u00b0C. Complex 2 has a higher weight loss of 38.5% upon heating from RT to 200 \u00b0C, which is attributed to the loss of three guest DMF and nine solvated/coordinated water molecules per Cu2(L2)2 (calcd: 39.1%). The frameworks of 1 and 2 may be anticipated to collapse above 300 and 290 \u00b0C, respectively (Figure ).\n\nGas Sorption\n\nTo study the porosity of 1 and 2, nitrogen physisorption measurements was preformed at 77 K. For this purpose, the synthesized materials were dried to remove the guest molecules by evacuation under a dynamic vacuum at 90 \u00b0C for 10 h. TGA shows that the solvent was removed completely for 1 (Figure c). The XRPD pattern of guest-free 1 confirms the stability of the framework in the absence of guest molecules, characteristic of peak broadening and peak shifts at higher 2\u03b8 angles probably related to the conformational change of the ligand (Figure c). The XRPD peaks could reversibly sharpen and shift back as the sample gets resolvated in the mother liquor (Figure d). The nitrogen physisorption measurement reveals that 1 exhibits a type-I isotherm, indicative of microporous materials (Figure a). The nitrogen adsorption shows good reversibility. 1 has a total pore volume of 0.28 cm3 g-1. The Langmuir and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas are 719 and 431 m2 g-1, respectively, derived from the adsorption data. In contrast, the guest removal of 2 under similar conditions causes a loss in crystallinity and leads to the gas sorption behavior of nonporous materials.\n\nAdsorption of carbon dioxide and hydrogen by guest-free 1 was also studied. Carbon dioxide sorption at 195 K gave a reversible type-I isotherm (Figure b). The uptake at 1 atm (1 atm = 101325 Pa) reached 118 cm3 g-1 (5.27 mmol g-1), which amounts to 17.3 CO2 molecules per formula unit. The hydrogen adsorption isotherm indicates an uptake of 117 cm3 g-1 (~1.05 wt %) at 77 K and 1 atm (Figure c). In contrast to the nitrogen and carbon dioxide sorption isotherms, the hydrogen sorption isotherm displays remarkable hysteresis between adsorption and desorption curves at 77 K. The hysteretic desorption indicates strong interaction between H2 and host frameworks and allows H2 to be adsorbed at high pressures but stored at lower pressures, which has been reported recently in a few examples. Considering the absence of vacant metal coordination sites and kinetic traps within the framework of 1, the present hydrogen sorption hysteresis is possibly related to the presence of narrow pores (~6.2 \u00c5) and tubular channels. An optimal pore size of just slightly over twice the kinetic diameter of the hydrogen molecules (about 6 \u00c5) strengthens the interactions between H2 molecules and pore walls. The strong interactions between H2 and the host framework are reflected by the high value of the isosteric heat of adsorption (Q st), which was calculated to be 8.4-9.2 kJ mol-1 utilizing the Clausius-Clapeyron equation using isotherms measured at 77 and 87 K.
