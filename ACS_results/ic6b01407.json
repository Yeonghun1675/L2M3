Two crystallographically equivalent Eu3+ ions are bridged by four carboxyl groups into a binuclear unit as secondary unit buildings (SUBs), which are further linked by BTB3- into a three-dimensional (3D) framework exhibiting atypical 1D open channels (c). Additionally, the total potential pore volume of 1 is as high as 56.1%, calculated by the PLATON program. From the topological point of view, each dinuclear [Eu2] unit is coordinated by six BTB3- anions; thus, the [Eu2] unit can be considered as a 6-connected node. Each BTB3- anion is bridging three [Eu2] units; thus, it can be regarded as a 3-connected node.
