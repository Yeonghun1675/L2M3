The obtained results demonstrate that silver ethynide compounds can be used as potential network builders to construct new coordination networks by incorporating extra coordination atoms into these conjugated organic ligands, which expands the scope of rational design for coordination networks or functional materials by choosing suitable building units. This study also shows that the structures of coordination networks of silver(I) pyridyldiethynides are able to be varied by changing the counterions, indicating that the bonding modes and steric hindrances of the counterions could be important factors influencing the structures of supramolecular chains and coordination networks. Further investigation is in progress to obtain new organometallic coordination networks based upon this approach.", "data": null, "include_properties": null, "intermediate_step": {"categorize": "['else']"}}, {"idx": 24, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>X-ray crystallographic data for <bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold> in CIF format, structure unit of compound <bold>2</bold>, and IR spectra of <bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>.
