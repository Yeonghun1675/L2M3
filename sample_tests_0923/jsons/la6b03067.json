The MOF-monomer mixed solution was loaded into a vinylized capillary tube and heated for 5 min via microwave-assisted heating. The resulting MOF-polymer was then connected to the IT-SPME device for extraction experiments. As shown in , almost 60% of sulfonamide molecules were not retained on MIL-101(Cr)-polymer after sample loading (a), and only 40% of the sulfonamide molecules, consisting of four sulfonamide compounds (SQL, SDM, SIZ, and SMX), were adsorbed on MIL-101(Cr)-polymer (the extraction recoveries were around 46%, 41%, 29%, and 14%, respectively) (d, Figure S5). Previous studies have demonstrated high correlation between the extraction efficiency and MOF amount used, therefore the amount of MIL-101(Cr) in the MIL-101(Cr)-monomer mixture was increased to 33% and 50% for further investigation. Results generated from this increase in MOF content showed that the amount of sulfonamide residues in the sample solution after sample loading was decreased (b-c), which indicated that the amount of MIL-101(Cr) greatly influenced the adsorption efficiency of sulfonamide analytes on MIL-101(Cr)-polymer. However, the same results were obtained as the above experiment, wherein among the sulfonamide analytes loaded, only four analytes were successfully desorbed (SQL, SDM, SIZ, and SMX with extraction recoveries around 56%, 51%, 36% and 20%, respectively) (d) as measured from the eluted solution while the rest of the test analytes (SPD, STZ, SMZ, SMR, and SDZ) were still retained on the MIL-101(Cr)-polymer, even if the volume of the elution solution was increased to three-folds (Figure S6). To explain this phenomenon, we postulated two reasons that possibly influenced the retention of these analytes onto the MIL-101(Cr)-polymer and thus hindered their elution. Looking at the structure of these retained analytes, they are all NH2-containing sulfonamides (Table S1) that could strongly attach to the unsaturated chromium sites on MIL-101(Cr) surface via a Lewis acid-base interaction (Figure S9). Another reason could be related to the cage-type framework of MIL-101(Cr) constructed by super tetrahedral building unit (ST) corner-sharing with an augmented MTN zeotype architecture, that possibly produced multiple pathways, making it more difficult for sulfonamide molecules to desorb from MIL-101(Cr)-polymer during the elution step (Scheme S3a,c).", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 24, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig3\" position=\"float\">\n<label>3</label>\n<caption>\n<p>MEEKC electrochromatogram\nof loading solution collected after sample\nloading step by using MIL-101\u00ad(Cr)\u2013polymer column with different\namounts of MOF.

Moreover, in contrast to the LODs obtained by CE-MEEKC method (0.36-0.85 \u03bcg mL-1), the HPLC-UV can further enhance the detection sensitivity 10-fold. This result was also comparable to or even better than other studies for sulfonamide antibiotic extraction (Table S2). Also, in order to analyze the sulfonamides in environment sample, the water sample taken from fish pond was spiked with 0.1 \u03bcg mL-1 of sulfonamides and subsequently applied in SPME prior to HPLC-UV analysis. As shown in Figure S11, our SPME approach can enhance the detection sensitivity for the trace-level sulfonamide drugs, which is in accordance with the regulations of the WHO and FAO. Furthermore, the MIL-53(Al)-polymer can be reused more than 30 times without any significant decrease in the extraction recovery (Figure S8). More importantly, the MIL-53(Al)-polymer, after 30 extraction times, still maintained a low backpressure (4 psi), which is similar to the initial condition at flow rate of 0.125 mL min-1, indicating that the MOF-polymer composite is stable and could overcome the shortcomings of neat polymer.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 37, "type": "table", "classification": null, "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Analytical Performance\nof MIL-53\u00ad(Al)\u2013Polymer\nMonolithic Column for IT-SPME of Sulfonamides</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup cols=\"6\">\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col5\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec align=\"char\" char=\".\" colname=\"col6\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">analytes</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">intraday<xref rid=\"t1fn1\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">interday<xref rid=\"t1fn1\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">column-to column<xref rid=\"t1fn1\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<italic>R</italic>\n<sup>2</sup>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">LOD (\u03bcg mL<sup>\u20131</sup>)<xref rid=\"t1fn2\"></xref>\n<sup>,</sup>\n<xref rid=\"t1fn3\"></xref>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>SQL</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>82.2% (2.5%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>84.9% (4.4%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>82.8% (2.2%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.998</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.72</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>SDM</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>79.0% (4.0%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>79.5% (3.2%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>79.1% (0.5%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.998</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.66</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>SIZ</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>92.9% (4.7%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>91.2% (4.2%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>89.7% (4.6%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.999</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.85</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>SMX</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>78.6% (4.4%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>80.9% (3.2%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>79.6% (1.4%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.999</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.69</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>SPD</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>71.3% (2.8%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>74.0% (0.8%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>72.6% (1.8%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.999</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.62</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>STZ</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>77.9% (4.2%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>78.2% (0.9%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>76.2% (4.2%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.998</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.67</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>SMZ</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>69.1% (2.3%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>72.0% (0.9%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>71.5% (3.1%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.998</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.54</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>SMR</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>70.6% (1.8%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>72.0% (2.7%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>71.4% (1.0%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.999</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.48</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>SDZ</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>40.6% (3.6%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>40.6% (6.4%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>41.9% (5.3%)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.999</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.36</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n<table-wrap-foot>\n<fn id=\"t1fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>Relative standard deviation (RSD%), <italic>n</italic> = 3.</p>\n</fn>\n<fn id=\"t1fn2\">\n<label>b</label>\n<p>Dynamic\nrange: 0.5, 2.5, 5, 25,\n50 \u03bcg mL<sup>\u20131</sup>.</p>\n</fn>\n<fn id=\"t1fn3\">\n<label>c</label>\n<p>LOD: S/N = 3 was calculated based\non the obtained S/N ratio from the CE-MEEKC method.</p>\n</fn>\n</table-wrap-foot>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 38, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<title>Conclusions</title><p>In\nsummary, we demonstrated for the first time the effect of MOFs\nwith different CUS and topology on the extraction efficiencies of\nsulfonamide model compounds carrying the NH<sub>2</sub> moiety.
