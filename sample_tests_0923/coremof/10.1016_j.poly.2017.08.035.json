These values can be attributed to the \u03c0-\u03c0\u2217 and n-\u03c0\u2217 electronic transitions taking place in H2 L. The esterified ligand, L1 , which has a quinone group, has \u03bb max values at 228 and 370nm, and the molar extinction coefficient values for L1  are 46300 and 30100M-1 cm-1, respectively. The \u03bb max at 228nm shows a hypsochromic shift of 16nm with a decrease in the absorption intensity compared to that of H2 L. The value of \u03bb max at 370nm shows a bathochromic shift of 19nm with an increase in the absorption intensity in comparison with that of H2 L. The shift of \u03bb max and change in absorption intensities can be attributed to the new structural features in L1  , that is, the change of functional group from an acid to ester group and the oxidation of quinol to quinone.\n\nIn the spectrum of 1, \u03bb max are found at 211 and 378nm, and the molar extinction coefficients are 29500 and 12500M-1 cm-1, respectively. These values indicate an inter-ligand electronic transition , i.e., \u03c0-\u03c0\u2217 and n-\u03c0\u2217. The absorption maxima of 1 show a hypsochromic shift of 17nm and a bathochromic shift of 8nm compared to those of L1 . In contrast, there is a clear decrease in the absorption intensity of the 1 spectra as compared to that of L1 . This could be because, in the solution state, L1  contains both quinone and unoxidized quinol forms, as shown by NMR.
