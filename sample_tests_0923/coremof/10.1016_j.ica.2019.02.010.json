TBTP was characterized and used as ligand to form new Cu(II) complexes, forming 1-D coordination polymers. Two square planar complexes were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, presenting formula [Cu(TBTP)][Cu(NO3)4] (1) and [Cu(TBTP)](NO3)2 (2). In both structures, a cationic 1-D coordination polymer (CP) has been formed. The CP contain a 1:1 Cu(II)/TBTP ratio with four neutral triazole groups coordinating the Cu(II) center, forming a CuN bonds ranging 1.988(2)-2.001(2)\u00c5. The study of the magnetic properties of compounds 1 and 2 pointed to an antiferromagnetic behavior for both compounds, defined by inter- and intra-chain dipolar interactions among their metallic centers.

Previously, the reaction was conducted without catalyst under the same conditions. No appreciable aniline conversion was detected in this case. However, by using the coordination polymer, it could be observed that the compound 1 was very active ( ), practically promoting the complete conversion of aniline (91.9%). Regarding the reaction selectivity, compound 1 preferentially catalyzed the formation of azobenzene (45.9% of selectivity), with some concomitant formation of nitrosobenzene, nitrobenzene and azoxybenzene as secondary products. The phenylhydroxylamine production was not detected. This result indicates that phenylhydroxylamine oxidizes to nitrosobenzene and further to nitrobenzene. In the course of the reaction, however, intermediate phenylhydroxylamine can react with aniline or nitrosobenzene to form azobenzene or azoxybenzene and the unconverted aniline can also react with nitrosobenzene by condensation to form azobenzene, which can also be oxidized to form azoxybenzene ( ) . In order to further examine the catalytic properties, we have investigated the conversion for the oxidation of aniline and the products selectivity, using only Cu(NO3)2 as catalyst under the same reaction conditions. The result showed that the Cu(NO3)2 led to a much lower aniline conversion (about 12%) relative to the compound 1. The Cu(NO3)2 catalyst displayed curious behavior in terms of selectivity, leading to the preferentially formation of N-phenylformamide (a product from the formylation of aniline) probably due to the acidity of the reaction medium, and only traces of nitrobenzene .

In a typical experiment, a mixture of 0.1mL of aniline (SYNTH), 0.50mL of H2O2 (30% (w/w), Sigma-Aldrich) 10mg of catalyst and 3mL of solvent (acetonitrile, SYNTH) was transferred to a 10mL round-bottom flask connected to a septum-inlet Flask. This catalytic system was kept under stirring for 12h at room-temperature. Upon completion, the reaction was quenched. Next, an aliquot of the reaction medium was then diluted in chloroform and injected in to the gas chromatograph for analysis. The analysis was performed on gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, GC-2010 Plus Tracera) connected to a Shimadzu SH-Rtx-5 capillary column and barrier discharge ionization detector (BID). Aniline conversion and product formation were quantified with the help of an external calibration curve, which was obtained by injecting authentic samples of known concentrations. Conversion of aniline was calculated by Eq. :  (1)   Conversion   ( % )   =    moles of reactant reacted   initial moles of reactant used   \u00d7 100     ", "data": [{"meta": {"name": "Tetrakis(2-propinyloximethyl)methane", "symbol": "3", "chemical formula": "C17H20O4Na"}, "processes": [{"synthesis method": "chemical synthesis", "precursor": [{"name": "pentaerythritol", "amount": "1.087", "unit": "g"}, {"name": "sodium hydride 60%", "amount": "1.787", "unit": "g"}, {"name": "Propargyl bromide", "amount": "3.67", "unit": "mL"}], "solution": [{"name": "N,N-dimethylformamide", "amount": "50", "unit": "mL"}, {"name": "water", "amount": "100", "unit": "mL"}], "pressure": "", "temperature": "0\u00b0C to room temperature", "time": "24h"}], "yield": "63%"}, {"meta": {"name": "Benzylazide", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "processes": [{"synthesis method": "chemical synthesis", "precursor": [{"name": "Benzyl bromide", "amount": "1.44", "unit": "g"}, {"name": "sodium azide", "amount": "4.39", "unit": "g"}], "solution": [{"name": "N,N-dimethylformamide", "amount": "40", "unit": "mL"}], "pressure": "", "temperature": "60\u00b0C", "time": "24h"}], "yield": "77%"}, {"meta": {"name": "Tetrameric ligand (TBTP)", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "C45H48O4N12"}, "processes": [{"synthesis method": "chemical synthesis", "precursor": [{"name": "Tetrakis(2-propinyloximethyl)methane", "amount": "317", "unit": "mg"}, {"name": "benzylazide", "amount": "642", "unit": "mg"}, {"name": "copper(I) bromide", "amount": "30.40", "unit": "mg"}, {"name": "tris[(1-benzyl-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl]amine (TBTA)", "amount": "131.56", "unit": "mg"}], "solution": [{"name": "acetonitrile:water", "amount": "1.83:1.02", "unit": "mL"}, {"name": "acetonitrile", "amount": "1.02", "unit": "mL"}, {"name": "dichlorometane", "amount": "0.61", "unit": "mL"}], "pressure": "", "temperature": "60\u00b0C", "time": "20min"}], "yield": "91%"}, {"meta": {"name": "[Cu(TBTP)][Cu(NO3)4]", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "C45H48Cu2N16O6"}, "processes": [{"synthesis method": "chemical synthesis", "precursor": [{"name": "TBTP", "amount": "16.40", "unit": "mg"}, {"name": "Copper(II) nitrate trihydrate", "amount": "4.83", "unit": "mg"}], "solution": [{"name": "acetonitrile", "amount": "4", "unit": "mL"}], "pressure": "", "temperature": "45\u00b0C", "time": "15min"}], "yield": "34%"}, {"meta": {"name": "[Cu(TBTP)](NO3)2", "symbol": "2", "chemical formula": "C45H48CuN14O10"}, "processes": [{"synthesis method": "chemical synthesis", "precursor": [{"name": "copper(II) nitrate trihydrate", "amount": "4.83", "unit": "mg"}, {"name": "TBTP", "amount": "16.40", "unit": "mg"}], "solution": [{"name": "acetonitrile", "amount": "4", "unit": "mL"}, {"name": "water", "amount": "0.8", "unit": "mL"}], "pressure": "", "temperature": "45\u00b0C", "time": "15min"}], "yield": "32%"}], "include_properties": ["chemical_synthesis"]}, {"idx": "37, 42, 43, 44", "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<ce:para id=\"p0150\" view=\"all\">The similarity can be also emphasized by the dihedral angle between the least-squares planes through the two <ce:italic>trans</ce:italic>-triazole rings, presenting the value of 74.25\u00b0 and 75.55 for <ce:bold>1</ce:bold> and <ce:bold>2</ce:bold>, respectively.
