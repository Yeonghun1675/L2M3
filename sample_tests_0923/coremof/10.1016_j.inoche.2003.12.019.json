The coordination environment around the Zn atom is given in  . The crystal structure is made up of [Zn(bbbm)(Ac)2] and non-coordinated methanol molecular. The Zn(II) center is in a slightly distorted tetrahedral geometry with two nitrogen atoms from two bbbm groups and two oxygen atoms from two monodentate acetate anions. The bond angles around the Zn(II) ion are in the range of 98.1(2)-116.8(2)\u00b0. Zn-Nbbbm bond lengths (2.006(4), 2.015(5) \u00c5) correspond to those observed in [Zn(bbbt)(NCS)2] n  (average 2.025 \u00c5) and [Zn(tp)(4,4-bipyridine)] (average 2.170 \u00c5) (tp=terephthalate) . However, Zn-O bond lengths (1.933(4), 1.952(4) \u00c5) are shorter than those reported polymers and those of Zn-N . Meanwhile, O(1)-Zn-O(3) and N(1)-Zn(1)-N(3) bond angles are 106.47(19)\u00b0 and 108.93(19)\u00b0, respectively, indicating a slightly distortion. The bbbm ligands have two kinds of different twisted conformations during coordinating: the torsion angles are -61.2\u00b0 and 61.2\u00b0 for N2-C8-C9-C9A and C9-C9A-C8A-N2A, respectively; the torsion angles are -69.4\u00b0 and 69.4\u00b0 for N4-C17-C18-C18A and C18-C18A-C17A-N4A, respectively, showing that the two benzimidazole rings from one bbbm are parallel to each other. Each trans-bbbm bridges two zinc ions together via nitrogen atoms to form a 1-D single helical chain ( ). The helical features of this helix are defined by several parameters. The planar index of planes Zn1-N1-C4-C8 (1), C8-C9-C9A-C8A (2) are 0.0011 and 0.0000 \u00c5, respectively. The dihedral angle between planes (1) and (2) is 103.1\u00b0. One Zn(II) atom, one bbbm ligand and two Ac-anions consist of a replicating structure unit. The intrachain Zn\u22efZn separation is 11.928 \u00c5.", "data": [{"meta": {"name": "Zn(Ac)2\u00b72H2O", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "C24H32N4O6Zn"}, "processes": [{"synthesis method": "chemical synthesis", "precursor": [{"name": "Zn(Ac)2\u00b72H2O", "amount": "1:2 mole ratio", "unit": "mole ratio"}, {"name": "bbbm", "amount": "1:2 mole ratio", "unit": "mole ratio"}], "solution": [{"name": "methanol", "amount": "10", "unit": "mL"}], "pressure": "", "temperature": "room temperature", "time": "one week"}], "yield": "55%"}], "include_properties": ["chemical_synthesis"]}, {"idx": "4, 6, 10, 11, 13, 14", "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<ce:simple-para id=\"simple-para0025\" view=\"all\">A new co-ordination framework {[Zn(Ac)<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>(bbbm)](CH<ce:inf loc=\"post\">3</ce:inf>OH)<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>}<ce:inf loc=\"post\">\n<ce:italic>n</ce:italic>\n</ce:inf> has been prepared and characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction and Z-scan technique.
