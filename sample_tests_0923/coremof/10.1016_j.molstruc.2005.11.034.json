Phmal is a suitable candidate for assembling such complexes due to its two interesting structural features. In the first place, it can adopt several kinds of coordination modes in metal complexes, which may provide abundant structural motifs . Secondly, it can act as hydrogen-bond acceptors and provide the pyridyl ring which may cause the aromatic \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions. To our best knowledge, the coordination polymers with phmal ligand have not been extensively studied . Furthermore, the introduction of 2,2\u2032-bipy ligand may induce new structural evolution. The 2, 2\u2032-bipy ligand is important in maintaining the desired low dimensional coordination polymer and may provide potential supramolecular recognition sites for \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 aromatic stacking interactions. So, we assumed that phmal ligand could be useful in the formation of supramolecular frameworks with some important features in the presence of 2,2\u2032-bipy chelate ligand.
