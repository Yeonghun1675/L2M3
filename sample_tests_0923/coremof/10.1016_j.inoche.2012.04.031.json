The Cu1 atom shows similar coordination environment and linkage to those in 1, but exhibits a distorted square-pyramidal geometry (\u03c4=0.28), accompanied by a slight change in the N-Cu-O chelate bite angles (78.32\u00b0 and 81.84\u00b0), and the dihedral angle between adjacent pyrimidine rings (72.87\u00b0) ( ). The Cu2 atom is located in a nearly perfect square-pyramidal geometry (\u03c4=0.09), coordinated by four ammonia molecules in equatorial positions and one water molecule with longer bond directed toward the axial position (Fig. S1).

Upon further cooling, the \u03c7  m  T value continuously decreases down to 0.08cm3 Kmol-1 at 2K. The Curie-Weiss fit to the magnetic susceptibility data above 40K gives a Curie constant of 1.31cm3 Kmol-1 and a Weiss constant of \u03b8 =-40.77K, indicating the presence of antiferromagnetic coupling interactions. Bearing in mind the structure of 1, the magnetic susceptibility data in the temperature range of 2-300K was fitted by Eq.  based on the modified Bonner and Fischer model  for 1D Heisenberg systems with J <0 with the Hamiltonian being H =-2J \u2211  i  S  i  S  i +1   (1)    \u03c7  m ( c h a i n )   = ( N  g 2   \u03b2 2  / k T ) ( 0.25 + 0.14995 x + 0.30094  x 2  ) / ( 1.0 + 1.9862 x + 0.68854  x 2  + 6.0626  x 3  )    where x =|J|/ kT, J is the exchange coupling constant between two nearest-neighbor spin doublets and other symbols have their usual meaning. The best-fitting parameters for compound 1 gave g =2.25, J =-28.38cm-1. Since compound 2 contained the [Cu2(hpdc)2(NH3)2]2- and [Cu(NH3)4(H2O)]2+ units, the \u03c7  m  was divided into \u03c7  m(chain)  and \u03c7  Cu :  (2)    \u03c7  m =    \u03c7  m   c h a i n   +    \u03c7 Cu     where     \u03c7  C u   = N  g 1 2   \u03b2 2  / 4 k T .
