The emission summit 5D0 \u2192 7F1 and 5D0 \u2192 7F4 correspond to a magnetic dipole transition with medium-strong intensities. It's strength should vary with the crystal field intensity acting on the Eu(III) ion. The emission peak 5D0 \u2192 7F2 transition, on the other hand, is an electric dipole transition and is extremely sensitive to chemical bonds in the vicinity of Eu3+, and its emission is the so-called hypersensitive transition responsible for the brilliant-red emission of 1, whose intensity extremely increased due to the site symmetry of Eu(III) ions decreases . The intensity(I) sequence of the summits falls in the order I(5D0 \u2192 7F2)> I(5D0 \u2192 7F1)> I(5D0 \u2192 7F4)\u2192 I(5D0 \u2192 7F3). The intensity ratio of I(5D0 \u2192 7F2)/I(5D0 \u2192 7F1) is about 3.16 which shows that an efficient energy transfer from organic ligands to the metal ion (LMCT) . What's more, Eu(III) has the lower symmetric coordination environment in 1. Compared with the luminescence of reported 1D or 2D Eu-Ag coordination polymers constructed from HIN/isonicotinic acid with similar coordination environments , we can find that the intensity ratio of I(5D0 \u2192 7F2)/I(5D0 \u2192 7F1) for 3D Eu-Ag coordination polymers are the highest maybe for that Eu3+ in 3D Eu-Ag coordination polymers occupy sites with the lowest symmetry and the most efficient energy transfer from LMCT. In addition, the absence of other emission peaks in the emission spectrum illustrates that ligand-to-Ag charge transition is ineffective. This is in good agreement with the result of the single-crystal X-ray analysis.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 30, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<ce:section-title id=\"st080\">Conclusion</ce:section-title><ce:para id=\"p0090\" view=\"all\">In summary, two novel 3-D 4d\u20134f (Ln\u2013Ag) heteronuclear coordination polymers based on double wave-like [Ln<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>Ag<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>IN<ce:inf loc=\"post\">4</ce:inf>(OH)<ce:inf loc=\"post\">2</ce:inf>]<ce:italic>\n<ce:inf loc=\"post\">n</ce:inf>\n</ce:italic> layers and two mixed ligands displaying the typical metal- and ligand-based luminescence emission have been hydrothermally synthesized.

In addition, direct Ag\u2013Ag interactions may be a very significant factor in the fluorescence properties of d<ce:sup loc=\"post\">10</ce:sup> metal coordination complexes . However, we do not observe emission peak of <ce:bold>2</ce:bold> at this range.</ce:para>", "clean_text": "Structural descriptions of complexes\n\n[Eu2Ag3(IN)5(OH)2(NO3)][NO3]\u22c52H2O (1)\n\nSingle-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of the two compounds reveal that they are in the low-symmetry triclinic space group   P   1   \u00af     and are of isostructural architecture. Thus, only the structure of complex 1 is described in details as the representation. As shown in  (a), the asymmetric unit of 1 consists of two crystallographic independent Eu3+ ions, three Ag+ ions, five IN- ligands, two \u03bc3-OH, two     NO   3     -     ions as well as two water molecules. Both Eu(1) and Eu(2) are eight-coordinated, they employ distorted square antiprism coordination geometry accomplished by five carboxylate oxygen atoms from five IN- bridging ligands and three oxygen atoms from three \u03bc3-OH ((b) and (c)). The Eu-O bond lengths range from 2.297(4) to 2.464(4)\u00c5, the O-Eu-O bond angles vary from 66.3(9) to 153.0(1)\u00b0, which are in a reasonable scope compared with reported lanthanide complexes . In compound 1, there are three different coordination models for Ag(I). Ag(1) is coordinated in a linear fashion by two pyridyl nitrogen atoms of the IN- ligands. The N-Ag-N bond angle is 177.6(1)\u00b0; Ag(2) is surrounded by a N atom from IN- ligand and one O atom from     NO   3     -     with the N-Ag-O bond angle of 152.3(2)\u00b0; Ag(3) adopts trigonal geometry, coordinated by two N atoms from IN- ligands and one O atom from     NO   3     -    . The Ag-O bond lengths range from 2.400(8) to 2.566(1)\u00c5 and the Ag-N bond length varys from 2.138(6) to 2.375(4)\u00c5. The N-Ag-N bond angles vary from 150.3(2)\u00b0 to 177.6(2)\u00b0. All the bond lengths and angles are in agreement with the reported compounds .\n\nEu(III) ion and IN- ligand combine together to form a relative flat Eu-IN layer along a axis. As the flat Eu-IN layers provide active nitrogen atoms to the affinity for Ag(I) ions, a wavy Ag+ layer is inserted between the Eu-IN layers ( (a)). To the best of our knowledge, this wavy \"Ag layer\", as shown in (b), was very scarce in the reported 4d-4f Ln-Ag compounds. The distances between neighboring Ag+ vary from 3.211(2) to 3.256(1)\u00c5, which are similar to the reported Ln-Ag complexes. It should be pointed that the second ligands     NO   3     -     play very important roles to the final structures of compound 1, some act as bridging ligand to connect Ag(I) and other free     NO   3     -     ions are inserted in the channel of the 3-D open framework with Ag\u22efO interactions ( ) to keep charge balance. Interestingly, a 36-membered ring (36 MR) channel (9.1\u00d78.5nm) composed of 2 Eu, 16 C, 8 O, 6 N and 4 Ag atoms is found in compound 1 As far as we know, similar 36 MRs have not been reported previously in 4d-4f coordination polymers. Small water clusters (H2O)2 are filled in the channels ( ). The distance between O(1w) and O(2w) is about 2.81(2)\u00c5.\n\nThe thermogravimetric curves (TGA) of 1 and 2 are shown in . Compound 1 lost lattice water and coordination water molecules (observed 4.04%, 3.78% calculated) in the range of 30-210\u00b0C. The weight loss beginning at 320\u00b0C could be attributed to the vaporization of HIN resulting structure decomposition. The TGA of compound 2 from 30 to 1100\u00b0C is quite the same as that of 1. It started to lose weight from 30 to 198\u00b0C, with a loss of 2.79%, which could be contributed to the loss of lattice water and coordination water molecules (calculated 2.50%). It lost 45.47% of its total weight continuously starting from 198 to 1000\u00b0C, which belongs to the evaporation of HIN (47.12% calculated) as a result of framework collapses. Both TGA profiles resemble those of other reported 4d-4f coordination polymers .\n\nPhotoluminescence properties\n\nThe photoluminescent spectra of solid state samples 1 and 2 at room temperature are shown in  . The blue fluorescence for 2 can be observed, where the maximum emission wavelength is at 361nm. Correspondingly, the peak with the maximum excited light at ca. 340nm can be observed in the excitation spectra, which can boil down to ligand-ligand (IN-IN) interactions. The centroid distance between two interacting IN ligands is about 3.4556(82)\u00c5. As known to all, the free HIN displays a feeble emission peak at 431nm while excited at 330nm in the ultraviolet (UV) region, so the fluorescence efficiency of 2 has been enhanced. We can attribute this to the IN- ligands' attachment with Ho(III) and Ag(I) ions which effectively increases the rigidity of the ligands and reduce the energy loss of radiation thermal vibration. The energy differences in Ag and Ho ions caused by the coordination environment make the blue shift of the emission from UV light to the blue color region. It's important to note that some reported articles show the emission spectrum of the Ag-Ag interaction  within 520-550nm. In addition, direct Ag-Ag interactions may be a very significant factor in the fluorescence properties of d10 metal coordination complexes . However, we do not observe emission peak of 2 at this range.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "[Eu2Ag3(IN)5(OH)2(NO3)][NO3]\u00b72H2O", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "[Eu2Ag3(IN)5(OH)2(NO3)][NO3]\u00b72H2O"}, "crystal system": [{"value": "triclinic", "condition": ""}], "space group": [{"value": "P1", "condition": ""}], "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "30-210", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "loss of lattice water and coordination water molecules", "condition": ""}, {"value": "320", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "vaporization of HIN resulting structure decomposition", "condition": ""}], "spectrum": [{"value": "361", "unit": "nm", "condition": "maximum emission wavelength"}, {"value": "340", "unit": "nm", "condition": "maximum excited light"}]}]], "include_properties": ["crystal_system", "space_group", "decomposition_temperature", "spectrum"]}, {"idx": 29, "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<ce:para id=\"p0085\" view=\"all\">The solid-state excitation spectrum of <ce:bold>1</ce:bold> is very different from <ce:bold>2</ce:bold> owing to the wonderful luminescent properties of Eu<ce:sup loc=\"post\">3+</ce:sup> ions, as shown in \n<ce:float-anchor refid=\"f0040\"></ce:float-anchor>.
