Significant quenching was observed in (b), the luminescence intensity decreases clearly with the increasing NB concentration. When the concentration of NB in the complex <ce:bold>1</ce:bold> of ethanol suspension reaches 75.0\u202f\u03bcM, the fluorescence is almost completely quenched with a quench percentage of 87.4%.

The crystal structure of 1 is charactered by Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. And the complex 1 belongs to the monoclinic system C2/c space group. As shown in  , there are one Cd2+ ion, one L1, half a BDC2-, three coordinated water molecules, one free Br- anion, one free ethylalcohol and three free water molecules in the asymmetric unit. The central metal atom coordinates a deformed octahedral configuration with six atoms, in which including two different carboxylate oxygen atoms (Cd1-O4=2.303\u00c5, Cd1-O9=2.354\u00c5) donors from L1, one carboxylate oxygen donors (Cd1-O1=2.265\u00c5) from BDC2- and three oxygen atoms (average Cd1-O=2.307\u00c5) donors from three coordinated water molecules. Each L1 is connected to two adjacent Cd2+ ions to form a one-dimensional zig-zag linear chain. And each BDC2- is connected to the chain through adjacent Cd2+ ions to generate a one-dimensional trapezoidal double stranded structure, which can be extended indefinitely. From the b direction, it looks like a deformed s-shaped structure. In the direction of c, there are small pores (20.768\u00d74.531\u00c52) on the microscopic surface.\n\nColorless crystals of [Zn(H2O)6]\u22c5L2\u22c52NO3 -\u22c50.5H2O (2) and [Cd(H2O)6]\u22c5L2\u22c52NO3 -\u22c50.5H2O (3) were obtained by room temperature volatile method. The crystal structure of 2 was charactered by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. As shown in Fig. S5, we can conclude that the crystal structure of 3 is the similar as 2. Here, we describe complex 2 as a sample. The complex 2 belongs to triclinic crystal system P\u012b space group. As shown in  , there are one Zn2+ ion, one L2, six coordinated water molecules, two free NO3 - anions, and half a free water molecule in the asymmetric unit. All of four isonicotinic acids are tilted to one side, and the configuration of L2 is changed from plane to boat. Two free NO3 - anions balance the charge of Zn2+ ions. There are hydrogen bonds connecting different layers [Zn(H2O)6]2+, so that the zero-dimensional complex can form three-dimensional supramolecular structure. There are three types of hydrogen bond in this complex. Firstly, the crystal structure of 2 which the central metal atoms coordinated by six oxygen atoms from water molecules appears as mono-nuclear units, weakly bonded to one another through hydrogen bonds (OH\u22efO=2.7475-2.8663\u00c5) with oxygen atoms from carboxyl of L2 acceptor and hydrogen atoms from binding water donor forming a one-dimensional chain. Secondly, each chain is interconnected through hydrogen bonds (OH\u22efO=2.714-2.9250\u00c5) with oxygen atoms from free NO3 - acceptor and hydrogen atoms from binding water donor forming the supramolecular polymers. Thirdly, there also have been hydrogen bonds (OH\u22efO=2.7217-2.7962\u00c5) among binding water molecules interconnection. Details of all hydrogen bonding interactions are given in Table S5. And structure of 3 is the similar to 2 but the central metal Cd2+.\n\nThe TG curve for 1 shows in Fig. S3, the thermal stability of complex 1 was conducted at a heating rate of 10\u00b0C/min from 25 to 850\u00b0C in a flowing atmosphere of nitrogen. The first stage of weight loss from 50 to 185\u00b0C corresponds to release of free water and free ethylalcohol (expt. 13.78%, calcd. 16.14%). Loss steps from 230 to 700\u00b0C are attributed to removal of L1 and BDC2-, which means collapse of the three-dimensional structure (expt. 67.17%, calcd. 66.88%). The complex 2 and 3 are in the same experiment condition. The first stage of weight loss from 32 to 140\u00b0C corresponds to release of free water and free ethylalcohol (expt. 12.83%, calcd. 17.37%). Loss steps from 230 to 800\u00b0C are attributed to removal of L2, which means collapse of the three-dimensional structure (expt. 57.63%, calcd. 66.66%). The reason why the experimental value is less than the calculated value is that the residue contains ZnO (2), CdO (3) and undecomposed carbon-containing compound. As shown in Fig. S2 and Fig. S5, we could conclude that the samples are good phase purity through the PXRD patterns for complex 1, 2 and 3.\n\nConsulting the previous studies have shown that d10-CPs exhibit luminescent properties []. The emission spectrum of the free L1 exhibits two broad emission bands at 425nm and 475nm, besides, H2BDC exhibits a broad emission band at 385nm, which can be attributed to the ligand-centered electronic transition (LCET) ((a)). Similar to the free L1 and H2BDC, the complex 1 displayed two emission peaks at 365nm and 470nm. Compared with the free ligand, the 1 showed a weaker emission band blue-shifted to different extent, which probably originates from the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). The luminescence of 1 motivated us to investigate its potential application in the detection of small molecules, ions and anions. The luminescence spectra of the free L2 and the sample of complex 2 and 3 in solid state were investigated at room temperature under excitation at 300nm, respectively. The emission spectrum of the free L2 exhibits two broad emission bands at 425nm and 475nm, which can be attributed to the ligand-centered electronic transition (LCET) ((b)). The complex 2 and 3 displayed two emission peaks at 420nm and 460nm.\n\nThe luminescence of complex 1 inspires us to investigate its potential application for sensing different types of small molecules. The complex 1 samples were dispersed in common small organic molecule solvents which were DMF, H2O, DMSO, DMA, Pyridine, CH2Cl2, CH3CN, Ethylalcohol, Acetone, Ethylacetate, and NB. All sample concentration in different organic solvents is 1mM []. As depicted in  , different small organic molecule solvents can result in different effect on the fluorescence intensity of the dispersed solution of 1. As shown in (a) the luminescence intensity of organic solvent included samples largely depends on different solvents, and the maximum luminescent intensity decreases in the order EtOH>MeOH>Py>Acetone>DCM>DMSO>EtOAc>Water>DMA>DMF>MeCN>NB. Compound 1 displays the strongest emission in Ethylalcohol while shows nearly complete quenching effect in the NB suspension. This result indicates that compound 1 can be used as a fluorescent sensor for the selective detection of NB. For better understanding of the sensing ability of 1 towards NB, a series of suspensions of complex 1 with the gradual addition of analyte in the ethylalcohol system are prepared to record the emissive response []. Significant quenching was observed in (b), the luminescence intensity decreases clearly with the increasing NB concentration. When the concentration of NB in the complex 1 of ethanol suspension reaches 75.0\u03bcM, the fluorescence is almost completely quenched with a quench percentage of 87.4%. The fluorescence quenching of complex 1 were calculated by using the Stern-Volmer equation (I 0/I=1+K SV[M]), where I 0 represents the initial intensity of 1 in the absence of analyte, I is the emission intensity in the presence of analyte with molar concentration [M], and K SV is the quenching constant []. According to the quenching experimental data, the dose-response graph fitted the relationship I 0/I=0.4876e^([NB]/27.81)-0.6842 (R2=0.9976) in (c). Importantly, the S-V curves deviate from the straight line, and this phenomenon suggests that more than one quenching mechanism appear in the process, which can be attributed to the presence of simultaneous dynamic and static quenching []. We also researched the complex 2 and 3 for sensing these chemicals. They only can sense for NB, and the fluorescence quenching of 2 and 3 is less than 1 (Fig. S6). They cannot good enough to sense for these anions and ions.\n\nAs shown in (d), the linear correlation coefficient (R) in the K SV curve of 1-ethanol with the low concentrations of NB is 0.9992, suggesting that the quenching effect of NB on the fluorescence of 1 fits well the Stern-Volmer model. From the linear fitting of the S-V plot, the calculated K SV values was found to be 3.8370\u00d7104M-1 at low concentrations of NB. The slope of this graph indicates a very low detection limit of 0.39ppb for NB (3\u03b4/slope, where \u03b4 is the standard deviation (5.02\u00d710-7) calculated by measuring the luminescent intensity of a blank solution 10 times) []. Fig. S7 shows that the PXRD pattern of 1, 1-ethanol with NB and 1-ethanol-immersed suggests that the retention of the basic structure of 1 after the use of selective sensing.
