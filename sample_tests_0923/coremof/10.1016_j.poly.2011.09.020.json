As a consequence, the channels are too narrow to host any solvent molecules.</ce:para>", "clean_text": "For all the complexes, standard 13C CP MAS spectra and short contact time measurements were also collected. Three (aliphatic, aromatic and low field) well resolved groups of signals were found. From the point of view of the number of signals, the situation is similar to the one in the nitrogen spectra. For the zinc and cadmium complexes two sets of signals are present, and one set are present for the nickel complex. The low field region is the most interesting and informative where C-2 (formally C-O) and C-7 (-CN-) signals are present. The chemical shifts of the C-2 atoms are known to be sensitive to the functionalization of the oxygen atom. Values close to 150ppm are expected for phenols, whereas for a carbonyl group the signal is strongly shifted downfield. The positions of those signals in the investigated complexes (Zn2+ \u03b4 =166.5 and 165.9ppm, Cd2+ \u03b4 =169.0 and 169.4ppm, Ni2+ \u03b4 =161.9ppm) indicate that in all cases the oxygen atom is differently involved in the complexation process. The other signals, aromatic and aliphatic, are in the typical ranges and do not supply valuable structural information.\n\nIn all the complexes, the metals are coordinated by the Schiff base molecular fragment (by two nitrogen and one oxygen atom) and by a nitrogen atom from the (SCN)- anion. For the Ni(NCS)L complex, four ligands coordinate nickel and form a square planar coordination (Figs.  and  a). The Ni1 atoms lay in the plane created by the O1, N1, N2 ligand atoms. In the case of Zn2(NCS)2L2  both zinc atoms are coordinated by five ligands and form tetragonal pyramids (Figs.  and b). Each oxygen atom from the Schiff base coordinates two zinc atoms. The distance between Zn1 and Zn2 is equal to 3.179\u00c5, and between the O1 and O2 atoms 2.532\u00c5. The deviation of the Zn(II) atoms from the ligand planes (plane 1: O1, O2, N1, N2 and plane 2: O1, O2, N3, N4 - see Fig. 1a in the Supporting materials) is equal to 0.63 and 0.67\u00c5 for Zn1 and Zn2, respectively. The angle between these planes is 62.91\u00b0. Also in the Cd2(NCS)2L2  (Figs.  and c) structure, each oxygen atom from the Schiff base is coordinated by two cadmium cations. The distances between Cd1\u2026Cd2 and O1\u2026O2 are equal to 3.418 and 2.820\u00c5, respectively. The Cd2 atom has a very similar coordination to the zinc atom coordination in Zn2(NCS)2L2  - five ligands and a tetragonal pyramidal geometry. The deviation of the Cd2 atom from the Schiff base plane is equal to 0.700\u00c5 (see Fig. 1b in the Supporting materials). Surprisingly, the coordination of the Cd1 atom is different. Cd1 is located exactly in the plane defined by the O1, O2, N1, N2 atoms. Additionally, it is coordinated by a sulfur atom. The angle between planes 1 and 2 (defined in the same manner as for the zinc complex) is equal to 51.63\u00b0.\n\nA comparison of selected bond distances and angles for the three complexes is illustrated in  . In general, the bond lengths in the aromatic rings are similar for all compounds. One can see that the bond lengths between the metal and ligands atoms in Ni(NCS)L are shorter than the respective bond lengths in Zn2(NCS)2L2  and Cd2(NCS)2L2 . For Cd2(NCS)2L2 , the ligand-metal-ligand angles are more deviated from 90\u00b0 than in the case of the other complexes. The C-O bond lengths vary from 1.318\u00c5 for Ni(NCS)L to 1.327\u00c5 for Cd2(NCS)2L2  and up to 1.351\u00c5 for Zn2(NCS)2L2 .\n\n Zn2(NCS)2L2  \n\nThe complex Zn2(NCS)2L2  crystallises in the monoclinic P21 space group with one molecule in the asymmetric part of the unit cell. From the view along the x direction ( a) it is seen that all the (SCN)- ligands are directed in the same direction, i.e., towards the Schiff base fragment. This apparently helps to pack the molecules efficiently in the crystal lattice. Molecules lay along the y axis and are related by a 21 screw axis. Such a molecular arrangement results in a number of short contacts between the (SCN)- ligand and the hydrogen atoms from the Schiff base fragment. Also some short C-H\u2026C interactions between the neighbouring Schiff base fragments can be observed ( a and ). No \u03c0\u2026\u03c0 stacking appears in this structure. All the sulfur atoms are relatively far from the zinc atoms (ca. 5\u00c5) and they do not belong to the coordination sphere of the Zn(II) centre.\n\n Cd2(NCS)2L2  \n\nThis complex crystallises in the monoclinic P21/n space group with one independent molecule in the asymmetric part of the unit cell. The molecular arrangement in the crystal lattice is slightly similar to the one in the complex Zn2(NCS)2L2 : the (SCN)- ligands are all directed in the same direction - towards the Schiff base fragments (see  a), thus forming an infinite ribbon in the crystal lattice. Also the shortest intermolecular contacts are present between (SCN)- and the hydrogen atoms from the Schiff base (see b and ). However, in this case, the distance between one of the sulfur atoms from (SCN)- and the closest cadmium atom from the neighbouring molecule is equal only to 2.684\u00c5. As a consequence, the sulfur atom is also coordinated by Cd(II). The coordination of the two cadmium cations in this molecule is different. No \u03c0\u2026\u03c0 stacking appears in this structure. In the z direction some empty channels are observed in the 3D structure of the Cd2(NCS)2L2  complex (see  b). The size of the channel is ca. 3.4\u00d75.5\u00c5 when only heavy atoms are considered (see Fig. 2a in the Supporting material). When the hydrogen atoms are also taken into account, it turns out that the distances between the closest hydrogen atoms from the methyl groups are close to 2.610 and 2.849\u00c5 (see Fig. 2b in the Supporting materials). As a consequence, the channels are too narrow to host any solvent molecules.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "Zn2(NCS)2L2", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "Zn2(NCS)2L2"}, "crystal system": [{"value":
