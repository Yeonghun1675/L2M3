The catalyst shows a TOF of 2\u00d710-3s-1 at overpotential of 418mV. Controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) shows that the catalyst exhibits a Faradaic efficiency of 95%. The catalyst preserved its chemical composition during 10h of bulk electrolysis which was confirmed by cyclic voltammetry, IR and powder X-ray diffraction studies of the catalyst before and after the catalytic process. This study demonstrates that copper-based metal-organic frameworks containing oxygen donor ligands are stable and efficient water oxidation electrocatalysts.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "Compound 1", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": "[Cu3(OH)4(oba)]n"}, "catalytic activity": [{"value": "0.1", "unit": "mA cm\u22122", "time": "", "condition": "\u03b7 = 576 mV"}, {"value": "2 \u00d7 10\u22123", "unit": "s\u22121", "time": "", "condition": "\u03b7 = 418 mV"}, {"value": "0.145", "unit": "mA cm\u22122", "time": "", "condition": "1.45 V"}, {"value": "0.0023", "unit": "s\u22121", "time": "", "condition": "\u03b7 = 418 mV"}, {"value": "1", "unit": "mA cm\u22122", "time": "", "condition": "\u03b7 = 623 mV"}, {"value": "0.1 and 1", "unit": "mA cm\u22122", "time": "", "condition": "\u03b7 = 576 and 623 mV"}, {"value": "2 \u00d7 10\u22123", "unit": "s\u22121", "time": "", "condition": "\u03b7 = 418 mV"}, {"value": "95", "unit": "%", "time": "", "condition": "Faradaic efficiency"}], "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "290 and 350", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "major single step weight loss", "condition": "loss of all organic ligands leaving behind CuO"}]}]], "include_properties": ["catalytic_activity", "decomposition_temperature"]}, {"idx": 12, "type": "table", "classification": ["Crystal"], "content": "<ce:table colsep=\"0\" frame=\"topbot\" id=\"t0005\" rowsep=\"0\" xmlns=\"http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/cals/dtd\">\n<ce:label>Table 1</ce:label>\n<ce:caption id=\"cn0060\">\n<ce:simple-para id=\"sp0075\" view=\"all\">Crystallographic details of <ce:bold>1</ce:bold>.</ce:simple-para>\n</ce:caption>\n<tgroup cols=\"2\">\n<colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"></colspec>\n<colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\"></colspec>\n<thead>\n<row rowsep=\"1\" valign=\"top\">\n<entry xmlns=\"http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd\">CCDC No.</entry>\n<entry xmlns=\"http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd\">1871660</entry>\n</row>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<row valign=\"top\">\n<entry xmlns=\"http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd\">Formula Unit</entry>\n<entry xmlns=\"http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd\">C<inf loc=\"post\">14</inf>H<inf loc=\"post\">12</inf>Cu<inf loc=\"post\">3</inf>O<inf loc=\"post\">9</inf>\n</entry>\n</row>\n<row valign=\"top\">\n<entry xmlns=\"http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd\">Crystal system</entry>\n<entry xmlns=\"http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd\">Monoclinic</entry>\n</row>\n<row valign=\"top\">\n<entry xmlns=\"http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd\">Space group</entry>\n<entry xmlns=\"http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd\">\n<italic>C</italic>2/<italic>c</italic>\n</entry>\n</row>\n<row valign=\"top\">\n<entry xmlns=\"http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd\">Cell Length</entry>\n<entry xmlns=\"http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd\">\n<bold>a</bold>\u202f=\u202f29.950(4)\u202f\u00c5, <bold>b</bold>\u202f=\u202f5.5890(7)\u202f\u00c5, <bold>c</bold>\u202f=\u202f9.2809(11)\u202f\u00c5</entry>\n</row>\n<row valign=\"top\">\n<entry xmlns=\"http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd\">Cell Angles</entry>\n<entry xmlns=\"http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd\">\n<bold>\u03b1</bold>\u202f=\u202f90\u00b0, <bold>\u03b2</bold>\u202f=\u202f104.903(15)\u00b0, <bold>\u03d2</bold>\u202f=\u202f90\u00b0</entry>\n</row>\n<row valign=\"top\">\n<entry xmlns=\"http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd\">Cell Volume</entry>\n<entry xmlns=\"http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd\">1501.28\u202f\u00c5<sup loc=\"post\">3</sup>\n</entry>\n</row>\n<row valign=\"top\">\n<entry xmlns=\"http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd\">Z</entry>\n<entry xmlns=\"http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd\">4</entry>\n</row>\n<row valign=\"top\">\n<entry xmlns=\"http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd\">Temperature</entry>\n<entry xmlns=\"http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd\">123(2)\u202fK</entry>\n</row>\n<row valign=\"top\">\n<entry xmlns=\"http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd\">Radiation type</entry>\n<entry xmlns=\"http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd\">Mo K<bold>\u03b1</bold>\n</entry>\n</row>\n<row valign=\"top\">\n<entry xmlns=\"http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd\">R-factor (%)</entry>\n<entry xmlns=\"http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd\">3.96</entry>\n</row>\n</tbody>\n</tgroup>\n</ce:table>", "clean_text": "Table 1.
