To further analyze the nature of these emission bands, the photoluminescent properties of the free H3 L have also been investigated under the same experimental conditions. The emission band for free H3 L ligand is attributable to the \u03c0*\u2192n transitions. The fluorescent behaviors of 1 and S1 are very similar to that observed for the free H3 L ligand (see Fig. S4 in the Supplementary material), which displays the maximal emission at 364nm upon excitation at 345nm. Moreover, the emission mechanism for 1 and S1 can be properly ascribed to charge-transfer transition between the H3 L ligand and the central Ln(III) ion .\n\nThermogravimetric (TG) analyses were performed to explore the thermal stability of 1 and S1 under a nitrogen atmosphere by heating the corresponding complexes from room temperature to at least 800\u00b0C with a heating rate of 10\u00b0Cmin-1 (see Fig. S5 in the Supplementary material). The TGA curve exhibits that 1 features two stages of weight loss, the first weight loss of 5.36% between 274 and 324\u00b0C (peaking at 303\u00b0C), corresponding to the loss of one water molecule (calcd: 5.54%). Then, the sample remains largely unchanged until the decomposition occurs at the temperature of ca. 620\u00b0C. Finally, complex 1 starts to quickly decompose with one sharp step of weight loss (peaking at 731\u00b0C). The final residue is not characterized because its weight loss does not stop until heating ends at 900\u00b0C. The TGA curve for S1 shows a first weight loss of 5.85% in the range of 130-174\u00b0C (peaking at 154\u00b0C), corresponding to the loss of coordinated free water molecules (calcd: 5.91%). The residue keeps thermally stable from 157 to 428\u00b0C, and then shows a continuous weight loss of 39.41% from 430 to 900\u00b0C (peaking at 447 and 593\u00b0C), revealing the decomposition of the coordination framework.\n\nThe data were collected on a Bruker Smart 1000 CCD area-detector diffractometer at 294(2) K with Mo-K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5) by \u03c9 scan mode. The structure was solved by direct method using SHELXS-97 and all non-hydrogen atoms were subjected to anisotropic refinement by full-matrix least-squares on F 2 using the SHELXTL program.
