Compound 2 also crystallizes in the monoclinic P2(1)/c space group and has a unique 3D\u21923D two-fold interpenetrating motif. There are two Cd(II) ions, two bimm ligands, two tdc ligands together with four lattice water molecules in the asymmetric unit ( a). The two crystallographically independent centers, Cd1 and Cd2, reside in similar coordination environments and are coordinated with four carboxylate oxygen atoms from three tdc ligands, and two nitrogen atoms from two bimm ligands, showing the distorted octahedral coordination geometry. As shown in (b), each deprotonated tdc ligand exhibits the (\u03ba 1-\u03ba 1-\u03bc 2)-(\u03ba 2)-\u03bc 3 binding fashion to connect three Cd(II) ions to generate a 2D layer structure containing a similar [Cd2(CO2)2] subunit. The Cd\u22efCd distance and O-Cd-O angle within the [Cd2(CO2)2] core are 3.7794 (3)\u00c5 and 76.253(78)\u00b0, respectively. These dinuclear units are further connected to their subsequent neighbors through bimm ligands and generate a 3D framework (c). From the topological point of view, the structure of complex 2 can be represented as a uninodal 6-connected pcu network with a Schl\u00e4fli symbol of 4120.63 (d) . The 3D pcu framework possesses large channels which allow further nucleation in the void space to generate a 2-fold interpenetrated structure, and thus reducing the void volume completely. PLATON calculations indicate that the effective volume is 515.7\u00c53 per unit cell, which is 15.8% of the crystal volume.\n\nWhen replacing H2O with DMF solven, we obtained 3 as 8-connected 3D network with 1D open channels. Single-crystal X-ray analysis reveals that 3 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pbca. The asymmetric unit consists of one Cd(II) ion, one bimm ligand, one tdc ligand together with one uncoordinated DMF molecule. As shown in  a, the coordination environment around 6-coordinated Cd(II) ion can be described as a distorted octahedral geometry, being coordinated by four carboxylate oxygen atoms of tdc ligands and two nitrogen atoms from two bimm ligands. The bond lengths of Cd-N are 2.309(3) (Cd-N2) and 2.278(3) \u00c5 (Cd-N5), while the Cd-O bond lengths vary from 2.225(2) to 2.609(3) \u00c5, which are in the normal range. In 3, each tdc ligand adopts a (\u03ba 1-\u03ba 1-\u03bc 2)-(\u03ba 2)-\u03bc 3 bridging fashion and connects three Cd(II) ions to produce a 2D layer structure with a [Cd2(CO2)2] subunit with an edge-sharing polyhedron along the ab plane (b). The Cd\u22efCd distance and O-Cd-O angle within the [Cd2(CO2)2] subunits are 3.7652 (5)\u00c5 and 76.457(82)\u00b0, respectively. The subunits are further connected to their subsequent neighbors through bimm ligands infinitely creating a 3D framework having small continuous 8.31\u00d78.22\u00c5 channels along the a direction to which DMF guest molecules point (taking into account the van der Waals radii of the atoms) (c). The total potential solvent-accessible volumes of 3 are calculated to be 29.6% (1174.8\u00c53 out of 3968.7\u00c53 per unit cell volume) after squeezing DMF molecules by PLATON program. From a topological viewpoint, each [Cd2(CO2)2] core can be considered as a 8- connected node which links with eight neighboring [Cd2(CO2)2] subunits. Based on this simplication, the overall 3D network of 1 can be rationalized as a 8-connected body-centered cubic (bcu) topology with a Schl\u00e4fli symbol of (4240.64) (d) .\n\nThermogravimetric analyses\n\nThermal behaviors of 1-3 have been characterized by thermogravimetric analysis ( ). No obvious weight loss was found for 1 before the decomposition occurred at about 230\u00b0C, which is in good agreement with the results of the crystal structure. For 2, a weight loss of 7.82% before 102\u00b0C indicates the exclusion of four water molecules (calc. 7.71%), and the host framework can be stable up to 269\u00b0C. For 3, there is no significant weight loss before 120\u00b0C, and then the gradual weight loss of 14.51% that takes place between 120 and 272\u00b0C corresponds to the removal of uncoordinated DMF molecules (calcd: 14.49%). Above 272\u00b0C, 3 begins to collapse of the framework, accompanied by the release of tdc and bimm ligands.\n\nLuminescent properties\n\nThe luminescent properties of 1-3 together with free organic ligands were studied in the solid state at room temperature. As shown in  , the emission spectra for 1-3 exhibit main emission peaks in the range of 350-600nm at 412nm, 407nm, and 416nm upon excitation at 300nm, respectively. The free ligands display luminescence with emission at 354nm (\u03bbex=280nm) for bimm and 380nm (\u03bbex=300nm) for H2tdc, which may be ascribed to the \u03c0*\u2192n or \u03c0*\u2192\u03c0 transitions . At present, it is still a challenge to illustrate the luminescence behaviors of the cooperatively CPs mixing two types of organic linkers. The emission band of 1-3 could be tentatively attributed to both a combination of the charge transfer process and intraligand \u03c0*\u2192n or \u03c0*\u2192\u03c0 transition originating from different chromophores in the crystal structures as reported for d10 metal compounds with N-donor ligands  ( .", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "1", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition
