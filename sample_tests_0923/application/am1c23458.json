Initially, the metal ions interact with l-cys to form precursor complexes, which undergo decomposition to produce metal sulfide composites as the reaction temperature increases. When soaked in a 20 ppm aqueous solution of Cd2+, MOF-808-cys showed removal of Cd2+ ions owing to the presence of free metal-binding sites. This observation was evident from inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) measurements. Similar observations were found for other heavy-metal ions such as Pb2+ and Hg2+, and the samples were named MOF-808-cys-M (M2+ = Cd2+, Pb2+, and Hg2+). In concentrations as low as 5 ppm, MOF-808-cys is capable of acting as a heavy-metal ion trap for removing Cd2+, Pb2+, and Hg2+ from their respective aqueous solutions with a removal efficiency >99% (Table S1). The resulting solution contained metal ion concentrations lower than the admissible limits in drinking water standards of the WHO. PXRD patterns of the metal captured samples (Figure S9) exhibited unaltered peak positions compared to the l-cys-functionalized MOF-808, suggesting that the MOF structure is retained after the capture of metal ions. The successful binding of the heavy metal ions was confirmed from FT-IR spectra (Figure S10) as the intensity of the S-H symmetric stretching peak at 2310 cm-1 for MOF-808-cys shows a significant decrease upon capturing the heavy-metal ions from the aqueous solution. A small shift to higher wavenumbers observed for the peak can be accredited to the rigidification of the S-H bond upon metal ion coordination.

The adamantane cage, having an internal pore diameter of 16.1 \u00c5, is formed by the tetrahedral cages acting as the vertices. To balance the charge, the coordination of the SBU is completed with five exchangeable formate ligands that are well-directed toward the spacious adamantane cage.

Importantly, the observed pattern demonstrated unshifted peaks when compared with the simulated pattern obtained from its single-crystal structure analysis. The as-synthesized MOF-808 was also characterized employing FT-IR spectroscopy (Figure S1) and 1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure S2). The morphology of MOF-808 was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), wherein octahedral particles of size around 200-250 nm were observed (d). The lattice fringe spacing calculated was 1.64 nm, which is typical for MOF-808, and the result is consistent with the pore size obtained from the non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) methods based on N2 adsorption data at 77 K (d inset). N2 adsorption study (at 77 K) was performed to validate the permanent porosity of MOF-808 (b). The BET surface area was 2418 m2 g-1, which is in good agreement with the previous reports of Zr4+-based MOF-808. The high internal surface area, large cavity size, excellent stability in aqueous solutions, and, most importantly, the presence of appropriately oriented and exchangeable formate ions on the Zr6 cluster makes Zr4+-based MOF-808 an ideal platform for postsynthetic modification with l-cys. The robustness of the structure of MOF-808 after functionalizing with l-cys was confirmed by PXRD studies (a), where similar peak positions were observed when compared with the pristine MOF-808. 1H NMR studies of alkaline digested MOF-808 exhibited two characteristic peaks at chemical shift values of 8.28 and 8.20 ppm corresponding to the protons of benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate (BTC) and formate ligands. The peak integration ratio of these two peaks confirmed the presence of six BTC and five formate units in the framework. However, for MOF-808-cys, this resulting ratio indicated the presence of six BTC units and one formate unit, thereby confirming the successful exchange of four formate ligands by l-cys (Figure S4). The FT-IR spectra for MOF-808-cys showed two new peaks at 2310 and 1190 cm-1 corresponding to the S-H and C-N symmetric stretching, respectively, further confirming the presence of the l-cys molecule in the MOF-808 framework (Figure S3). TEM images of MOF-808-cys (e,f) reveal an octahedral morphology, thereby confirming no significant change in morphology upon covalent grafting of l-cys. The presence of S and N in the elemental mapping of MOF-808-cys (g and S5) also illustrates the incorporation of l-cys into the framework.\n\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements (Figure S6) demonstrated weight loss in two steps and a total of 40 and 56% weight loss up to 800 \u00b0C for MOF-808 and MOF-808-cys, respectively. It was also observed that MOF-808-cys could maintain good thermal stability up to 250 \u00b0C, which is in good consistency with that of pristine MOF-808. A significant decrease in the N2 uptake (b) and the corresponding BET surface area from 2418 to 562 m2 g-1 further validates the incorporation of l-cys in the framework. The pore size distribution (c) showed a reduction of pore size from 1.60 to 0.86 nm after postsynthetic modification with l-cys. However, the cavity size for MOF-808-cys is still spacious enough for efficient mass transfer to take place.\n\nIn Situ Growth of Metal Sulfide NPs\n\n l-Cys is widely used as a precursor in the synthesis of metal sulfides accredited to the presence of the thiol group.

When soaked in a 20 ppm aqueous solution of Cd2+, MOF-808-cys showed removal of Cd2+ ions owing to the presence of free metal-binding sites. This observation was evident from inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) measurements. Similar observations were found for other heavy-metal ions such as Pb2+ and Hg2+, and the samples were named MOF-808-cys-M (M2+ = Cd2+, Pb2+, and Hg2+). In concentrations as low as 5 ppm, MOF-808-cys is capable of acting as a heavy-metal ion trap for removing Cd2+, Pb2+, and Hg2+ from their respective aqueous solutions with a removal efficiency >99% (Table S1). The resulting solution contained metal ion concentrations lower than the admissible limits in drinking water standards of the WHO. PXRD patterns of the metal captured samples (Figure S9) exhibited unaltered peak positions compared to the l-cys-functionalized MOF-808, suggesting that the MOF structure is retained after the capture of metal ions. The successful binding of the heavy metal ions was confirmed from FT-IR spectra (Figure S10) as the intensity of the S-H symmetric stretching peak at 2310 cm-1 for MOF-808-cys shows a significant decrease upon capturing the heavy-metal ions from the aqueous solution. A small shift to higher wavenumbers observed for the peak can be accredited to the rigidification of the S-H bond upon metal ion coordination. TEM images of the MOF-808-cys-M samples illustrated the intactness of the octahedral morphology (Figure S11). The capture of the metal ions was further validated from the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images and the corresponding elemental mappings (Figures S12-S14). For real-time analysis, MOF-808-cys was also tested against water samples from a nearby waterbody, and the corresponding elemental mapping (Figure S15) showed ample amounts of Pb2+ and Hg2+ uptake. The MOF-808-cys-Cd samples obtained from the 20 ppm Cd2+ solution were subjected to heating at 60 \u00b0C to unravel the decomposition of l-cys and consequential formation of cadmium sulfide composites. From ICP-OES analysis, the wt % of CdS formed within the MOF pores was calculated to be 1.18%. Correspondingly, the sample was named CdS1@MOF-808. The CdS1@MOF-808 sample showed peaks corresponding to the metal sulfide NPs in its PXRD pattern (Figure S16). The N2 uptake and the BET surface area (b) showed an increase for CdS1@MOF-808 as compared to those for both MOF-808-cys and MOF-808-cys-Cd, which was in good accordance with the breaking of the l-cys moiety to form metal sulfide NPs at elevated temperatures. We hypothesized that MOF-808-cys acts as a template for the in situ growth of metal sulfide NPs within its nanosized cavities. This proposed phenomenon was validated from the TEM images of the metal captured samples which clearly showed NPs having diameters in the range of 1-2 nm under high magnification (a-c). The lattice fringe spacings (b inset) of CdS1@MOF-808 were calculated to be 0.33 and 0.19 nm, corresponding to the (111) and (220) planes of the cubic CdS system, respectively, thereby confirming our conjecture of in situ growth of metal sulfide NPs. This was further clarified from the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (c), which confirmed the presence of the two aforementioned planes for the crystalline CdS NPs.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "MOF-808-cys", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "Zr6O5(OH)3(BTC)2(HCOO)5(H2O)2"}, "catalytic activity": [{"value": "10.41", "unit": "mmol h\u20131 g\u20131", "time": "", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["catalytic_activity"]}, {"idx": 12, "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<title>Photocatalytic Studies</title><p>CdS<sub>1</sub>@MOF-808 exhibited\nconsiderable absorption of visible light, as evident from a significant\npeak at 410 nm in its absorption spectrum (a).

Following the literature report, B1, B2, and A1 bands are assigned to the exciton bleach due to the\nstate filling of the 1S\u00ad(e) level at the CB of CdS, stimulated emission,\nand the excitonic absorption due to the presence of multiple excitons,\nrespectively.

In this context, it was observed that photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the CdS moiety to the empty LUMO of the Zr4+ cluster of MOF-808-cys could open up a catalytic path for manifesting in excellent photocatalytic activity of the system. Confinement of CdS NPs in close proximity to the catalytic center, that is, the Zr4+ cluster, helps dock and separate electron-hole pairs by opening up a shorter electron transfer route, resulting in stabilization of the excited-state electron and rendering it more available for catalytic reactions. To study this phenomenon in detail, a comparative study was carried out between two photocatalytic systems, CdS4@MOF-808 and CdS/MOF-808-cys, having different locations of CdS NPs in the MOF-808 (Figure S33). Unlike CdS4@MOF-808, in case of CdS/MOF-808-cys, the presynthesized CdS NPs of 1-2 nm were stabilized on the surface of MOF-808-cys. From ICP-OES analysis, the amount of CdS present in CdS/MOF-808-cys was found to be 3.82 wt %, which is almost equal to that observed for CdS4@MOF-808. TEM images of CdS/MOF-808-cys showed the presence of CdS NPs on the external surface of the MOF (e). The photocatalytic activity observed for CdS/MOF-808-cys (0.15 mmol g-1 h-1) (f) was almost 60 times lower compared to that observed for CdS4@MOF-808. Recyclability tests demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity of CdS/MOF-808-cys gradually decreases with each cycle (Figure S25). Although the crystalline MOF structure remains intact post-photocatalytic reaction (Figure S34), considerably large agglomerations of CdS NPs on the MOF surface were observed for CdS/MOF-808-cys (Figures S38-S40). However, CdS NPs in CdS4@MOF-808 continued to maintain a uniform dispersion inside the MOF pores, as validated from TEM and FESEM images (Figures S35-S37). This further accentuates the fact that in an unconfined state, CdS NPs tend to agglomerate and undergo photobleaching, thereby reducing the overall photocatalytic activity of the system. To gain an insight into the factors responsible for such differential activity of the two samples, photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies were carried out. The photocurrent response (a) of the as-prepared samples was examined in a three-electrode photoelectrochemical cell with multiple 30 s on-off cycles under visible-light irradiation. CdS4@MOF-808 exhibited a much higher current density as compared to CdS/MOF-808-cys, suggesting a large separation rate of the photoinduced electron-hole pairs, and consequentially, higher efficiency of charge transfer from CdS to the MOF in the former was conjectured. The EIS-Nyquist plot of CdS4@MOF-808 (b) demonstrated a smaller circular radius than that of CdS/MOF-808-cys, therefore indicating a lower charge-transfer resistance of the former sample. Moreover, the photocurrent response and EIS analysis of MOF-808-cys individually revealed negligible charge transfer, thereby emphasizing the importance of CdS in this system for any PET process to occur, and most importantly, the enhanced charge-transfer efficiency of CdS4@MOF-808 compared to CdS/MOF-808-cys solely arises from the confinement of the CdS NPs inside the MOF pores. Furthermore, photophysical studies were employed to investigate the efficiency of charge carrier trapping and transfer in the photocatalysts. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of both CdS4@MOF-808 and CdS/MOF-808-cys (c) showed a peak at 504 nm corresponding to the radiative recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes. However, significant quenching of PL intensity was observed for CdS4@MOF-808 as compared to that of CdS/MOF-808-cys, indicating that the former showed enhanced separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The lifetime of the charge carriers was studied via luminescence decay measurements (d and Table S3), wherein CdS4@MOF-808 demonstrated a shortened lifetime value of 2.02 ns as compared to CdS/MOF-808-cys, which has a lifetime of 4.03 ns. To further understand the charge-transfer kinetics of the photogenerated electrons and origin of higher current density in CdS4@MOF-808 than CdS/MOF-808-cys observed in EIS studies, femtosecond TA experiments were performed. The TA spectra of CdS/MOF-808-cys in the visible region for different times are shown in Figure S41a. At initial time, the spectra of the sample showed a negative TA band (B1) with a peak ~480 nm and a broad negative band (B2) spanning over 520-700 nm. The TA spectra of the sample also revealed a positive absorption band (A1) below 440 nm. Following the literature report, B1, B2, and A1 bands are assigned to the exciton bleach due to the state filling of the 1S(e) level at the CB of CdS, stimulated emission, and the excitonic absorption due to the presence of multiple excitons, respectively. Significant quenching of all three bands in the presence of methyl viologen clearly indicates that an electron rather than a hole mainly contributes to these spectral bands (Figure S41b). Since the excitonic bleach band B1 represents the population of the electron in the 1S(e) state, its dynamics corresponds to the depopulation of the electron at the CB. Hence, to understand the fate of electrons, the dynamics of the B1 band has been analyzed. The fitting of B1 band decay kinetics results in the decay time constants of 0.83 ps (33%), 21 ps (53%), and 3.12 ns (14%) for CdS/MOF-808-cys. The two fast decay time constants are due to the trapping of the electron in the shallow and deep trap state, respectively. The longest lifetime (3.12 ns) is due to the recombination of the CB edge electron with the trapped hole. A similar TA spectral feature has been observed for CdS4@MOF-808 (e) except that the B1 band is centered at ~460 nm than 480 nm in CdS/MOF-808-cys. Such difference in the spectral position is due to the agglomeration of CdS NPs in CdS/MOF-808-cys. The kinetics of the B1 band for CdS4@MOF-808 has been compared with CdS/MOF-808-cys, and the result is shown in f. Similar analysis of the B1 band for CdS4@MOF-808 results in the decay time constants of 0.22 ps (44%), 13.2 ps (31%), and 384 ps (25%). Hence, the lifetime of excitonic electrons in the CB of CdS NPs reduces significantly due to its incorporation inside the MOF cavity as compared to the CdS NPs residing on the external surface of the MOF.
