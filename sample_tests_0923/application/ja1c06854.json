To address question 1, we utilized tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) to characterize the surface of LCryst isolated from Stage I (a) and found a beautiful growth spiral, that developed consecutively from the geometric center of LCryst (a) to its peripheral edge (b), affording a spiral pyramid on the crystal surface (c). This growth spiral had a terrace width of 320 nm and a Burgers vector b modulus of 1.4 nm (d), which is consistent with the interlayer distance of LCryst (Figure S5c). On the basis of the BCF theory, the above observations indicate the presence of a single screw dislocation at the geometric center of the growth spiral. In contrast to the case of 1D crystals, visualization of screw dislocations in layered crystals, including LCryst, is generally impossible, because the layered crystalline shell around the screw dislocation is too thick for TEM imaging. Therefore, we attempted to etch the surfaces of LCryst with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in DMF at [TFA] = 0.3 mM (). When the surface etching was briefly carried out over 5 s, LCryst did not show any change detectable by optical microscopy (g, [i] \u2192 [ii]). However, when the surface etching was carried out for 90 s, LCryst became thinner than it was before etching (g, [iii], and S5) and had a tiny through-hole at the geometric center (g, [iv]). We analyzed the surface features of the resulting acid-etched LCryst by tapping-mode AFM and found that the 5-s etched LCryst (g, [ii]) already had a tiny pit (h and i) at its geometric center, while the other regions mostly maintained a growth spiral pattern.

Thus, the interlayer distance (d) in LCryst was estimated to be 1.4 nm (Figure S5c). As shown in e, the crystal structure of PLCryst obtained by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis at 100 K showed that the ZnPor ligands, similar to the case of LCryst, are bridged by zinc paddlewheel units and that AzoPy bridges the paddlewheel units in every other ZnPor layer, thereby resulting in the pillared layer three-dimensional structure (Figures S5d and S5e). Viewed along the crystallographic b axis, two identical frameworks are mechanically interlocked with each other in a slipped cofacial manner (e and S5e).", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "L Cryst", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "crystal system": [{"value": "tetragonal", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["crystal_system"]}, {"idx": 5, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Stepwise <sup>L</sup>Cryst-to-<sup>PL</sup>Cryst transition\nat 65 \u00b0C (<bold>Pathway 1</bold>): Stage I, in a DMF/EtOH (3:1 <italic toggle=\"yes\">v</italic>/<italic toggle=\"yes\">v</italic>) solution of a mixture of <sup>2H</sup>Por, <sup>Azo</sup>Py, and Zn\u00ad(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\u00b76H<sub>2</sub>O (1:2:3 in molar ratio), kinetically preferred <sup>L</sup>Cryst is nucleated and grows without incorporation of <sup>Azo</sup>Py; Stage II, <sup>L</sup>Cryst spontaneously liberates a square-shaped\ncore region; Stage III, the liberated part gradually transforms into\nthermodynamically preferred <sup>PL</sup>Cryst via a hybrid crystal\nintermediate. <sup>PL</sup>Cryst grows continuously at the expense\nof residual <sup>L</sup>Cryst.
