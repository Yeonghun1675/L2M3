Crystals of the five binary MTV-MOFs (1  CuV , 1  CuMn , 1  CuCr , 1  CuFe , and 1  CuCo ) were obtained by heating a 1:1 mixture of H2 L  M  [M = VO, CrCl, MnCl, Fe(OAc), Co(OAc)] and H2 L  Cu  with Zn(NO3)2\u22c56H2O in DMF and MeOH at 80 \u00b0C. Crystals of the two ternary MTV-MOFs (1  CuMnCr  and 1  CuMnCo ) were obtained by heating a 1:1:1 mixture of one or two identical H2 L  Cu , H2 L  Mn , and H2 L  M  [M = CrCl and Co(OAc)] with Zn(NO3)2\u22c56H2O in DMF and EtOH at 80 \u00b0C. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction data for these binary and ternary MOFs were a little weak, but their isostructral nature to 1  Cu  could be well established by cell parameter determination and powder X-ray diffraction studies (A and B). ICP-OES showed that molar ratios of L  Cu /L  M  in the binary frameworks are 2:1 for 1  CuV  and 1  CuCo , 3:1 for 1  CuCr , and 4:1 for 1  CuMn  and 1  CuFe , respectively, and the molar ratios of both 1  CuMnCr  and 1  CuMnCo  are 2:1:1 in the ternary variants. The synthesis of these MTV-MOFs does not appear to be sensitive to the ligand feed ratios. For instance, varying the feed ratio of H2 L  Cu /H2 L  Mn /H2 L  Cr  from 1:1:1 to 2:1:1 and 3:1:1 did not change the composition of 1  MnCrCu  at all. EDS analysis of individual single crystals further showed that these mixed-linker MOFs are truly mixed-component compounds rather than physical mixtures of homoleptic series (C and D).\n\nEvaluation of the proposed sequential transformation began with exposure of 2,2-dimethyl-2H-chromene (2a) to oxidant 2-(tertbutylsulfonyl)iodosylbenzene (sPhIO) and (R)-1  CuMnCr  first and using aniline as a nucleophile. After screening a series of solvents, different catalyst loading, and temperature conditions, the sequential reaction was carried out with 0.5 mol % 1  CuMnCr  in the presence of 1.1 equiv of sPhIO in CH2Cl2 at 0 \u00b0C. It is essential to add the oxidant  several times at 15 min intervals, which can significantly improve the conversion of epoxide, and  aniline was added after epoxidation.
