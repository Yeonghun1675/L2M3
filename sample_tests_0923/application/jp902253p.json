At low pressures, both isomers have a similar amount of adsorption, particularly, in noncatenated IRMOF-14 and PCN-6' possessing relatively larger pores. Upon increasing pressure, nC4 exhibits a greater increase in adsorption than iC4 and reaches a higher saturation capacity. This implies that a competitive adsorption occurs between nC4 and iC4 at high pressures. The packing efficiency in MOFs is better for a linear isomer with a lower degree of branching, in accordance with the concept of shape selectivity; that is, a slender isomer is preferentially adsorbed over a bulky one due to the effect of configurational entropy.
