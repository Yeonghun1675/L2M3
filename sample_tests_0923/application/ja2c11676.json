According to the total density of state (TDOS) analyses in a,b, the continuous electron occupation of Ni-HTP and NiRu-HTP near the Fermi level (E f) suggests that both possess a high electrical conductivity. The obviously larger electron density of NiRu-HTP near E f than that of Ni-HTP implies a higher electrical conductivity, which is confirmed by the conductivity measurements in Figure S9. In addition, the fully symmetric electron state densities of Ni-HTP indicate that the Ni atoms are of low spin with no single electron. In NiRu-HTP, the electron state densities near E f are asymmetric and spin-polarized, which is attributed to the plentiful single electrons on Ru atoms, contributing to the gas adsorption and activation. Generally, the d-orbital energy level center (E d) is considered as a good descriptor to evaluate the adsorbate-metal interaction and electrocatalytic activity. The integration of TDOS of Ni-HTP and NiRu-HTP yields the E d of -1.82 and -1.43 eV for Ni-HTP and NiRu-HTP, respectively.

NiRu-HTP was prepared by partially replacing Ni sites with Ru via an ion-exchange method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of NiRu-HTP and Ni-HTP electrodes are shown in a and S2, respectively. The directional nanoarrays densely surround the carbon fibers of about 30 nm in diameter and ~1 \u03bcm in length, which induce the hierarchical porous structure to benefit electron transfer, gas diffusion, and exposure of catalytic active sites. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of NiRu-HTP and Ni-HTP nanowires manifest high crystallinity and interplanar spacing of 1.8 nm, as displayed in b and S3. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurement of NiRu-HTP indicates that the contents of Ru and Ni are 37 and 63%, respectively.\n\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of NiRu-HTP and Ni-HTP in c and S4a suggest their high crystalline features. Pawley refinements were conducted to simulate their crystal structures, which reveal that they can be assigned to the hexagonal structure. The prominent peaks at 4.7, 9.4, 12.4, and 16.5\u00b0 are corresponding to the (001), (002), (210), and (004) facets, respectively, indicating the long-range order within the ab plane. Their comprehensive crystallographic information is depicted in Table S1, and their main structure variations are the lattice constants and unit cell volume. The Ni or Ru atoms are coordinated with the tritopic HTP linkers to form hexagonal units in Ni-HTP or NiRu-HTP with the layered graphene-like honeycomb structure, as depicted in d and S4b. The enlarged HRTEM image of NiRu-HTP perpendicular to the c-axis in e presents an ordered honeycomb arrangement of hexagonal pores of 2.0 nm along the [001] direction, which is consistent with the simulated structure of NiRu-HTP. The molecular structures of NiRu-HTP and Ni-HTP were disclosed in Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of Figure S5. The three peaks at 1273, 1513, and 1619 cm-1 are ascribed to the stretching vibrations of C-C, C-N, and C\ue5fbN bonds in NiRu-HTP and Ni-HTP, respectively. The stretching vibration peak of C-N upshifts from 1502 cm-1 (H-N-C, HTP) to 1513 cm-1 (Ru/Ni-N-C) due to the formation of Ni-N or Ru-N bonds in NiRu-HTP and Ni-HTP, along with the peak disappearance of Ar-NH2 at 3275 cm-1.\n\nX-ray absorption spectroscopy is employed to study the coordination of Ni and Ru in Ni-HTP and NiRu-HTP. g displays the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of Ni K-edge in NiO, Ni-HTP, and NiRu-HTP. The edge positions of Ni-HTP and NiRu-HTP are approaching that of NiO, indicating that the Ni species are positively charged with the valence state of +2, in consistence with XPS (Figure S6b). The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectrum of Ni-HTP displays its characteristic peak at 1.3 \u00c5, and it is assigned to the Ni-N bond (h). The EXAFS fitting indicates the average coordination number of 4 on Ni within Ni-HTP (Figure S8), corresponding to the Ni-N4 units, in line with the resolved crystal structure in Figure S4. The XANES spectra of Ru K-edge in i suggest that the edge position of NiRu-HTP is located between Ru foil and RuO2, revealing that Ru exists with the valence state between 0 and +4. The Fourier-transformed EXAFS spectrum of NiRu-HTP in j exhibits a characteristic peak of 1.47 \u00c5 for the Ru-N bond, and its fitting indicates an average coordination number of 4 for Ru-N in Figure S8. In comparison with Ru foil and RuO2, no characteristic peaks of Ru-Ru bonds in NiRu-HTP can be observed and suggest the atomically dispersed Ru sites. The wavelet transform (WT) analyses are further performed for the Ru K-edge XANES spectra of NiRu-HTP (k). It displays a WT intensity maximum at ~5.0 \u00c5-1 for the planar Ru-N coordination, which is obviously different from RuO2 and Ru-Ru bonds at 10.5 \u00c5-1 in Ru foil. This verifies the atomic dispersion of Ru-N4 in NiRu-HTP.\n\nElectronic Structure of NiRu-HTP and Ni-HTP\n\nThe electronic structures of NiRu-HTP and Ni-HTP are uncovered by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. According to the total density of state (TDOS) analyses in a,b, the continuous electron occupation of Ni-HTP and NiRu-HTP near the Fermi level (E f) suggests that both possess a high electrical conductivity. The obviously larger electron density of NiRu-HTP near E f than that of Ni-HTP implies a higher electrical conductivity, which is confirmed by the conductivity measurements in Figure S9. In addition, the fully symmetric electron state densities of Ni-HTP indicate that the Ni atoms are of low spin with no single electron. In NiRu-HTP, the electron state densities near E f are asymmetric and spin-polarized, which is attributed to the plentiful single electrons on Ru atoms, contributing to the gas adsorption and activation. Generally, the d-orbital energy level center (E d) is considered as a good descriptor to evaluate the adsorbate-metal interaction and electrocatalytic activity. The integration of TDOS of Ni-HTP and NiRu-HTP yields the E d of -1.82 and -1.43 eV for Ni-HTP and NiRu-HTP, respectively. The higher E d of NiRu-HTP than that of Ni-HTP suggests the enhanced O2 adsorption and higher oxygen reduction activity. The valence band maxima (E VB) of Ni-HTP and NiRu-HTP are estimated to be ca. -0.32 and 0.07 eV, respectively (Figure S10). Since the valence electrons are approaching E f and mainly contribute to the d states, it allows the distinctly higher d-orbital energy level of NiRu-HTP than that of Ni-HTP, in accordance with the abovementioned TDOS analyses.\n\nPDOS calculations are performed to investigate the interplay between Ni-HTP/NiRu-HTP and O2 molecules, as plotted in c,d. The electronic interaction is regarded as the coupling of molecular orbitals of O2 with d orbitals of metal nodes, giving rise to the orbital splitting to form the separated bonding and antibonding orbitals in Figure S11. The bonding states locate far below the E f and are generally fully filled, while the electron filling of antibonding states is decided by the position of d-orbitals relative to E f and contributes to the bonding strength. Obviously, NiRu-HTP manifests a significantly higher E d and larger hybridization degree with the 2p orbitals of O2 than Ni-HTP, which implies its higher bonding strength with O2. Specifically, at the Ni-N4 site, the d xz  and d yz  orbitals of Ni are overlapped with \u03c0 orbitals of O2 to generate the (d xz /d yz -\u03c0)* orbitals, as shown in c. For the Ru-N4 site, the       d     z   2        and d xz  orbitals of the Ru site are coupled with the \u03c3 and \u03c0 orbitals of O2 to constitute the respective (      d     z   2       -\u03c3)* and (d xz -\u03c0)* orbitals, as plotted in d. As compared with the (d xz /d yz -\u03c0)* in Ni-HTP, the (      d     z   2       -\u03c3)* and (d xz -\u03c0)* in NiRu-HTP displays a lower electron occupancy and higher energy level, which suggest the enhanced O2 adsorption and boosted Ru-O2 interaction. The O2-enrichment capabilities of NiRu-HTP and Ni-HTP are confirmed by low-pressure O2 adsorption at 298.25 K (Figure S12). Their O2 uptake linearly rises as a function of pressure, and NiRu-HTP exhibits an O2 adsorption of 7.02 cm-3 g-1 under an ambient atmosphere, obviously outperforming Ni-HTP (3.33 cm-3 g-1), suggesting the stronger O2 adsorption on NiRu-HTP.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "Ni-HTP", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "Ni-HTP"}, "crystal system": [{"value": "hexagonal", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "NiRu-HTP", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "NiRu-HTP"}, "crystal system": [{"value": "hexagonal", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["crystal_system"]}, {"idx": "13, 14, 16, 19, 20", "type": "text", "classification": "property", "content": "<p>\ne,f shows the differential charge density of O<sub>2</sub> adsorption on Ni-HTP and NiRu-HTP.
