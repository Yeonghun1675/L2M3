In contrast, 2 and 3 exhibit large and steep uptake steps as their pores are filled with water. These materials remain crystalline after water sorption and retain their high BET surface areas of 1912 m2 g-1 and 1762 m2 g-1, respectively (Figures S3-S6).

B illustrates the superiority of 2, on a material basis in this humidity range, as compared to other MOFs and zeolites that have been investigated for their water uptake properties. \n\nOwing to its superior water adsorption behavior, Co2Cl2BTDD (2) was investigated in greater detail with respect to its potential utility in AWGs and AHPs. The heat of adsorption for water in 2, determined by variable temperature water sorption isotherms fitted to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, is approximately 55 kJ mol-1 at zero coverage and falls to 45.8 kJ mol-1 during pore filling (Figure S7). The latter is closer to the heat of vaporization for water, 40.7 kJ mol-1, and indicates that water-water interactions are dominant during pore filling. The variable temperature water sorption isotherms also allow the calculation of a characteristic curve, which converts the independent pressure and temperature variables governing uptake into a single parameter related to the Gibbs free energy of adsorption (see the Supporting Information). In turn, the characteristic curve allows for the extrapolation of an isotherm at a given temperature to temperature and pressure values relevant for various devices. The characteristic curve for 2 (Figure S8) was validated by measuring water vapor isotherms at 283, 293, and 298 K (Figure S9).

In a similar device, 2 is projected to capture and release 0.87 LH2O kg-1 MOF per cycle.\n\nThe thermodynamic parameters of water sorption in 2 highlight its exceptional performance at transferring heat. The water-2 fluid-adsorbent working pair achieves a 20 \u00b0C temperature lift, the range required for an air conditioner, for instance. This temperature difference can be achieved with a cooling capacity per cycle of ~400 kWh m-3 (A), at least 50 kWh m-3 higher than that of any known adsorbent, regardless of regeneration temperature.
