The liquid-liquid interface disappeared after removing the upper phase; therefore, the liquid/liquid interfacial tension and the interaction between the film and the upper phase were eliminated. Hence, the film folded due to the unbalanced forces. It can be inferred based on the folding times and the width of the film shown in c that the length can reach more than 200 \u03bcm if the film is unfolded, indicating that a large-area homogeneous ultrathin film forms at the interface. The SEM observation is consistent with the TEM observation (d). A large-area homogeneous flat thin film appeared, and the folded edges can be seen clearly. From the HRTEM image of the folded structure, one can see a clear layered structure with an interlayer spacing of about 3 nm (e). Several lamellar structures of inorganic and organic crystals and inorganic/organic hybrids were confirmed by HRTEM imaging. In some cases, the interplanar distance obtained from the TEM images was not in accordance with the actual situation sometimes due to the removal of residual ligands or solvents between the layers in organic/inorganic hybrids under a high vacuum, and it can still be used as a qualitative criterion for the layered structure. f shows the XRD pattern of the film. Two peaks corresponding to the (001) and (003) crystal planes of the layered structure appeared, and the d-spacing was calculated to be 1.32 nm. This value is much less than the interlayer spacing obtained from the HRTEM image, indicating the structural change of the films under a high vacuum. This may be attributed to the evaporation of some small molecules incorporated in the film, such as water molecules. The more likely reason should be the folding of the film, which may cause the structural changes, distortion, or superposition of the layered structure, leading to incorrect information. This value is slightly less than 1.57 nm, the d-spacing of the Eu(DN-bpy)2Cl3 powder, indicating the difference between the two kinds of structures, possibly arising from the different orientations of the alkyl chains in these structures because of the different microenvironments.
