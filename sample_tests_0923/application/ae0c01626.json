The morphology of Li2O2 can not only provide the open channels beneficial to the oxygen and ion diffusion, but also increase the contact area of the Li2O2/electrolyte interface, making Li2O2 easy to be decomposed and reducing the charging overpotential. For the MnO2 electrode, it can be observed that large disk-like Li2O2 is formed by closely assembled Li2O2 nanosheets (c,d). According to previous reports, the disk-like Li2O2 formation process can be described as follows, some Li2O2 nanoflakes grow on the MnO2 electrode surface during discharge at first, and then a large number of nanoflakes are connected together to form this disk-like Li2O2 with the increasing of Li2O2 density. The large disk-like Li2O2 stacked on the MnO2 electrode with a diameter of about 5 \u03bcm, resulting in slow electron and ionic transport performance, making it more difficult for the catalytic decomposition of Li2O2 and resulting in a higher overpotential. On the contrary, the size of Li2O2 on the NiCo-LDH/MnO2 electrode decreases to 1 \u03bcm with a typical toroidal structure, as shown in e,f. Interestingly, unlike previously reported toroidal Li2O2-stacked thin plate by a layer-by-layer mechanism, the porous toroidal Li2O2 is also made up of nanoflakes with a thickness of several nanometers. This unique structure displays the advantage of a large specific surface area and close contact with the electrode surface, which makes it easier to implement the delithiation process compared with bulk Li2O2.

The terminal discharge/charge voltages maintain relatively stable states up to 130 cycles for the NiCo-LDH/MnO2 electrode. The charge overpotentials of NiCo-LDH (c) and MnO2 (Figure S8) electrodes increase continuously to 4.5 V during circulation. Especially, the overpotential of the MnO2 electrode is the highest one in the first cycle, and increases dramatically in the subsequent cycles because of its inferior OER catalytic activity. Moreover, although the NiCo-LDH cathode displays much lower charge overpotential at the first 30 cycles attributed to high OER catalytic activity, Li2O2 and byproducts accumulated on the NiCo-LDH cathode surface during cycling bring about the passivation of the active sites, resulting in the rapid increase of charging overpotential. Nevertheless, the overpotential of the hybrid catalyst electrode increases slowly in the first cycles, and does not change significantly from the 20th to 140th cycles, proving that the robust NiCo-LDH/MnO2 nanocages have stable catalytic activity (c). It is worth noting that the terminal voltage dropping below 2 V originates from the consumption of the lithium anode and electrolyte instead of the deactivation of NiCo LDH/MnO2 catalysts. As depicted in Figure S12, the NiCo-LDH/MnO2 cathode can still operate normally after reassembly, indicating the NiCo-LDH/MnO2 cathode is effective to improve ORR/OER reaction kinetics and thus extend the cycling life. Furthermore, we carried out cycling measurements under a limited capacity of 1000 mA h g-1. As shown in Figure S13a-c, the NiCo-LDH/MnO2 catalyst shows significant advantages of ameliorating overpotential and improving cycling stability of LOBs compared with the single component. Therefore, NiCo LDH/MnO2-based cells can operate very stably for at least 130 cycles during cycling. In contrast, NiCo LDH/MnO2-based batteries can only maintain 46 and 29 cycles, respectively (Figure S13d).\n\nThe reversibility of Li2O2 formation and decomposition has been verified by comparing three fully discharged and recharged cathodes using ex situ XRD techniques (a). As for fully discharged cathodes, there are obvious diffraction peaks at 32.7, 34.8, and 58.6\u00b0 corresponding to the crystal planes of Li2O2 (JCPDS card no. 73-1640), indicating that Li2O2 is the main discharge product. However, only the MnO2 electrode still has a weak bump at 32.7\u00b0 after the subsequent charge process, demonstrating that Li2O2 could not be completely decomposed for the MnO2 electrode during charging, which leads to the accumulation of Li2O2 on the electrode surface. Thus, the large overpotential and poor cycling performance are observed. In contrast, the characteristic peaks of Li2O2 for the other two electrodes disappear completely, meaning that the discharge and charge capacities are mainly contributed by the reversible formation and decomposition of Li2O2. It is worth noting that the crystalline state of Li2O2 formed by the three electrodes is different. The sharp and narrow diffraction peaks of Li2O2 on the NiCo-LDH electrode illustrate that it has the best crystallinity, while the peak intensity of Li2O2 is lower and broader after NiCo-LDH is combined with MnO2, suggesting that Li2O2 is transformed from highly crystalline to low crystalline. Then, the formation of poor-crystalline state Li2O2 is favorable for the decomposition of Li2O2 and reducing the charge voltage gap.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn summary, hierarchical hollow NiCo-LDH/MnO2 nanostructures derived from MOFs using a facile method were rationally designed for LOBs. The hollow NiCo-LDH/MnO2 hierarchical nanostructures exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance with a highly charge/discharge specific capacity of 13,380 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1, a long-term cycling stability for 162 cycles at a cutoff capacity of 500 mAh g-1, and a low overpotential of 0.63 V in the first cycle. The hollow NiCo-LDH/MnO2 nanostructures possess highly special surface areas, abundant open active sites, and short diffusion paths for Li+ and oxygen, and show advantages of enhancing catalytic activity for ORR and OER, as well as reducing charge/discharge overpotential. Furthermore, for the NiCo-LDH/MnO2 cathodes, the porous toroidal Li2O2 are made up of nanosheets formed during the discharge process resulting from the synergistic effect of NiCo-LDH and MnO2. The toroidal Li2O2 assembled by fine nanoflakes formed on the surface of cathode can be conducive to form a low-impedance Li2O2/cathode contact interface to achieve the reversible formation and decomposition of Li2O2. This unique porous structure not only brings large specific capacity, but also reduces polarization and further improves battery performance. Moreover, the application of MOF derivatives expands the selection range of electrocatalysts and offers a new idea of structure design for LOBs.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "NiCo-LDH/MnO2", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "NiCo-LDH/MnO2"}, "cycling performance": "better than others", "overpotential": "0.21/0.42 V", "cycle life": "162 cycles", "terminal discharge/charge voltages": "maintain relatively stable states up to 130 cycles", "charge overpotentials": "increases slowly in the first cycles, and does not change significantly from the 20th to 140th cycles", "catalytic activity": "stable", "cycling life": "extended", "overpotential and cycling stability": "improved", "cycles during cycling": "at least 130 cycles"}, {"meta": {"name": "NiCo-LDH", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "NiCo-LDH"}, "overpotential": "0.38 V/0.46 V", "cycle life": "98 cycles", "charge overpotentials": "increase continuously to 4.5 V during circulation", "cycling life": "46 cycles"}, {"meta": {"name": "MnO2", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "MnO2"}, "overpotential": "0.29 V/0.76 V", "cycle life": "31 cycles", "charge overpotentials": "highest one in the first cycle, and increases dramatically in the subsequent cycles", "cycling life": "29 cycles"}, {"meta": {"name": "Li2O2", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": "Li2O2"}, "formation and decomposition": "verified", "main discharge product": "yes", "decomposition during charging": "could not be completely decomposed for the MnO2 electrode", "crystalline state": "different for the three electrodes", "formation of poor-crystalline state": "favorable for the decomposition of Li2O2 and reducing the charge voltage gap"}, {"meta": {"name": "hierarchical hollow NiCo-LDH/MnO2 nanostructures", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "electrocatalytic performance": "excellent", "charge/discharge specific capacity": "13,380 mA h g\u20131 at 100 mA g\u20131", "long-term cycling stability": "162 cycles at a cutoff capacity of 500 mAh g\u20131", "overpotential": "0.63 V in the first cycle", "surface areas": "highly special", "catalytic activity for ORR and OER": "enhanced", "charge/discharge overpotential": "reduced"}]], "include_properties": []}, {"idx": 7, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>SEM images\nof (a,b) NiCo LDH and (c,d) NiCo LDH/MnO<sub>2</sub>.</p>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"ae0c01626_0002.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  SEM images of (a,b) NiCo LDH and (c,d) NiCo LDH/MnO2.
