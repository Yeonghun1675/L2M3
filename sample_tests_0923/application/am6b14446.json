The assay of the HeLa cells treated with Ce6@MOF displayed growing apoptosis degree under increasing laser power (Figure S10) and gained the satisfactory apoptosis degree at 500 mW cm-2, which was comparable to the effect of CPC@MOF with the power of 200 mW cm-2, demonstrating the good therapy performance of multifunctional CPC@MOF probe. Besides, the treatment time was also an important factor in the therapy process. As shown in B for Cam@MOF, 53% apotosis ratio of pure drug-treated HeLa cells needed the long treatment time of 30 h. In comparison, above 99% apotosis ratio of CPC@MOF-treated cells was achieved after 7.5 h of incubation and 5 min of laser irradiation at 200 mW cm-2. These results manifested that a better therapy efficiency could be achieved by the synergistic antitumor effect both the chemotherapy and CaB-depended PDT of CPC@MOF.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "Cam", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "payload": {"value": "3.9", "unit": "wt %"}}, {"meta": {"name": "MOF-NH2", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "zeta potential": {"value": "-17.7", "unit": "mV"}}, {"meta": {"name": "Ce6-peptide", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "loaded amount": {"value": "32.3", "unit": "mg g\u20131"}}, {"meta": {"name": "Ce6@MOF", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "fluorescence intensity": {"value": "increased", "unit": ""}, "incubation time": {"value": "60", "unit": "min"}, "pH": {"value": "5.0", "unit": ""}}, {"meta": {"name": "MOF-NH2", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "viability": {"value": "90%", "unit": ""}}, {"meta": {"name": "Ce6@MOF", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "viability": {"value": "91.1%", "unit": ""}}, {"meta": {"name": "Cam@MOF", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "apoptosis percentage": {"value": "increasing", "unit": ""}}, {"meta": {"name": "CPC@MOF", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "viability": {"value": "decreased", "unit": ""}, "apoptosis percentage": {"value": "99.27%", "unit": ""}, "laser irradiation power": {"value": "200", "unit": "mW cm\u20132"}, "laser irradiation time": {"value": "5", "unit": "min"}}]], "include_properties": []}, {"idx": 5, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"scheme\" id=\"sch1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Schematic Illustration of (A) Preparation of Multifunctionalized\nCPC@MOF Nanoprobe and (B) Cathepsin B-Activated Cancer Cell Imaging\nand Chemo-Photodynamic Therapy</title>\n</caption>\n<graphic id=\"gr1\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"am-2016-144462_0008.tif\"></graphic>\n</fig>", "clean_text": " 1  Schematic Illustration of (A) Preparation of Multifunctionalized CPC@MOF Nanoprobe and (B) Cathepsin B-Activated Cancer Cell Imaging and Chemo-Photodynamic Therapy   ", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 14, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(A) SEM image of MOF-NH<sub>2</sub>.
