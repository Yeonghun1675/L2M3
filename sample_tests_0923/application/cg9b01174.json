The structural stability\nof MUT-1 after the activation process and removal of the coordinated\nsolvents from its 1D channels were confirmed by PXRD analysis and <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy, respectively (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.cgd.9b01174/suppl_file/cg9b01174_si_001.pdf\">Figures S4 and S5</ext-link> in the Supporting Information).

In the\ncase of water, it was observed that MUT-1 was soluble in it. This\nphenomenon is relatively rare in MOFs, and there are few reported\nMOFs with this property. A powder X-ray\ndiffraction pattern (PXRD) of the ethanol-exchanged bulk material\nshowed all significant peaks with appropriate matches with the simulated\nPXRD pattern. This result indicates the crystalline phase purity and\nstructural stability of MUT-1 in dry ethanol.

MUT-1 is soluble in water and is accompanied by a phase\nchange (A phase).

Therefore, this phase remains unknown.\nFor more investigations of the A phase, some analyses such as FT-IR\nand TG-DTA were carried out (<ext-link xlink:href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.cgd.9b01174/suppl_file/cg9b01174_si_001.pdf\">Figures S1 and S9</ext-link> in the Supporting Information, respectively).

Thus, the A phase shows different thermal\nbehavior and has higher thermal stability in comparison with MUT-1.</p><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, a new calcium-based\nMOF, [Ca\u00ad(NO<sub>2</sub>-BDC)\u00b7DMF]<sub>\n<italic>n</italic>\n</sub> (MUT-1), with 5,5T4 topology and the Scha\u0308fli\nsymbol of (4<sup>8</sup>.6<sup>2</sup>)\u00ad(4<sup>5</sup>.6<sup>5</sup>) was synthesized and structurally characterized by the single-crystal\nX-ray technique.

MUT-1 has 1D channels along the crystallographic c axis. Its 1D channels have microporosity before the activation process, and its nanoporous structure can be achieved with the activation process. 1D channels of MUT-1 are surrounded by -NO2 groups, which indicate that this MOF could be a good candidate for CO2 storage. It shows 0.97 mmol g-1 of CO2 adsorption at 298 K up to 1 bar pressure. The structural stability of MUT-1 in various solvents was investigated, and a new phase after subsequent exposure to water and DMF was characterized.\n\nSingle-Crystal X-ray Analysis\n\nThe results of single-crystal X-ray diffraction confirmed that the structure of [Ca(NO2-BDC)\u22c5DMF] n  (MUT-1) is an extended 3D framework. It has a trigonal crystal system with R3c space group (). The asymmetric unit of MUT-1 consists of one Ca atom, one deprotonated NO2-BDC ligand, and one coordinated DMF molecule (a). The structure of MUT-1 consists of only one kind of calcium ion that is coordinated with seven oxygen atoms (O1, O2, 2 O3, 2 O4, and O7) and forms a distorted pentagonal bipyramid (b,c). Six oxygen atoms are from the NO2-BDC2- ligand and one oxygen atom is from the DMF molecule. Ca-O distances in the structure of MUT-1 are 2.28-2.57 \u00c5 (Table S1 in the Supporting Information). This range is similar to those of compounds with similar bonds. \n\nAlthough DMF molecules are coordinated to metal sites through their oxygen atoms and occupied the pores, the structure of MUT-1 is microporous before the activation process and has 1D channels with a diameter of 8.0 \u00c5 (represented with a yellow circle in ). These 1D channels are along the crystallographic c axis, and its dimension is obtained by measuring the van der Waals radii of atoms by Diamond software. The 1D channels of MUT-1 in the absence of solvents have a diameter of 15.3 \u00c5 that is shown with an orange circle in  (see also Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). The types of pores are classified on the basis of their diameter. Nanopores are in the range of 1-10 nm. Thus, we can consider MUT-1 as both a micro- and nanoporous MOF. The solvent-accessible volume was obtained as 1123.5 \u00c53 by olex2 software from the structural data without drying the MOF. \n\nThermal Behavior\n\nThe TG-DTA result is shown in . According to the results obtained, there are two main weight loss steps. The first weight loss is 23.8% from 65 to 200 \u00b0C, which corresponds to removal of coordinated DMF molecules that exist in the channels. On the basis of calculation, 22.7% of the molecular weight of MUT-1 consists of DMF molecules, which is similar to the results obtained from TG-DTA analysis (23.8%). This analysis also confirms that there is one DMF molecule per formula unit. The second step (about 59.0%) corresponds to the chemical decomposition of NO2-BDC2-, which starts at 200 \u00b0C and ends at 400 \u00b0C. The DTA curve of the compound displays two main exothermic peaks at 382 and 473 \u00b0C. These results show that the main step of the decomposition process occurs at 400 \u00b0C.\n\nN2 Adsorption Isotherm\n\nThe BET surface area of MUT-1 before any activation was investigated. Crystals of MUT-1 were dried in the oven at 60 \u00b0C for 8 h. These crystals had a surface area of 1.315 m2 g-1 (). The N2 adsorption isotherm of MUT-1 before the activation process (a) showed that, at saturated pressure, MUT-1 can adsorb 1.05 cm3 g-1 of N2 gas. Activation of MUT-1 was carried out by a solvent exchange method. MUT-1 crystals were Soxhlet extracted with ethanol for 24 h. After the successful solvent exchange, crystals were heated in the vacuum oven at 80 \u00b0C for 24 h. The structural stability of MUT-1 after the activation process and removal of the coordinated solvents from its 1D channels were confirmed by PXRD analysis and 1H NMR spectroscopy, respectively (Figures S4 and S5 in the Supporting Information). The results obtained from N2 adsorption showed that MUT-1 has slightly accessible channels with a BET surface area of 28.173 m2 g-1 ( and b). The N2 adsorption isotherm (b) also showed that, at saturated pressure, an activated sample of MUT-1 can adsorb 83.58 cm3 g-1 of N2 gas. According to IUPAC classifications, this is a type V isotherm that is a particular type of adsorption in a micro- or mesoporous material. Also, there is a wide hysteresis in the N2 isotherm of MUT-1. On the basis of the IUPAC classifications of hysteresis loops, this MOF represents a type H3 hysteresis. This type of isotherm does not exhibit any limiting adsorption at high P/P 0. This type of hysteresis also represents that the desorption branch is delayed. The reasons can be due to various phenomena, such as pore blocking, cavitation, and strong adsorbate-adsorbent interactions in the MOF. The pore size distribution of MUT-1 before and after activation, evaluated using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method, is shown in Figure S6 in the Supporting Information.\n\nCO2 Adsorption\n\nOne of the structural features of MUT-1 is the presence of nitro groups in the pores. The presence of this functional group with a polar nature can be suitable for interactions with the quadrupole moment of CO2 molecules. Therefore CO2 adsorption of MUT-1 was measured at 298 K up to 1 bar pressure (). The results obtained showed a maximum CO2 adsorption of 0.97 mmol g-1 at room temperature. This amount is comparable with those of some other reports that are given in . Its CO2 adsorption is similar to thta of ZIF-8 and ZIF-100 and higher than that of MOF-2 and MOF-5, which have no functional group on BDC2-. The Langmuir surface area of this MOF was also determined by CO2 sorption measurements at 298 K, which showed a surface area of 555 m2 g-1.\n\nStructural Stability of MUT-1 in Different Solvents\n\nIn order to study the stability of MUT-1 in different solvents, samples of the synthesized MOF were immersed in solvents for 3-4 days. Then they were heated in the oven at the temperature near the boiling point of the solvents to obtain an activated powder sample. In the case of water, it was observed that MUT-1 was soluble in it. This phenomenon is relatively rare in MOFs, and there are few reported MOFs with this property. A powder X-ray diffraction pattern (PXRD) of the ethanol-exchanged bulk material showed all significant peaks with appropriate matches with the simulated PXRD pattern. This result indicates the crystalline phase purity and structural stability of MUT-1 in dry ethanol. Some other solvents, including water, methanol, acetonitrile, and dichloromethane, were also investigated. MUT-1 is stable and insoluble in all of the solvents except water (Figure S7 in the Supporting Information). MUT-1 is soluble in water and is accompanied by a phase change (A phase). This change in the structure of MUT-1 can be attributed to dissolution/reorganization reactions, including Ca-O bond breaking and re-formation. An investigation of this new phase (the preparation method is explained in the Supporting Information) requires crystallographic studies on a single crystal of this MOF in water. However, unfortunately, the crystallization process of this compound in water was not successful. In an continuation of our previous work on investigating the structural conversion of MOFs and coordination polymers, in this case a comparison between the PXRD pattern of the A phase with those of other reported MOFs constructed from Ca2+ and terephthalic acid in the presence of water was done in order to find some similar patterns (Figure S8 in the Supporting Information). (1) A PXRD pattern (Figure S8 in the Supporting Information) that is attributed to a MOF with the formula [Ca(BDC)(DMF)(H2O)] n  formula was similar to that of the A phase. However, there are some differences that are represented in red. Therefore, this phase remains unknown. For more investigations of the A phase, some analyses such as FT-IR and TG-DTA were carried out (Figures S1 and S9 in the Supporting Information, respectively). The IR spectrum indicates a pattern similar to that of MUT-1, but the peak at 1667 cm-1 that is attributed to the carboxyl group of DMF molecules is reduced in the A phase and shows a smaller amount of DMF in the structure of the A phase. The TG-DTA result is in agreement with that of FT-IR and shows lower reduced weight (14.5%) in comparison with MUT-1 (23.8%) at about 200 \u00b0C. On the basis of a similar FT-IR spectrum and lower DMF content in the A phase, a compound with a chemical formula of [Ca(NO2-BDC)\u22c50.6DMF] n  is proposed for the A phase. MUT-1 is stable up to 200 \u00b0C () and the A phase is stable up to 400 \u00b0C (Figure S9 in the Supporting Information). Thus, the A phase shows different thermal behavior and has higher thermal stability in comparison with MUT-1.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn summary, a new calcium-based MOF, [Ca(NO2-BDC)\u22c5DMF] n  (MUT-1), with 5,5T4 topology and the Scha\u0308fli symbol of (48.62)(45.65) was synthesized and structurally characterized by the single-crystal X-ray technique.
