Each metal ion is thus coordinated by eight oxygen atoms including one from H2O. The coordination geometry around the cadmium metal ions in 1 is best described as a distorted square antiprism. The framework is negatively charged (-6 per formula unit), but no countercations were found by X-ray diffraction analysis. The presence of 1.5 Cd2+ and three solvated protons (3H3O+) per formula unit balancing the framework charge was, however, suggested by elemental analysis.\n\nThe framework of 1 is stable in air as well as in various solutions. It is also stable up to 350 \u00b0C even after removal of guest molecules in the large channels. The exceptional stability and the accessibility of metal ions constituting the framework of 1 from the large channels prompted us to explore the possibility of metal ion exchange from the integral part of the framework. When 1 was immersed in aqueous Pb(NO3)2 solution for a week, a complete exchange (as analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES)) of the framework Cd(II) ions by Pb(II) ions was observed without losing the structural integrity. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of the Pb(II) exchanged MOF (2a) is similar to that of the parent compound 1 (Figure a). Furthermore, this ion exchange process occurs without losing single crystallinity, as confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD) studies. The X-ray structural analysis of the Pb(II)-exchanged crystal (2a) clearly indicated that the overall framework structure of 2a is the same as that of 1. The only significant difference is that the M-O bond distances in 2a (Pb-O1 2.489; Pb-O2 2.526; Pb-O2' 2.833; Pb-O3 3.070 \u00c5) are substantially longer than those in 1 (Cd-O1 2.327; Cd-O2 2.289; Cd-O2' 2.477; Cd-O3 2.641 \u00c5) reflecting the larger size of Pb2+ than Cd2+ (ionic radius, 1.43 \u00c5 vs 1.24 \u00c5, respectively). We have also confirmed that the crystal structure of 2a is essentially identical to that of 2 directly synthesized from lead nitrate and H3hett.
