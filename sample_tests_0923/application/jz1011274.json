In contrast, molecular simulations are expected to bring a more subtle and conclusive analysis of the mechanism in play, considering the length and time scales sampled. The numerical investigation of this structural transition started with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on our newly derived classical flexible force field for the framework, which allowed successful capture of the structural transformation of this solid upon CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption and thermal stimuli. It was concluded that such a structural switching is mainly governed by the intramolecular distortion term of the framework.

We have further conducted a Hybrid Osmotic Monte Carlo simulation (HOMC) approach, which evidenced that the structural transformation of the framework is accompanied by a change of the orientational order parameter for the adsorbate.
