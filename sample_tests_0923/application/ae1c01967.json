The mesoporous structure has a positive impact on the mass transfer and rapid diffusion of O2, thus providing a highly accessible surface area and more active sites for the electrolysis. \n\nElectrocatalytic Properties\n\nTo assess catalytic performance toward ORR, the five samples' powder as well as 20% Pt/C were tested for linear sweeping voltammograms (LSV) in O2-bubbled 0.1 M KOH solution with a rotation speed of 1600 rpm at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1. As displayed in a and Table S3, without the addition Co2+ in the precursor, even the diffusion limiting current density of Ni4Co0-CNR does not achieve -4 mA cm-2, whereas after the introduction of Co2+ in the precursor, Ni3Co1-CNR, Ni2Co2-CNR, and Ni1Co3-CNR can reach higher values above -4 mA cm-2, indicating that the synergetic effects between NiCo alloy nanoparticles and carbon nanorods can enhance ORR performance. More remarkably, Ni2Co2-CNR shows pleasurable ORR catalytic activity confirmed by the limiting current density (-5.15 mA cm-2) and half-wave potential (E 1/2 = 0.80 V) being more positive than those of Ni4Co0-CNR, Ni3Co1-CNR, and Ni1Co3-CNR, although they are slightly lower than those of 20% Pt/C. However, with the continuous increase of Co2+ until Ni2+ is totally replaced by Co2+, the limiting current density of Ni0Co4-CNR is still unsatisfactory. All the above discussions demonstrate that Ni2Co2-CNR possesses the best ORR electrocatalytic performances. The excellent ORR activity of Ni2Co2-CNR can further be verified by the Tafel slope displayed in b. It can be seen that the Tafel slope of Ni2Co2-CNR is 83 mV/dec, much lower than that of Ni4Co0-CNR (150 mV/dec), Ni3Co1-CNR (138 mV/dec), Ni1Co3-CNR (123 mV/dec), and Ni0Co4-CNR (127 mV/dec) and even comparable to that of Pt/C (70 mV/dec), which validates the preferable kinetic process of Ni2Co2-CNR toward ORR.
