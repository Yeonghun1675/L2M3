The XRD pattern shows that COMOC-2(lp) is isostructural with the rigid microporous aluminum biphenyl-4,4'-dicarboxylate DUT-5. COMOC-2 structure (Figure ) contains chains of octahedra cross-linked by BPDC2- organic linkers. The octahedral chains have a -O\ue5fbV-O\ue5fbV- coordination mode. The equatorial corners of the {VO6} octahedra are shared with BPDC2- ligands. The 1D orthorhombic channels parallel to the octahedral chains have an aperture of ~18.9 \u00c5 \u00d7 19.4 \u00c5. The refined lp structure has an accessible pore volume of 68.2% (2092.7 \u00c53 per 3068.6 \u00c53), as calculated by PLATON. \n\nTo study the role of oxidation state in determining the extent of framework flexibility, the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms (Figure ) of COMOC-2(VIV) and COMOC-2(VIV/VIII) at 77 K were measured and compared. Both samples reveal a two-step sorption behavior, typical for flexible MOFs. For COMOC-2(VIV), a gradual adsorption occurs until P/P 0 = 0.5, when the isotherm reaches its first plateau. Then a very strong uptake of N2 can be observed, rising steeply in the area P/P 0 = 0.5-1.0; leading to a final uptake volume of 510 cm3/g at P/P 0 = 0.98 (The maximum N2 uptake volume of COMOC-2(VIV) with different batches is around 510 \u00b1 40 cm3/g). This sorption amount is similar to that of DUT-5, which has a Langmuir surface area of about 2335 m2 g-1 and a total N2 sorption amount of ~600 cm3 g-1. A hysteresis occurs upon desorption. For COMOC-2(VIV/VIII), the N2 sorption isotherms at 77 K also reveal a two-step sorption behavior. However, the first plateau is maintained until P/P 0 = 0.6, then followed by a large nitrogen uptake at higher relative pressures, leading to almost the same sorption amount as for COMOC-2(VIV) at P/P 0 = 0.98. It is interesting to note that the presence of VIII in COMOC-2(VIV/VIII) compared to pure COMOC-2(VIV) increases the difficulty in triggering the flexibility of the framework. This phenomenon is contrary to MIL-47, in which the presence of VIV centers inhibits the flexibility to a large extent. The reason that COMOC-2(VIII/VIV) needs a higher nitrogen pressure to open up the pores might be due to remaining internal stabilization effects (e.g., H-bonding).\n\nGas/Vapor Sorption Isotherms\n\nTo further verify the structural transformation of COMOC-2(VIV), CO2, CH4, and n-hexane sorption isotherms were measured. As shown in Figure a, the adsorption isotherms at 303 K for both CO2 and CH4 show a classical type I shape, with a capacity of 4.8 mmol of CO2 g-1 at 25 bar and 1.4 mmol CH4 g-1 at 27 bar. At 265 K, however, the CO2 and CH4 isotherms become distinctively different. In the CO2 sorption isotherm at around 12.5 bar, a sudden increase in adsorption is observed, reaching 14 mmol g-1 at 28 bar, corresponding to almost complete pore filling based on the nitrogen porosimetry data. Two distinct steps are clearly observed, revealing a breathing of the framework. Desorption occurs with a large hysteresis loop. This loop is explained with the stress model developed by Neimark et al. According to this model, structural transition or phase transformation, i.e., the breathing effect, occurs when a certain critical stress threshold is reached. As a consequence, the structural transition pressure depends on the stress threshold. As the stress threshold is different for the various phases, a hysteresis occurs in the adsorption-desorption process. Also at this lower temperature, CH4 presents a type I isotherm. The desorption curve for CH4 almost coincides with an adsorption isotherm without the occurrence of any hysteresis. The adsorption profile of COMOC-2(VIV) shows a distinctive adsorption step at 265 K for CO2 but not for CH4. This is similar to the CO2 and CH4 adsorption behavior of MIL-53 at 304 K. \n\n n-Hexane, having larger molecular weight and thus comparatively larger van der Waals interactions, shows the two-step adsorption behavior associated with framework breathing at 323 K. As shown in Figure b, in the first plateau, when COMOC-2(VIV) is in the np form, the adsorption capacity is ~2 mmol g-1. The framework opens up at P/P 0 = 0.2 to reach a final hexane adsorption capacity of 4.7 mmol g-1 or almost 40 wt % at the saturation pressure.\n\nIn complete agreement with the earlier work of Walker et al., addition of dispersion corrections is needed to get realistic energy differences between the lp and np forms. Without dispersion interactions, the three minima are not found. As frequency calculations were performed for every point along the profile, we were able to determine also the vibrational entropic contributions of the smallest unit cell and to plot the free energy profiles for various temperatures. The numerical results reveal that the free energy barrier for the lp \u2192 np phase transition is more or less constant with temperature, with a value varying between 36 and 43 kJ mol-1 (Table ). The free energy difference between the np forms decreases from 38.3 to 27.2 kJ mol-1 when increasing the temperature from 0 to 650 K. The theoretically determined free energy profiles of the empty host give evidence for a tristable behavior of COMOC-2(VIV), favoring the large pore structure when temperature rises. Experimentally, the breathing behavior is only observed at a certain CO2 pressure. No phase transitions have taken place with CH4. The occurrence of a breathing behavior depends on the strength of the host-guest interactions. For a molecule such as CO2 exhibiting strong interactions with the pore walls, the free energy barrier toward the np may already be overcome at 1 bar, as demonstrated by the experiment. As our simulations were performed without guest molecules, we cannot correlate exactly the pore angle and lattice parameters for the np and lp shapes with the experimental values given in Table . In particular, the theoretical lattice parameter along the c-axis for the np form is smaller compared to the experimental value, since the np form may not fully close due to the presence of adsorbate molecules. Our simulations do however clearly show that COMOC-2(VIV) has an intrinsic tristable behavior.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "COMOC-2", "symbol": "", "chemical formula": ""}, "porosity": [{"value":
