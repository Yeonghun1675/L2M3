In addition, the isosteric heat (Q st) of CO2 adsorption was calculated by the virial equation from the sorption isotherms at 273 and 298 K (Figures S10 and S11). The initial Q st values of CO2 are 23.0 and 20.1 kJ mol-1 for 1 and 1-Li, respectively, suggesting that the affinity of H2N(Me)2 + cations toward CO2 is slightly larger than that of Li+ cations, which is probably due to the stronger intermolecular interaction between H2N(Me)2 + and CO2.
