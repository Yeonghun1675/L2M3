However, we did not observe obvious peak in the range of 350-450 nm for 1, indicating that there are no \u03c0*-\u03c0 transitions between Tipa ligands and the deprotonated acids. So the emission peaks for 1 and 2 can be attributed to the charge transfer (\u03c0\u2192\u03c0* and n\u2192\u03c0*) of internal Tipa ligands, and the red-shifted emission of 1 is attributed to the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transitions.\n\nGas Sorption Properties of Compound 2 \n\nTo investigate the permanent porosity of compound 2, gas sorption experiments evaluating N2, H2, and CO2 uptakes were performed. The freshly prepared samples of compound 2 were first activated through solvent exchange with acetone 10 times in 3 d, followed by the thermal/vacuum activation at 303 K to generate activated materials. As shown in Figure a, the N2 sorption isotherm at 77 K shows that 2 displays typical Type I sorption behavior, with Langmuir and BET surface areas of 484.8 and 348.8 m2 g-1, respectively. Meanwhile, it has a moderate absorption of H2 (95.7 cm3 g-1 STP, 0.89 wt %) at 77 K and 1 atm. The CO2 uptakes around 1 atm are 48.17 and 33.49 cm3 g-1 at 273 and 297 K, respectively (Figure b,c).\n\nThe small hydrocarbons, CH4, C2H2, and C2H4, are also selected as probe molecules to assess the gas adsorption properties of compound 2 (Figure b,c). As expected, compound 2 adsorbs much more C2 hydrocarbons than C1 methane. At 297 K and 1 atm, compound 2 can take up a moderate amount of C2H2 (64.13 cm3 g-1) and C2H4 (40.52 cm3 g-1), but basically a much smaller amount of CH4 (12.04 cm3 g-1), indicating that compound 2 is a promising material for selective separation of C2 hydrocarbons from CH4 at room temperature. To evaluate the affinity of gas molecules to compound 2, we calculated the isosteric enthalpies of adsorption (Q st) of CH4, C2H2, and C2H6 from the adsorption data using the virial method at zero coverage. The Q st value of CH4 for 2 is 22.72 kJ/mol, while the Q st values of C2H2 and C2H4 for 2 are 41.05 and 34.69 kJ/mol, respectively. It is worthy to mention that these Q st values of C2H2 and C2H4 are much higher than those observed with other MOFs, such as M'MOF-4a (36.0, 28.0 kJ/mol), M'MOF-2a (30.0, 22.5 kJ/mol), and Zn-MOF-74 (32, 23 kJ/mol). These results indicate that the surface of 2 has strong affinity with the light hydrocarbons.\n\nTo evaluate the gas separation ability of 2, the adsorption selectivities of C2H2/CH4, C2H4/CH4, and CO2/CH4 were calculated by Henry's law based on the equation S  ij  = KH(i)/KH(CH4). The calculated selectivities for C2H2, C2H4, and CO2 over CH4 are 67.9, 23.7, and 4.3 at 273 K, 39.1, 13.5, and 3.1 at 297 K, respectively, which are higher and comparable to the previously reported porous adsorbents, such as UTSA-34b (18-24), UTSA-35a (15-25), and mesoPOF (25-40). The C2H2/CH4 selectivity in compound 2 is one of the few highest values ever reported among the porous metal-organic materials. The highly selective sorption of 2 for C2H2 and CO2 makes it a good candidate for practical C2H2/CH4, C2H4/CH4, and CO2/CH4 separation application in the near future.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "",
