In summary, the adsorption capacities of CAU-13 are lower than those of Al-MIL-53, which adopts the large-pore form under similar experimental conditions. The micropore volume of CAU-13 is relatively small because of the bulkier aliphatic CDC2- ions in CAU-13 compared to the BDC2- ions in Al-MIL-53. A small breathing effect under thermal treatment in air (i.e., the desorption of water) and upon the adsorption of CO2 was revealed. DFT calculations evidenced the most preferred arrangements of CO2 within the pores of CAU-13 for different loadings, resulting in simulated adsorption enthalpies only slightly lower than those previously reported for Al-MIL-53, consistent with the microcalorimetry data. The adsorption of o-, m-, and p-xylene as single components and mixtures was investigated using solutions of the adsorbate in mesitylene. From mixtures in the liquid phase, o-xylene is adsorbed preferentially.

Simultaneously,\nthe adsorption enthalpies were determined by microcalorimetry. The\nadsorption isotherms and a plot of the adsorption enthalpies against\nthe adsorbed amount are reported in Figure . The exact adsorbed amounts and adsorption enthalpies are presented\nin Table S8 in the .</p><p>The high-pressure adsorption\nisotherms show that CAU-13 exhibits\nporosity towards all investigated gases. All isotherms show a steeper\nincrease at lower pressures than at higher pressures, which is most\ndistinct regarding the adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>. Unlike the MIL-53 compounds, CAU-13 does not show a stepwise adsorption\nof the investigated adsorbates, which implies that there are no guest-induced\nsudden structural changes. The observed capacities for the adsorbates\nare relatively small. At 303 K and 23 bar, CAU-13 adsorbs 2.78 mmol\ng<sup>\u20131</sup> CO<sub>2</sub> (0.60 mol mol<sup>\u20131</sup>), similar to the amount adsorbed by the np form of Al-MIL-53, which\nis only stable up to a CO<sub>2</sub> pressure of 6 bar. However,\nthe lp form of Al-MIL-53 is formed above this pressure and adsorbs\nalmost 4 times the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> (\u223c10 mmol g<sup>\u20131</sup>, 2.1 mol mol<sup>\u20131</sup>). The relatively flat enthalpy profiles observed for all\nfour samples during pore filling suggests a relatively homogeneous\nenergetic surface. A comparison of the adsorption enthalpies obtained\nfor the adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub> shows that the adsorption enthalpy\nof CAU-13 (\u221239 kJ mol<sup>\u20131</sup>) is similar to that\nobserved in the first step in the experiments with the np form of\nAl-MIL-53 (\u221235 kJ mol<sup>\u20131</sup>) or with STA-12 (\u221232 kJ mol<sup>\u20131</sup>),\nwhich features open metal centers. In\ncontrast, the adsorption enthalpy for methane is remarkably higher\nfor CAU-13 (\u221232 kJ mol<sup>\u20131</sup>) compared to Al-MIL-53\n(\u221217 kJ mol<sup>\u20131</sup>). Furthermore, the methane uptake is high with respect to that observed\nfor nitrogen and carbon monoxide. This can be explained by the smaller\npore diameter of CAU-13 and thus a higher degree of confinement, which\nleads to an increase of the host\u2013guest interactions. However,\nthese drastic differences in the methane adsorption enthalpies and\nuptakes of methane by CAU-13 may also be related to a contribution\nof the aliphatic pore environment.</p><title>In Situ PXRD and CO<sub>2</sub> Adsorption</title><p>The adsorption\nof water and CO<sub>2</sub> in MIL-53 leads to similar structural\nchanges. Because CAU-13 has already shown\na small breathing effect upon the uptake of water, a similar effect\nwas expected for the adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub>. Because the adsorption\nisotherms measured at 298 and 303 K gave no direct evidence for a\nbreathing effect, the CO<sub>2</sub> sorption of CAU-13 was additionally\nfollowed in situ by synchrotron PXRD at 195 K.

We investigated the sorption properties of CAU-13 towards various gases and vapors at low (p \u2264 1 bar) and high pressures (p \u2264 40 bar). From the adsorption isotherm of N2 at 77 K, the specific surface area (380 m2 g-1) and the micropore volume (0.15 cm3 g-1) were determined. These experimental data are in good agreement with the calculated pore volume of 0.17 cm3 g-1 using PLATON  and the simulated accessible surface area (450 m2 g-1) estimated using a Monte Carlo algorithm, following the same strategy as previously reported by Du\u0308ren et al. The H2O sorption isotherm of CAU-13 at 298 K is presented in Figure , while the isotherms for N2, CO2, and H2 obtained up to a pressure of 1 bar are shown in Figure S13 in the .\n\nThe H2O sorption isotherm exhibits an S shape. Because of the hydrophobic character of the pore walls, adsorption does not begin at low partial pressures but is shifted to p/p 0 = 0.15. This effect has also been observed for functionalized MIL-53 derivatives Al-MIL-53-Cl, -Br, and -CH3. The steep increase at p/p 0 = 0.2 corresponds to the adsorption of one water molecule per formula sum (Figure ) and is in accordance with the water molecule that was localized in the structure of CAU-13\u22c5H2O by Rietveld refinement. At higher relative pressures, a maximum of 1.8 mol mol-1 water are adsorbed. The maximum amounts of CO2 and H2 adsorbed at 298 K and 1 bar are 75 and 6.8 mg g-1, respectively. These values correspond to less than one molecule per formula sum (0.36 and 0.73 mol mol-1). An overview of the adsorbed amounts in mol mol-1, mg g-1, and wt % is listed in the  (Table S8). Except from the water sorption experiment, no stepwise adsorption of the guest molecules could be observed in the low-pressure region. In order to investigate whether such adsorption steps occur at higher adsorbate concentrations, high-pressure isotherms at 303 K were recorded using N2, CH4, CO2, and CO. Simultaneously, the adsorption enthalpies were determined by microcalorimetry. The adsorption isotherms and a plot of the adsorption enthalpies against the adsorbed amount are reported in Figure . The exact adsorbed amounts and adsorption enthalpies are presented in Table S8 in the .\n\nThe high-pressure adsorption isotherms show that CAU-13 exhibits porosity towards all investigated gases. All isotherms show a steeper increase at lower pressures than at higher pressures, which is most distinct regarding the adsorption of CO2 and CH4. Unlike the MIL-53 compounds, CAU-13 does not show a stepwise adsorption of the investigated adsorbates, which implies that there are no guest-induced sudden structural changes. The observed capacities for the adsorbates are relatively small. At 303 K and 23 bar, CAU-13 adsorbs 2.78 mmol g-1 CO2 (0.60 mol mol-1), similar to the amount adsorbed by the np form of Al-MIL-53, which is only stable up to a CO2 pressure of 6 bar. However, the lp form of Al-MIL-53 is formed above this pressure and adsorbs almost 4 times the amount of CO2 (~10 mmol g-1, 2.1 mol mol-1). The relatively flat enthalpy profiles observed for all four samples during pore filling suggests a relatively homogeneous energetic surface. A comparison of the adsorption enthalpies obtained for the adsorption of CO2 shows that the adsorption enthalpy of CAU-13 (-39 kJ mol-1) is similar to that observed in the first step in the experiments with the np form of Al-MIL-53 (-35 kJ mol-1) or with STA-12 (-32 kJ mol-1), which features open metal centers. In contrast, the adsorption enthalpy for methane is remarkably higher for CAU-13 (-32 kJ mol-1) compared to Al-MIL-53 (-17 kJ mol-1). Furthermore, the methane uptake is high with respect to that observed for nitrogen and carbon monoxide. This can be explained by the smaller pore diameter of CAU-13 and thus a higher degree of confinement, which leads to an increase of the host-guest interactions. However, these drastic differences in the methane adsorption enthalpies and uptakes of methane by CAU-13 may also be related to a contribution of the aliphatic pore environment.\n\nIn Situ PXRD and CO2 Adsorption\n\nThe adsorption of water and CO2 in MIL-53 leads to similar structural changes. Because CAU-13 has already shown a small breathing effect upon the uptake of water, a similar effect was expected for the adsorption of CO2. Because the adsorption isotherms measured at 298 and 303 K gave no direct evidence for a breathing effect, the CO2 sorption of CAU-13 was additionally followed in situ by synchrotron PXRD at 195 K. At this lower temperature, a larger amount of CO2 can be adsorbed. The experiments were performed at beamline KMC-2 at BESSY, Berlin, Germany. The corresponding adsorption isotherm is presented in Figure S3 in the  (left) together with an overview of the relative pressures at which PXRD patterns were recorded. At the conditions used for this study (195 K, p \u2264 1 bar), CAU-13 adsorbs 24 wt % (1.2 mol mol-1) CO2. During the experiment, PXRD patterns were recorded. Significant parts of the patterns are shown in Figure  (top). The full patterns are presented in Figure S3 (right) in the . A noticeable shift of the reflections corresponding to the crystallographic b axis (i.e., 010 and 01\u03051) can be observed, whereas the position of the 001 reflection is not remarkably influenced.\n\nWe studied the liquid- and vapor-phase single-component xylene adsorption on CAU-13 and also the competitive adsorption from the liquid phase. In Figure , the liquid-phase batch adsorption isotherms of CAU-13 are presented. The experiments were carried out at 298 K using mesitylene as the eluent. For o-xylene, a slightly higher uptake (17 wt %, 0.34 mol mol-1) than those for p-xylene (15 wt %, 0.29 mol mol-1) and m-xylene (14 wt %, 0.28 mol mol-1) can be observed.\n\nThe PXRD patterns exhibit a shift of the reflections to lower angles in the order CAU-13\u22c5H2O < CAU-13(empty pore) < CAU-13(xylene, vapor phase) < CAU-13(excess xylene). Indexing of the powder patterns obtained for CAU-13 loaded with the xylene isomers and Pawley refinements gave rise to cell volumes of 1350 \u00c53 for the m-xylene-loaded sample and 1317 \u00c53 for the o-xylene-loaded sample. The unit cell of p-xylene-containing CAU-13 is doubled in the direction of the one-dimensional pores (a axis), giving a cell volume of 2654 \u00c53. The results of the refinement and final Pawley plots are presented in Table S4 and Figure S8 in the . With a cell content of Z = 4 [8 for CAU-13(pX)], this corresponds to a relative expansion by ~25% compared to CAU-13(empty pore) (V = 540 \u00c53, Z = 2; Table ). The volume changes are accompanied by an increase of symmetry from the triclinic space group P1\u0305 to the monoclinic space group P21. On the basis of these findings, structural models have been set up in the space group P21 using Materials Studio 5.0. To allow for the large unit cell dimensions, all of the linker molecules had to be introduced using the e,e conformation, which represents the longer molecule of the two conformers [the Ccarboxy-Ccarboxy distance of the e,e conformer is ~5.6 \u00c5 and that of the a,a conformer is ~4.6 \u00c5, taken from the crystallographic data of CAU-13(empty pore)]. Rietveld refinements applying rigid bodies for both the linker and guest molecules proved the validity of the assumption.
