Due to the high emission intensity of compound 6 (Eu3+), we sought to investigate its potential as a sensor for metal ions and NACs. We first investigated the luminescence intensity of 6 (2 mg) in various commonly used solvents (2 mL) to identify the most suitable solvent. As seen in a, the emission intensity of 6 is strongest in ethanol compared to other solvents such as methanol, water, acetone, acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dichloromethane (DCM), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), cyclohexane, benzene, and toluene. Subsequently, the potential of ethanol suspensions of 6 (6-EtOH) to sense Al3+, Fe3+, Cu2+, Co2+, Hg2+, Mg2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, and Mn2+ metal ions was assessed by monitoring the Eu3+ (5D0 \u2192 7F2) transition at 610 nm (\u03bbex = 310 nm). The extent of quenching of 5D0 \u2192 7F2 was calculated by using : 1     quenching  efficiency =  (   I   0   - I )  /   I   0   \u00d7 100 %    where I 0 and I are the luminescence intensities of 6-EtOH before and after interaction with metal ions, respectively. As shown in b the luminescence emission of 6-EtOH is most significantly quenched upon interaction with Fe3+ ions (87%) and Cu2+ ions (75%), while moderate quenching is observed for Co2+ and Al3+, negligible effects for Mn2+ and Ni2+ cations and a slight luminescent enhancement is seen for Hg2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+ cations. To gain a greater understanding of the luminescence response of 6 to Fe3+ and Cu2+ ions, luminescence titrations were conducted, in which incremental amounts of these analytes were added to suspensions of 6-EtOH (c-d). As expected, the luminescence intensity decreases with increasing concentration of analytes. The fluorescence quenching efficiency can be quantitatively explained by the Stern-Volmer (S-V) : 2      (   I   0   / I )  =   K   SV    [ Q ]  + 1    where K SV is the Stern-Volmer constant/quenching effect coefficient (M-1) and [Q] is the molar concentration of the quencher. The Stern-Volmer plot for Fe3+ and Cu2+ ions is nearly linear at low concentrations (R 2 = 0.9891 for Fe3+ and 0.9893 for Cu2+) but deviate from linearity at high concentrations, which indicates that the quenching mechanism may feature both dynamic and static quenching processes or competitive absorption (i.e., inner filter effects) (e-f). The K SV values obtained at low concentrations were determined to be 6742.4 M-1 and 4612.0 M-1 for Fe3+ and Cu2+ respectively. These are comparable to K SV values in numerous studies which report CPs and MOFs as highly sensitive detectors for metal ions and demonstrate the high sensitivity of 6-EtOH toward Fe3+ and Cu2+. The limit of detection (LOD), calculated from the slope and standard error of the fitting lines (LOD = 3\u03c3/K SV; \u03c3 = standard error of slope), is 6.79 \u00d7 10-5 mol/L (3.79 ppm) for Fe3+ and 7.52 \u00d7 10-5 mol/L (4.78 ppm) for Cu2+.\n\nSensing of Nitroaromatic Compounds\n\nThe rapid and sensitive detection of explosive nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) is of importance in homeland security, environmental safety, and human health due to the detrimental effects of these compounds. In light of this, we explored the potential of 6-EtOH to sense NACs by monitoring the intensity of Eu3+ (5D0 \u2192 7F2) transition before and after addition of nitrobenzene (NB), 1,3-dinitrobenzene (1,3-DNB), 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (TNB), 3-nitrophenol (3-NTP), 4-nitrophenol (4-NTP), 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP), 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP), 3,5-nitrobenzoic acid (3,5-DNTBA), 3-nitrobenzaldehyde (3-NBZAL), 3-nitroaniline (3-NTAN), 4-nitroaniline (4-NTAN), and 2-nitrotoluene (2-NTT). Studies were also carried out with phenol and aniline (AN) to comparatively assess the effect of the nitro group on the quenching efficiency of the analyte. Phenol presents a weak enhancing effect on the Eu3+ (5D0 \u2192 7F2) emission of 6-EtOH, but all other aromatic compounds quenched the emission by varying degrees (). The order of quenching efficiency was 2,4-DNP > 4-NTP > TNP > 4-NTAN > 3-NTP > 2-NTT > 1,3-DNB > 3-NTAN > aniline > 3,5-DNTBA > TNB > 3-NBZAL > NB > phenol. This deviates slightly from the titration experiments which yielded the highest K SV for 4-NTP (11037.7 M-1) followed by 2,4-DNP (8378.8 M-1) and TNP (7320.1 M-1) (). The discrepancy may arise due to greater interaction of 4-NTP with 6-EtOH upon incremental addition during the titrations, resulting in a more accurate representation of the luminescence quenching behavior. Incremental addition of 4-NTP, 2,4-DNP, and TNP to 6-EtOH results in a progressive reduction in luminescence intensity (). The calculated LOD is 1.70 \u00d7 10-5 mol/L (2.37 ppm) for 4-NTP, 4.31 \u00d7 10-5 mol/L (7.94 ppm) for 2,4-DNP, and 7.46 \u00d7 10-5 mol/L (17.10 ppm) for TNP which are comparable to other reported MOF structures used for the detection of NACs. The Stern-Volmer plots for 4-NTP and 2,4-DNP are linear from low to high concentrations, suggesting that dynamic or static processes may contribute to the quenching of Eu3+ (5D0 \u2192 7F2) emission. The Stern-Volmer plot for TNP is linear at low concentrations but deviates from linearity at higher concentrations with an upward curvature, which suggests that static and dynamic quenching processes may be acting simultaneously or there may be competitive absorption which leads to an inner filter effect. UV-vis absorption spectra of the analytes in ethanol show strong overlap between the excitation spectrum of 6 and the absorption spectra of 4-NTP, 2,4-DNP, TNP, and 4-NTAN, suggesting that there is competitive absorption for the excitation energy at 310 nm (Figure S9). Further comparison of phenol and aniline with their nitro congeners show that the presence of the nitro group and its location at the para- position enhances the quenching efficiency. Luminescence quenching of Ln-MOFs by NACs is known to involve photoinduced electron transfer from the conduction band of the MOF to LUMOs of the electron deficient nitroaromatic analyte. In addition, disruption of the supramolecular structure of the MOF by electrostatic forces such as \u03c0-\u03c0 and hydrogen bonding interactions can also lead to quenching. IR data of compound 6 immersed in the NACs show that the structure remains the same, but a broadening of the peaks indicate that there may be electrostatic interactions of the NACs with the framework (Figure S10). Recyclability studies carried out with 4-NTP, 2,4-DNP, and TNP reveal that the initial luminescence intensity is not significantly affected even after five sensing-recovery cycles; hence, 6-EtOH is a highly regenerative probe for the detection of nitroaromatic compounds (Figure S11).
