The UV/vis spectra show that the cationic dyes can be effectively adsorbed, while the absorbance of the MO dye has almost no obvious change (). At the same time, the colors of the solutions change from purple, blue, and pink to yellow over 20 h (Figure S5), indicating that cationic dyes can be selectively adsorbed over anionic organic by crystals of FJI-H-U1.
