The Na(2) ion is five-coordinated to form a distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry by binding with three BTC [O(2), O(6), and O(14)], one \u03bc2-H2O molecule [O(1W)ii], and a terminal aqua molecule [O(3W)]. In addition, three independent BTC ligands, which are all completely deprotonated, have different arrangements of metal cations (Figure S2b-d in the ). For the first type of BTC ligand (Figure S2b in the ), the first carboxyl group uses the chelating bidentate configuration to connect one Cd(3) atom, the second one is coordinated with Cd(1), Na(1) and Cd(2), Cd(3) atoms adopting the bridging unidentate fashion, while the third one gives the similar mode as the first one by linking one Cd(2) atom. For the second type of BTC linker (Figure S2c in the ), the first carboxyl group is of the chelating/bridging bidentate mode linking one Cd(2), one Cd(3), and one Na(2) atoms, either the second or the third one uses the chelating/bridging bidentate fashion to connect with one Cd and one Na atoms [Cd(2), Na(2) or Cd(3), Na(1)]. For the third kind of BTC ligand (Figure S2d in the ), all of the three carboxyl groups adopt the chelating/bridging bidentate fashion through ligating one Cd and one Na centers, and those are Cd(1) and Na(2), Cd(1) and Na(1), and Cd(1) and Na(1), respectively.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 18, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig id=\"fig2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>2</label>\n<caption>\n<p>(a) Two-fold interpenetration of identical [Cd<sub>3</sub>(BTC)<sub>4</sub>] frameworks in <bold>1</bold> viewing along the <italic toggle=\"yes\">a</italic>-axis (the neighboring identical frameworks are represented as blue and purple colors.

The surface area for N<sub>2</sub> adsorption is not too impressive, comparing with the values of very well studied microporous MOFs such as MOF-177 (4630 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> for BET model, 5250 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> for Langmuir model) and MOF-5 (3800 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> for BET model, 4400 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>\u20131</sup> for Langmuir model).

By fitting the Langmuir\u2013Freundlich equation, the maximum H<sub>2</sub> uptake of <bold>1a</bold> was predicted to be 1.12 wt %, which was in accordance with the experimental value. Under ambient pressures (1.0 bar), the H<sub>2</sub> uptake amount of <bold>1a</bold> is typical comparing to MOF-177 (1.25 wt %) and MOF-5 (1.32 wt %), although these famous MOFs have large pore dimensions (MOF-5, 15 \u00c5; MOF-177, 10.8 \u00c5).

Compound 1a adsorbed 142 cm3 g-1 of N2 at 77 K, corresponding to Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 473 m2 g-1 (within the range 0.06 < p/p 0 < 0.2) and the Langmuir surface area of 618 m2 g-1. The pore volume calculated from the maximum N2 adsorption was 0.220 cm3 g-1. Furthermore, the N2 adsorption showed very good reversibility. The surface area for N2 adsorption is not too impressive, comparing with the values of very well studied microporous MOFs such as MOF-177 (4630 m2 g-1 for BET model, 5250 m2 g-1 for Langmuir model) and MOF-5 (3800 m2 g-1 for BET model, 4400 m2 g-1 for Langmuir model). By analyzing the crystal structure of 1a, interpenetration decreases the internal diameter of aperture to 6 \u00c5 without blocking any adsorptive sites and leads to a more convoluted void region. These narrow voids are too small to incorporate more N2 molecules (the kinetic diameter for N2, 3.64 \u00c5).\n\nH2 adsorption isotherm was recorded at 77 K under atmospheric pressures, which also showed type I behavior with good reversibility and no hysteresis. The H2 adsorption kinetic data confirmed that equilibrium was achieved rapidly within approximately 3 min of the isotherm pressure step. Compound 1a could adsorb nearly 1.11 wt % H2 at 1.0 bar and 77 K. The saturation value of H2 uptake on a unit specific surface area was calculated to 2.35 wt % per 1000 m2 g-1. The result confirmed the monolayer prediction, on the basis of which the H2 storage capacity was estimated to be 2.27 wt % per 1000 m2 g-1. By fitting the Langmuir-Freundlich equation, the maximum H2 uptake of 1a was predicted to be 1.12 wt %, which was in accordance with the experimental value. Under ambient pressures (1.0 bar), the H2 uptake amount of 1a is typical comparing to MOF-177 (1.25 wt %) and MOF-5 (1.32 wt %), although these famous MOFs have large pore dimensions (MOF-5, 15 \u00c5; MOF-177, 10.8 \u00c5). The result suggests that many reported MOFs have spaces between their walls that are too large for the effective adsorption of H2 (the kinetic diameter for H2, 2.89 \u00c5), on the basis of the confirmed monolayer prediction for H2 adsorption. However, in 1a, the rolling surface of the pores and the nonlinearity of the channels may be appropriate for accommodate more H2 as several reported references. \n\nTo investigate the interaction between H2 and the framework, the isosteric heats of the adsorption were calculated by fitting the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to the H2 adsorption isotherms measured at 77 and 87 K (Figure b). The equation is as follows:    ( ln  P )   n   = -   Q   st   / R T + C  where P is the pressure, n is the amount adsorbed, T is the temperature, R is the universal gas constant, and C is a constant. By calculating the slope of the ln P -(-1/RT) curve, the coverage dependency of Q st was presented graphically in Figure c. Interestingly, the isosteric heats of adsorption for 1a increased initially with H2 loading until a maximum of 8.4 kJ mol-1, higher than MOF-177 (4.4 kJ mol-1) and MOF-5 (5.2 kJ mol-1). These values suggest that there may be effects due to H2-H2 interactions at low coverage. The reason of high adsorption heat of 1a may be that its convoluted narrow pores and unsaturated Na sites afford strong binding affinities for H2 molecules.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe combination of transition metals [Cd(II)] and alkali metals [Na(I)] to react with the aromatic BTC ligands afforded two novel 3D MOFs through solvothermal syntheses. Compound 1 constructs a {Na3O12}-bridged 2-fold interpenetrated framework with bor topology, while 2 forms a {Na2O10}, (CH3)2NH2 +, and free water-filled 1D honeycomb channel network. In compound 1, the exceptional H2 storage capacity of 1.11 wt % at 77 K and 1.0 bar has been observed with the higher isosteric heat of 8.4 kJ mol-1. This illustration demonstrates that metal (transition alkali) organic frameworks with very narrow voids and exposed alkali sites may provide a useful platform for further new MOFs with enhanced H2 storage performance. We are currently investigating the possibilities of gas adsorption for compound 2, through any method of replacing (CH3)2NH2 + by alkali cations.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "340", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "stable", "condition": ""}, {"value": "340 to 520", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "consecutive weight loss", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "2", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "310 to 480", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "destruction of the material", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["decomposition_temperature"]}, {"idx": 9, "type": "table", "classification": ["Crystal"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Crystallographic and Structural Refinement Parameters for <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup align=\"left\" cols=\"3\">\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\"></oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<bold>1</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<bold>2</bold>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>formula</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>Cd<sub>3</sub>Na<sub>6</sub>C<sub>36</sub>H<sub>38</sub>O<sub>37</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>Cd<sub>3</sub>Na<sub>2</sub>C<sub>29</sub>H<sub>25</sub>O<sub>22</sub>N</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>fw</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1537.80</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1122.68</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>crystal system</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>tetragonal</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>monoclinic</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>space group</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">P</italic>4<sub>2</sub>/<italic toggle=\"yes\">n</italic>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">Cc</italic>\n</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">a</italic> (\u00c5)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>13.8730(14)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>14.644(3)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">b</italic> (\u00c5)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>13.8730(14)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>13.655(3)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">c</italic> (\u00c5)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>13.812(3)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>17.683(4)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\u03b2 (deg)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>90.00</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>111.63(3)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">V</italic> (\u00c5<sup>3</sup>)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2658.2(7)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>3286.9(11)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">Z</italic>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>8</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>4</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">D</italic>\n<sub>calcd</sub> (g cm<sup>\u20133</sup>)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.921</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.269</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\u03bb (Mo K\u03b1) (\u00c5)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.71073</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.71073</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\u03bc (mm<sup>\u20131</sup>)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.345</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.051</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>GOF on <italic toggle=\"yes\">F</italic>\n<sup>2</sup>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.006</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>1.005</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">R</italic>\n<sub>int</sub>\n</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.0427</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.0256</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">R</italic>1, <italic toggle=\"yes\">wR</italic>2 [<italic toggle=\"yes\">I</italic> &gt; 2\u03c3 (<italic toggle=\"yes\">I</italic>)]</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.0660, 0.1961</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.0425, 0.1616</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">R</italic>1, <italic toggle=\"yes\">wR</italic>2 (all data)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.0711, 0.2023</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.0430, 0.1619</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "Table 1.
