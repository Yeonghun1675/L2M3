Meanwhile, a control reaction without any catalyst gave negligible\nconversion. However, for bulky epoxide substrates such as styrene\noxide, TMOF-1 gave a yield of only 39(3)% (, entry 6).

Compared to literature values, the Q st of TMOF-1 is higher than those of most of the unfunctionalized carboxylate-based MOFs without exposed metal sites or amine functionality, confirming the high affinity of TMOF-1 for CO2. In addition, after TMOF-1 had been soaked in 1 bar CO2 for 1 h at room temperature, the material exhibited a characteristic CO2 absorption band at 2335 cm-1 in the infrared spectrum, confirming the strong interaction between CO2 and TMOF-1 even under ambient conditions (Figure S3). Besides CO2 sorption, the H2 sorption isotherms of TMOF-1 exhibit a steep increase at low pressure with a Q st of 9.0 kJ/mol, resulting in H2 uptake capacities of 0.9 wt % (77 K, 1 bar) and 0.75 wt % (87 K, 1 bar) (d). The high Q st value is likely related to the increased extent of H2-host interaction, due to the narrow pore size from the 2-fold interpenetration. \n\nTo examine in detail the interaction between CO2 and embedded sulfonate moieties in TMOF-1, we employed both control experiments and DFT calculations. First, we synthesized a doubly interpenetrated carboxylate-based Cu(II) MOF, [Cu2(bpy)(bdc)2] n  [MOF-508b(Cu)], which possesses the same N-donor ligand and a prototypical primitive-cubic topology, as well. Despite the fact that its BET surface area (364 m2/g) is slightly larger than that of TMOF-1 (256 m2/g) (Figure S4), its CO2 uptake value at 298 K and 1 bar is <40% compared to that of TMOF-1 (c). More importantly, the zero-coverage Q st of this carboxylate MOF is as low as 19.2 kJ/mol, measured using variable-temperature CO2 sorption under identical conditions. This value agrees well with the literature value (15-19 kJ/mol) of the isostructural MOF-508b(Zn). \n\nIn addition to control experiments of CO2 capture, we performed first-principles calculations based on dispersion-corrected DFT to investigate the CO2 binding sites residing in TMOF-1 (see the Supporting Information for calculation details). By adding CO2 molecules to the cavity of TMOF-1, we discovered that the adsorbed CO2 inside TMOF-1 reaches up to four molecules per unit cell at 298 K and 1 bar of CO2, which is equivalent to a CO2 uptake of ~78 mg/g. The most energetically stable adsorption site (two such sites per unit cell) is shown in , where each CO2 is surrounded by four sulfonate groups from the two adjacent EDS linkers, confirming the strong binding between CO2 and organosulfonate functionalities. The calculated free energy of adsorption after the correction of vibrational entropy and the zero-point energy is 29.2 kJ/mol, which agrees well with the experimentally measured Q st (30.9 kJ/mol). Importantly, our first-principles molecular dynamics simulation confirms that these captured CO2 molecules together with TMOF-1 are energetically stable at room temperature (Figure S5). Adding CO2 above the ~39 mg/g capacity, we found the new additional CO2 would reside in the spare porosity adjacent to the adsorbed CO2 molecules, which are distal (\u22655.9 \u00c5) to the sulfonate groups within the TMOF-1 framework. These CO2 molecules are rather weakly adsorbed, with an adsorption free energy value of -3.3 kJ/mol. The proposed CO2 diffusion channels were analyzed, as well, on the basis of the MD trajectories (Figure S6). According to computational results, the CO2 molecules can easily diffuse through the 3D-interconnected porosity of the TMOF-1 with a low free energy barrier (only ~0.3 eV). Overall, the CO2-sulfonate interaction obviously plays an important role in the CO2 capture of TMOF-1.\n\nThe thermal stability of TMOF-1 was investigated in detail by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and ex situ PXRD ( and Figure S7). An ~10.0% weight loss occurs after heating beyond 100 \u00b0C, ascribed to the removal of solvent H2O molecules in the pores. The anhydrous phase is stable up to ~300 \u00b0C until the decomposition of bpy and EDS. Ex situ PXRD of heating TMOF-1 to 260 \u00b0C in air confirms the retention of the as-synthesized 3D porous topology (). The chemical stability of TMOF-1 was examined in polar and nonpolar boiling solvents (water, methanol, and n-hexane), a HCl solution (pH 3), and a NaOH solution (pH 10). After incubation in these solutions for 24 h, the high crystallinity of the primitive-cubic topology is retained well, as evidenced by PXRD patterns (). Besides PXRD, a <10 wt % decrease in mass was observed after the thermal and chemical treatment, which is likely due to the solvent loss after activation (Table S1). To further confirm the strong water-stable nature of TMOF-1, in situ optical microscopy was employed to monitor the crystallinity throughout the immersion of MOF in an acid/base solution (Figure S8). The size and morphology did not change in an observable manner. Importantly, the porosity of the material was largely retained after refluxing in water, evidenced by BET measurements (238 m2/g) using Ar at 87 K (Figure S9). Note that only a limited number of carboxylate MOFs with permanent porosity demonstrate excellent stability in boiling water, or in aqueous solutions over a wide pH range. Indeed, divalent metal carboxylate MOFs (e.g., Cu2 or Zn2 paddlewheel) are subject to hydrolysis and usually quite soluble in aqueous solutions. It is likely that the typical Jahn-Teller distorted octahedral coordination geometry of Cu(II) in our TMOF-1 was less susceptible to hydrolysis than the conventional five-coordinate Cu centers in Cu2 paddlewheel SBUs.\n\nGiven the strong inherent CO2 affinity and highly robust nature of TMOF-1, we sought to investigate the embedded Cu(II) Lewis acidic sites for CO2-related heterogeneous catalytic reactions. As a benchmark reaction, cycloaddition of CO2 and epoxides to form cyclic carbonates is of great interest in the chemical industry, because of the wide application of carbonates in pharmaceuticals. High pressure and/or temperature is necessary for this CO2 fixation by common catalysts, such as metal-salen complexes, metal oxides, and zeolites. A few recent studies employed MOFs as promising and efficient catalytic materials to convert captured CO2 to cyclic carbonates. In conjunction with tetra-n-tert-butylammonium bromide (TBAB) as a cocatalyst under ambient conditions (i.e., room temperature, 1 bar), TMOF-1 exhibited a nearly quantitative yield in converting 2-methyloxirane to the corresponding cyclic carbonate (, entry 1). The high efficiency of this catalytic activity was successfully extended to functionalized (e.g., -CH3, -Cl, or -Br) 2-methyloxirane substrates (, entries 2-5). By comparison, these catalytic activities are significantly higher than that of the benchmark Cu(II)-carboxylate MOF, HKUST-1, which showed a moderate yield in the range of 50-60%. Meanwhile, a control reaction without any catalyst gave negligible conversion. However, for bulky epoxide substrates such as styrene oxide, TMOF-1 gave a yield of only 39(3)% (, entry 6). This lower yield is probably due to the steric hindrance on the \u03b2-carbon of the substrates, hampering nucleophilic attack from TBAB (see the mechanism in Figure S10). To confirm the heterogeneous and reusable nature of the catalysis, TMOF-1 demonstrated excellent recyclability in converting 2-(chloromethyl)oxirane without a significant decrease in yield [86-92% (Figure S11)]. Between each run, the catalyst was recovered by filtration, rinsed with methanol, dried in air, and reused on subsequent reactions without further treatment. Importantly, the crystallinity of TMOF-1 was maintained after each cycle, as indicated by PXRD (Figure S12). In addition, the filtrate of catalysis reactions contained <0.1 ppm Cu, as evidenced by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). All these results point to the heterogeneity of the MOF catalyst.
