The emission properties of these complexes have been investigated. The adsorption properties (N2, H2, O2, CO2, and CH4) of the 3D porous framework have been studied, and the results show that it possesses a moderate capability of gas sorption for N2, H2, O2, and CO2 gases, with high selectivity ratios for O2 over H2 at 77 K and CO2 over CH4 at 273 K.\n\nIn this study, we used the H2ptp ligand and ZnII ion as building blocks to construct complexes, aimed at obtaining useful MOF materials. Through control of the reaction conditions, a new series of complexes, {Zn(ptp)(H2O)]2 (1), [Zn(ptp)(CH3OH)] n  (2), [Zn(ptp)] n  (3), and {[Zn3(ptp)3](DMF)2(H2O)} n  (4; DMF = N,N-dimethylformamide), were obtained and structurally characterized. Taking the intense luminescent properties of d10 metal complexes into account, the luminescence properties of these complexes were also investigated in the solid state at room temperature. Furthermore, the gas adsorption properties (N2, H2, O2, CO2, and CH4) of 4a (desolvated complex 4) have been studied. The results reveal that 4a possesses moderate capability of gas sorption for N2, H2, O2, and CO2 gases, with high selectivity ratios for O2 over H2 at 77 K and CO2 over CH4 at 273 K.\n\nPXRD and TGA\n\nThe phase purity of 1-4 was confirmed by PXRD analysis on bulk samples. The PXRD profile of each as-synthesized complex well matched the simulated ones based on the single-crystal X-ray structure (Figure S2 in the  for 1-4). Prior to gas sorption experiments, water and DMF molecules are removed from compound 4 by solvent exchanges. The solvent-exchanged sample was then dried under a high vacuum to obtain the desolvated solid 4a. The activated sample 4a is still crystalline, as evidenced by the PXRD patterns. Although the experimental patterns of the activated sample 4a show a few unindexed peaks and slightly broadened diffraction lines that might be attributed to the slight change of the structure caused by removal of the guest molecules, the whole porous framework should remain. To examine the thermal stability of 4, a TGA experiment was performed by heating the crystalline sample (Figure S1 in the ). The TGA curve of 4 reveals that the first weight loss of 3% in the temperature region of 195-295 \u00b0C corresponds to the expulsion of lattice water and partial DMF molecules. The residual component starts to decompose beyond 300 \u00b0C with two step weight losses (peaking at 305 and 527 \u00b0C). TGA of 4 showed that it is stable to 300 \u00b0C (Figure S3 in the ).\n\nTo investigate the porosity of 4a, N2 sorption was performed at 77 K. The uptake amount of N2 is 93.96 cm3/g (STP) at P/P 0 = 1.0, and the gas sorption shows a reversible type I isotherm with no hysteresis upon desorption (Figure a), being characteristic of microporous material. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and Langmuir surface areas of the guest-free framework were estimated to be 322.56 and 421.98 m2 g-1, respectively, and the Horvath-Kawazoe (H-K) pore diameter is 4.98 \u00c5 (Figure S4 in the ). Furthermore, the H-K pore volume is 0.15 cm3 g-1, a little lower than the value of 0.17 cm3 g-1 calculated from the crystal structure, which indicates that the gas molecules fill the void space efficiently.\n\nThe accessible porosity in 4a confirmed by the N2 sorption study prompts us to further investigate the gas sorption properties of 4a. Subsequently, O2 and H2 adsorption measurements were carried out. In the case of O2 adsorption, 4a adsorbs up to 20.38 wt % (142.32 cm3 g-1, 6.37 mmol g-1, STP) at 77 K and P/P 0 = 0.9 (Figure a).\n\nThe H2 sorption isotherms at 77 and 87 K both show type I behavior with slight hysteresis and no noticeable change in the properties upon repeated cycling (Figure b). The uptake of H2 at 77 K and 800 mmHg is 0.84 wt % (94.27 cm3 g-1, STP). Moreover, the H2 isosteric heats of adsorption (Q st) for 4a calculated from the respective adsorption isotherms at 77 and 87 K, employing the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, are 7.3-7.1 kJ mol-1, depending on the degree of H2 loading (Figure S5 in the ), which is in the usual range of the PMOFs. The approximate value of 7.3 kJ mol-1 at zero surface coverage obtained from isotherm studies is close to the corresponding values found for most promising MOFs for hydrogen storage. \n\nAlthough most adsorption studies on porous materials have been carried out for hydrogen storage purposes in the past few years, there are now increasing investigations aimed at different objectives for other gases, such as CO2, CH4, etc. To further check the gas adsorption properties of 4a, CO2 and CH4 adsorption studies have been systematically carried out at 273 K under normal pressure, respectively. All of the adsorption isotherms exhibit typical type I sorption behavior (Figure c) and the adsorption capacity of CO2 is higher than that of CH4 under the same conditions. At 832 mmHg, 4a adsorbs CO2 gas up to 11.21 wt % (57.08 cm3 g-1, STP), while the adsorb amount of CH4 at 833 mmHg is 1.02 wt % (14.29 cm3 g-1, STP), indicating the high selectivity of gas sorption for CO2 over CH4. This may mainly be attributed to two factors: (1) The kinetic diameter of the CO2 molecule (3.3 \u00c5) is smaller than that of the CH4 molecule (3.8 \u00c5), so that access to the channels in 4a is easier. (2) The quadrupole moment of CO2 (-1.4 \u00d7 10-39 C m2) might induce stronger interaction with the porous framework than CH4. \n\nLuminescent Properties\n\nIt is known that many d10 metal compounds exhibit luminescent properties. The coordination compounds with the rational selection and design of conjugated organic spacers and metal centers can be efficient for obtaining new luminescence materials. To investigate the luminescent properties of complexes 1-4, measurements of the complexes and the H2ptp ligand were carried out in the solid state at room temperature. As shown in Figure , H2ptp exhibits a blue emission band at 490 nm upon excitation at 360 nm, which could be attributed to intraligand charge transfer (n-\u03c0* or \u03c0-\u03c0*). Complexes 1-4 present emission bands at 431, 436, 491, and 431 nm upon excitation at 372, 255, 446, and 383 nm, respectively. Compared with emission of the H2ptp ligand, complexes 1, 2, and 4 reveal similar blue shifts of the emission peak and increased luminescent density. These might be attributed to coordination of the ligand ptp2- to ZnII ions, which decreased the nonradiative decay of intraligand excited states. The red shift of the emission spectra of complex 3 suggests an enhancement of \u03c0 conjugation. All of the emissions of the complexes are tentatively attributed to the intraligand transition (n-\u03c0* and \u03c0-\u03c0*) modified by ligation of the ligand to the inactive ZnII ion. To some extent, coordination enhances the \"rigidity\" of the ligand and thus reduces the loss of energy through a radiationless pathway. \n\nConclusion\n\nA multitopic tetrazolate-based ligand has been used to react with Zn(NO3)2\u22c56H2O in solvothermal conditions to give four metal-organic crystalline materials with various structures from a 0D dinuclear molecule to 3D porous frameworks.
