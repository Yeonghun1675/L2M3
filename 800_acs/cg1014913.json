When reacted with different metal salts, different ligands can take on varied conformations to generate discrete 0D to polymeric 3D coordination structures, which are further stabilized by hydrogen bonds and \u03c0\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 interactions in the crystal lattice. It is found that the structural nature, including the positions of the N-donors and the spacers of pyromellitic or naphthalene diimide, play a key role to determine the conformation and coordination mode of these ligands, leading to different building blocks for assembly of varied coordination polymers. The results demonstrate that these large semirigid ditopic ligands can be rationally used to construct novel MOFs with specific structure and properties, which may bring new insights and an important impetus to crystal engineering. In addition, the gas adsorption experiment indicates complex 7 can be used for CO2 separations from synthesis gas and flue gas mixtures, and the fluorescent emissions show that complexes 5 and 6 may be good candidates for photoactive materials.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 45, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>PXRD patterns, crystallographic data and structure refinement for complexes <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>9</bold>, additional structural figures for ligand L<sub>1</sub>-L<sub>3</sub>, complexes <bold>2</bold>, <bold>4</bold>, and TGA curves for compounds <bold>3</bold>, <bold>5</bold>, and <bold>6</bold> as well as X-ray crystallographic files in CIF format for complexes <bold>1</bold>\u2013<bold>9</bold>.

Complex 3 crystallizes in the monoclinic system with space group C2/c. Its asymmetric unit contains an Mn(II) ion, two L3 ligands, two coordinating NCS -  anions. The overall coordination geometry of the Mn(II) ion in 3 can be described as a distorted octahedron consisting of four NPy donors from four different ligands and two N atoms from two independent NCS -  anions (Figure a). The two terminal Py groups in L3 take on the \"Z-mode\" conformation and link up two Mn(II) ions such that a 2D grid is formed. In this grid network, the metal ions serve as 4-connecting nodes and the L3 is in a linear linker to bridge Mn(II) ions, and then connections between the metal nodes and the L3 linkers alternately will give rise to a 2D (4, 4) topological network (Figure b).

The crystal packing analysis reveals weaving layers stack in a parallel fashion, and between the layers the CH3OH and H2O molecules are encapsulated (Figure c).\n\nThermal Stability\n\nThe thermal stability of the coordination polymers was analyzed by recording thermogravimetric (TG) curves of selected complexes. As a representative, Figure  shows the TG diagram of complex 7, {[Co(L1)2(NCS)2]\u22c54(H2O)} n . Three main steps of weight losses were observed in the temperature range from 25 to 800 \u00b0C. The first step occurs in the range of 25-90 \u00b0C, amounting to about 6.7% and corresponding to the escape of water molecules (calculated 6.8%).

The general decomposition temperature of other complexes is in the range of 250-350 \u00b0C (Figure S2, ), which is typical for MOFs containing large organic ligands.\n\nLuminescent Properties\n\nPhotoluminescence of coordination polymers constructed from d10 metal centers have often been investigated for their potential applications in chemical sensors, photochemistry, and electroluminescent display. Therefore, the solid state emission spectra of complexes 5 and 6 and the corresponding free ligands L2 and L3 were measured at room temperature (Figure ). A broad emission band was observed at 425 nm for L2 and 437 nm for 5 (\u03bbex = 300 nm), respectively. Similarly, a wide emission band was observed at 562 nm for L3 and 575 nm for 6 (\u03bbex = 465 nm), respectively. Compared to those of free ligands, the emission maxima of complexes 5 and 6 are increased and slightly red-shifted. From the band shape and position, we speculate that the emission of the complexes is ligand centered (LC), which has been verified by the lifetime measurement for the ligand L3 and complex 6. As depicted in , both the ligand and complex show quite similar biexponential decays, \u03c41 = 0.44 and \u03c42 = 4.20 ns for L3, and \u03c41 = 0.86 and \u03c42 = 3.25 ns for complex 6. Such lifetime is typical for an organic compound with two aromatic moieties. The red shift and increasing intensity of the LC emissions in complexes compared to the free ligands are obviously caused by coordination of N-donor ligands to the metal centers, which effectively increases the ligand conformational rigidity and therefore results in a decrease in the loss of energy by radiationless decay. \n\nSorption Properties\n\nTo verify the porosity of 7, which provides a void space composing 44% of the total crystal volume, the gas sorption properties were measured for N2 (kinetic diameter = 3.64 \u00c5), H2 (2.8 \u00c5), and CO2 (3.3 \u00c5) gases, respectively. All adsorption isotherms show type I behavior as expected for materials with micropores (~5 \u00c5) (Figure ). Interestingly, 7 can adsorb a medium amount of CO2 at 1 atm and 195 K [24.6 cm3 g-1 (STP)], exhibiting noticeable sorption selectivity of CO2 over N2 [13.9 cm3 g-1 (STP)] and H2 [0.6 cm3 g-1 (STP)]. It was also observed that there is some sort of hysteresis between CO2 sorption/desorption curves, which might originate from the interactions of CO2 molecules with the host solid 7. The different adsorption capabilities for gases can be ascribed to the existence of a larger quadrupolar moment for CO2 (quadrupolar moment = 4.30 \u00d7 1026 esu cm2) than N2 (1.52 \u00d7 1026 esu cm2) and H2 (0.662 \u00d7 1026 esu cm2), thereby providing stronger framework-partial-charge/quadrupole interactions for CO2.
