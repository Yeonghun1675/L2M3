At 99%\nRH, the Nyquist plots show a semicircle in the high frequency region\nand a tail at low frequencies, representing the bulk resistance and\nblocking of protons at the electrodes, respectively, consistent with\nion migration. At reduced humidity, the resistivity of all samples\nincreases and in the frequency range investigated, the tail in the\nNyquist plot is not present. Reduction of resistivity with increasing\nrelative humidity is a well-known response observed in PEMs and MOFs\nwhen their proton conductivity is water-mediated, the proton conductivity of water-mediated materials relying on both\nwater molecules and hydrogen-bonding interactions between the water\nmolecules and the protons within the framework. It is noteworthy that the proton conductivities measured\nat 99% RH and 20 \u00b0C for the series MFM-550\u00ad(M) and MFM-555\u00ad(M)\nare very similar as expected, since the materials are isostructural\nand only small changes in the unit cell parameters are observed with\nvarying metal ions. The proton conductivity of MFM-550\u00ad(M) at 20 \u00b0C\nand 99% RH is \u223c10<sup>\u20136</sup> S cm<sup>\u20131</sup>, which is lower than many reported MOFs under similar conditions.\n</p><p>We sought to improve the proton conductivities of these materials\nwith a focus on the availability of free protons and their location\nin the structure. First, we argued that substituting Ln\u00ad(III) with\nBa\u00ad(II) ions would require the loss of positive charge to be made up\nby additional protons in the framework. The case discussed here goes\nbeyond simply doping the Ln\u00ad(III) framework with Ba\u00ad(II) defects, rather\nthe successful synthesis of the Ba-form of the framework has been\nachieved. Interestingly, an increase of proton conductivity of one\norder of magnitude was measured for MFM-550\u00ad(Ba) (\u223c10<sup>\u20135</sup> S cm<sup>\u20131</sup>) at 99% RH and 20 \u00b0C (). This demonstrates the success\nof this strategy and confirms that the proton conductivity of a MOF\ncan be increased by the use of a metal with lower oxidation state,\nwithout modifying the overall structure.</p><p>The second methodology targeted\nthe increase of the number of protons\nin a fixed cell volume. This was accomplished with the use of benzene-1,4-diphosphonic\nacid, H<sub>4</sub>L<sup>2</sup>, a shortened version of the H<sub>4</sub>L<sup>1</sup> linker. This decreases the distance between\nthe metal phosphonate chains and thus increases the concentration\nof protons in a fixed volume, 1.4 times on going from MFM-550\u00ad(M) to\nMFM-555\u00ad(M). On going from MFM-550\u00ad(M) to MFM-555\u00ad(M) at 99% RH and 20\n\u00b0C, the proton conductivity shows a remarkable increase of 2\norders of magnitude from 10<sup>\u20136</sup> S cm<sup>\u20131</sup> to 10<sup>\u20134</sup> S cm<sup>\u20131</sup> (). Despite increasing the proton\ndensity to a lesser extent than seen for MFM-550\u00ad(Ba), this method\nhas a greater impact on the increase in proton conductivity, highlighting\nthe importance of the accessibility of the mobile protons, particularly\nin nonporous MOFs. This result shows, for the first time, that increasing\nthe density of active protons in nonporous MOF structures positively\nimpacts on their proton conducting property.</p><p>The third methodology\ninvolved doping MFM-555\u00ad(Ho) with 2 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to\nincrease the concentration of surface H<sup>+</sup>. The introduction\nof proton carriers as guest molecules into\nthe cavities of porous MOFs is widely reported. However, the surface effect of such doping in nonporous MOFs is\nyet to be explored. The stability and full retention of the crystal\nstructure of MFM-555\u00ad(Ho) on treatment with H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> were verified by PXRD ().\nSignificantly, treatment of MFM-555\u00ad(Ho) with H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> results in an increase in proton conductivity of four orders of\nmagnitude (from 10<sup>\u20136</sup> S cm<sup>\u20131</sup> to\n10<sup>\u20132</sup> S cm<sup>\u20131</sup>) compared with MFM-550\u00ad(M),\nand an increase of two orders of magnitude (from 10<sup>\u20134</sup> to 10<sup>\u20132</sup> S cm<sup>\u20131</sup>) compared to\nthe MFM-555\u00ad(Ho) at 99% RH and 20 \u00b0C (a). Interestingly, the proton conductivity\nof H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>-treated MFM-555\u00ad(Ho) is comparable to\nthe best-behaving proton-conductive MOFs to date and, to the best of our knowledge, is the\nhighest performing nonporous MOF under the same conditions (). These results are accompanied by\nan additional 0.31 mmol g<sup>\u20131</sup> of acidic sites residing\non the MOF surface compared to the pristine MFM-555\u00ad(Ho) (see  for details of pH and NH<sub>3</sub>-temperature-programmed\ndesorption experiments), indicating that proton dynamics also play\na key role in the resultant conductivity. Variable temperature impedance measurements\nat 99% RH revealed that the activation energy was reduced from 0.32\nto 0.12 eV on addition of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to MFM-555\u00ad(Ho),\nsuggesting an increase in the efficiency of proton transfer across\nthe surface of acid-treated MFM-555\u00ad(Ho) (). A general linear relationship between the framework\nproton density and proton conductivity is observed for all nonporous\nMOFs and 2D coordination polymers reported to date (b), and, more interestingly,\ncompared to literature examples, a steeper slope (b) is observed for MOFs reported\nin this study, demonstrating the high efficiency of the design strategies\ndeveloped here.</p><p>To further understand the influence\nof humidity on proton dynamics\nin MFM-555\u00ad(Ho), QENS experiments were conducted between 248 and 353\nK for both dehydrated and hydrated MFM-555\u00ad(Ho). For the dehydrated\nsample, despite a loss of elastic intensity, no QENS broadening was\nobserved with increasing temperature (), suggesting that any motions, if occurring, were too slow\nto be captured within the resolution of the spectrometer. As with\nthe INS experiment, evidence was found for the presence of a tunnelling\nmode at low temperature, manifested by extra intensity on the shoulder\nof the elastic peak at \u223c0.4 meV ().

The absence of weight loss at low temperatures, characteristic of loss of solvent molecules trapped inside the pores, confirms MFM-550(M) and MFM-555(M) to be very compact frameworks, in agreement with their crystal structures. The slightly higher thermal stability (by about 50 \u00b0C) of MFM-555(M) compared with MFM-550(M) is likely due to the more compact structure of MFM-555(M) due to the use of a shorter ligand.\n\nProton Conductivity Study\n\nImpedance measurements on all complexes were recorded at 99%, 70% and 45% RH at 20 \u00b0C to investigate any correlation between the proton conductivity and the relative humidity (). At 99% RH, the Nyquist plots show a semicircle in the high frequency region and a tail at low frequencies, representing the bulk resistance and blocking of protons at the electrodes, respectively, consistent with ion migration. At reduced humidity, the resistivity of all samples increases and in the frequency range investigated, the tail in the Nyquist plot is not present. Reduction of resistivity with increasing relative humidity is a well-known response observed in PEMs and MOFs when their proton conductivity is water-mediated, the proton conductivity of water-mediated materials relying on both water molecules and hydrogen-bonding interactions between the water molecules and the protons within the framework. It is noteworthy that the proton conductivities measured at 99% RH and 20 \u00b0C for the series MFM-550(M) and MFM-555(M) are very similar as expected, since the materials are isostructural and only small changes in the unit cell parameters are observed with varying metal ions. The proton conductivity of MFM-550(M) at 20 \u00b0C and 99% RH is ~10-6 S cm-1, which is lower than many reported MOFs under similar conditions. \n\nWe sought to improve the proton conductivities of these materials with a focus on the availability of free protons and their location in the structure. First, we argued that substituting Ln(III) with Ba(II) ions would require the loss of positive charge to be made up by additional protons in the framework. The case discussed here goes beyond simply doping the Ln(III) framework with Ba(II) defects, rather the successful synthesis of the Ba-form of the framework has been achieved. Interestingly, an increase of proton conductivity of one order of magnitude was measured for MFM-550(Ba) (~10-5 S cm-1) at 99% RH and 20 \u00b0C (). This demonstrates the success of this strategy and confirms that the proton conductivity of a MOF can be increased by the use of a metal with lower oxidation state, without modifying the overall structure.\n\nThe second methodology targeted the increase of the number of protons in a fixed cell volume. This was accomplished with the use of benzene-1,4-diphosphonic acid, H4L2, a shortened version of the H4L1 linker. This decreases the distance between the metal phosphonate chains and thus increases the concentration of protons in a fixed volume, 1.4 times on going from MFM-550(M) to MFM-555(M). On going from MFM-550(M) to MFM-555(M) at 99% RH and 20 \u00b0C, the proton conductivity shows a remarkable increase of 2 orders of magnitude from 10-6 S cm-1 to 10-4 S cm-1 (). Despite increasing the proton density to a lesser extent than seen for MFM-550(Ba), this method has a greater impact on the increase in proton conductivity, highlighting the importance of the accessibility of the mobile protons, particularly in nonporous MOFs. This result shows, for the first time, that increasing the density of active protons in nonporous MOF structures positively impacts on their proton conducting property.\n\nThe third methodology involved doping MFM-555(Ho) with 2 M H2SO4 to increase the concentration of surface H+. The introduction of proton carriers as guest molecules into the cavities of porous MOFs is widely reported. However, the surface effect of such doping in nonporous MOFs is yet to be explored. The stability and full retention of the crystal structure of MFM-555(Ho) on treatment with H2SO4 were verified by PXRD (). Significantly, treatment of MFM-555(Ho) with H2SO4 results in an increase in proton conductivity of four orders of magnitude (from 10-6 S cm-1 to 10-2 S cm-1) compared with MFM-550(M), and an increase of two orders of magnitude (from 10-4 to 10-2 S cm-1) compared to the MFM-555(Ho) at 99% RH and 20 \u00b0C (a). Interestingly, the proton conductivity of H2SO4-treated MFM-555(Ho) is comparable to the best-behaving proton-conductive MOFs to date and, to the best of our knowledge, is the highest performing nonporous MOF under the same conditions (). These results are accompanied by an additional 0.31 mmol g-1 of acidic sites residing on the MOF surface compared to the pristine MFM-555(Ho) (see  for details of pH and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption experiments), indicating that proton dynamics also play a key role in the resultant conductivity. Variable temperature impedance measurements at 99% RH revealed that the activation energy was reduced from 0.32 to 0.12 eV on addition of H2SO4 to MFM-555(Ho), suggesting an increase in the efficiency of proton transfer across the surface of acid-treated MFM-555(Ho) (). A general linear relationship between the framework proton density and proton conductivity is observed for all nonporous MOFs and 2D coordination polymers reported to date (b), and, more interestingly, compared to literature examples, a steeper slope (b) is observed for MOFs reported in this study, demonstrating the high efficiency of the design strategies developed here.\n\nTo further understand the influence of humidity on proton dynamics in MFM-555(Ho), QENS experiments were conducted between 248 and 353 K for both dehydrated and hydrated MFM-555(Ho). For the dehydrated sample, despite a loss of elastic intensity, no QENS broadening was observed with increasing temperature (), suggesting that any motions, if occurring, were too slow to be captured within the resolution of the spectrometer. As with the INS experiment, evidence was found for the presence of a tunnelling mode at low temperature, manifested by extra intensity on the shoulder of the elastic peak at ~0.4 meV (). For the hydrated sample, broadening of the elastic peak was observed between 248 and 353 K (). Analysis of the half-width of the half-maximum (HWHM, \u0393) of the QENS spectra recorded as a function of Q2 was successfully fitted with the Hall-Ross diffusion model () (a). 1     \u0393  ( Q )  =   \u210f   \u03c4    ( 1 - exp  (     Q   2    \u27e8   r   2   \u27e9    6   )  )     where \u03c4 is the average residence time and (r 2) is the mean square jump length. The only exception to this model was the fit at 248 K, which showed almost no broadening. Extraction of \u03c4 and (r 2) () allowed calculation of the diffusion coefficient, D at all temperatures () (). 2     D =    \u27e8   r   2   \u27e9    6 \u03c4      The mean jump-length, r increases from 1 \u00c5 at low temperature to 3 \u00c5 at elevated temperature, suggesting that QENS is not subject to the dynamics of a single hydrogen bonded atom. Instead, at low temperature the gyration of a single O-H is observed, arising from water molecules adsorbed on the MOF surface. At elevated temperature, proton-transfer occurs between the surface P-OH and adsorbed water to form H3O+. The increased population of H3O+ with temperature leads to the increase in the observed gyration radii. The residence time, \u03c4, decreases as a function of temperature giving an activation energy of ~3 kJ mol-1 () consistent with the observation of fast local gyrations with a small energy barrier. The diffusion coefficient, D, is not constant over the temperature range measured due to its dependence on jump-length, showing a transition temperature of ~302 K (b). Thus, the results of MD are consistent with the proton migration pathway derived from the structure of MFM-555(Ho), and the neutron scattering study builds on this by considering the influence that hydration of accessible phosphonate groups on the surface of the MOF has on the overall proton dynamics.\n\nThe 2H NMR spectra of dehydrated d-MFM-555(Ho) was measured between 123 and 403 K (a), in this region the line shape is given by a very broad, Gaussian-type pattern. Even at 123 K, a Pake-powder pattern, which is typical for static deuterons, was not observed. This observation is distinct to reported studies on zeolites and anhydrous tungsten HPAs, where static patterns were commonly seen, and suggests that even at 123 K, the O-D groups in d-MFM-555(Ho) are partially mobile. A very broad Gaussian-type pattern indicates that these motions are heavily restricted and the O-D groups are localized in a disordered manner with various orientations and mobility. Moreover, the line-width of Gaussian patterns (\u0394\u03bd1/2 > 150 kHz) suggests that the motions responsible for the line shape are slow (10-4-10-5 s) and that a tunneling mechanism is responsible for the motion, entirely consistent with neutron scattering results. With increasing temperature, the effective width of the pattern decreases, indicating that the motion becomes faster and deuterons at different positions are readily exchanging between accessible sites. At 123 K, the Gaussian pattern has \u0394\u03bd1/2 ~ 210 kHz, which corresponds to a quadrupolar coupling constant Q 0 ~ 250 kHz. This is comparable with values reported for O-D groups in zeolites and HPAs (234 and 210 kHz, respectively). The temperature dependence of the Gaussian line-width \u0394\u03bd1/2 allows the estimation of the apparent transverse relaxation time T 2* ~ /(\u03c0\u0394\u03bd1/2), which enables the calculation of the activation barrier (~0.25 kJ mol-1) (). Interestingly, such a low energy barrier suggests migration of the deuterons between neighboring sites via a tunneling mechanism. For comparison, in dehydrated tungsten HPA, the surface migration of protons is characterized by an activation barrier of ~70 kJ mol-1, corresponding to the proton hopping between neighboring oxygens sites.
