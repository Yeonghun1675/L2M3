Although the final polymeric architectures are impossible to predict with our present state of  knowledge, which is due to the coordinative flexibility and diversity of the azido and diazine ligands and the complexity of the intermolecular interactions involved, we succeeded in inducing (partial) spontaneous resolution and obtained a series of chiral crystalline compounds, which contains homochiral chains or layers built of chiral bi- or trinuclear units of different molecular topology. The molecular chirality of the building units is induced by the ligation of two metal ions by the diazine ligands that are furnished by two bidentate pyridylimino groups. Thus, an isosceles triangular [Mn3(L1)2(N3)2] chiral unit with two single diazine bridges and a double EO azido bridge in 1, a double helical [Mn2(L2)2] unit with a double N-N bridge in 2, and a binuclear [Mn2(L3)(N3)2] chiral unit with triple bridges containing two EO azido ions and a N-N group in 3a and 3b are generated. The homochirality within the polymeric structures of these complexes is achieved via interunit single EE azido bridges, which tend to bridge metal ions in an asymmetric fashion and can assume variable M-N-N-N-M torsion angles. Thus, homochiral chains (1 and 2) or layers (3a and 3b) are generated from the above chiral units. For 1 and 2, where the diazine ligands contain one (L1) or two (L2) amino substituents as hydrogen donors, the chiral preservation in the whole structure is achieved via interchain hydrogen bonding between amino groups and azido ligands, and hence spontaneous resolution occurs. The generation of the crystals of 1 and 2 represents two new examples of chiral induction and transfer in the absence of chiral auxiliaries. For the chiral layers formed from L3, which contains methyl instead of amino substituents, there are no preferential interlayer interactions for chiral discrimination, and the layers can be stacked in both heterochiral and homochiral fashions, yielding simultaneously racemic (3a) and chiral (3b) crystals. Therefore, a partial spontaneous resolution occurs. In contrast with the above results, the reaction of Mn(II) and azido ions with L4, which does not contain any side substituent, yielded achiral crystals (4), which contain 2D layers with alternating single diazine, single EE azido, and double EO azido bridges. This compound is also built of chiral binuclear units due to the coordination of the diazine ligand, but the chirality is destroyed by the centrosymmetric double EO azido bridges between neighboring units. The formation of the double bridges may be related to the absence of the interligand steric effects that would be introduced by the methyl or amino substituents.

In\nthe expression, we have included the \u03c1 parameter, which is the\namount of the paramagnetic impurities (presumably a monomeric Mn(II) complex), to account for the increase of \u03c7<sub>M</sub> below\n6 K.

Therefore, although it\nis difficult, with limited data, to assign the two exchange\nparameters to specific bridges, we can safely conclude that both\nthe double diazine and single EE azido bridges mediate\nantiferromagnetic interactions. This is in agreement with what\nwe have inferred for the same kinds of bridges in <bold>1</bold>, although\nthe structural parameters (e.g., the Mn\u2212N\u2212N\u2212Mn and Mn\u2212N<sub>3</sub>\n<sub>-</sub>Mn torsion angles) of the bridges are quite different in these\ntwo compounds.\n</p><p>\n<bold>Complexes 3a and 3b.</bold> These two compounds have been\ncharacterized by various temperature- and field-dependent\nmagnetic measurements.

In the low-temperature region, both behave\nas weak ferromagnets, whose spontaneous magnetization arises\nfrom spin canting within the antiferromagnetic layers (canted\nantiferromagnetism), consistent with the chiral layer structure.\nHowever, the critical temperatures (8 K for <bold>3a</bold> and 12.5 K for\n<bold>3b</bold>) and other details (field-cooled (FC) and zero-field-cooled\n(ZFC) magnetization, hysteresis) of the weak ferromagnetic\ntransitions are different, which may be related to the differences\nin the intralayer structure and/or the interlayer stacking.\n</p><p>\n<bold>Complex 4.</bold> The temperature dependence of the magnetic\nsusceptibility of <bold>4</bold> in the 2\u2212300 K temperature range is shown\nin Figure . The susceptibility (\u03c7<sub>M</sub>) per Mn(II) ion first increases\nwith decreasing temperature to a round maximum around 30\nK, then decreases slightly, and finally increases below 22 K.\nThe final increase becomes very rapid below 17 K. The\nreciprocal susceptibility (\u03c7<sub>M</sub>\n<sup>-1</sup>) versus temperature plot above\n60 K obeys the Curie\u2212Weiss law, with \u03b8 = \u221242.6 K. The \u03c7<sub>M</sub>\n<italic>T</italic>\nvalue at room temperature is 3.71 emu mol<sup>-1</sup> K, lower than\nthe spin-only value expected for an isolated Mn(II) ion. As the\ntemperature is lowered, \u03c7<sub>M</sub>\n<italic>T</italic> first decreases smoothly to 0.78\nemu mol<sup>-1</sup> K at 16.5 K, then increases sharply to 1.16 emu\nmol<sup>-1</sup> K at about 10 K, and finally drops rapidly upon further\ncooling. The high-temperature magnetic behaviors indicate that\n\nthe magnetic interactions between Mn(II) ions are dominated\nby antiferromagnetic coupling. Structural data have revealed that\nthere exist five different superexchange pathways in the 2D\nbridging network of <bold>4</bold>:\u2009 the single N\u2212N bridges, two different\nsets of double EO azido bridges, and two different sets of single\nEE azido bridges. According to the magnetic analysis on <bold>1</bold> and\n<bold>2</bold> and the previous findings established for azido bridges, it\nshould be reasonable to assume that the EO azido bridges\nmediate a ferromagnetic interaction and that the diazine and\nEE azido bridges mediate antiferromagnetic interactions. For\nso complicated a topology, it is impossible to evaluate the\nsuperexchange parameters by conventional methods.\n\n</p><p>To fully characterize the weak ferromagnetism due to spin\ncanting, FC and ZFC magnetizations were measured at different\nfields (Figure , inset). All curves support the occurrence of\nspontaneous ferromagnetic ordering in compound <bold>4</bold>, and the\ndifference between the ZFC and FC curves at 200 G indicates\nthe existence of remnant magnetization. Interestingly, the\nmagnetization at the field below 1.5 kG exhibits a two-step\ndecrease as temperature is increased, indicating the existence\nof two magnetic transitions. The critical temperatures are\nestimated to be <italic>T</italic>\n<sub>C1</sub> = 10.1 K and <italic>T</italic>\n<sub>C2</sub> = 14.6 K at 200 G,\ncorresponding to the temperatures at which the slope of the FC\ncurve reaches maximum values. As the field is increased, the\nphase transitions shift slightly toward higher temperatures:\u2009 the\ncritical temperatures are 10.7 and 14.7 K at 500 G and 11.4\nand 15.0 K at 1 kG, respectively. As can be seen from Figure\n (inset), the two-step feature of the FC curves becomes less\nobvious at higher field, and at the field of as high as 1.5 kG,\nthe two transitions are hardly distinguishable. The temperature\ndependence of the ac magnetic susceptibility of <bold>4</bold> is also\nmeasured at zero dc field (see Figure S4 in Supporting\nInformation). Both \u03c7\u2018 and \u03c7\u2018\u2009\u2018 exhibit a strong and sharp peak at\n14.4 K and a weak and broad peak around 10.4 K, confirming\nthe occurrence of the two magnetic transitions suggested by dc\nmagnetic measurements.\n</p><p>The field-dependent magnetization of <bold>4</bold> was measured at 1.8\nK (Figure ). The magnetization increases very rapidly before\nthe field reaches 1 kG, above which the magnetization increases\nslowly and linearly with the increasing field. The magnetization\nat the highest field measured (70 kG) is 0.72 N\u03b2, far below the\nsaturation value (5 N\u03b2) expected for Mn(II) species. These\nbehaviors are consistent with weak ferromagnetism due to spin\ncanting, or the so-called \u201ccanted antiferromagnetism\u201d.

Complex 1. The magnetic susceptibility of complex 1 was measured in the 1.8-300 K range at 1000 G (Figure ; \u03c7M is the magnetic susceptibility per Mn3 unit). The temperature dependence of reciprocal susceptibility (\u03c7M -1) above 50 K follows the Curie-Weiss law, with a negative Weiss  constant \u03b8 = -31.7 K, indicating an overall antiferromagnetic interaction between Mn(II) ions. The \u03c7M T value at 300 K is 11.1 emu K mol-1, lower than the spin-only value (13.1 emu K mol-1) expected for three magnetically isolated high-spin Mn(II) ions. As the temperature is lowered, the \u03c7M T product first decreases smoothly to a rounded minimum (7.35 emu K mol-1) at 32 K, then increases rapidly to a very high and sharp maximum (24.9 emu K mol-1) at 2.9 K, and finally decreases rapidly on further cooling. The behavior above 2.9 K is characteristic of a ferrimagnetic chain, and that below 2.9 K may be due to interchain antiferrimagnetic interactions and/or the saturation effect.  \n\nTo get a closer characterization in the low-temperature region, field-cooled magnetization was measured under different fields (Figure , inset). At the low field of 400 G, the M-T curve displays a maximum at ca. 2.9 K, clearly indicating the occurrence of 3D antiferromagnetic ordering of the ferrimagnetic chains below the critical temperature. The magnetization maximum shifts toward low temperature as the applied field is increased to 1000 G. However, the magnetization at or above 1100 G shows no maximum and tends to saturate at lower temperature, indicating that the interchain antiferromagnetic interactions are overcome by the external field. These behaviors are characteristic of a metamagnet built of ferrimagnetic chains. The temperature dependence of the ac magnetic susceptibility is also measured at zero dc field and confirms the occurrence of the magnetic ordering with T N = 2.9 K, at which both \u03c7\u2018 (the in-phase component) and \u03c7\u2018\u2018 (the out-of-phase component) reach maximum values (see Figure S3 in Supporting Information). \n\nThe metamagnetic behavior is confirmed by the field dependence of magnetization (Figure ). The sigmoidal shape of the M - H curve at 1.8 K clearly indicates the field-induced transition from an antiferromagnetic to a ferromagnetic state, which is characteristic of a metamagnet. The critical field is 1100 G, estimated as the field at which a maximum \u2202M/\u2202H value is reached. Upon increasing the field above the critical field, the magnetization increases and saturates rapidly. The saturation magnetization is 5.09 N\u03b2, confirming the S = 5/2 ground state for a trinuclear unit. As expected, the sigmoidal feature of the magnetization curve disappears at 3 and 5 K, which are above the critical temperature for 3D antiferromagnetic ordering. Further measurements revealed that 1 is a soft magnet with no detectable magnetic hysteresis.  \n\n Complex 2. The temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility of 2 as a conglomerate in the 2-300 K temperature range is shown in Figure . The \u03c7M -1 versus T plot above 50 K follows the Curie-Weiss law, with a negative Weiss constant \u03b8 = -52.6 K, indicating an overall antiferromagnetic interaction between Mn(II) ions. The experimental \u03c7M T value per Mn(II) ion at room temperature is ca. 4.0 emu mol-1 K, slightly lower than the spin-only value (4.38 emu K mol-1) expected for an isolated high-spin Mn(II) ion. As the temperature is lowered, the \u03c7M T product exhibits a monotonic decrease but \u03c7M varies in a complex way: it first increases smoothly to a rounded maximum at about 20 K, then decreases slightly to a minimum at 6 K, and finally increases again upon further cooling to 2 K. The behavior before the minimum is reached is typical of Mn(II) chain complexes with overall antiferromagnetic intrachain interactions. The final increase at very low temperature may be due to the presence of a small amount of paramagnetic impurities. The magnetization versus field curve measured at 1.8 K supports the antiferromagnetic nature of the complex at low temperature (Figure , inset). The nonlinearity of the curve in the low-field region (<5 kG) is consistent with the presence of a small amount of paramagnetic impurities. Further temperature- and field-dependent measurements did not reveal any evidence of long-range magnetic ordering.  \n\nAccording to the structural data, the compound should exhibiting alternating interactions mediated by the double diazine and the single EE azido bridges. To evaluate the interactions (J 1 and J 2), we used the theoretical model based on the Hamiltonian  H  = -J 1\u2211 S  2  i   S  2  i+  1 - J 2\u2211 S  2  i  +1  S  2  i+  2. According to Cort\u00e9s et al., the molar susceptibility of an alternating S = 5/2 chain, in which the local spin is larger enough to be treated as a classical spin, can be expressed as    where u  i  = coth[J  i  S(S + 1)/kT] - kT/[J  i  S(S + 1)] (i = 1, 2). In the expression, we have included the \u03c1 parameter, which is the amount of the paramagnetic impurities (presumably a monomeric Mn(II) complex), to account for the increase of \u03c7M below 6 K. The least-squares fit of the experimental data to the above expression is quite satisfactory, leading to g = 2.00, J 1 = -5.7 cm-1, J 2 = -2.5 cm-1, \u03c1 = 0.006, and R = 4.2 \u00d7 10-5, where R is the agreement factor defined as \u2211[(\u03c7M)obs - (\u03c7M)calc]2/\u2211[(\u03c7M)obs]2. We have tried in vain to fit the data by setting opposite signs for J 1 and J 2, which could not simulate the variation in the low-temperature region. Therefore, although it is difficult, with limited data, to assign the two exchange parameters to specific bridges, we can safely conclude that both the double diazine and single EE azido bridges mediate antiferromagnetic interactions. This is in agreement with what we have inferred for the same kinds of bridges in 1, although the structural parameters (e.g., the Mn-N-N-Mn and Mn-N3 -Mn torsion angles) of the bridges are quite different in these two compounds. \n\n Complexes 3a and 3b. These two compounds have been characterized by various temperature- and field-dependent magnetic measurements. The results have been presented and discussed elsewhere, and we do not repeat them here. Only some important conclusions are summarized. The complexes exhibit overall antiferromagnetic intralayer interactions with similar high-temperature behaviors, reflecting the similarity in 2D layer structure. In the low-temperature region, both behave as weak ferromagnets, whose spontaneous magnetization arises from spin canting within the antiferromagnetic layers (canted antiferromagnetism), consistent with the chiral layer structure. However, the critical temperatures (8 K for 3a and 12.5 K for 3b) and other details (field-cooled (FC) and zero-field-cooled (ZFC) magnetization, hysteresis) of the weak ferromagnetic transitions are different, which may be related to the differences in the intralayer structure and/or the interlayer stacking. \n\n Complex 4. The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of 4 in the 2-300 K temperature range is shown in Figure . The susceptibility (\u03c7M) per Mn(II) ion first increases with decreasing temperature to a round maximum around 30 K, then decreases slightly, and finally increases below 22 K. The final increase becomes very rapid below 17 K. The reciprocal susceptibility (\u03c7M -1) versus temperature plot above 60 K obeys the Curie-Weiss law, with \u03b8 = -42.6 K. The \u03c7M T value at room temperature is 3.71 emu mol-1 K, lower than the spin-only value expected for an isolated Mn(II) ion. As the temperature is lowered, \u03c7M T first decreases smoothly to 0.78 emu mol-1 K at 16.5 K, then increases sharply to 1.16 emu mol-1 K at about 10 K, and finally drops rapidly upon further cooling. The high-temperature magnetic behaviors indicate that  the magnetic interactions between Mn(II) ions are dominated by antiferromagnetic coupling. Structural data have revealed that there exist five different superexchange pathways in the 2D bridging network of 4: the single N-N bridges, two different sets of double EO azido bridges, and two different sets of single EE azido bridges. According to the magnetic analysis on 1 and 2 and the previous findings established for azido bridges, it should be reasonable to assume that the EO azido bridges mediate a ferromagnetic interaction and that the diazine and EE azido bridges mediate antiferromagnetic interactions. For so complicated a topology, it is impossible to evaluate the superexchange parameters by conventional methods.  \n\nTo fully characterize the weak ferromagnetism due to spin canting, FC and ZFC magnetizations were measured at different fields (Figure , inset). All curves support the occurrence of spontaneous ferromagnetic ordering in compound 4, and the difference between the ZFC and FC curves at 200 G indicates the existence of remnant magnetization. Interestingly, the magnetization at the field below 1.5 kG exhibits a two-step decrease as temperature is increased, indicating the existence of two magnetic transitions. The critical temperatures are estimated to be T C1 = 10.1 K and T C2 = 14.6 K at 200 G, corresponding to the temperatures at which the slope of the FC curve reaches maximum values. As the field is increased, the phase transitions shift slightly toward higher temperatures: the critical temperatures are 10.7 and 14.7 K at 500 G and 11.4 and 15.0 K at 1 kG, respectively. As can be seen from Figure  (inset), the two-step feature of the FC curves becomes less obvious at higher field, and at the field of as high as 1.5 kG, the two transitions are hardly distinguishable. The temperature dependence of the ac magnetic susceptibility of 4 is also measured at zero dc field (see Figure S4 in Supporting Information). Both \u03c7\u2018 and \u03c7\u2018\u2018 exhibit a strong and sharp peak at 14.4 K and a weak and broad peak around 10.4 K, confirming the occurrence of the two magnetic transitions suggested by dc magnetic measurements. \n\nThe field-dependent magnetization of 4 was measured at 1.8 K (Figure ). The magnetization increases very rapidly before the field reaches 1 kG, above which the magnetization increases slowly and linearly with the increasing field. The magnetization at the highest field measured (70 kG) is 0.72 N\u03b2, far below the saturation value (5 N\u03b2) expected for Mn(II) species. These behaviors are consistent with weak ferromagnetism due to spin canting, or the so-called \"canted antiferromagnetism\". Furthermore, a well-defined hysteresis loop was observed at 1.8 K with a remnant magnetization (M r) of 0.030 N\u03b2 and a coercive field (H c) of 360 G (Figure , inset a). The magnetic hysteresis was also observed at 13.6 K, which is between T C1 and T C2, but the remnant magnetization (0.0053 N\u03b2) and the coercive field (22 G) are much smaller (Figure , inset b).
