The \u03c7m T value at 300 K is 31.97 cm3 mol-1 K, which is much smaller than the expected value of 87.5 cm3 K mol-1 (20 isolated FeIII ions with g = 2 and S = 5/2) and reveals the strong antiferromagnetic interactions in the Fe20 unit that is bridged by 14 \u03bc3-O2- groups. This result is similar to many reported \u03bc3-O2--bridged FeIII complexes. Upon cooling, the \u03c7m T value decreases monotonically to 12.52 cm3 K mol-1 at 6 K and then sharply to 11.57 cm3 mol-1 K at 2 K, which further confirms the antiferromagnetic coupling within the Fe20 core. The large value at 2 K implies a nonzero ground state for 1. At 2 K, the field-dependent reduced magnetization per 20 FeIII ions of 1 tends to a saturation value of 10.0 N\u03b2 at 5 T (Figure S9 in the ), which reveals an S = 5 ground state for 1 that resulted from either spin frustration or some ferromagnetic interactions, in spite of some dominant antiferromagnetic couplings between FeIII ions. Compared to S = 0 for Fe64, Fe28, and Fe22  and an uncertain low-spin ground state for Fe168, complex 1 is a rare example with a nonzero-spin ground state for FeIII clusters with nuclearity larger than 20, in spite of S = 33/2 for SMMs Fe19. Alternating-current (ac) magnetic susceptibility was collected at different frequencies. \u03c7'm T is almost 14 cm3 mol-1 K in the range of 15-2 K, indicating a low population of excited states in this temperature range. Extrapolation of the data from above 15 to 0 K gives about 13.5 cm3 K mol-1, confirming an S = 5 ground state for 1. However, the lack of a positive signal in out-of-phase ac magnetic susceptibility precludes 1 from an SMM.\n\nIn conclusion, a 2D coordination polymer based on unprecedented Fe20 clusters has been successfully synthesized through the two-step in situ ligand reaction, which displays a ground state of S = 5.\n\nCrystallographic details (CIF), experimental section, supplementary structural figures, and additional characterizations.
