To ensure that the Ir sites in the framework are accessible and to achieve catalyst loadings below 1 mol % Ir, only 10% of the bipyridine sites were metalated in the samples employed for catalysis. The Ir-metalated framework, 1\u22c5(Ir(COD)BF4)0.6, proved to be a highly active catalyst for the C-H borylation of benzene to form 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-2-phenyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (PhBpin) in good yield at a very low catalyst loading (Tables  and ). Comparison of the powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the material before and after catalysis reveals no loss in crystallinity, suggesting that the material is stable under the conditions used for catalysis. Following conversion of benzene to PhBpin by 1H NMR spectroscopy, the average turnover frequency of the catalyst was determined to be 860 mol PhBpin mol Ir-1 h-1 at 80 \u00b0C ( Figure S45), which is within an order of magnitude of that reported for the best molecular systems.

Interestingly, the CuII centers do not have acetonitrile bound, despite the presence of additional acetonitrile in the pores. The Cu-N distances of 1.993(4) and 2.007(4) \u00c5 and Cu-Cl distances of 2.2101(15) and 2.2126(16) \u00c5 in the complex were found to be very close to reported bond distances for the analogous molecular complex, Cu(tbbpy)Cl2 (tbbpy = 4,4'-bis(tert-butyl)-2,2'-bipyridine). The CuII centers exhibit a distorted square planar geometry, with the Cl-Cu-Cl plane tilted 33\u00b0 away from the N-Cu-N plane, which is likely a result of steric repulsion between the Cl- ligands and neighboring bipyridine H atoms.

These indicate substantial irreversible binding of CO with uptake of roughly two CO molecules per Ir center by 0.001 bar CO. This presumably occurs through the substitution of CO for COD on the Ir center to form 1\u22c5(Ir(CO)2BF4)4.7.

To ensure that the Ir sites in the framework are accessible and to achieve catalyst loadings below 1 mol % Ir, only 10% of the bipyridine sites were metalated in the samples employed for catalysis. The Ir-metalated framework, 1\u22c5(Ir(COD)BF4)0.6, proved to be a highly active catalyst for the C-H borylation of benzene to form 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-2-phenyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (PhBpin) in good yield at a very low catalyst loading (Tables  and ). Comparison of the powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the material before and after catalysis reveals no loss in crystallinity, suggesting that the material is stable under the conditions used for catalysis. Following conversion of benzene to PhBpin by 1H NMR spectroscopy, the average turnover frequency of the catalyst was determined to be 860 mol PhBpin mol Ir-1 h-1 at 80 \u00b0C ( Figure S45), which is within an order of magnitude of that reported for the best molecular systems. Note that supporting ligands that are stronger electron donors are better at stabilizing the proposed IrV intermediate that forms upon C-H activation of the arene, which is often the rate-determining step of the reaction.
