See the  for the TG-MS plots of 1, 3, and 4, respectively). The thermal behavior of 2 can be summarized as follows: formation of an intermediate Gd(HCOO)3 phase in the 250-320 \u00b0C temperature range [weight loss = 23.8% (calculated); 23.6% (experimental)] after both formamidine and formic acid loss {analogously to what was observed for [(Fmd)Mg(HCOO)3]\u221e}, which in turn releases CO and H2O leading to the corresponding Gd2O3 oxide above 600 \u00b0C [total weight loss = 52.7% (calculated); 52.4% (experimental)].\n\nLuminescence Properties\n\nOwing to their low molar extinction coefficients, Ln(III) ions are normally matched with \u03c0-conjugated multidentate organic chromophores (antennae) within LOFs, to enhance the harvested light to be transferred to the emitting metal levels. In the present case, since the small formate linker cannot generate any antenna effect, a direct excitation (365 nm) of the Ln(III) ion absorption bands was necessary. On the other hand, in these polymeric formates the photoluminescence efficiency was found to be remarkably high, because of the lack of intermediate processes (photoinduced energy transfer). Figure  shows the emission spectra of 1, 3, and 4 in the solid state (as powders). The line-like bands, typical of trivalent lanthanide ions, originate from internal f-f transitions (shielded by both 5s and 5p subshells). The Dy(III) ion emission bands at 490 and 574 nm are related to the 4F9/2 \u21926H15/2 and 4F9/2 \u21926H13/2 transitions, while Eu(III) and Tb(III) multiple lines arise from 5D1, 5D0 \u21927Fj, and 5D4\u21927Fj ones, respectively. The corresponding strong emission intensities, especially for the Tb-containing compound (3, \u03a6em = 0.83), are clearly visible to the naked eye. The related lifetime decays span from the micro- (4) to the millisecond (1,3) time scale (see Table).\n\nMagnetic Properties\n\nThe temperature dependence of the \u03c7M T product of the paramagnetic samples 2, 3, and 4 is reported in Figure . Given that exchange interactions are expected to be weak and play a role only at very low temperatures, the magnetic properties of 1 (which is characterized by a non magnetic 7F0 state) have not been investigated. The room temperature value of \u03c7M T of 2, 7.24 emu K mol-1, is  close to that expected for an isolated S = 7/2 with g = 2, 7.875 emu K mol-1, taking also into account  the hygroscopic nature of the compound and that no  treatment has been performed before the  measurements. On decreasing the temperature below 30 K, a monotonic decrease is observed, suggesting the presence of antiferromagnetic interactions. Given the 3D nature of the network the data have been analyzed using the Curie-Weiss law by plotting \u03c7-1 versus T (). A linear fit of the data provided the Curie constant, 7.25 emu K mol and \u03b8 = -0.54 K. Thus, the magnetic interaction mediated by the formate ligand is weak but sizable and antiferromagnetic in nature, comparable to that found in a diphosphonate based 3D network. \n\nThe magnetic behavior of 3 and 4 is more complex. The room temperature value of 3, 11.9 emu K mol-1, is in reasonable agreement with that expected for the J = 6 with g J = 3/2, which characterize the 7F6 state of Tb(III), 11.82 emu K mol-1. Similarly, the room temperature value, 13.2 emu K mol-1, is in good agreement with that expected for the J = 15/2 with g J = 4/3 of the 6H15/2 state of Dy(III), 14.17 emu K mol-1. In both cases, a decrease of \u03c7M T occurs at a higher temperature than that of 2, but this phenomenon can be ascribed to the gradual depopulation of the highest level of the 7F6, and 6H15/2 multiplets of 3 and 4, respectively, because of crystal effects rather than magnetic exchange. The overall splitting is in fact several hundreds of K, as confirmed by the width and complex structure of the 5D4\u21927F6 and 4F9/2 \u2192 6H15/2 bands around 480 nm of the luminescence spectrum of 3 and 4 (see Figure ). An estimation of the exchange interaction is therefore not possible in this case. This interpretation is further confirmed by the analysis of the magnetization versus field curves recorded for 3 and 4 at different temperatures in the range 2-10 K (see ). These curves do not rescale on a single curve when plotted versus the reduced H/T variable and do not show saturation at low temperature due to the strong magnetic anisotropy.\n\nTo investigate the dynamic behavior of the magnetization of these extended structures, the susceptibility in an ac field of 2, 3, and 4 has been measured in zero static field (), but no frequency dependence or a significant imaginary component of the susceptibility has been observed, suggesting that the zero field relaxation is faster than the employed frequencies also at the lowest investigated temperature (2 K). The application of a static field has often been employed to suppress a fast relaxation mechanism. The frequency dependence of the ac susceptibility has thus been measured by varying the static field. A significant difference is observed among the three compounds. In fact, 2 exhibits at 10 K a significant frequency dependent imaginary component, which is not the case of 3 at any temperature down to 2 K, while a weak imaginary component is observed for 4 at the lowest temperature. The temperature dependence of the imaginary component (\u03c7'') of 2 measured in a static field of 2 kOe is reported in Figure . The related graph for the real compoment \u03c7' is shown in . The data analysis using the Debye model has allowed to extract the temperature dependence of the relaxation, shown as an Arrhenius plot in the inset of Figure . A thermally activated regime is observed above 5 K, and the highest investigated temperatures provide for the Arrhenius law \u03c4 = \u03c40 exp(\u0394/k B T) the following parameters: \u03c40 = 4.2(3) \u00d7 10-6 s, \u0394 = 25(1) K (red line in the inset of Figure ). The relaxation time seems, however, to level off at lower temperatures, but below 5 K the \u03c7'' versus \u03bd curves become too distorted to extract a relaxation time, and a decreasing fraction of the magnetization is involved in the monitored relaxation process. In these extended structures, the slower magnetic relaxation (although in applied static fields) is observed for the most isotropic lanthanide ion, Gd(III). This trend is opposite to that observed in discrete molecules showing magnetic bistability, also known as Single Molecule Magnets, while is rather common in traditional paramagnets. Indeed, a similar slow relaxation in static field was previously observed in another extended network of Gd(III) ions linked by fumarate ligands. In that case, the analysis of the temperature dependence of the relaxation time was performed assuming a \u03c4 = aT  n  dependence. The slow relaxation was not attributed to an anisotropy barrier, but to the phonon-bottleneck effect originated by the trapping of resonant phonons that are unable to release the energy of the spin bath to the thermal one. A similar analysis performed on 2 provides a better agreement with the experimental data (see blue line in the inset of Figure ) and a best fit value n = -2.0(1). An exponent equal to -2 is theoretically expected for this phonon-bottleneck phenomenon. The observation of this phenomenon in two different Gd-MOF structures suggests that the coordinative 3D network can play a role in trapping resonant phonons.\n\nConclusions\n\nFour novel polymeric lanthanide formates of general formula [(Fmd)LnIII(HCOO)4]\u221e have been prepared through solvothermal methods. The isomorphous species show an amine-templated 3D polymeric lattice, whose luminescence and magnetic properties have been assessed. The compounds containing Dy(III), Eu(III), and Tb(III) showed remarkable emission intensity (\u03a6em up to 0.83) and long lifetime decays in the micro- (Dy) and millisecond (Tb, Eu) time scale. Their photoluminescence features were not affected by changing the environment (i.e., by growing crystals of the material on an ITO-coated support). The magnetic investigation revealed the unambiguous presence of weak antiferromagnetic interaction between Gd(III) ions. While the Tb(III) and Dy(III) analogues, despite their significant orbital contributions, do not show the slow relaxation that characterize Single Molecule or Single Chain Magnets, a temperature dependent mechanism of relaxation is observed for the Gd(III) derivative in static applied fields. Weakly coupled Gd(III) systems are particularly interesting for their large magnetocaloric effect exploitable in refrigerators based on the adiabatic demagnetization process. Examples of extended systems exploited for this purpose are scarce. To be usable as refrigerants, the magnetization dynamics of these materials must be fast compared to the field ramp. This appears to be the case for 2, whose relaxation time is in the milliseconds range. While the characterization of the magnetocaloric properties of these compounds is in progress, controlled change of their physical properties through a judicious spacer modification are currently under study in our laboratories with the aim of creating new materials for practical applications in the fields of sensing and magnetism.", "data": [[{"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "1", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "", "unit": "", "type": "", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "2", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "250 to 320", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "formation of intermediate Gd(HCOO)3 phase", "condition": ""}, {"value": "600", "unit": "\u00b0C", "type": "release of CO and H2O leading to Gd2O3 oxide", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "3", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "", "unit": "", "type": "", "condition": ""}]}, {"meta": {"name": "", "symbol": "4", "chemical formula": ""}, "decomposition temperature": [{"value": "", "unit": "", "type": "", "condition": ""}]}]], "include_properties": ["decomposition_temperature"]}, {"idx": 16, "type": "table", "classification": ["Bond & Angle"], "content": "<table-wrap id=\"tbl1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\">\n<label>1</label>\n<caption>\n<title>Hydrogen Bonds for <bold>4</bold> [\u00c5\nand deg]<xref rid=\"tbl1-fn1\"></xref>\n</title>\n</caption>\n<oasis:table colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\">\n<oasis:tgroup align=\"left\" cols=\"5\">\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col1\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col2\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col3\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col4\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:colspec colname=\"col5\"></oasis:colspec>\n<oasis:thead>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">D\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">d</italic>(D\u2013H)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">d</italic>(H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\n<italic toggle=\"yes\">d</italic>(D\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry align=\"center\">\u2220(DHA)</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:thead>\n<oasis:tbody>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>N(1)\u2013H(5A)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O(1)#7</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.86</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.24</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>3.038(7)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>155.0</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>N(1)\u2013H(5B)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O(4)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.86</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.20</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>3.000(7)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>155.0</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n<oasis:row>\n<oasis:entry>N(1)\u2013H(5B)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O(2)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>0.86</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>2.47</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>3.092(8)</oasis:entry>\n<oasis:entry>130.1</oasis:entry>\n</oasis:row>\n</oasis:tbody>\n</oasis:tgroup>\n</oasis:table>\n<table-wrap-foot>\n<fn id=\"tbl1-fn1\">\n<label>a</label>\n<p>Symmetry transformations used\nto generate equivalent atoms: #1 \u2013<italic toggle=\"yes\">x</italic>+1,<italic toggle=\"yes\">y</italic>,\u2013<italic toggle=\"yes\">z</italic>+1/2; #2 <italic toggle=\"yes\">x</italic>,\u2013<italic toggle=\"yes\">y</italic>+2,\u2013<italic toggle=\"yes\">z</italic>+1; #3 \u2013<italic toggle=\"yes\">x</italic>\u20131/2,\u2013<italic toggle=\"yes\">y</italic>+3/2,<italic toggle=\"yes\">z</italic>\u20131/2;\n#4 \u2013<italic toggle=\"yes\">x</italic>\u20131,<italic toggle=\"yes\">y</italic>,\u2013<italic toggle=\"yes\">z</italic>+3/2; #5 \u2013<italic toggle=\"yes\">x</italic>\u20131/2,\u2013<italic toggle=\"yes\">y</italic>+3/2,<italic toggle=\"yes\">z</italic>+1/2; #6 \u2013<italic toggle=\"yes\">x</italic>,<italic toggle=\"yes\">y</italic>,\u2013<italic toggle=\"yes\">z</italic>+1/2; #7 \u2013<italic toggle=\"yes\">x</italic>,\u2013<italic toggle=\"yes\">y</italic>+2,<italic toggle=\"yes\">z</italic>+1/2.</p>\n</fn>\n</table-wrap-foot>\n</table-wrap>", "clean_text": "Table 1.
