Another important parameter in these reactions is the solvent. The reactions are carried out in nonaqueous media, although rigorously dry solvents are usually not required unless the metal ion is particularly sensitive. While these conditions can pose a problem because the common hexacyanometallate salts (alkali-metal-based) are insoluble in organic solvents, the introduction of organic cations allows for the use of a range of solvents. Finally, the fact that the cluster is neutral undoubtedly facilitates crystallization of the compounds from a polar medium. Indeed, with the exception of the Co3Fe2, Fe3Cr2, Fe3Fe2, and Fe3Co2 analogues, which exhibit reasonable solubility in methanol, methanol/acetonitrile (1:1 v/v), or propylene carbonate, the TBP molecules are essentially insoluble in all common solvents.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 13, "type": "text", "classification": ["else"], "content": "<p>The aforementioned synthesis has proven to be an efficient method for introducing numerous metal ions into the TBP core.

A similar situation is observed for the Fe3Fe2 complex that exhibits \u03bd(C\ue5fcN) at 2131 and 2109 cm-1 assigned to the bridging and terminal cyanides, respectively. The Fe3Cr2 cluster, on the other hand, exhibits one stretch at 2117 cm-1, which is similar to the \u03bd(C\ue5fcN) = 2114 cm-1 of the free [CrIII(CN)6]3- anion and is assigned to the terminal cyanides, and a second absorption band that is shifted to lower frequency (2103 cm-1). The latter is attributed to the FeII-C\ue5fcN-CrIII bridging arrangement, which is in accordance with more efficient d-\u03c0 back-bonding when the CN- ligand is carbon-bound to the FeII ion. The IR data, in combination with the results of Mo\u0308ssbauer, magnetic, and crystallographic studies, support the conclusion that the cyanide bridges in the Fe3Cr2 cluster have undergone complete reversal from the [CrIII(CN)6]3- reactant to the TBP product. Analogous cyanide linkage isomerism has been documented for FeII-CrIII analogues of PB, for which the higher- and lower-frequency \u03bd(C\ue5fcN) stretches were assigned to FeII-N\ue5fcC-CrIII and FeII-C\ue5fcN-CrIII bridging modes, respectively.
