Longer breakthrough times for the propylene/propane mixture relative to the ethylene/ethane mixture are likely due to uncertainties in the olefin/paraffin flow rate. Using an equimolar olefin/paraffin feed, it can be seen that the paraffin breaks through the bed first, followed by the olefin. The steep breakthrough of ethane, propane, ethylene, and propylene indicates that there is a clean separation of each species. After breakthrough of both components, when the bed is saturated with an equilibrium composition, the effluent composition returns to equimolar. A subsequent purge with He at ambient conditions regenerated the bed. Notably, residual paraffin in the bed shortly after switching to desorption was not observed, indicating that the adsorbed phase is highly enriched in olefin. This implies that during olefin separation, high purity ethylene or propylene can be produced, exceeding the purity requirement of 99.9%. Additionally, the rapid desorption of the olefin by merely purging with He indicates that the olefin is labile and regeneration of the bed can be accomplished without a temperature swing. This is significant, as flowing a purge gas or using a vacuum or pressure swing are desirable over a temperature swing process, which has longer cycle times due to the time-consuming heating and cooling steps.", "data": null, "include_properties": null}, {"idx": 32, "type": "figure", "classification": null, "content": "<fig fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"fig6\" position=\"float\">\n<label>6</label>\n<caption>\n<p>Transient breakthrough measurements of an equimolar\nmixture of\n(a) ethylene/ethane and (b) propylene/propane in Co<sub>2</sub>(<italic>m</italic>-dobdc) at 45 \u00b0C.

Among these materials, Fe2(p-dobdc) shows an ethylene/ethane selectivity of ~14 at 45 \u00b0C with an ethylene capacity of greater than 7 mmol/g, and Mn2(p-dobdc) shows a propylene/propane selectivity of ~16 with a propylene capacity of greater than 7.5 mmol/g. While these frameworks show reversible olefin adsorption with olefin capacities that are more than an order of magnitude higher than in size-selective adsorbents, improvements in selectivity are desired in order to boost olefin purity in the product stream. Such increases in selectivity would translate to olefin purities sufficient for downstream processes, such as polymerization.\n\nGas Adsorption and Olefin/Paraffin Selectivity in M2(m-dobdc) Frameworks\n\nIn rigid frameworks with well-defined gas adsorption sites, single-component gas adsorption isotherms reveal a wide range of information about the thermodynamics of gas molecules interacting within the system. Single-component ethylene, ethane, propylene, and propane isotherms were therefore measured at 25, 35, and 45 \u00b0C in M2(m-dobdc) (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) (a and b). These isotherms display steep adsorption behavior at low pressures, corresponding to strong interactions with the frameworks.
