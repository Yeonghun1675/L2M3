Indeed, a deep knowledge of the structural data is required to evaluate notably the effects of the rigid triple \u03bc1,2-trz bridges and/or the characteristics of the intermolecular contacts on the propagation of the elastic interactions.

Thus,\nin the <italic>LS</italic> state, they are shorter in the <italic>b</italic> direction (14.2708(4) \u00c5) compared to the <italic>c</italic> direction (14.5072(4) \u00c5), whereas in the <italic>HS</italic> state, we observe the opposite tendency because the interchain\ndistances along the <italic>b</italic> direction (14.4975(4) \u00c5)\nare longer than those along the <italic>c</italic> axis (14.2832(4)\n\u00c5), leading finally to very similar distances in the <italic>LS</italic> and <italic>HS</italic> states, but inverted with respect\nto <italic>b</italic> and <italic>c</italic> parameters (). These observations indicate\na significant motion of the chains with respect to each other in the <italic>bc</italic> plane that co-occurs with a slight gliding along the <italic>a</italic> direction as the chains shift increase during the <italic>LS</italic> to <italic>HS</italic> transition (<italic>ca</italic>. 0.35 \u00c5). Additionally, the <italic>LS</italic> to <italic>HS</italic> transition is accompanied by a rearrangement of the side\nchain of the triazole ligand, leading to a much better accommodation\nof the modification of the iron coordination sphere volume in <bold>1</bold> than in the parent compound [Fe\u00ad(Htrz)<sub>2</sub>(trz)]\u00ad(BF<sub>4</sub>). Indeed, while the octahedron\nvolume (Vp) increases in similar proportions for both compounds (Vp\nincrease of 32% for <bold>1</bold> and 36% for [Fe\u00ad(Htrz)<sub>2</sub>(trz)]\u00ad(BF<sub>4</sub>)), the molecular volume remains almost the\nsame for <bold>1</bold> (+0.8%) but increases appreciably for [Fe\u00ad(Htrz)<sub>2</sub>(trz)]\u00ad(BF<sub>4</sub>) (+4.7%, ). This structural rearrangement of the chains and the related accommodation\nof the molecular volume to the transition might be responsible for\nthe smaller unit cell volume change at the transition when compared\nto the parent compound [Fe\u00ad(Htrz)<sub>2</sub>(trz)]\u00ad(BF<sub>4</sub>)\n(4.5% vs 11.5%). Such capability of structural\nbreathing was not observed in [Fe\u00ad(Htrz)<sub>2</sub>(trz)]\u00ad(BF<sub>4</sub>) and may explain the (i) unusual crystal quality of compound <bold>1</bold> and (ii) its exceptional reliability and mechanical resilience\nto repeated <italic>LS</italic> to <italic>HS</italic> transition.\nThe latter has been clearly evidenced by crystal mosai\u0308city\nstudies and optical microscopy investigations performed over 20 <italic>SCO</italic> cycles. Thus, (i) the crystal mosai\u0308city was found\nto be nearly constant around 0.49(2) between the <italic>LS</italic> and <italic>HS</italic> states (), and (ii) no damage or alteration at the resolution of the optical\nmicroscopy (\u223c0.3 \u03bcm) was detected within the single crystal\n(). In addition, an elongation\nof 5.3% of the crystal upon <italic>LS</italic> to <italic>HS</italic> transition was observed in optical microscopy studies. This value\nis in excellent agreement with X-ray data that indicates an elongation\nof 5.32% of the <italic>a</italic> parameter during the <italic>LS</italic>/<italic>HS</italic> thermal transition.</p><p>In conclusion, we have prepared and characterized\na new triazole-based\n[Fe\u00ad(bntrz)<sub>3</sub>]\u00ad[Pt\u00ad(CN)<sub>4</sub>]\u00b7H<sub>2</sub>O (<bold>1</bold>) salt exhibiting an abrupt spin transition with a transition\ntemperature of <italic>ca</italic>. 242 K. The cationic [Fe\u00ad(bntrz)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> complex displays a polymeric chain, similar\nto that reported for the Fe<sup>II</sup> triazole-based systems exhibiting\nmagnetic bistability around or above room temperature. The present study clearly evidences the starring roles of the ligand\nsubstitution and counterion changes to prevail over the implicit crystallogenesis\nissue in the Fe<sup>II</sup>/trz systems, with the association of\nbntrz ligand and [Pt\u00ad(CN)<sub>4</sub>)]<sup>2\u2013</sup> anion leading\nfor the first time to robust single crystals of high quality and relatively\nconsiderable size (up to 0.45 \u00d7 0.04 \u00d7 0.04 mm) that withstand\nthe <italic>LS</italic>/<italic>HS</italic> first-order spin transition\nupon repeated <italic>SCO</italic> cycles. Distinctively from other\n1D Fe<sup>II</sup>/trz systems for which the origin of the strong\ncooperativity remains strictly indefinite because of the lack of structural\ninformation, the characteristics of complex <bold>1</bold> led us\nto single crystal X-ray data collections of high-quality, allowing\nhighly refined structural characterizations of both high and low spin\nstates, and the thermal evolution of the lattice parameters. The polymeric\nchain structure of <bold>1</bold>, crystallographically determined\nat 296 and 120 K, is built from two different Fe<sup>II</sup> centers\nfor which the average values of the Fe\u2013N distances are in agreement\nwith the complete <italic>HS</italic>/<italic>LS</italic> spin transition\nrevealed by the magnetic data. The crystal structures of the <italic>LS</italic> and <italic>HS</italic> states definitely confirm the\nperfect linearity of the chains of such polymeric triazole-based <italic>SCO</italic> compounds, even in the <italic>HS</italic> state conversely\nto what was suggested from the first investigations based on EXAFS\nand WAXS studies. The thermal variation of the\nlattice parameters shows anisotropic changes at the transition temperature,\nand proves that the most pronounced structural changes occur along\nthe 1D covalent chain. The intermolecular interchain contacts occur\nthrough hydrogen bonding via the [Pt\u00ad(CN)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2\u2013</sup> anions leading to an overall 3D arrangement. Although displaying\ncooperativity, the absence of a wide hysteresis loop in the <italic>SCO</italic> of <bold>1</bold> reveals that the strong short-range\n\u201cFe<sup>II</sup>-(Rtrz)<sub>3</sub>-Fe<sup>II</sup>\u201d\ninteractions along the chain are not sufficient to drive the existence\nof long lifetime metastable states at the origin of thermal hysteresis;\nit also confirms that the overall long-range interactions, with an\nemphasis on the direct contacts between the chains, should play a\ncrucial role to promote significant elastic strains that stabilizes\nthe spin state changes. The exceptional resilience of the present\ncrystals upon repeated switching cycles is most likely due to the\naccommodation of the molecular volume and the anisotropic expansion/contraction\nof the unit cell upon <italic>SCO</italic> transition, which allows\nthe existence of a mismatch free <italic>HS</italic>/<italic>LS</italic> interface resulting from the capability of the \u201cFe<sup>II</sup>-(Rtrz)\u201d chains to glide from each other and accommodate the\nstructural modifications despite the sharp transition. This observation\nis similar to that of the spin-crossover single crystals [{Fe\u00ad(NCSe)\n(py)<sub>2</sub>}<sub>2</sub>(m-bpypz)] (with py = pyridine and bpypz\n= 3,5-bis\u00ad(2-pyri-dyl)\u00adpyrazolate) recently reported by K.

Single crystals of [Fe(bntrz)3][Pt(CN)4].H2O (1) have been synthesized via diffusion technique in a fine glass tube (3.0 mm diameter) by layering an ethanolic solution of the bntrz ligand onto an aqueous solution containing both K2[Pt(CN)4)]\u22c5xH2O and Fe(BF4)2\u22c56H2O salts (). The magnetic susceptibility (\u03c7m) of 1 was measured over the 2-300 K temperature (T) range on a set of single crystals. The \u03c7m T versus T plot is displayed in . In the high-temperature region, the \u03c7m T value (3.45 cm3\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1) is consistent with a HS (S = 2) configuration of the hexacoordinated FeII ions. Upon cooling, the \u03c7m T remains constant down to 240 K, then sharply decreases to ca. 0.0 cm3\u22c5K\u22c5mol-1, indicating the presence of a complete sharp HS to LS first-order spin transition (T 1/2 = 242 K). However, no significant thermal hysteresis effects were detected after the warming mode, at the value of the temperature scan rate of 0.4 K\u22c5mn-1. The DSC measurements for 1, performed in the temperature range 200-260 K with a temperature scan rate of 2 K\u22c5mn-1, reveal exo- and endothermic transitions with maxima at 241.1 and 243.5 K, respectively (inset in ). Furthermore, the phase transition has been found to occur with an enthalpy and entropy changes of \u0394H = 16.87 kJ\u22c5mol-1 and \u0394S = 69.61 J\u22c5K-1\u22c5mol-1, respectively. These values are in the range of those reported in the literature for similar SCO compounds. The presence of a weak hysteresis in the calorimetry data while it was absent in magnetic measurements can be reasonably attributed to the difference of temperature scan rates.\n\nTo understand how the crystal structure is affected by the SCO transition, the temperature dependence of the lattice parameters of a single crystal of 1 was measured in the range 200-280 K. As clearly depicted in , the evolution of the unit cell parameters (a, b, c) reveals significant anisotropic changes at the transition temperature (ca. 242 K), more precisely a contraction upon heating for the c parameter paralleled with positive expansions occurring simultaneously in the ab plane. The amplitude of the anisotropic expansion is much more pronounced along the a axis, proving that the major structural change accompanying the SCO transition in the overall structure arises along the 1D chain. In comparison with the parent 1D compound [Fe(Htrz)2(trz)](BF4), the careful examination of the shortest interchain contacts in 1 reveals the absence of direct H-bonding interchain interactions whereas strong direct H-bonding interchain interactions through the N-H group of the triazole have been identified in [Fe(Htrz)2(trz)](BF4) (). However, the presence of significant indirect H-bonding, occurring via the [Pt(CN)4]2- anions, links the chains in the b and c directions, leading to an overall 3D packing ( and ). These interactions in 1 are more pronounced in the LS state than in the HS state; this observation may explain the more constrained iron geometry along the chain in the LS state. The intrachain Fe\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Fe distances in 1 are almost similar to those found in [Fe(Htrz)2(trz)](BF4), in both spin states, whereas the interchain Fe\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Fe ones are significantly longer than those observed in other parent 1D triazole-based derivatives that have been structurally characterized (see ). Moreover, the Fe\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Fe intrachain distances in 1 appear also longer in both HS and LS states than the corresponding distances observed in discrete trinuclear complexes based on triazole ligands, although this latter observation refers only to the few compounds that display \"full\" HS or LS states, i.e., involving all the iron centers. Because of the triclinic symmetry of the crystal lattice, the interchain distances do not exactly match the Fe\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Fe intermolecular distances, but are shorter because the chains are slightly shifted from each other in the a direction (). It follows that the interchain distances are different along the b and c directions. Thus, in the LS state, they are shorter in the b direction (14.2708(4) \u00c5) compared to the c direction (14.5072(4) \u00c5), whereas in the HS state, we observe the opposite tendency because the interchain distances along the b direction (14.4975(4) \u00c5) are longer than those along the c axis (14.2832(4) \u00c5), leading finally to very similar distances in the LS and HS states, but inverted with respect to b and c parameters (). These observations indicate a significant motion of the chains with respect to each other in the bc plane that co-occurs with a slight gliding along the a direction as the chains shift increase during the LS to HS transition (ca. 0.35 \u00c5). Additionally, the LS to HS transition is accompanied by a rearrangement of the side chain of the triazole ligand, leading to a much better accommodation of the modification of the iron coordination sphere volume in 1 than in the parent compound [Fe(Htrz)2(trz)](BF4). Indeed, while the octahedron volume (Vp) increases in similar proportions for both compounds (Vp increase of 32% for 1 and 36% for [Fe(Htrz)2(trz)](BF4)), the molecular volume remains almost the same for 1 (+0.8%) but increases appreciably for [Fe(Htrz)2(trz)](BF4) (+4.7%, ). This structural rearrangement of the chains and the related accommodation of the molecular volume to the transition might be responsible for the smaller unit cell volume change at the transition when compared to the parent compound [Fe(Htrz)2(trz)](BF4) (4.5% vs 11.5%). Such capability of structural breathing was not observed in [Fe(Htrz)2(trz)](BF4) and may explain the (i) unusual crystal quality of compound 1 and (ii) its exceptional reliability and mechanical resilience to repeated LS to HS transition. The latter has been clearly evidenced by crystal mosai\u0308city studies and optical microscopy investigations performed over 20 SCO cycles. Thus, (i) the crystal mosai\u0308city was found to be nearly constant around 0.49(2) between the LS and HS states (), and (ii) no damage or alteration at the resolution of the optical microscopy (~0.3 \u03bcm) was detected within the single crystal (). In addition, an elongation of 5.3% of the crystal upon LS to HS transition was observed in optical microscopy studies. This value is in excellent agreement with X-ray data that indicates an elongation of 5.32% of the a parameter during the LS/HS thermal transition.\n\nIn conclusion, we have prepared and characterized a new triazole-based [Fe(bntrz)3][Pt(CN)4]\u22c5H2O (1) salt exhibiting an abrupt spin transition with a transition temperature of ca. 242 K. The cationic [Fe(bntrz)3]2+ complex displays a polymeric chain, similar to that reported for the FeII triazole-based systems exhibiting magnetic bistability around or above room temperature.

The polymeric chain structure of 1, crystallographically determined at 296 and 120 K, is built from two different FeII centers for which the average values of the Fe-N distances are in agreement with the complete HS/LS spin transition revealed by the magnetic data.

The intermolecular interchain contacts occur through hydrogen bonding via the [Pt(CN)4]2- anions leading to an overall 3D arrangement. Although displaying cooperativity, the absence of a wide hysteresis loop in the SCO of 1 reveals that the strong short-range \"FeII-(Rtrz)3-FeII\" interactions along the chain are not sufficient to drive the existence of long lifetime metastable states at the origin of thermal hysteresis; it also confirms that the overall long-range interactions, with an emphasis on the direct contacts between the chains, should play a crucial role to promote significant elastic strains that stabilizes the spin state changes.
