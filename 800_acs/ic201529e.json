Compared to the thiolate-containing DNICs [Fe(SEt)2(NO)2]- displaying IR \u03bdNO (1674, 1715 cm-1) in THF, the aqueous IR \u03bdNO spectra of peptide-bound DNICs CnA-DNIC exhibit the diagnostic stretching frequencies 1722, 1767 cm-1 (C1A-DNIC), 1722, 1768 cm-1 (C2A-DNIC), 1720, 1767 cm-1 (C3A-DNIC), and 1721, 1766 cm-1 (C4A-DNIC), respectively (Table ). In contrast to complex [Fe(SPh)2(NO)2]- dominated by intense absorption bands 479 and 798 nm in THF, the electronic spectra of peptide-bound DNICs CnA-DNIC display different patterns and absorptions in aqueous solution: 309 sh, 413 nm (C1A-DNIC), 313 sh, 409 nm (C2A-DNIC), 315 sh, 407 nm (C3A-DNIC), and 313 sh, 407 nm (C4A-DNIC) (Figures b and S4a,b in the ). The UV-vis spectra of CnA-DNIC observed in this work are in very good accord with those published by Fontecave and co-workers using cysteamine as the thiol ligand.

All CnA-DNIC were purified by the gel-filtration chromatography (Bio-Gel P-2 Gel, Bio Rad). The CnA-DNIC were characterized by IR, UV-vis, EPR, and ESI-MS (Figure S2 in the  and Table ). The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of peptide-bound DNICs CnA-DNIC in aqueous solution are depicted in Figures a and S3 in the . Compared to the thiolate-containing DNICs [Fe(SEt)2(NO)2]- displaying IR \u03bdNO (1674, 1715 cm-1) in THF, the aqueous IR \u03bdNO spectra of peptide-bound DNICs CnA-DNIC exhibit the diagnostic stretching frequencies 1722, 1767 cm-1 (C1A-DNIC), 1722, 1768 cm-1 (C2A-DNIC), 1720, 1767 cm-1 (C3A-DNIC), and 1721, 1766 cm-1 (C4A-DNIC), respectively (Table ). In contrast to complex [Fe(SPh)2(NO)2]- dominated by intense absorption bands 479 and 798 nm in THF, the electronic spectra of peptide-bound DNICs CnA-DNIC display different patterns and absorptions in aqueous solution: 309 sh, 413 nm (C1A-DNIC), 313 sh, 409 nm (C2A-DNIC), 315 sh, 407 nm (C3A-DNIC), and 313 sh, 407 nm (C4A-DNIC) (Figures b and S4a,b in the ). The UV-vis spectra of CnA-DNIC observed in this work are in very good accord with those published by Fontecave and co-workers using cysteamine as the thiol ligand. \n\nAs shown in Scheme a,b, chelate-cysteine-containing peptide-bound RREs CnA-RRE (n = 1-4) were synthesized by reacting peptide-bound DNICs CnA-DNIC with Fe(CO)2(NO)2 in aqueous solution at ambient temperature followed by contact with O2. The transformation of peptide-bound DNICs CnA-DNIC into peptide-bound RREs CnA-RRE via the {Fe(NO)2}9{Fe(NO)2}10 reduced peptide-bound RRE rCnA-RRE was monitored by UV-vis spectra in aqueous solution; the shift of the electronic bands from 309 sh, 413 nm [C1A-DNIC (H2O); Figure b] to 310, 369, 464, 613, 952 nm (rC1A-RRE; Figures c and S4d in the ) and then a further shift to [312, 366, 448 sh nm (H2O); C1A-RRE; Figures d and S4b in the ] confirmed the conversion of C1A-DNIC to C1A-RRE via the reduced-form rC1A-RRE (Table ).

All peptide-bound RREs KCAAK-RRE and CnA-RRE were purified by gel-filtration chromatography (Bio-Gel P-2 Gel, Bio Rad) and identified by ESI-MS (Figure S10 in the ). In comparison with RRE [Fe(SEt)(NO)2]2 showing IR \u03bdNO 1749 s, 1774 s, 1809 w cm-1 in THF, aqueous IR \u03bdNO spectra of peptide-bound RREs CnA-RRE exhibit the diagnostic stretching frequencies 1763 s, 1788 s, 1821 w cm-1 (C1A-RRE), 1764 s, 1788 s, 1822 w cm-1 (C2A- RRE), 1763 s, 1788 s, 1822 w cm-1 (C3A- RRE), and 1764 s, 1788 s, 1822 w cm-1 (C4A-RRE) in H2O, respectively (Figures b and S11 in the ). It is noticed that the separation (\u0394\u03bdNO = ~45 cm-1) of \u03bdNO stretching frequencies of the peptide-bound DNICs CnA-DNIC is different from that (\u0394\u03bdNO = ~25 cm-1) of peptide-bound RREs CnA-RRE (Table ).\n\nPeptide Synthesis and Purification\n\nAll peptides were prepared on a 0.2 mmol scale by solid-phase Fmoc chemistry and standard reaction cycles on an automated PS3 peptide synthesizer (Protein Technologies Inc.). NMP was used as the major solvent in synthesis. The coupling time for each cycle was 4 h. Each peptide has an acetylated N-terminus. The use of a Rink amide resin with a MBHA linker generated an amidated C-terminus following cleavage from the resin with a 92.5% TFA/2.5% triisopropylsilane/2.5% H2O/2.5% ethanedithiol solution. All peptides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC (Jasco) with a Thermo BioBasic semipreparative C18 column. H2O/acetonitrile linear gradients with 0.1% (v/v) TFA as the counterion were used for the purification at a flow rate of 3 mL/min. The identities of all peptides were confirmed by using ESI-MS spectra: C1A observed 593, expected 593.34; C2A observed 664, expected 664.51; C3A observed 735, expected 735.20; C4A observed 806, expected 806.33. Peptide concentrations were determined by using a published assay with 4,4'-dipyridyl disulfide. \n\nPreparation of [Na-18-crown-6-ether][Fe(SPh-NO2COOH)2(NO)2] (1)\n\nComplex [Na-18-crown-6-ether]2[Fe2(\u03bc-S)2(NO)4] (0.87 g, 1 mmol) and 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (0.793 g, 2 mmol) were dissolved in CH3CN (10 mL) and stirred for 30 min under nitrogen at ambient temperature. The reaction was monitored by FTIR. The IR \u03bdNO shifting from (1667 s, 1647 s cm-1) to [1759 s, 1732 s, 1712 cm-1 (CH3CN)] was assigned to the formation of complex 1. Absorption spectrum (H2O) [\u03bbmax, nm (\u03b5, M-1 cm-1)]: 400 (19496). Anal. Calcd for C26H32FeN4NaO16S2: C, 39.06; H, 4.03; N, 7.01. Found: C, 39.21; H, 4.33; N, 6.57. The reaction solution was dried under vacuum and then redissolved in THF/diethyl ether (1:1 volume ratio). The mixture solution was filtered through Celite to remove the insoluble solid, and hexane was then added to precipitate the dark-red solid 1 (1.28 g, 85%) characterized by IR and UV-vis spectra and single-crystal X-ray diffraction.\n\nPreparation of Peptide-Bound DNICs CnA-DNIC (n = 1-4)\n\nTo the 5 mL of phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 8.5) of peptides [C1A (0.01 mmol), C2A (0.01 mmol), C3A (0.01 mmol), C4A (0.01 mmol), respectively] was added in a dropwise manner the 5 mL of phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 8.5) of complex 1 (0.008 g, 0.01 mmol). The reaction solution was stirred under N2 at ambient temperature for 1 h. The reaction was monitored by UV-vis spectra. The shift of the absorption maximum from 400 nm (complex 1) to 412 nm implicated the complete reaction of complex 1 and peptide. The resulting yellow-brown solution was further purified by gel-filtration chromatography (Bio-Gel P-2 Gel, Bio Rad). The formation of peptide-bound DNICs was confirmed by the absorption spectra of the collected yellow fraction with the presence of two absorption bands [C1A-DNIC (309 sh, 413 nm), C2A-DNIC (313 sh, 409 nm), C3A-DNIC (315 sh, 407 nm), and C4A-DNIC (313 sh, 407 nm)] and by an EPR spectrum [g = 2.032 for C1A-DNIC; g = 2.029 for C2A-DNIC; g = 2.033 for C3A-DNIC; g = 2.029 for C4A-DNIC (H2O)] at 298 K. The rhombic EPR g values are g 1 = 2.040, g 2 = 2.032, g 3 = 2.014 for C1A-DNIC, g 1 = 2.039, g 2 = 2.029, g 3 = 2.014 for C2A-DNIC, g 1 = 2.040, g 2 = 2.030, g 3 = 2.014 for C3A-DNIC, g 1 = 2.040, g 2 = 2.029, g 3 = 2.014 for C4A-DNIC at 77 K. The peptide-bound DNICs were further characterized by ESI-MS: C1A-DNIC observed 708, expected 708.3; C2A-DNIC observed 779, expected 779.2; C3A-DNIC observed 850, expected 850.1; C4A-DNIC observed 921, expected 921.3, respectively. The solution was dried under vacuum, and the light-yellow solid was precipitated. The peptide-bound DNICs CnA-DNIC were also identified by aqueous solution IR {IR \u03bdNO: C1A-DNIC [1767 s, 1722 s cm-1 (H2O)], C2A-DNIC [1768 s, 1722 s cm-1 (H2O)], C3A-DNIC [1767 s, 1720 s cm-1 (H2O)], C4A-DNIC [1766 s, 1721 s cm-1 (H2O)].\n\nPreparation of Monodenate-Cysteine-Containing Peptide-Bound RREs KCAAK-RRE and KCAAHK-RRE \n\nThe pure liquid Fe(CO)2(NO)2 (1.2 \u03bcL, 0.01 mmol) was added dropwise into the aqueous solution (5 mL) of peptide KCAAK (0.01 mmol) by a microsyringe, and then the mixture solution was stirred under N2 at ambient temperature for 1 h. The reaction was monitored by aqueous solution IR and UV-vis spectra. The appearance of IR \u03bdNO stretching frequencies 1764 s, 1788 s, and 1820 w cm-1 (H2O) and the electronic absorption bands of 312, 366, and 448 sh nm (H2O) were consistent with the formation of peptide-bound RRE KCAAK-RRE. The red mixture solution was further purified by gel-filtration chromatography (Bio-Gel P-2 Gel, Bio Rad) and then dried under vacuum to precipitate the yellow solid KCAAK-RRE. The peptide-bound RRE KCAAK-RRE was also characterized by ESI-MS: KCAAK-RRE observed 1351, expected 1350. In a similar fashion, the reaction of peptide KCAAHK and Fe(CO)2(NO)2 (1:1 molar ratio) led to the formation of peptide-bound RRE KCAAHK-RRE characterized by IR [1764 s, 1788 s, 1820 w cm-1 (H2O)], UV-vis [310, 364, 448 nm (H2O)], and ESI-MS (observed 813, expected 1624).\n\nPreparation of Chelate-Cysteine-Containing Peptide-Bound RREs CnA-RRE (n = 1-4)\n\nTo the aqueous solution (5 mL) of peptide-bound DNICs CnA-DNIC [C1A-DNIC (0.0071 g, 0.01 mmol), C2A-DNIC (0.0078 g, 0.01 mmol), C3A-DNIC (0.0085 g, 0.01 mmol), C4A-DNIC (0.0092 g, 0.01 mmol), respectively] was added in a dropwise manner the pure liquid Fe(CO)2(NO)2 (1.2 \u03bcL, 0.01 mmol) at ambient temperature. The reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for 1/2 h and monitored by UV-vis and EPR spectra. The shift of the electronic bands from (309 and 413 nm for C1A-DNIC, 313 and 409 nm for C2A-DNIC, 315 and 407 nm for C3A-DNIC, and 313 and 407 nm for C4A-DNIC) to (310, 369, 464, 613, and 952 nm for rC1A-RRE, 306, 368, 467, 646, and 957 nm for rC2A-RRE, 312, 367, 464, 639, and 939 nm for rC3A-RRE, 310, 370, 462, 637, and 950 nm for rC4A-RRE) in H2O and the EPR g values [g \u22a5 = 2.006 and g \u2225 = 1.970 for rC1A-RRE, g 1 = 2.012, g 2 = 1.999, and g 3 = 1.988 for rC2A-RRE, g 1 = 2.012, g 2 = 1.999, and g 3 = 1.989 for rC3A-RRE, and g 1 = 2.012, g 2 = 2.000, and g 3 = 1.988 for rC4A-RRE at 77 K (H2O)] implicated formation of the reduced peptide-bound RREs rCnA-RRE (n = 1-4). The reaction solution was then stirred for 1 min after O2 gas was added to the mixture solution at ambient temperature. The electronic absorptions shifting to (312, 366, 448 sh nm) for C1A-RRE, (312, 364, 448 sh nm) for C2A-RRE, (314, 366, 448 sh nm) for C3A-RRE, (312, 364, 448 sh nm) for C4A-RRE and the disappearance of the EPR signal suggested formation of the peptide-bound RREs CnA-RRE. All peptide-bound RREs CnA-RRE were purified by gel-filtration chromatography (Bio-Gel P-2 Gel, Bio Rad) and also characterized by ESI-MS: C1A-RRE observed 823, expected 822; C2A-RRE observed 894, expected 893; C3A-RRE observed 965, expected 964; C4A-RRE observed 1036, expected 1035.

The mixture solution was purified by gel-filtration chromatography (Bio-Gel P-2 Gel, Bio Rad) and further characterized by ESI-MS. In a similar fashion, the reaction of peptide-bound RREs C1A-RRE (or C2A-RRE) and peptide C1A (or C2A) in the ratio of 1:1 led to the formation of peptide-bound DNICs C1A-DNIC (or C2A-DNIC) characterized by IR and UV-vis.\n\nConversion of Peptide-Bound RREs CnA-RRE (n = 1-4)/KCAAK-RRE into Cysteine-Bound DNIC [Fe(Cys)2(NO)2]- \n\nPeptide-bound RRE KCAAK-RRE (0.0135 g, 0.01 mmol) and l-cysteine (0.0051 g, 0.04 mmol) were dissolved in 5 mL pf phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 8.5) and stirred under N2 at ambient temperature for 5 min. The reaction was monitored by aqueous solution IR, UV-vis, and EPR spectra. The aqueous solution IR \u03bdNO shifting from [1764 s, 1788 s, 1823 w cm-1 (H2O)] to [1727 s, 1772 s cm-1 (H2O)] and the shift of electronic bands to (310, 405 nm) were assigned to formation of the cysteine-bound DNIC [Fe(Cys)2(NO)2]- with a well-resolved 13-line EPR spectrum (g value 2.031). In a similar fashion, the reaction of peptide-bound RREs CnA-RRE (n = 1-4) and l-cysteine (1:2 molar ratio) led to formation of the cysteine-bound DNIC [Fe(Cys)2(NO)2]- and peptide-bound DNICs CnA-DNIC (n = 1-4) characterized by IR, UV-vis, EPR, and ESI-MS.", "data": ["This model's maximum context length is 4097 tokens.
